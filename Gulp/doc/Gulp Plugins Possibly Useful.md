1. **gulp-dependency**

   **Description**: This plugin analyzes JavaScript files and creates a dependency list. It can be used to visualize or manipulate the order of file processing based on dependencies.

   **Use case**: It's useful for creating a structured process based on which files are dependent on others, similar to a dependency graph. While it mainly supports JavaScript, it could still be useful for a hybrid JS/TS setup with proper configuration.

1. **gulp-webpack**

   **Description**: While primarily a wrapper for Webpack inside a Gulp task, Webpack itself builds a detailed dependency graph of your project. By using gulp-webpack, you can take advantage of Webpack's built-in capability to follow import and require statements across both JavaScript and TypeScript files.

   **Use case**: When you need a more robust solution that bundles your files while resolving all dependencies. Webpack tracks dependencies in a graph to optimize bundling.

1. **gulp-tsc (TypeScript Compiler for Gulp)**

   **Description**: While gulp-tsc is a TypeScript compiler plugin, it does handle module resolution by following import statements during the TypeScript compilation process. If you configure it to emit JavaScript output, it will trace dependencies as part of compiling.

   **Use case**: Not necessarily a full dependency graph analyzer, but it does help in resolving and bundling dependencies within a TypeScript project as part of the compilation process.

1. **gulp-browserify**

   **Description**: Browserify transforms your code to work in a browser environment by resolving require and import statements in your project. It traverses your code's dependency graph and bundles the files accordingly.

   **Use case**: Useful for resolving dependencies in browser-based JavaScript applications. It can trace import statements and their dependencies fully.

1. **gulp-rollup**

   **Description**: This plugin integrates Rollup into Gulp. Rollup is another module bundler that resolves dependencies, especially for ES modules, and provides optimized output. Rollup works with both JavaScript and TypeScript.

   **Use case**: Rollup can trace and resolve dependencies from import statements, and using it with Gulp allows for modular builds.
