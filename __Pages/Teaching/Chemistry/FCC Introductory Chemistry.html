<h1>Development of Atomic Theory</h1>
<p>Ancient Greeks wondered <q>What is matter made of?</q> Indirect evidence 
that it was composed of <q>atoms</q> but with invention of <i>scanning tunneling
microscopy</i>, we can <q>see</q> atoms now.
</p>
<p>Dalton in 1808 presented a theory of <b>atoms</b> based on his studies with combustion 
with carbon and oxygen. Elements were known, but the chemistry indicated that elements had 
to be composed of something smaller to explain what was observed. Atoms have same properties,
and they form the chemical compounds, combining in different proportions. Dalton had been 
aware that water was composed of hydrogen and oxygen and in certain proportions. He came up
with its formula being OH with H having mass 1 and O having mass 8. He developed a table of
atomic masses (now atomic weights). Dalton's theory of atoms had the following four principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>All matter is made of indivisible atoms.</b>  Atoms are the smallest units of matter 
and cannot be created, divided, or destroyed (this was later revised with the discovery of 
subatomic particles).</li>
<li><b>All atoms of a given element are identical.</b> Atoms of the same element have the same 
mass and properties (later revised—atoms of the same element can have different masses, 
known as isotopes).</li>
<li><b>Compounds are formed by a combination of atoms of different elements.</b> A given 
compound always contains the same kinds and ratios of atoms.</li>
<li><b>Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms.</b> Atoms are neither created nor 
destroyed in a chemical reaction—only rearranged.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Joseph Gay-Lussac in 1809 reported on his experiments with volumes of gases reacting with each
other. He reported two volumes of hydrogen react with one volume of oxygen to form two 
volumes of gaseous water, and one volume hydrogen react with one volume chlorine to form 
two volumes hydrogen chloride. In 1811 Avogadro proposed from these results at same temperature
and pressure that equal volumes of different gases contain the same number of particles
</p>
<h1>Atoms, Isotopes, Molecules, and Ions</h1>
<p>In latter 19th century, chemists and physicists had all kinds of evidence of the atom.
Now we are getting into the nature of the atom, to examine any subatomic features and what
they are. British physicist J.J. Thomson from 1898-1903 applied a high voltage to a tube 
with a partial vacuum and he observes from the cathode <q>rays</q>. This discharge shows 
repulsion by the negative pole of applied electric field and that there is a stream of 
negatively charged particles (later called <b>electrons</b>). Thomson measures these 
deflections and find a <b>charge-to-mass ratio</b> to be
</p>
<p class="math">
	\( \frac{e}{m} = -1.76 \times 10^8\:C/g \)
</p>
<p>Thomson wanted to understand structure of atom and his experiments concluded that electrons
were part of every atom. He also reasoned that since atoms are electrically neutral, if they 
have negatively charged particles (electrons), they must be include positively charged particles.
Thomsom developed the <q>plum pudding</q> model of an atom: electrons as plums within a 
diffuse cloud pudding of positive charge.
</p>
<p>
Robert Millikan constructed a device to atomize oil and the spray was emitted into a container with
two plates: a positively charged upper plate with hole allowing oil to fall through the hole. 
There was also a bottom negatively charged plate. X-rays were introduced into the stream of oil 
droplets which would cause them to be charged, affecting the gravitational fall of the droplets.
Using Thomson's value, Millikan found that the mass of an electron could be computed to be 
\( 9.11 \times 10^{-31}\;\mathrm{kg} \). The mass of hydrogen was known and is about 2000 times 
larger.
</p>
<h2>Radioactivity</h2>
<p>Another property of elements was that some where radioactive. Becquerel (1911) discovered 
uranium was emitting radiation, and the Curies found it was attributable to the atoms of 
uranium. Ernest Rutherford found three types of radiation:
<ol>
<li><b>alpha particles</b>: paths of movement changed in electric field, deflected away From
positive charges</li>
<li><b>beta particles</b>: movement also deflected by electric field, but away from negative 
end.</li>
<li><b>gamma radiation</b>: unaffected by any electric field.</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Nucleus</h2>
<p>Elements were composed of atoms, and atoms themselves had a subatomic structure. The electron 
was known and its mass was quite small. Thomoson proposes a cloud of large positive charge 
while electrons are a <q>plum in the pudding</q>. Rutherford's experiment with alpha particles 
at gold foil and observing deflections while some particles passed through indicated that atoms 
were composed of a vast space with positive dense charge in a nucleus. Rutherford discovered
protons in 1919, and Chadwick reported neutrons in 1932.
</p>
<h2>Characteristics of Elements/Atoms</h2>
<p>Elements get an ID given to them: the <b>atomic number</b> is the number of protons 
in the atom. Atoms in a unique element will always have same number of protons, but neutron
count can vary. Because atoms can differ in neutrons, these isotopes will have an element 
symbolized with the atomic number subscripted to lower left of element symbol. The <b>mass
number</b>, which the integral sum of the protons and neutrons, will be superscripted to 
the left above the atomic number. Weights of atoms themselves are measured in <b>atomic 
mass units</b> (amu) which is defined as 1/12th of the mass of the <sup>12</sup>C isotope
of carbon. \( 1 u = 1.660\:539\:066\:60 \times 10^{-27}\;\mathrm{kg} \). A proton has 
1.0073 amu, neutron 1.0087, and electron \( 5.486\times 10^{-4}\;\mathrm{amu}\)
</p>
<h2>Periodic Table</h2>
<p>Developed in 1869, it shows elements that show a pattern of characteristics. The 
1st period has two elements, the 2nd and 3rd periods have eight, the 4th and 5th have
18, and the 6th and 7th have 32. Vertical columns are groups. Nomenclature has some 
significance. The A and B labeling is a North American convention. IUPAC has set the 
numbering from 1 to 18 of the groups.
</p>
<h1>Compounds</h1>
<p>
Only the noble gas elements exist elements but also as pure single atoms unbonded to 
atoms including their own type. All other atoms exist as molecules and ions. Oxygen 
is found as a diatomic molecule and even as a triatomic molecule as <i>ozone</i>. 
Many of the important elements on the right side of the periodic table exist in diatomic
form. <b>Molecular compounds</b> designate substances composed of more than one atomic 
type. Methane is one such compound: CH<sub>4</sub> is composed of nonmetallic elements
and it should be noted that most of the molecular compounds that exist are composed 
only of non-metals.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Molecular formulas</b> are chemical formulas that contain the actual numbers of 
atoms in a molecule. The molecular formula for hydrogen peroxide is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li><b>Empirical formulas</b> are chemical formulas that reflect the relative numbers 
of atoms in a molecule. The empirical formula for hydrogen peroxide is HO. It is always 
possible to know the empirical formula if the moecular formula is known, but the 
converse is not true.</li>
<li>A <b>structural formula</b> of a molecule or compound is a molecular formula that
shows the bonding arrangement between the atoms</li>
<li>Other molecular representations include <b>Perspective drawing</b>, which convey 
information using wedges and dashed lines to show atoms out of plane in three 
dimensional arragement, <b>ball-and-stick models</b>, where atoms are represented
as spheres/balls and bonds are sticks, and <b>space-filling models</b> which show 
atoms scaled up </li>
</ul>

<h2>Percent Composition of Compounds</h2>
<p>The <b>mass percent</b> or <b>weight percent</b> of each element in a compound 
is computed using the example of ethannol: C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH:</p>
<p class="math">
\( \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{2 mol C}}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{12.01 g C}}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}}\right)
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}{\displaystyle \text{46.07 g C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}\right)
\times\text{ 100%} = \text{52.14%}\)
\( \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{6 mol H}}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}\right)
   \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1.008 g H}}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol H}}\right)
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}{\displaystyle \text{46.07 g C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}\right) 
\times\text{ 100%} = \text{13.13%}\)
\( \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol O}}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{16.00 g O}}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol O}}\right)
\left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}{\displaystyle \text{46.07 g C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}\right) 
\times\text{ 100%} = \text{34.73%}\)
</p>
<h2>Formula Determination Of Compound</h2>
<p>
When a new compound is found, the determination of its formula is of interest. A typical
start of analysis is by combustion particularly for organics, which will produce CO<sub>2</sub>,
H<sub>2</sub>O, and N<sub>2</sub>. Products are collected and weighed. It would be typical
to collect H<sub>2</sub> with Mg(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> with 
NaOH. 
</p>
<p>
Suppose an example analysis of a compound with C, H, and N. 0.1156 g is combusted and 
0.1638 g CO<sub>2</sub> is produced, and 0.1676 g H<sub>2</sub>. 
</p>
<p class="math">
\( \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{0.1638 g CO}_2}{\displaystyle \text{0.1156 g sample}}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol CO}_2}{\displaystyle \text{44.01 g CO}_2}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol CO}_2}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{12.01 g C}}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}}\right)
\times\text{ 100%} = \text{38.67%}\)
</p>
<p>Apply the same formula for the water to get the hydrogen value: 16.22% H. The balance
is nitrogen, so 100 - 38.67 - 16.22 = 45.11% N.</p>
<p>The next step is to use this to find the relative mole of each element assuming 100.00 g
compound. 
</p>
<p class="math">
\( (\text{38.67 g C}) \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}}{\displaystyle \text{12.01 g C}}\right) = \text{3.220 mol C} \)<br>
\( (\text{16.22 g H}) \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol H}}{\displaystyle \text{1.008 g H}}\right) = \text{16.09 mol H} \)<br>
\( (\text{45.11 g N}) \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol N}}{\displaystyle \text{14.01 g N}}\right) = \text{3.220 mol N} \)
<br><br>
\( \text{C:} \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{3.220}}{\displaystyle \text{3.220}}\right) = 1.000 = 1\)<br>
\( \text{H:} \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{16.09}}{\displaystyle \text{3.220}}\right) = 4.997 = 5\)<br>
\( \text{N:} \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{3.220}}{\displaystyle \text{3.220}}\right) = 1.000 = 1\)
</p>
<p>
The empirical formula, not molecular formula, is (CH<sub>5</sub>N)<sub><i>n</i></sub>, where <i>n</i>
is an integer.
</p>
<h2>Chemical Equations</h2>
<p>Reactions involve bond breaking and making to produce new arrangements of atoms, with
<i>reactant</i> molecules on one side and <i>product</i> molecules on another.
These are written as <b>equations</b> and with all equations, everything must 
<q>balance</q>. This balance at requires a <i>conservation</i> of <b>mass</b>
and <b>charge</b>. As to mass, the number of atoms of each element must be 
equal on the left and right sides.
</p>
<p>Besides the mass conservation (numbers of each element), equations also 
include the physical state of a compound/molecule: solid (<i>s</i>),
liquid (<i>l</i>), gas (<i>g</i>), and aqueous (<i>aq</i>). For example,
pouring hydrochloric acid on solid sodium bicarbonate will produce 
carbon dioxide gas, and a salt solution. 
</p>
<p class="reaxn">
  HCl (<i>aq</i>) + NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (<i>s</i>) &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) +
  H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>l</i>) + NaCl (<i>aq</i>)
</p>
<p>
The combustion of methane includes coefficients to achieve balance:
</p>
<p class="reaxn">
  CH<sub>4</sub> (<i>g</i>) + 2 O<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) +
  2 H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>g</i>)
</p>
<h2>Balancing Equations</h2>
<p>We approach the combustion of ethanol knowing carbox dioxide and water:</p>
<p class="reaxn">
  C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (<i>l</i>) + O<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) +
  H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>g</i>)
</p>
<p>Mass is not conserved on both sides of the chemical equation. The steps in balancing will start
out by focusing on the most complex of molecules, ethanol. It has two carbons, so the first step 
is to make sure two carbons are on the other side. Only one molecule has carbon in the products 
and it requires putting a coefficient of 2 as a count of the molecules.</p>
<p>There are six hydrogen atoms in ethanol, and no other hydrogen atoms. On the right side,
only water has hydrogen atoms, and to balance them for six, it is convenient to use a coefficient
of 3.</p>
<p>The final balance is for the element oxygen. First count up the side with the immediately 
apparent most O atoms, which is on the products side. With 2 CO<sub>2</sub> and 3 H<sub>2</sub>O, 
that is 2 &times; 2 + 3 &times; 1 = 7 O atoms. To achieve that balance, 3 O<sub>2</sub> molecules
would fit properly. So the final analysis is:
</p>
<p class="reaxn">
  C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (<i>l</i>) + 3 O<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) &rarr; 2 CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) +
  3 H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>g</i>)
</p>
<p>Trying another: solid ammonium dichromate (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is a 
bright orange and can be ignited. The products end up being chromium(III) oxide, nitrogen gas, and 
water vapor.</p>
<p class="reaxn">
  (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (<i>s</i>) &rarr; Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (<i>s</i>) +
  N<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) + H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>g</i>)
</p>
<p>Immediately it appears that N and Cr are balanced on both sides of the equation. Only H and O elements are not
balanced. Looking at H, there are 8 H atoms on the left side, so we check how to make 8 H atoms on the right 
side. A coefficient of 4 for water will do that, so the H atoms are balanced. Now looking at the O atoms, 
the calculation is that there are 7 O atoms on the right, and that conveniently balances out by putting 4 water 
molecules.
</p>
<p class="reaxn">
  (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (<i>s</i>) &rarr; Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (<i>s</i>) +
  N<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) + 4 H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>g</i>)
</p>
<h2>Stoichiometric Calculations: Amounts of Reactants and Products</h2>
<p>
Suppose one has 96.1 g propane and is asked how much oxygen reacts in combustion.
The balanced equation is first developed:
</p>
<p class="reaxn">
  C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> (<i>g</i>) + 5 O<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) &rarr; 3 CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) +
   4 H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>g</i>)
</p>
<p class="math">
\( (\text{96.1 g C}_3\text{H}_8) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}_3\text{H}_8}{\displaystyle \text{44.1 g C}_3\text{H}_8}\right)
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{5 mol O}_2}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol C}_3\text{H}_8}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{32.0 g O}_2}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol O}_2}\right) = \text{349 g O}_2
\)
</p>
<h2>Concept of Limiting Reactions</h2>
<p>Suppose a sandwich shop makes a popular item as follows:</p>
<p class="reaxn">
  2 slices bread + 3 slices meat + 1 slice cheese &rarr; sandwich
</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, the following ingredients are found: 8 slices bread, 9 slices meat, 5 slices 
of cheese. How many sandwiches can be made and what will be left over?</p>
<p class="math">
\( \text{Bread:    8 slices bread} \times
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 sandwich}}{\displaystyle \text{2 slices bread}}\right) = \text{4 sandwiches} \)
\( \text{Meat:    9 slices meat} \times
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 sandwich}}{\displaystyle \text{3 slices meat}}\right) = \text{3 sandwiches} \)
\( \text{Cheese:    5 slices cheese} \times
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 sandwich}}{\displaystyle \text{1 slice cheese}}\right) = \text{5 sandwiches} \)
</p>
<p>From the calculations above, the most sandwiches that can be made are 3, as
the meat is the limiting ingredient. When the 3 sandwiches are made, we will
have 2 slices of bread and 2 slices of cheese remaining.</p>
<p>The same principle applies in chemistry. Suppose we will mix 25.0 kg nitrogen and 5.00 kg 
hydrogen gases to make ammonia. The balance reaction is:
</p>
<p class="reaxn">
  N<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) + 3 H<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) &rarr; 2 NH<sub>3</sub> (<i>g</i>)
</p>
<p>
For the reaction amounts we have, calculate the moles of product made from the moles of reactant available:
</p>
<p class="math tight">
\( \text{Hydrogen:    5.00 kg H}_2
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1000 g H}_2}{\displaystyle \text{1 kg H}_2}\right)
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol H}_2}{\displaystyle \text{2.016 g H}_2}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{2 mol NH}_3}{\displaystyle \text{3 mol H}_2}\right)
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{17.0 g NH}_3}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol NH}_3}\right)
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 kg NH}_3}{\displaystyle \text{1000 g NH}_3}\right)
   = \text{28.1 kg NH}_3 \)

\( \text{Nitrogen:    25.0 kg N}_2
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1000 g N}_2}{\displaystyle \text{1 kg N}_2}\right)
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 mol N}_2}{\displaystyle \text{28.0 g N}_2}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{2 mol NH}_3}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol N}_2}\right)
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{17.0 g NH}_3}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol NH}_3}\right)
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 kg NH}_3}{\displaystyle \text{1000 g NH}_3}\right)
   = \text{30.4 kg NH}_3 \)
</p>
<p>From this calculation, we can see that H<sub>2</sub> is limiting and the most 
ammonia that can be made is 28.1 kg.</p>
<p>This calculation involved determine the total product that could be formed from 
  each of the reactants. Another way of calculating would be to determine from the moles 
  of one reactant the exact moles of the other reactant that would be required of the 
  other reactant and compare that the moles available.
</p>

<h1>Introduction to Aqueous Reactions: Precipitation, Acids and Bases, and Gas-Forming and Redox Reactions</h1>
<h2>The Solvent Water</h2>
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O has the ability to create a solution of many substances. The molecule itself has two 
hydrogen atoms coordinated around an oxygen atom with a bond angle of 105&deg;. Each O-H bond is a covalent
polar bond with the more electronegative oxygen polarizing the electrons in the bond. Dissolution of a 
salt with its ionic bonds is done when water molecules envelop each ion, cation and anions, in a 
process of <b>hydration</b>. The process is represented as follows:</p>

<p class="math">
\( \text{NH}_4\text{NO}_3 (s) \xrightarrow{\text{H}_2\text{O} (\textit{l})} 
    \text{NH}_4^+ (\textit{aq}) + \text{NO}_3^- (\textit{aq})\)

<h1>Gas Laws</h1>
<p>Properties of gases are that they are easily compressed, fill containers, and 
mix completely with other gases</p>
<h2>Pressure</h2>
<p>Gases exert pressure. Gases form the atmosphere. The <b>barometer</b> is a 
device that measures atmospheric pressure. The Toricelli barometer works by 
filling a glass tube with mercury and inverting it in a dish of mercury. When
this happens at sea level, a column of mercury 760 mm in height stays in the 
tube. Pressure varies with altitude: at 9600 feet in the mountains of 
Colorado. <b>Manometers</b> are instruments</p> that measure pressure, typically
use mercury, units are <b>mm Hg</b>, also called <b>torr</b> in honor of Toricelli.
Also 1 <b>atmosphere</b> has the standard of 760 mm Hg.  In SI units, pressure 
is force per unit area, which is N/m<sup>2</sup>. This is called the <b>pascal</b>. 
1 atmosphere is 101,325 Pa. (In imperial measures, 1 atmosphere is 
14.6959 psi)

<p>Irish chemist Robert Boyle in 1662 reported performing an experiment where he measured the volume
of gas trapped in a J-shaped tube closed at the lower end. He started with a low volume
of mercury in the tube. The volume of gas in the closed end of the tube was determined
(in cubic inches) and the pressure was assessed as the height difference between
the mercury at the closed end and at the open end, in 'in Hg'. Mercury was gradually
added to the open end of the tube and the measures taken. His data showed that the 
product of the pressure and volume was a constant: <i>PV = k</i> and this is known
as <b>Boyle's Law</b>.</p>
<p>
It is of interest that a plot of <i>P vs V</i> is a right hyperbola and that 
<i>V vs 1/P</i> is that of a straight line with positive slope <i>k</i>. 
A plot of <i>PV v P</i> should be a horizontal line at 22.41 L atm if the gas 
is ideal in the range of P from 0.0 to 1.0 atm. But all gases deviate somewhat.

<p>
In an experiment to see how ammonia behaves, 1.0 mole NH<sub>3</sub> at a temperature
of 0&deg;C, volume measurements were made at various presssures. The value of <i>k</i>
is determined to see if it is constant. The deviations are small but the pattern 
clearly shows that <i>k</i> deviates not randomly but in one direction. The explanation
for this non-ideal nature is made later.
</p>
<h2>Charles' Law</h2>
<p>French physicist Jacques Charles in 1787 found that the volume of a gas at constant
pressure increases linearly with the temperature of the gas (he had been experiment 
with hydrogen gas in balloons). A plot of V vs T in &deg;C for gases He, CH<sub>4</sub>,
H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O with different moles of gas will 
have different slopes of straight lines, but all these points converge at the value
&minus;273 &deg;C. When the plot is rescaled on the abscissa with the temperature 
scale in Kelvins, the convergence is on 0, otherwise known as <b>absolute zero</b>.
</p>
<p>Practice: A gas at 15&deg;C and 1 atm has a volume of 2.58 L. What will the volume 
(at constant pressure) be when the temperature is 38&deg;C? Because 
\( V = kT \), then \( V_1/T_1 = V_2/T_2 \). This applies for temperatures on the 
Kelvin scale only, so the solution sets the correct values for temperature:</p>
<p class="math">
\( \text{2.58 L} \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{(38 + 273) K}}{\displaystyle \text{(15 + 273) K}}\right)  = 2.79 L \)
</p>
<h2>Avogadro's Law</h2>
<p>
In 1811, Avogadro made the following observation: <b>equal volumes of gases at the 
same pressure and temperature appear to have the same number of <i>particles</i></b>. 
This became Avogadro's Law and can be expressed mathematically as
</p>
<p class="math">
\( V = an \)
</p>
<p>where <i>V</i> is gas volume, <i>n</i> is number of moles, and <i>a</i> is a 
propotionality constant.</p>
<p>Practice: a 12.2 L sample has 0.50 mole oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) at pressure 1 atm
at a temperature of 25&deg; C. If this is entirely converted to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) 
at same temperature and pressure, what is the ozone volume.</p>
<p>
First write the balanced equation to get the reaction: 
3 O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2 O<sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>A stoichiometric conversion should then be:</p>
<p class="math">
\( \text{0.50 mol O}_2  
\left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{2 mol O}_3}{\displaystyle \text{3 mol O}_2}\right)  = \text{0.33 mol O}_3
\)
<br>
\( \text{12.2 L}  
\left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{0.33 mol}}{\displaystyle \text{0.50 mol}}\right)  = \text{8.1 L}
\)
</p>
<h2>Ideal Gas Law</h2>
<p>
The analysis of Boyle's law, Charles' law, and Avogadro's law brings us to 
understand that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to temperature 
and the number of particles and inversely proportional to pressure, and that 
this proportionality includes a constant:</p>
<p class="math">\( V = R \left(\frac{\displaystyle Tn}{\displaystyle V}\right) \)</p>
<p>algrebraically rearranged:</p>
<p class="math">\( PV = nRT \)</p>
<p>This is the <b>ideal gas law</b> and is an <b><i>equation of state</i></b> for a gas. The state of a gas is 
described by its pressure, volume, temperature, and mass (in moles). Generally 
the ideal gas law works when the pressure is below 1 atm and the temperatures 
are high. The value for <i>R</i> when the pressure is measured in atmospheres and 
volume is in liters is 
<span class="math tight"><b>0.08206 L atm/(K mol)</b></span></p>
<h2>Stoichiometry of Gases</h2>
<p>
Consider 1 mole of an ideal gas at 0&deg;C at 1 atm. The volume is computed to 
be 22.42 L and is the <b>molar volume</b>. Experimentally the molar volumes of 
several gases has been determined. 
</p>
<table class="centertd">
<caption>Molar Volumes for Various Gases at 0&deg;C and 1 atm</caption>
<tr><th>Gas</th> <th>Molar Volume (L)</th></tr>
<tr><td>	Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)	  </td><td>	22.397 </td></tr>
<tr><td>	Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)	</td><td>	22.402 </td></tr>
<tr><td>	Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)	</td><td>	22.433 </td></tr>
<tr><td>	Helium (He)	              </td><td>	22.434 </td></tr>
<tr><td>	Argon (Ar)	              </td><td>	22.397 </td></tr>
<tr><td>	Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)	</td><td>	22.260 </td></tr>
<tr><td>	Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)	</td><td>	22.079 </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The temperature of 0&deg;C and pressure of 1 atm is called 
<b>standard temperature</b> and <b>pressure (STP)</b>. The law can be 
used to calculate the molecular weight of a gas from its measured density
</p>
<p class="math">
\( n = 
\frac{\displaystyle \text{grams of gas}}{\displaystyle \text{molar mass}}  = 
\frac{\displaystyle \text{mass}}{\displaystyle \text{molar mass}} = 
\frac{\displaystyle m}{\displaystyle \text{molar mass}} 
\)
</p>
<p>
Substitute <i>n</i> in the ideal gas equation, and then evaluate 
\( d = m/V \) to be gas density in grams per liter, as solve for the molar mass.
</p>
<p class="math">
\( P = \frac{\displaystyle nRT}{\displaystyle V} = 
  \frac{\displaystyle (m/\text{molar mass})RT)}{\displaystyle V} =
  \frac{\displaystyle m(RT)}{\displaystyle V(\text{molar mass})}
\)
<br>
\( P = \frac{\displaystyle dRT}{\displaystyle \text{molar mass}} \)
<br>
\( \text{molar mass} = \frac{\displaystyle dRT}{\displaystyle P} \)
</p>
<h2>Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures</h2>
<p>In 1803 Dalton noted: <i>In a mixture of gases, the total pressure 
is the sum of pressures of each gas exerted if the gas were alone.</i>
This is <b>Dalton's law of partial pressures</b> and is expressed as follows:</p>
<p class="math">
\( P_{TOTAL} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 \text{+ ...} \)
<br><br>
\( \qquad  = \frac{\displaystyle n_1RT}{\displaystyle V} + \frac{\displaystyle n_2RT}{\displaystyle V} + 
  \frac{\displaystyle n_3RT}{\displaystyle V} \text{+ ...} \)
<br><br>
\( \qquad = \displaystyle(n_1 + n_2 + n_3 \text{ + ... } ) \frac{\displaystyle RT}{V} \)
<br><br>
\( \qquad = n_{TOTAL} (\frac{\displaystyle RT}{V}) \)
</p>
<p>Practice: Mixtures of He and O<sub>2</sub> are used in scuba diving to prevent 
the bends. 46 L of He and 12 L O<sub>2</sub> at 25&deg;C and 1 atm are pumped into a 
tank with a volume of 5.0 L. Calculate the partial pressure of each gas and the total
pressure at 25&deg;C.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to get the mass of each gas that will be put into the tank:</p>
<p class="math">
\(  n  = \frac{\displaystyle PV}{\displaystyle RT} \)
<br><br>
\(  n_{He}  = \frac{\displaystyle \text{(1.0 atm)(46 L)}}{\displaystyle \text{(0.08206 L atm/K mol)(298 K)}} = \text{1.9 mol}\) 
<br><br>
\(  n_{O_2}  = \frac{\displaystyle \text{(1.0 atm)(12 L)}}{\displaystyle \text{(0.08206 L atm/K mol)(298 K)}} = \text{0.49 mol}\) 
</p>
<p>Now compute the partial pressure of gases in the tank:</p>
<p class="math">
\(  P  = \frac{\displaystyle nRT}{\displaystyle V} \)
<br><br>
\(  P_{He}  = \frac{\displaystyle \text{(1.9 mol)(0.08206 L atm/K mol)(298 K)}}{\displaystyle \text{5 L}} = \text{9.3 atm}\)
<br><br>
\(  P_{O_2}  = \frac{\displaystyle \text{(0.49 mol)(0.08206 L atm/K mol)(298 K)}}{\displaystyle \text{5 L}} = \text{2.4 atm}\) 
</p>
<p>The final step is to sum the partial pressures to get the total: 
  <span class="math"> \( 9.3 + 2.4 = \text{11.7 atm} \) </span></p>
<p>
The quantity <b>mole fraction</b>, symbolized with the Greek <b>chi</b> (\(\chi\)) is defined as the ratio of the moles of a given component in the 
mixture to total number of moles in the mixture.  This can be used also to calculate the 
partial pressure since it can be derived that the mole fraction in related to the partial 
pressure. If the O<sub>2</sub> in the tank has \( \chi = 0.49 / (1.9 + 0.49) = 0.205 \),
then the partial pressure will be \( 11.7 \times 0.205 = \text{2.4 atm} \)
</p>
<p>
A nice experiment to do is the decomposition of KClO<sub>3</sub> in a test tube
over a flame, setting up the tube to be stoppered with glass tubing that has been 
bent to be vented to an inverted bottle filled with water in a dish that is also filled 
with water. The potassium chlorate also contains a small amount of MnO<sub>2</sub> as a 
catalyst to decompose the KClO<sub>3</sub> more rapidly. Oxygen gas bubbles into 
the inverted bottle from the tube, displacing the water in the inverted bottle. 
</p>
<p class="reaxn">2 KClO<sub>3</sub> (<i>s</i>) &rarr; 2 KCl (<i>s</i>) + 3 O<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>)</p>
<p>The pressure is 754 torr at 22&deg;C for the oxygen collection. The volume of the 
gas collected is 0.650 L, and the water vapor pressure at 22&deg;C is 21 torr.
Calculate the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> collected, and the mass of KClO<sub>3</sub>
that was decomposed.</p>

<p class="math">
\(  \text{total moles gas} = n_{TOTAL}  = \frac{\displaystyle PV}{\displaystyle RT} \)
<br><br>
\(  = \text{(754 torr - 21 torr)(0.650 L)} 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1 atm}}{\displaystyle \text{760 torr}}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{K mol}}{\displaystyle \text{0.08206 L atm}}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{1}}{\displaystyle \text{(273 + 22) K}}\right) 
  \)
<br><br>
\( = 2.59 \times 10^{-2}\text{ mol O}_2 \) 
</p>
<p>The number of moles of KClO<sub>3</sub> used is:</p>
<p class="math">
\(  2.59 \times 10^{-2}\text{ mol O}_2 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{2 mol KClO}_3}{\displaystyle \text{3 mol O}_2}\right) 
  \left(\frac{\displaystyle \text{122.6 g KClO}_3}{\displaystyle \text{1 mol KClO}_3}\right) 
  =  \text{2.12 g KClO}_3   \)
</p>
<h2>Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases</h2>
<p>With experimental observations about gases, it is now time to describe a model to explain
the observations. Going back to scientific method, a law is a way of generalizing observations 
from many experiments with reproducible results. Laws permit the prediction of results in 
similar systems. Laws summarize observed results, but do not inform us why these observations 
occur. Thus theories, or built models, will provide this. Models are successful if they 
both explain and predict behavior. The <b>kinetic molecular theory</b> helps to explain how 
ideal gases work using a molecular scale. 
</p>
<p>Postulates of kinetic molecular theory are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Particles will be so small compared to distances between them that the volume of 
individual particles is considered neglible.</li>
<li>Particles are in constant motion: collisions of particles with walls of container 
  are cause of pressure exerted by gas</li>
<li>Particles should exert no forces on each other in this gas, neither attracting
  or repelling each other.</li>
<li>The average of the kinetic energy of all gas particles will be directly proportional 
to Kelvin temperature.</li>
</ol>
<p>
To produce the kinetic molecular model, consider a cube of side <i>L</i> and gas 
particle of mass <i>m</i> with velocity \( \vec{u} \) and the magnitude of 
velocity will have three dimensional components: \( u^2 = u_x^2 + u_y^2 + u_z^2 \). 
The collision frequency, or collisions per unit time, with two walls that are 
perpendicular to <i>x</i> axis is given by:</p>
<p class="math">
\( (\text{collision frequency})_s = 
   \frac{\displaystyle \text{velocity in the } x \text{ direction}}
   {\displaystyle \text{distance between the walls}} \)
<br><br>
  \( \qquad = \displaystyle \frac{u_x}{L} \)
</p>
<p>
The force definition is applied: 
<span class="math">\( F = ma 
  = m \displaystyle (\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta t}) 
  = \displaystyle \frac{\Delta (mu)}{\Delta t} \)</span></p>
<p>That last quantity notes that since the mass of a particle does not 
change, it can be shown as a change in momentum over time:
</p>
<p class="math tight">
\( \text{change in momentum} = \Delta (mu_x) 
   = \text{final momentum} - \text{initial momentum}
   = -mu_x - mu_x 
   = -2mu_x \)
</p>
<p>It can be shown that 
  <span class="math">\( \text{Force}_x = 
    (2mu_x)(\displaystyle \frac{u_x}{L}) = \frac{2mu_x^2}{L} \)</span></p>
<p>
The total forces in all three dimensions ca be shown to be
<span class="math">\( \text{Force}_{\text{TOTAL}} = \displaystyle 
  \frac{2mu_x^2}{L} + \frac{2mu_y^2}{L} + \frac{2mu_z^2}{L} = 
  \frac{2m}{L} (u_x^2 + u_y^2 + u_z^2) = \frac{2m}{L}(u^2) \)</span>
</p>
<p>The result shows the velocity is the sum of dimensional components.
The pressure caused by the <q>average</q> particle can be show to be:
</p>
<p class="math">
\( \displaystyle \frac{\overline{\text{force}_{\text{TOTAL}}}}{\text{area}_{\text{TOTAL}}} 
  = \frac{\displaystyle \frac{2m\overline{u^2}}{L}}{6L^2} = \frac{m\overline{u^2}}{3L^3} \) </p>
<p>The volume of the gas <i>V</i> is the cube volume, <i>L</i><sup>3</sup>, and the number of 
gas particles is <i>nN</i><sub>A</sub> where <i>n</i> is the number of moles and 
<i>N</i><sub>A</sub> is Avogadro's number.</p>
<p class="math">
\( \displaystyle P = nN_\text{A}\frac{m\overline{u^2}}{3V} \)
</p>
<p>
Considering that <span class="math tight">\( m\overline{u^2} = 
  2(\frac{1}{2})m\overline{u^2}\)</span>, a new expression for pressure using average 
  kinetic energy is: 
</p>
<p class="math">
\( \displaystyle P = (\frac{2}{3})\frac{nN_\text{A}(\frac{1}{2}m\overline{u^2})}{V} \)
<br><br>
\( \displaystyle \frac{PV}{n} = (\frac{2}{3})N_\text{A}(\frac{1}{2}m\overline{u^2}) \)
</p>
<p>
Taking the last postulate, it can be shown that the average kinetic energy of a 
mole of gas particles is:</p>
<p class="math">
\( (\text{KE})_{\text{avg}} = N_A(\frac{1}{2}m\overline{u^2}) \)
<br><br>
\( \text{so } \displaystyle \frac{PV}{n} = RT = \frac{2}{3}(\text{KE})_{\text{avg}} \)
<br><br>
\( \displaystyle (\text{KE})_{\text{avg}} = \frac{3}{2}RT \)</p>
<p>
The quantity <span class="math tight">\( \overline{u^2} \)</span> represents the average
of the square of velocities. The square root of that value is the <b>root mean square 
velocity</b> (<span class="math tight">\( u_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\overline{u^2}} \)</span>)
</p>
<p>
From the above for <span class="math tight">\( \displaystyle (\text{KE})_{\text{avg}} \)</span>:
</p>
<p class="math">
\( \displaystyle N_A(\frac{1}{2}m\overline{u^2}) = \frac{3}{2}RT \)
