<p>
The goal of tutoring is to help you, the student, with succeeding in courses you are
taking at an educational institution. It is not to offer the course work itself apart
from the objectives of the school or college instruction you are getting. Find out more
on how tutoring preparation is done.
</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>
Will the interaction between myself and those tutored be face-to-face or strictly online?
Will there be just one who is tutored or will there be a group?
</p>
<h3>In-Person or Online</h3>
<p>
Online tutoring is occurring more and more these days, and there are many advantages.
<ul>
<li><b>Right at Home.</b> You don't have to leave home if you don't want to.</li>
<li><b>Security.</b> Because you don't have to leave home and invite someone you consider
	a relative stranger into your home, there's no worry or need for <q>background checks</q>,
	if this is important to you
</li>
<li><b>Lower Cost</b>. There is no cost for travel at all, both its time and resources
like fuel and vehicle wear-and-tear</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some students are not comfortable with online interaction however, and feel they
get a better interaction through a face-to-face session. Decide what is best for you.
</p>

<h4>Requirements for Online Tutoring</h4>
<p>
	At the <a href="#setup">end of this page</a>, recommendations the resources and setup for the student
	for online tutoring are shown.
</p>

<h3>One-on-One or Group</h3>
<p>
Your best result would be a completely one-on-one session with your tutor. But if there are
a group of you studying the same course/subject/content, I can teach a group of up to 6
learners. I will not teach more or else I would probably just open up a school, and so
teaching larger numbers is impractical unless you really want a school.
<p>
Because the time and attention are divided among more persons in the group, There
is a discount on the per hour rate for each student. I could not divide the rate by
the number of each student because that can affect the incentive to learn in a more
one-on-one interaction. See the table below on group rate calculation.
</p>

<h3>First Session</h3>
<p>
I prefer the first session be only 30-45 minutes long. I expect the first session actually
to be a "get acquainted" session and to get organized. I will not charge a fee for any
session that is not related to actual tutoring/learning, but which are just administrative
things like this.

<h2>Subjects Tutored &amp; Pricing</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
</p>
<p>
Because the interaction can vary as explained above (one-on-one vs group, in-person vs online,
me traveling vs client traveling), the per-hour final rate will vary with adding to or
subtracting from a base rate. The base rate has three tiers: middle school level, high school level,
and college/university level (primary school students should really be tutored by
experienced credentialed teachers).
</p>
<p>
While I will try to follow a reasonable formula for determining the final per-hour rate as indicated
in the table below, there might be other factors that mean I have to determine a customized
per-hour rate for a particular client or group.
</p>
In subsequent sessions a per-hour base rate
The fees depend on the level of the subject.  See the table below for the fees.  This is either at my home
or place of business.  If you require/prefer that I travel to a location, an additional I charge an
additional 36 cents/mile from either my work or home location, whichever is closest to your location.

<b>Per-Session Fee</b>. This only applies to my traveling to meet the student, and it is because of the cost
of my time and use of resources (fuel, vehicle) for that travel. This is not a per-hour cost, but
a fixed cost related to each session, no matter how long the session. This fee will be determined during
the initial organization of the tutoring contract.

<p>
I have competencies beyond the list above, but please email to inquire about your particular
subject(s) of study and I will inform you as to whether I am competent to provide instructional
assistance to you or the tutored student.
</p>
<p>
For groups of students up to a maximum of 6 students (I don't want to open a school at this
time), the table below shows the rate adjustment by percentage that I would use to
reduce the per hour rate for each student:</p>

To maintain tutoring quality, group sizes shall not be greater than six (6) students.

<h2>Payment for Service</h2>
<p>
For new customers, payment is due after a session is completed. Once payment is complete, the next session
can be scheduled and session preparation started. The method of payment may vary depending on whether
payment is made in person (cash, check) or digitally by a system (Zelle, Venmo, PayPal). Customers will
receive a detailed receipt which I recommend they retain for the customary period; clients should consult
with their financial advisors about whether payment for tutoring services have additional benefits,
such as those related with taxes.
</p>
<h2>Preparation for Tutoring</h2>
<p>
I prefer online instruction using the latest interaction technologies, but am open
In order to keep your costs down, I will ask the student what specific subject he/she is studying in order
to prepare mini-lectures (often as a PowerPoint presentation) should they be necessary, and which can be
given to the student as a study aid.

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>
Your tutor has a Ph.D. in Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology but I have been working
primarily in Information Technology, using Microsoft technologies particularly app Development
with SharePoint. I have limited non-credentialed <q>substitute</q> middle school teacher
experience teaching science to middle school students.

	<li>Internet Connection
		<ul>
			<li>Bandwidth: Your download service should have a minimum 5 Mbps, but

			<li>Your latency (ping) should be less than 100 ms, but dont
				worry if you cant determine it</li>
			<li>If a wireless connection to computer to home LAN is used,
