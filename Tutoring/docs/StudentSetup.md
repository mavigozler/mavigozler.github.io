# Student Setup for Online Tutoring

For online tutoring that involves an interactive whiteboard, the student's computing device and internet connection play a critical role in ensuring a smooth and productive experience. Here's a breakdown of the ideal setup:

---

## **1. Computing Device Recommendations**

### **Monitor**

- **Size**:
  - A monitor of at least **15.6 inches** is ideal for laptops.
  - For desktops, a **21–24 inch** monitor is recommended to comfortably view the whiteboard, notes, and other content side by side.

- **Resolution**:
  - A minimum resolution of **1920x1080 pixels (Full HD)** is essential for clear text and diagrams.
  - Higher resolutions, such as **2560x1440 (Quad HD)**, are even better if the student is working on tasks involving detailed visuals.

### **Device Type**

- **Laptop or Desktop**:
  - A laptop or desktop is preferred for its larger screen and processing power.
  - Ensure the device has a **dual-core processor (minimum)** and **4GB of RAM (8GB or more preferred)** to handle video calls and whiteboard interactions simultaneously.

- **Touchscreen Option**:
  - If the student will actively draw or write on the whiteboard, a device with a touchscreen and stylus support (e.g., **Microsoft Surface**, **iPad with Pencil**, or similar) is highly beneficial.

- **Webcam and Microphone**:
  - A **720p or better webcam** and a noise-canceling microphone or headset are essential for communication.

## **2. Internet Connection Requirements**

For a seamless tutoring session with video, audio, and interactive tools like whiteboards, ensure the following:

### **Bandwidth**

- **Download Speed**:
  - Minimum: **5 Mbps**.
  - Recommended: **10–20 Mbps** to accommodate HD video calls and whiteboard data.

- **Upload Speed**:
  - Minimum: **3 Mbps**.
  - Recommended: **5–10 Mbps** for clear video and real-time interaction.

### **Latency**

- Latency (ping) should ideally be **under 100 ms**. Higher latency can cause noticeable delays in whiteboard interactions and voice communication.

### **Connection Stability**

- A **wired Ethernet connection** is preferable for its stability.
- If using Wi-Fi, ensure a strong and consistent signal (e.g., the student should be within 10-15 feet of the router).

### **Data Cap**

- Online tutoring with video and whiteboard tools can consume **1-2 GB per hour**. Ensure the student's internet plan has sufficient data allowance to avoid interruptions.

## **3. Peripheral Equipment**

- **Stylus/Tablets**:
  - A **Wacom tablet** or similar input device can help students write and draw effectively if they don’t have a touchscreen device.

- **External Monitor**:
  - For students using small laptops, connecting an **external monitor** can greatly improve usability.

- **Headphones**:
  - A good pair of **noise-canceling headphones** reduces distractions and improves focus.

---

## **4. Software Considerations**

- Ensure the device can run interactive tools like:
  - **Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet** for video calls.
  - **Jamboard, Miro, or Ziteboard** for whiteboard sessions.
- The browser should support WebRTC for real-time collaboration (e.g., **Chrome** or **Edge**).
