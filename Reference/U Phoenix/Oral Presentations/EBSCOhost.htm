<H1 class=delivery-title>EVALUATING AND ASSESSING STUDENT ORAL PRESENTATIONS: A 
LIMITED BUT EFFECTIVE ROLE FOR EMPLOYERS IN THE GEOGRAPHY CURRICULUM </H1>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>ABSTRACT </STRONG>Employers were involved in 
assessing students' presentations, giving feedback and in the development of 
staff skills for providing feedback. The curriculum context to the oral 
presentations is described and the problems and benefits of employer involvement 
are considered. It is argued that it is possible to develop an effective 
small-scale approach to employer involvement as an alternative to major schemes.

class=medium-bold>Employer Involvement--more problems than benefits? </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>This paper argues that it is possible to develop a 
limited but very effective small-scale approach to employer involvement, which 
occupies the middle ground between large-scale initiatives and non-involvement. 
Our approach has been to identify a particular area of our geography curriculum, 
skills teaching and evaluation, where one employer could make a significant 
impact in the short term in a manner that would neither distort our academic 
aims for the curriculum nor make major demands on the resources of academic 
staff or employers. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Many individuals working in higher education may be very 
wary of involving employers in curriculum development. Clearly, as other papers 
in this collection show, there are immense potential benefits to students in 
terms of skill and career prospect enhancement. However, these have to be offset 
against significant potential management and academic problems. A large-scale 
initiative such as a sandwich course will undoubtedly put pressure on resources, 
both in the development and operational phases, as time and effort are needed to 
ensure employer involvement is maintained. Academically, problems may occur in 
terms of balancing the impact of employers' requirements on the curriculum and 
the more important need, for these authors at least, to adjust course content to 
reflect developments within the discipline. Employers' needs and disciplinary 
advances are not of course incompatible, but equally there may well be some 
significant differences in terms of how they relate to the curriculum. Our 
approach to employer involvement has allowed us to develop an initiative in 
which employers have played an effective role but in which our other strategic 
academic aims have not been compromised. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Employer involvement in geography at Birkbeck College is 
focused on assessing and providing feedback on student oral presentations. As 
part of a second-year geography project students present their findings in a 
15-minute oral presentation. The training and guidance students require prior to 
the oral presentation is provided by the departmental staff, with no employer 
involvement. Employers only play a role at the final stage by assisting with 
evaluation and the crucial process of providing useful feedback. The input of 
employers produces tangible benefits for students and staff, but it also raises 
a number of important dilemmas for teachers. </P><A 
name=AN9510173312-4></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>The Context: the geography 
curriculum, skills teaching and the Enterprise Initiative at Birkbeck College 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Birkbeck College is a long-established London University 
institution that specialists in the teaching of mature, part-time undergraduate 
and postgraduate students in the evening; 87% of the college's students are 
mature part-timers, most of whom pay their own fees. Typically, undergraduate 
students complete a degree in four years of evening study. Despite this we would 
argue that the initiative outlined below is transferable to other institutions 
with more traditional student profiles. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>In the geography department curriculum development is a 
continual process but, in 1987-88, a major review was instigated as a response 
to changes in the discipline, and in order to improve learning amongst mature, 
part-time undergraduate students. Employer involvement had not been an initial 
aim of the curriculum review but was stimulated by the involvement of the 
geography department two years later in the Enterprise Initiative. At the same 
time the curriculum review meant that the department was in the process of 
establishing an assessed summer project undertaken between the first and second 
year of undergraduate studies, which in part aimed to develop certain student 
skills that were classed as 'enterprise' skills. The funding and employer 
contacts from the Enterprise Initiative allowed the geography department to 
extend the summer project to include a key role for employers that had not 
initially been planned, whilst also achieving one of the main aims of the 
Enterprise Initiative, which is the embedding of 'enterprise' skills teaching in 
assessed courses. The role employers played in the summer project was quite 
limited but very clearly focused on the evaluation and feedback process. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The compulsory summer project started in 1989-90 and was 
designed to relate to first-year human geography lecture courses. The academic 
objectives of the summer project are to enable students to examine the processes 
that determine economic and social change in a particular locality and to study 
local political geography in the form of interest group and local alliance 
construction. The skill-based objective is to allow students to develop the 
following skills: </P>

<P class=body-paragraph>Some 20-30 students per year work in pairs and are given 
a detailed pack of information on a major redevelopment site in London which 
they have chosen from a list of 20 (students may also select a site of their own 
choosing). At the end of the summer term, training is given in preparing and 
delivering oral presentations. The summer is spent obtaining further information 
on the sites and collecting material for use as visual aids. At the start of the 
second year students give an assessed, 15-minute oral presentation in which they 
have to argue a case for or against the development of the site with the other 
student in the pair arguing the opposite case. Assessed oral presentations are 
becoming more commonplace in geography curricula (Jenkins &amp; Pepper, 1988; 
Sharp, 1989; Daniel, 1991; Healey, 1991; Hay, 1994) and there are a number of 
different methods for involving students in the marking process. In the case of 
the summer project the additional involvement of employers in assessing student 
presentations provided some useful insights into the role employers can play, 
not just in curriculum development but also in improving the feedback and 
evaluation process. </P><A name=AN9510173312-5></A><SPAN 
class=medium-bold>Employer Involvement in Assessment and Feedback for Oral 
Presentations </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>There has been considerable discussion of the value of 
oral presentations within the geography curriculum and approaches for teaching 
oral skills (Jenkins &amp; Pepper, 1988; Keene, 1988; Sharp, 1989; Walker, 1993; 
Hay, 1994). Particular skills and techniques are needed to teach and assess oral 
presentation skills and the approach described below, except for the feedback 
process, has many similarities to the methods outlined in earlier papers in this 
journal (Sharp, 1989; Daniel, 1991; Healey, 1991; Hay, 1994). Many of the 
previous discussions of oral presentations in geography and other disciplines 
deal with feedback mainly as part of the assessment process; feedback commonly 
involves discussion with markers and fellow students after a presentation, 
written comments and a mark (Coiling, 1988; Sharp, 1989; Daniel, 1991; Healey, 
1991; Hay, 1994). Indeed, students' concern over the assessment used for oral 
presentations means that much effort is put into developing negotiated 
assessment methods that include a key role for students themselves (Jenkins 
&amp; Pepper, 1988; Daniel, 1991; Healey, 1991; Hay, 1994). The approach we 
adopted to oral presentations has also involved negotiating the criteria for 
assessment with students, but this negotiation process indicated a strong desire 
from amongst mature students for a high level of interactive feedback rather 
than just assessment. Our students were not only interested in their general 
performance (i.e. a mark) but, for a substantial majority, specific advice on 
technique was as important. This feedback would allow them to make relatively 
simple changes to their oral presentation style and would lead to improvements 
in the future. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>After three years of employer involvement an approach 
developed that makes clear to students that feedback and assessment are two 
separate but interrelated parts of the approach used for evaluating oral skills. 
Students are then able to separate out feedback and guidance on technique 
improvements from a broader overall assessment of their presentation based on 
agreed criteria. There is some justification for this separation of assessment 
and feedback in the literature on public speaking, which indicates that many of 
the difficulties speakers encounter and the mistakes they make are easily 
corrected by basic guidance of a technical nature from experienced oral 
presenters (Leeds, 1988). </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The problem facing academic staff in 1989 was that the 
staff development undertaken for teaching oral skills had dealt with feedback in 
a limited manner as part of assessment and staff were unsure of their skills for 
providing good quality student-centred feedback. Simultaneously, the Birkbeck 
College Enterprise Initiative Unit had established links with employers and were 
looking for projects where employers could play a useful role. A contact was 
provided with the education officer of a major retail company who arranged 
meetings between lecturers and the company staff who were responsible for 
training shop-floor staff in oral presentations. These individuals had 
considerable experience and training in developing assessment methods for oral 
presentations and providing supportive feedback. Furthermore, their experience 
of training staff meant they were used to dealing with groups of very varied 
maturity and ability. Staff at Birkbeck felt that direct employer involvement in 
the assessment and feedback process for student presentations had considerable 
potential benefits and, after discussion with the education officer at the 
retail company, five objectives were identified for the employer involvement: 
</P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Employees from the retail company would analyse 
  the assessment process for oral presentations and provide advice to staff. 
  </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Employees from the retail company would provide 
  students with high-quality feedback. </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Employees from the retail company would employ a 
  variety of methods for providing feedback. </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Staff at Birkbeck would aim to improve their 
  skills in providing feedback by observing different methods being used. 
</SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Staff at Birkbeck would aim to improve their 
  skills in providing feedback by experimenting with the use of different 
  methods and receiving advice and comments from the employees of the retail 
  company. </SPAN></LI></UL>
<P class=body-paragraph>These five objectives identified a very precise role for 
employer involvement in the summer project that it was hoped would be beneficial 
to staff and students. The retail company agreed that three employees would 
attend each student presentation for a period of three years, to provide 
feedback to students, and to advise Birkbeck staff on the assessment process and 
feedback methods. The education officer for the retail company also indicated 
that she was pleased for her employees to have a clear pro-active role that was 
designed to assist not only students but academic staff as well. She felt that 
their involvement with curriculum development in a number of universities had 
become rather predictable usually involving either very generalised advisory 
roles or major involvement in sandwich courses and student placements. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>As part of the summer project each student has to attend 
three class sessions and it is only in the last of these three that employers 
were directly involved. At the first session the project aims and content are 
outlined and the assessment process is discussed. The second session provides 
detailed written and spoken guidance on preparing an oral presentation, and at 
the third session students present their 15-minute talk and each student 
receives 20-30 minutes of feedback. One of the aims of the first session is to 
establish a negotiated assessment schedule and whilst the employees from the 
retail company did not attend these sessions they did provide advice on 
improving this process. A number of techniques for devising negotiated 
assessment criteria were experimented with in the first three years of the 
project, including large seminars and students working in small groups. After 
discussions with the employees from the retail company and an analysis of 
student evaluation questionnaires an approach has been developed that is now 
used regularly. In the first session, students are shown a video of a past 
presentation, asked to work in small groups to identify evaluation criteria, and 
then discussion amongst the whole class is used to obtain a consensus on 
assessment criteria. The employees from the retail company provided very useful 
advice on the techniques for structuring this session whilst allowing students 
considerable control of the discussion process. Consequently, the assessment 
process varies slightly from year to year but has always included criteria to 
evaluate content, delivery, clarity, use of visual aids and response to 
questions. A student's performance on each of these criteria is outlined on the 
written report they receive shortly after their presentation. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>In discussing the assessment process in the first 
session the students are also made aware of the form that feedback will take in 
the third session after they complete their presentation. The feedback process 
was also developed over the three-year period that the employers were involved 
and different methods were tested by staff at Birkbeck. The three employees from 
the retail company attended all of the student presentations over the three-year 
period and used a variety of feedback techniques in order to provide good 
feedback to students, but also to illustrate the range of possible methods to 
staff. In the first two years the retail employees would each adopt a different 
approach to each student: one would concentrate on using a positive, individual, 
student-centred approach that always started by allowing the individual to 
outline their reactions to the presentation they had just completed; the second 
would utilise a critical assessor-centred approach where students are given 
direct advice, some of which may be quite critical; and the third would use a 
peer-group-based approach which encouraged other students to provide feedback. 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph>After the presentation, students completed an evaluation 
questionnaire and a self-assessment form. The former provided valuable reactions 
to the different feedback methods which suggested that over 80% of students 
strongly favoured the individual student-centred feedback and were least 
interested in peer-group evaluation. In the third year of the summer projects 
operation Birkbeck staff provided the majority of the feedback after each 
presentation and the employees from the retail firm provided advice on how staff 
might improve their technique. The summer project is now in its fifth year of 
operation and the approach currently used for feedback endeavours to ensure that 
70% of time in the feedback session is based on an individual student-centred 
approach whilst the rest is used for assessor-led or peer-group feedback. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The self-assessment forms are used by students to 
identify the ways they might improve future oral presentations based on the 
feedback they receive. The structure of the self-assessment forms is quite 
simple and they were devised with advice from the retail employees. Following 
their advice, these forms are kept by Birkbeck staff and then presented to 
students before any human geography seminar they undertake in future years, to 
encourage them to implement improvements. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Overall, the input of employers to the summer project 
led to the following changes and improvements: </P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>useful changes to the negotiation process used 
  for agreeing assessment criteria with students; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>feedback and evaluation is much more individual, 
  student-centred and supportive; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>structures exist to encourage limited but useful 
  student feedback to each other; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>student self-assessment mechanisms have been 
  changed; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>student self-assessment is now a long-term 
  process that is returned to in future years. </SPAN></LI></UL>
<P class=body-paragraph>The presence of the staff from the retail company was 
always well received since over two-thirds of students felt this added authority 
to the process. This positive reaction to employers was initially surprising for 
the lecturing staff who were concerned that they might be viewed as intimidating 
by students. Furthermore, a number of students clearly seemed to value the 
opinions of employers above those of the academic staff! </P><A

and problems </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>The employer involvement in the summer project was quite 
a small-scale initiative. Only one major retail firm was involved which also 
reduced the time required to develop the employer link. Twenty to thirty 
students were involved each year and the summer project is part of a course unit 
that amounts to about 8% of a student's total degree mark. Nevertheless, by 
setting limited aims for employer involvement it was at least possible to feel 
they had largely been achieved. In addition, the role identified for employers 
would be transferable to other institutions. It may be that the aim of Birkbeck 
staff to pay special attention to assessment and feedback reflects the 
particular concerns of mature students, but quality evaluation and feedback will 
be valuable in any environment where oral presentation skills are taught, and 
the experience at Birkbeck indicates that employers have a contribution to make 
to this process. The involvement of employers produced the following general 
benefits to staff and students: </P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>more sensitive and student-centred assessment 
  and feedback; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>improved student awareness of their skills and 
  limitations in oral presentation and the use of visual aids; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>improved staff skills for assessing and 
  providing feedback on oral presentations; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>a greater sense of student ownership over the 
  summer project; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>improvements in student seminars in years three 
  and four. </SPAN></LI></UL>
<P class=body-paragraph>The last of these benefits has been particularly 
valuable as students have to give seminar papers in other course units and they 
have all indicated that their oral presentation training has provided them with 
valuable skills for use in seminars. Fellow students also benefit since seminar 
papers have become better presented and easier to follow. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The benefits to the retail employer were less easy to 
identify. Generally, it was part of their public commitment to the Enterprise 
Initiative, and the staff who attended the oral presentations claimed it was 
useful for them to be assessing people who were not company staff. The education 
officer of the retail company indicated that the limited benefit to the employer 
was one reason why their willingness to commit staff did not continue after the 
three-year period initially agreed. In the case of this initiative this was not 
a problem since it was designed to be sustainable once the employer was no 
longer involved. More generally, it seems reasonable to surmise that where 
employer benefits are small or hard to identify they are more likely to be 
persuaded to become involved in an initiative where their role is clearly 
identified and not too demanding in terms of resources. One other problem of 
fixed-term employer involvement is that, if it is a success, at least one group 
of students will feel that they missed out on a beneficial process. The students 
participating in the summer project in the fourth and fifth year of its 
operation had heard about the benefits of employer involvement from students in 
the years above them and indicated that they would have liked the same 
treatment. Other problems and worries relating to employer involvement in this 
initiative include: </P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>the large amount of academic staff time needed 
  to set up and maintain employer links (i.e. the standard moan about the lack 
  of promotion-related credit for this sort of work); </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>the difficulty of identifying a clear benefit to 
  employers that could be justified in terms of their time commitment; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>staff turnover in the retail company meant that 
  some of the employees involved changed from year to year and time had to be 
  spent briefing the new employees; </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>a concern that students became more interested 
  in feedback on skills rather than the content of their presentation. 
  </SPAN></LI></UL>
<P class=body-paragraph>At a more general level, the experience of developing 
links with employers inevitably led academic staff involved to consider broader 
educational issues concerned with employer involvement. The Enterprise 
Initiative was encouraging us to develop employer links quickly, leaving little 
time to consider the educational value of exploring other approaches to 
improving feedback and assessment that did not involve employers. Just because 
an initiative involves employers does not necessarily mean it is educationally 
the best approach. In our case we felt that the employer involvement was 
justified since the literature we managed to examine in the brief time available 
provided plenty of guidance on assessment for student oral presentations, but 
far less on providing feedback. Employer involvement in the geography curriculum 
may seem initially attractive but there are drawbacks that need to be carefully 
assessed by any department before jumping on board this particular bandwagon.
