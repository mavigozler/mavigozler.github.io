            <DIV id=Panel1><SPAN id=_ctl13_lblwhy>Since University of Phoenix 
            was founded nearly a quarter-century ago, learning teams have been 
            an essential element of its Teaching/Learning Model. The 
            University’s Founder, Dr. John Sperling, recognized the value of 
            teams in both academia and the workplace long before these benefits 
            became widely known and accepted. Dr. Sperling believed—and 
            subsequent research has confirmed—that learning teams fill several 
            essential functions that are especially beneficial to working adult 
            learners. Learning teams can:

              <UL style="FONT-SIZE: x-small">
                <LI>Create collaborative learning environments in which working 
                adults can share the practical knowledge that comes from their 
                life and work experience.<BR><BR>

                <BR><BR>
                <LI>Serve as vehicles for the kind of shared reflection through

                knowledge.<BR><BR>
                <LI>Provide a sense of community and support that is invaluable 
                in helping working adults cope with the challenge of balancing 
                school with other life 
            demands.<BR></LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE></SPAN><SPAN id=_ctl13_lblwhy2>
            <H2>“Team” Competence at Work</H2>There is another equally important 
            function that should be served by learning team participation. More 
            than ever, organizations require their employees to work effectively 
            as members of teams. The University’s institutional 
            research,supported by virtually every national education study of 
            the past decade, confirms that employers expect colleges and 
            universities to help develop this competency. Research into the 
            attitudes of University of Phoenix students tells us that they 
            expect the University to help them develop these skills 
            too.<BR><BR>Based on these findings, the faculty of University of 
            Phoenix has mandated the use of learning teams as “laboratories” for 
            developing team effectiveness skills. Further, it requires that 
            learning teams be used across the curriculum throughout every 
            student’s program of study.<BR><BR>Some might suggest that there are 
            students whose preferred learning styles lean away from learning in 
            groups and that other formats should be available. To that argument, 
            we give two responses. First, learning styles should not be allowed 
            to become straightjackets—to become effective lifelong learners; we 
            will each need continuously to expand our learning repertoires. 
            Second, creating an educational experience that prepares learners to 
            contribute to the effectiveness of their organizations is central to 
            the mission of University of Phoenix. Developing team competence is 
            critical enough to our students, their organizations, and society as 
            to justify our insistent emphasis.<BR><BR>
            <H2>Toolkit for Effective Team Building</H2>Just as a skilled 
            carpenter gathers the right tools for the job at hand, a skilled 
            leader and manager also fills his or her toolbox with critical 
            knowledge, skills, and attitudes that fit the job to be done. When 
            that job involves building effective teams, the manager’s toolbox 
            must contain knowledge about what teams are, when and why they 
            should be used, and how they can be organized to maximize their 
            effectiveness. It should also contain tools that will help develop 
            the interpersonal and organizational skills, and professional 
            attitudes, that are prerequisites for team success.<BR><BR>In 
            creating this Learning Team Toolkit, our goal was to create a 
            toolbox filled with just what you need most to become an effective 
            team member or leader—a team “builder”—in your organization. Content 
            of the site will continue to expand as we add works from various 
            business and organizational sources, both scholarly and practical, 
            as well as from the University’s digital library. Each section deals 
            with a different critical aspect of teaming. Often, we’ve included 
            more than one source in the discussion of a particular topic. Just 
            as different craftsmen and artisans approach the same job from a 
            slightly different perspective, so do those who study and write 
            about management. We think the varied perspectives you’ll experience 
            will broaden and deepen your knowledge and 
            skills.<BR></SPAN></DIV><BR><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
