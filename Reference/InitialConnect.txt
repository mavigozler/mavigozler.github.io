Thanks, Sophia. I am going to use what I know about project management principles having worked as an analyst on multiple software projects that did feature additions and problem corrections for the Medi-Cal Information Management System used by the state of California for its dental program, which has almost 15 million Californians as beneficiaries. In my time at the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), I worked with top-rate project (PMs) managers (who hold PMP certificates) and learned a great deal from them. Of course, the tasks here will be at scale, but the practices to be employed are the same.

Catchafire in the "let's get going now" email reminded me of what these small scale project management principles are. I asked ChatGPT to review for me in outline fashion how it would proceed with this project where I told it that it would be a "website redesign or design improvement" type project, and it responded to that prompt in this way:

Applying project management principles to your volunteer website reorganization project can enhance efficiency and ensure successful completion. Here's an outline of the project lifecycle, tailored for a small-scale IT endeavor:

1. Initiation Phase:

Define Project Objectives: Clearly articulate the goals of the website reorganization, such as improving user navigation or updating content.

Identify Stakeholders: Determine who has an interest in the project, including the organization, website users, and any collaborators.

Develop a Project Charter: Create a document summarizing objectives, scope, stakeholders, and high-level requirements.

2. Planning Phase:

Scope Definition: Detail the specific tasks and deliverables required for the reorganization.

Resource Allocation: Identify necessary tools, technologies, and team members involved.

Schedule Development: Establish a timeline with milestones and deadlines.

Risk Management: Anticipate potential challenges and devise mitigation strategies.

3. Execution Phase:

Task Implementation: Carry out the planned activities, such as restructuring content and redesigning layouts.

Team Coordination: Ensure effective communication among team members and stakeholders.

Quality Assurance: Regularly test website functionalities to maintain quality standards.

4. Monitoring and Controlling Phase:

Progress Tracking: Compare actual progress against the project plan to identify deviations.

Performance Metrics: Utilize key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess project health.

Issue Resolution: Address any problems or changes promptly to keep the project on track.

5. Closing Phase:

Final Deliverables: Ensure all project components are completed and meet the required standards.

Stakeholder Approval: Obtain formal acceptance from stakeholders or clients.

Documentation: Compile project documentation, including lessons learned and best practices.

Celebration: Acknowledge the team's efforts and celebrate the project's success.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively manage your website reorganization project, even on a smaller scale. This framework ensures all critical aspects are addressed, leading to a well-organized and successful outcome.

I am going to generally follow this approach, but without the huge efforts of developing the written deliverables that go into these projects and which prolong considerably the project. Keeping logs/written records of what's going on is vital. If a couple of years down the road you want to remember something that was done on this project, you can dig it up and look for the info quickly. It happens all the time.

One other thing I've learned from PMs: always get someone on the team assigned a task to have them tell the PM when they will get to them with a task update. If a task completion (not a task update) is estimated to have an inordinate amount of time (meaning more than two weeks), then the task assignee will be told of a communication plan requiring weekly (or at least never more than every two weeks) updates on task completion progress. Projects that work by other approaches seem to never complete or take too long to complete.

What does that mean for this project? When we agree that a task is to be done and when I am assigned the task, I will estimate a completion time (could be in a day, could be in a week, could be longer), and we will also agree on my reporting/communicating with you with progress updates, which may describe work activity that is actual and within expected, or bottlenecks or hindrances, which includes any activity that can wander outside of the scope of the project (happens a lot). I also will make the effort to identify risk (PMs expect a detailing of risk) although that is probably more formal and suitable to a larger project.
