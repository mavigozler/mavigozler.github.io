The following are my personal notes I recorded while reading the full text of
articles, chapters, texts, or monographs. They are effectively more than any
abstract (if any) that is part of the published work, but they are somewhat
less than the full text of the article itself. Since the article is cited with
sufficient information to find it (usually on the Internet, sometimes without
payment), any interested reader can pursue the information in the original.

Calling A Team A Team Doesn't Mean That It Is:  Successful Teamwork Must Be
A Way of Life
<p class="Para1">
Within the last few years teambuilding is the new concept in corporate success.
The president or member of top management issues a memo in which teams are formed
in every department.
<p>
But teams are not built overnight, or work in a <q>hurry up and get it done</q>
approach.  Both sincerity and understanding what comprises a real team are
essential components.  Teams cannot be formed by a demand or power/order/fiat.
Teams must set their own goals, make decisions, and solve problems, as well
as have the power in formation.
<p>
Work teams must have frequent meetings.  They must have a defined purpose or
they spend time philosophizing instead of acting.  Consider the traits of a team,
and place a plus mark to those already possessed, and a minus mark next to those
requiring improvement.
<p>
Teams must have <b>goals and objectives</b>.  They must set them on their own,
and not be given them by some executive or department manager.  Nor must they
be decided by the team leader alone, but by all members in order for them to be
actively involved in the outcome.
<p>
Teams must be <b>empowered</b>.  Without authority to set goals or make decisions\
or solve problems, it is a team in name only.  Team leaders must share power
and members be willing to assume responsibility with empowerment.
<p>
Teams require <b>trust</b> between members if the team is to grow and prosper.
Team members must be consistent in making commitments and keeping them for that
trust.  It applies from leader to member.
<p>
<b>Authentic participation</b> must be genuinely encouraged.  Ideas and suggestions
must be welcomed, heard, and when appropriate, acted upon.  All ideas are okay
with authentic participation.  Members will keep their thoughts to themselves
if they believe ideas are discouraged or criticized.
<p>
<b>Innovation, Creativity, and Risk Taking</b> are activities encouraged by
real teams.  Where open communication and authentic participation occur, teams
will be innovative and creative.  Team leaders and members must risk making
mistakes and even failing occasionally.
<p>
Teams must have direction and so <b>leadership</b> is an essential trait.
Such leadership comes in the form of coaching and counseling.  Coaching
is giving direction and assistance to team members so they can succeed.
Counseling means careful listening to ideas, concerns, and needs, and helping
them to take responsibility to meet their own needs.
<p>
The <b>ability to encourage constructive change</b> represents <b>flexibility</b>.
Since change is always necessary, a change-oriented climate must be made.
Deciding what to change for a company means to ask its customers.  Surveys and
focus groups let customers state what they believe needs to be changed in
products, services, and procedures.  This is Total Quality Management (TQM).

Making Meetings Work
<p class="Para1">
If meeting are not an integral part of work, why have them at all?
Too many people view team-building efforts (in meetings) particularly
as a waste of time.  The problem is that meetings have a lack of focus
and of follow-up.  The following quiz tests the understanding of the
importance of meetings:
<ol>
<li>Many meetings seem to have no clear purpose.
 <ol>
 <li>Restrict meetings to one issue only.
 <li>Prepare an agenda in advance, including the desired outcome
for each agenda item.
 <li>Prohibit people from raising issues not on the agenda.
 </ol>
<li>People arrive late so meetings never start on time.
 <ol><li>Allow an extra five minutes only for latecomers.
  <li>Start on time. As latecomers arrive, quickly summarize
for them what's happened before their arrival.
  <li> Start on time. Appoint a note taker to make detailed meeting
notes on flipchart pages. As latecomers arrive, refer them
to the notes to catch up on what has happened.
 </ol>
<li>Meetings drag on and on.
 <ol><li>Set a rule that all meetings will last only one hour.
  <li>Hold stand-up meetings.
  <li>Appoint a timekeeper whose job is to be fanatical about sticking
to a schedule with predetermined ending times.
  </ol>
<li>The boss dominates the meeting.
 <ol><li>Advise the group in advance on its role for each agenda item:
to acquire information, to give input so the boss can make an informed
decision, or to make a group decision.
  <li>Appoint a facilitator, other than the boss, who can take
responsibility for ensuring everyone is heard.
  <li>As the boss, keep silent until everyone else has spoken.
  </ol>
<li>Meetings are like broken records. People repeat over and
over the same things they said at previous meetings.
 <ol><li> Restrict everyone to speaking just once on each agenda item.
  <li>Ask people in advance to avoid dragging out their favorite hobby
horses.
  <li>When people repeat themselves, point to where their comments
are already recorded on the flip chart.
 </ol>
<li>One or two individuals dominate the meeting.
 <ol><li>Restrict everyone to speaking just once on each agenda item.
  <li>Thank the talker for all his or her helpful input and ask the
person to be patient while others share their ideas.
  <li>For the next meeting, appoint the talker to be facilitator or recorder.
  </ol>
<li>Some people are negative about everything.
  <ol><li> For each idea, get pluses first, then minuses.
  <li>Ask the naysayers to prove their allegations.
  <li>Seat negative types so they are surrounded by more optimistic people.
  </ol>
<li>Discussions turn into arguments.
  <ol><li>Cut off arguments immediately.
   <li>Set a ground rule: Agree before refuting.
   <li>Conflict is healthy. Let people fight it out.
  </ol>
<li>When a decision is made by majority vote, the dissenting minority doesn't support it on the job.
 <ol><li>Make every effort to come to consensus decisions.
  <li>Assign the dissenters specific roles in implementing the
  decision and monitor their performance carefully.
  <li>Avoid giving important implementation roles to dissenters.
 </ol>
<li>People leave meetings confused about the outcomes and what is
expected of them.
 <ol><li>Close each meeting with a question and answer period.
  <li>Close each meeting by assigning follow-up tasks to everyone.
  <li>Close each meeting by recapping the key discussion points
and confirming all actions to be taken.
 </ol>
</ol>
<p>
The best answers to this are 1-b, 2-c, 3-c, 4-a and b, 5-c, 6-b
and c, 7-a, 8-b, 9-a, 10-c.
<p>
The 1st commandment of meetings is the setting of an agenda.  Such an
agenda should not only have topic but even give the time in which
it will be discussed as well as expected outcome.  For example,
suppose topic is cost-cutting:  expected outcome would be <q>three
approaches to cutting department costs by 15 percent.</q>  It does
not fix the solution, but asks that solutions be proposed to the
problem requiring a 15% cut.  At the meeting start, the time and
outcomes can be negotiated quickly, even taking new items/info into
account.
<p>
Do not accommodate latecomers.  Doing so invites them to come later
the next time.  If latecomers want to be apprised of what has
happened, appoint a recorder to keep minutes on flipcharts; let them
read the notes.
<p>
Also appoint a timekeeper to enforce the time constraints on the agenda.
This prevents other people from getting bored who may not be interested
in the hot item.  The discussion can be tabled to a later time when
perhaps more information or perspective can be obtained, and a new
time for discussion allotted.
<p>
Managers represent a problem.  They either dominate the meeting by
doing all the talking or they ask for input and then promptly ignore
it.  Managers should be upfront in saying that they just want others
to listen.  If they solicit opinion, then they need to inform the group
how that opinion influenced a decision.  And if the group is to decide
the manager must stick by the promise.   Managers who want to participate
should appoint a facilitator to control discussion.
<p>
Meeting Reruns are where people bring up subjects or make points that
they have already discussed.  Rather than stopping them from talking,
record the points on a flipchart and point to it to say that the
subject at hand has been duly noted (and that a decision had already
been made).
<p>
Keeping flipcharts for meeting notes also controls the non-stop talker.
Thank the person for the input but point out recorded remarks:  the
abundance of them shows that the person has dominated the discussion
and ask the person to join you in encouraging others to share.
Alternatively appoint loudmouths to the facilitator or recorder role,
since they probably only want the attention and this makes them happy,
and the role also restrains the job holder with respect to input.
<p>
Deal with naysayers by bringing up the issue and forcing people to come
up FIRST with a list of positive things or what they like about an idea.
The pluses are put on a flipchart first.  The people in the room are less
likely to be affected by pessimism then.
<p>
If meeting tend to disintegrate into arguments, then establish the
ground rule:  <b>first agree, then refute</b>.  That is, before anyone
criticizes an idea, the critic must find something first to agree with,
then the critic states an opinion as an addition to the idea rather than
as the negation of it.
<p>
If the issue is put to a vote where there is a sharp split into a winning
majority and a large but losing minority, the losers can win by sabotaging
implementation.  Try to build a consensus instead:  not everyone can love the
outcome but they can all live with it.  Find out what people can not live with
and try to work out a solution on those parts.
<p>
When the meeting adjourns, summarize all key discussion points.  Ask each person
to recap what they will do according to decisions made.  Put all the decisions
in writing and distribute it within a short time.  Follow the progress of the
people.

Evaluating and Assessing Student Oral Presentations:  A Limited But Effective
Role for Employers in the Geography Curriculum
<p class="Para1">
A program was instituted to involve employers in student oral presentations
at Birkbeck College (in the UK).  The instructors debated to what extent employers
should be involved as well as limited in their participation in the educational
process.  2nd year students of the college are required to give a 15-minute
oral presentation.  Training/guidance are given by departmental staff (no
employer involvement).  Employers only play a role in the final stage by
assisting with evaluation and useful feedback.
<p>
Birkbeck College's students part-time undergraduate and graduate students
(87%) who pay for their courses usually in the evening.  It takes undergrads about
four years of evening study to complete a program.  In a review of the currculum,
employers were not considered but became involved as a result of the Enterprise
Initiative.  Their involvement resulted because students must develop <q>enterprise
skills</q> during the summer related to the practical aspects of their education.
Employers were involved in an evaluation and feedback process unrelated to the
oral presentation skills.  The summer project was to get the student to examine
processes determining economic and social change in a particular locality.
Students are to develop the following skills:
<ul><li>information collection <li>advocacy <li>working in pairs <li>role playing
<li>oral presentation <li>use of visual aids <li>response to questions <li>receiving
and acting on feedback</ul>
<p>
20-30 students each year choose from a list of 20 major redevelopment sites in
London.  They spend the summer collecting information, and the end of it
preparing the oral presentation.  They then give a 15-minute talk at the end
of the 2nd year arguing <i>for</i> or <i>against</i> re-development.  The other
student of the pair must argue the opposite case.

Helping Adults Learn
<p class="Para1">
Experts are looking at adult learning theory which is the science of <b>andragogy</b>.
M. Knowles (1980) first looked at this art and science of helping adults learn
with the idea that adults are self-directed learners with a rich body of
personal experiences and an education.
<p>
The traditional lecture style of teaching is less appealing to adults.
When given just the theory alone, only 5 percent of learners will implement
into practice just a theoretical understanding of a lecture.  Four times more
people will do so if given theory, demonstration, and practice.  Ninety percent
will do so if theory, demonstration, and practice includes feedback and
ongoing coaching.
<p>
Adult learning theory process incorporates seven elements:
<ol>
<li>climate setting
<li>involving learners in mutual planning
<li>involving participants in diagnosing their own needs for learning
<li>involving learners in formulating their learning objectives
<li>involving learners in designing learning plans
<li>helping learners carry out their learning plans and
<li>involving learners in evaluating their learning (Knowles, 1984)
</ol>
<p>
The following components of adult learning theory have been proposed as the
most critical to effective professional development design:
<ol>
<li>Adults need real-world applications. The training will have more meaning
to the participants if they feel as if they can use what they have learned
in the workplace.
<li>Adults want to be treated as competent professionals. Participants
need some control over the specifics of the what, how, why, when and where
details of their learning.
<li>Adult learning involves egos. Professional development opportunities
should be structured to allow support from peers and to reduce the fear
of judgment while participants are learning to apply new skills.
<li>Adults need constructive feedback on their efforts to learn and
apply new skills.
<li>Adults benefit from professional development activities that allow
them to participate in small-group activities that provide opportunities
for application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.
<li>Adult learners are unique individuals with a wide range of skills and
experiences. Individual needs and differences must be accommodated
in the professional development planning and implementation.
<li>The transfer of learning must be facilitated. "Coaching and other kinds
 of follow-up support are needed to help adult learners transfer learning
into daily practice so that it is sustained" (Speck, 1996).
</ol>
<p>
In general learners are in control of or help to determine their own
education/training/learning process with respect to professional/staff
development.  Additional training design elements for use with adult learners
include:
<ul>
<li>Use of lectures only for conveying information
<li>Use of demonstrations of instructional strategies
<li>Opportunities for guided practice
<li>Use of case studies
<li>Self-directed learning opportunities
<li>Opportunities to try new practices and then discuss them with colleagues
<li>Peer coaching
<li>Support from the school administrator, including tolerance of mistakes
as learners implement new practices
<li>Self-evaluation of learners' own growth attained through staff
development(Dempwolf, 1993).
</ul>
<p>
Relationships are of primary importance to adult learners:  andragogical approaches
require a psychological climate of mutual respect, collaboration, trust,
support, openness, authenticity, pleasure, and humane treatment.
<p>
Traditional professional development programs have two key design flaws:
they ignore individual needs and the desire for self-determination.  20 key
elements to effective professional development have been identified:
<ol>
<li>Increasing student learning is the overarching goal of all training.
<li>The school is the unit of change.
<li>Professional development is an ongoing process, not a "one-shot approach."
<li>All educators should be life-long learners.
<li>The involvement and support of the principal is a key factor.
<li>Setting and working toward improvement goals should involve
stakeholders in the school.
<li>Improvement efforts must recognize the values, norms and beliefs
that shape school practice and culture.
<li>Policies and practices must be connected to the change process.
<li>Ownership and commitment is gained through input.
<li>The primary goal of professional development is school improvement,
but both school and individual growth must be addressed in the effort.
<li>School districts must provide resources to schools for this purpose.
<li>Planning and implementation should utilize adult learning theory.
<li>Coaching and ongoing systematic support are required for the transfer
of learning from training into applied, daily practice.
<li>Schools should provide recognition and rewards for those involved
in efforts to grow professionally.
<li>Stakeholders must share decisions about time, schedules, curriculum,
personnel, space and materials.
<li>Professional development should support instructional and program
improvement.
<li>Educators must have opportunities to learn from colleagues.
<li>Opportunities should be provided inside schools to discuss, practice
and reflect on new skills.
<li>Participation across job function/role increases shared understandings
and stimulates the use of new approaches.
<li>Broader support mechanisms outside the school are needed, such as
networks, collaboratives, coalitions and partnerships with individuals and
groups outside the school.

We've Got To Start Meeting Like This
<p class="Para1">
We have all been in the agonizingly boring, ineffective, unproductive meeting,
wondering when we will get back to work.
<p>
Meeting at <b>City Year</b> in Boston are called to order with the meeting leader
first raising a hand.  Soon those in the audience are raising their hands,
conversations ceasing, until all hands are raised and the room is quiet.
At another meeting for the 10th anniversary, there was a 4 &times; 8-foot magazine
cover mock-up which encouraged big thinking:  participants generated ideas to
be used for stories whose titles would be featured on the cover.  Other ways
of getting the meeting rolling was based on Robert F. Kennedy's <q>ripples</q>
based on his <q>tiny ripple of hope</q>: acts of courage send such ripples,
and people share a ripple about a happening.  This celebrates the good, creates
an updraft of positive emotion.  A ground rule at most City Year meetings
is called NOSTUESO: No One Speaks Twice Until Everybody Speaks Once.  It keeps
domineering and wordy individuals from monopolizing discussion and ensures a
hearing of all voices.  Leaders of the meeting also end their meetings with
another mini-meeting called <q>+ / &delta;</q>:  the purpose here is to assess
the meeting itself.  Under the plus sign, items that worked are written down.
Under the delta symbol, changes that need to be made are listed, with phrasing
in positive terms.  Not, for instance, <q>Meeting too long</q> but rather
<q>Meeting should be shorter</q>.
<p>
At the <b>Mattel Media</b> in El Segundo, CA (division of Mattel Toys),
a meeting on product development is called.  Note-taking is forbidden:
if people are writing notes, then they are not paying attention.
Instead, a single <q>technographer</q> is selected to record everyone's ideas
on laptop, and the entries are projected on a 35-inch color monitor or
projected on to the wall.  Instead of a whiteboard requiring erasure, ideas
can be quickly moved to other areas and content of the meeting easily scrolled
back to.  Meeting notes are easily emailed or printed out quickly to a printer.
Ideas and thoughts should never be deleted.  One product idea was developed
from notes of a meeting that occurred a year earlier and was found in a
boneyard.
<p>
In Santa Monica, CA the marketing agency <b>The Phelps Group</b> calls a
meeting to order with the agenda to build camaraderie and cooperation.
At 9:28 a.m. every Monday Joe Phelps issues a "two-minute warning" in which
each of his 50 employees goes to an all-purpose room.  First item on the agenda
and encouraging prompt attendance is a $100 bill for the employee whose phone
extension is drawn and who correctly answers a question from the employee
handbook.  There are always 5 agenda items.  The 2nd, after the drawing,
is a report of the company's teams (advertising, direct marketing, production,
media) to show off new work.  The 3rd is announcing important agency and client
business.  The title of the 4th is <q>Minutes</q>:  each team gives a one-minute
mini-lessn, teaching the group about a piece of expertise or handing out and
summarizing a helpful article.  Also there is a technology minute, grammar
minute (e.g., use of quotation marks), and an office-machine minute
(covering copy jams perhaps).  The 5th item is the Atta Boy/Atta Girl Award,
which gets festooned with personal effects/items, passed on from one employee
to the other, the current award holder selecting the next.
<p>
<b>Douglas Griffen</b> is a meeting facilitator and managing partner at D. S.
Griffen &amp; Associates who, for $5000 a day, will arrive at a doorstep
with networked laptops, a server, a laser printer, and even a CD player.
At one meeting are 20 laptops around a U-shaped table, asking the question
<q>What new markets can we enter?</q>  As people type answers, they immediately
appear on everyone's screen at the top.  This prompts more entries.  Soon there
is a great deal of brainstorming.  15 minutes and no word has been said yet.
Griffen skims from the 200 ideas posted by about 20 people and shows the
12-15 common themes...all anonymous.  The entire system is also set up to vote
on ideas...keep those that are good and eliminate those going nowhere.
<p>
At <b>Domino's Pizza</b> holds a meeting to review an employee's aspirations,
needs, and achievements.  Tom Monaghan is founder and president of Domino's
headquartered in Ann Arbor, MI.  He conducts individual job planning and review
(JP&amp;R) meetings, each 2 hours long and sometimes longer, with six executive
vice presidents and a chief of staff about once a month.  Don Vlcek was hired
in the late 1970s and ran the company's $600 million-per-year distribution
subsidiary until 1994 and had his first session lasting 8 hours.  The JP&amp;R
allows no salary talk.  The subordinate leads the session and move point-by-point
through 10 areas of review following from a form filled out in advance.
The subordinate discusses his/her dream or mission (a CFO might want to
achieve 100% accurate P&amp;L statements never a day late and zero past
due collection or payments to suppliers), an analysis of his/her role (what
does the employee do on a regular basis?), a discussion of the employee's needs,
and a report of achievements (accomplishments over a month) and struggles
(an opportunity to admit screw-ups before the boss discovers them).
<p>
Consider the meeting of <b>educators who have formed a task force</b>.
Their mission is to write a vision statement within two sessions for a new
concept high school.  Since each session is 2.5 hours, they have to do this
within 5 hours.  The school was to be located on teh grounds of the
Minnesoate Zoological Gardens.  Using index cards, they useed a meeting method
known as <q>compression planning.</q>  It is a kind of storyboarding system.
The first board states the purpose of the meeting.  In subsequent boards
are ground rules:  <q>We listen to each other.</q> <q>No speeches.</q>\
<q>We address ideas, not people.</q>  Meeting leaders point to a statement to
remind people of the guidelines.  Two people recorded the ideas on 3&times;5
cards.  Another stuck them on fabric-covered boards 4 feet square.  A timer
watches the clock, who signals the facilitator when it was time to move from
exploration or brainstorming phase to focusing phase (ideas are winnowed out
and categorized by colored dots), then to the concept board and finally on to
the action board.  Consensus was easy to spot in the focusing phase.

What do we know about students' learning, and how do we know it?
<p class="Para1">
In 1969 a book covering the last 40 years of research on how higher education
affected college students covered 1500 research studies.  About two decades later
in 1991, a larger volume appeared called <i>How College Affects Students</i>
covering twice the number of pages (about 1000) and 2600 studies.
This information now has to be distilled down to perhaps a dozen bulleted
points.  Some of that information is part of the <q>Seven Principles for Good
Practice in Undergraduate Education.</q>  The Study Group on the Conditions
of Excellence in American Higher Education (1984) came up with the <q>three
critical conditions for excellence.</q>  There is also the nine strategies for
improving student learning by the Oxford Centre for Staff Development (1992),
and the Education Commission of the States (1996) published the twelve attributes
of good practice.  And the Task Force on Psychology in Education of the American
Psychological Association came forth with a dozen learner-centered principles
representing pscyhology's accumulated knowledge about learning and instruction
(McCombs, 1992).  We have found a nugget of gold from mining tons of ore.
There is lot of discussion whether continued research will yield any more
for the practitioner to apply to everyday problems.  Some areas may be incapable
of solutions on a rigorous technical level.
<p>
A great many movements (<q>isms</q>) have emerged that question the very nature
of knowledge.  If we don't know what knowledge is, how can we attain it?
A fundamental question of epistemology is whether knowledge is <q>out there</q>
to be discovered by learners or whether it is constructed through a process of
language, thought and social interaction.
<p>
Bruffee at Brooklyn College and teaches English believes in <q>nonfoundtaional
social constructionism</q> meaning that knowledge is socially constructed:
it is not by examination of the world but rather <q>a negotiating with one another
in commnities of knowledgeable peers...[knowledge is] therefore not a universal
and absolute. It is local and historically changing.  We construct it and
reconstruct it, time and again, and build it up in layers.</q>  The contrasting
view is that there is a reality or world <q>out there,</q> and there is a right
answer discoverable by objective scientific research.
<p>
Contrasted was cooperative and collaborative learning in the pedagogies that
have been described.  Cooperative learning is where students work in small
groups on assigned projects or problem under instructor guidance so that
students come up with right answers.  And of course this assumes that the
teacher knows the right or best answer in the process.  This is probably what
most school systems see as the revolution in learning.
<p>
Collaborative learning is more radical:  the students are still in learning
groups, interacting and reaching consensus, but the teacher's purview
is not to inform them about correcting <q>wrong</q> impressions because the
teacher is not an authority.  In many cases, knowledge is the result of
thoughts of a majority culture (ethnocentrism).
<p>
Conventional rules of education is a hierarchy in which those who know teach
those who do not know.  All questions posed have answers and scholarship
involves knowing the answer or at least knowing the process of discovering it.
This follows a competition of who knows the most or the best answers.
Education becomes a contest for learning the truth about a reality which we
invent for social competitiveness.
<p>
Moreover, the structure of education has certain impositions.  Since males have
dominated the structure because they dominate the world, they see learning
and knowledge as a disconnected detached analysis descriptive of <q>scientific
method.</q>  Women are <em>connected learners</em>:  they develop procedures
better to get access to other people's knowledge, and have a capacity for
empathy.
<p>
A connecter learner does not ask whether something is right, but what it means.
She says, <q>Why do you think that?</q> not <q>What evidence do you have to
back that up?</q>
<p>
William Perry has posited nine positions in the development of the intellect
of college students, and the three major positions are described briefly here.
At the low end of development, students assume that there is a right answer to
every question and that it is known by an authority, namely the professors.
Students have a low tolerance for ambiguity but are willing to allow that
answers are not available for some cases.  They assume as society does that
authorities in research will provide the answer or will eventually.  In fact
we expect answers in brief and clear and unambiguous form such as the three
or seven or twelve principles of learning.
<p>
At the next (mid)stage, students learn that the authorities disagree with each
other and that views of fellow students are at variance with their own.  Students
rationalize this as <q>everyone has a right to their own opinion.</q>  However
there is now a growing skepticism of the authoritative officials.  Pollsters and
economists are ignored, and people listen instead to neighbors, friends, and
family.
<p>
At the highest stage of intellectual development, there is an affirmation of
identity through commitment and self-actualization.  There is uncertainty of
what this level is since developmental theorists have not seen many examples.
At this level the truth is relative and depends on context.  There is no single
right answer and no answer is as good as any other.  Developmental theory finds
that the periods of greatest personal groth are in unnamed and poorly defined periods
<em>between</em> stages.
<p>
This essay was titled with two questions.  <q>What do we know about student
learning?</q> is intended to provide the author with the ability to provide
a few <q>right answers</q> while <q>How do we know it?</q> is intended to raise
questions about authoritative knowledge.  Those gold nuggest from all that mined
research data can be melted down to gold bullion as an efficient way of answering
the first question.  All those condensed lists or <q>principles</q> can be
further condensed to synthesize one or more meta-principles, perhaps to a grand
meta-principle:  <b>what we know about student learning is that students who are
actively engaged in learning for deeper understanding are likely to learn more
than students not so engaged</b>.  But this is disillusioning since we already
knew it from experience without the research.  Look specifically at the Seven
Principles of Good Practice (Chickering &amp; Gamson, 1987):
<ol>
<li>Good practice encourages student-faculty contact.
<li>Good practice encourages cooperation among students.
<li>Good practice encourages active learning.
<li>Good practice gives prompt feedback.
<li>Good practice emphasizes time on task.
<li>Good practice communicates high expectations.
<li>Good practice respects diverse talents and ways of knowing.
</ol>
<p>
These tell us out to get and keep students <i>actively</i> engaged in learning.
Thus active learning is the grand principle here.  The irony here is that the
list items violate its own advice:  if people are to find their own answers, then
the list has no validity since it purports to be the right answer.  Perhaps trying
to describe the best way of enabling collegiate learning is not a matter of
producing bulleted lists of points since it removes the understanding at a deeper
level.
<p>
Consider the first principle of student-faculty interaction.  This conclusion
comes from large-scale correlational studies measuring student-faculty contact
frequency in and out of class with performance.  Students are less likely to drop
out.  This correlation tells us what goes together, but not why.  The correlation
is observed probably because students already successful are more likely to seek
contact with faculty than less successful students, i.e. success leads to faculty
interaction and faculty interaction does not promote success.  Alternatively
faculty who invite contact are more likely to be the kind of persons who
stimulate educational satisfaction than those who are less approachable.
And how do we treat cases where students are successful and have virtually no
contact, and students who have lots of contact but still drop out dissatisfied
and disillusioned, both kinds being exceptions to the rule.
Thus such studies actually attempt to relate the <em>quantity</em> of student-faculty
contact as opposed to its <em>quality</em>.  Faculty are more impressionable
on student success when they become involved through more than formal channels.
<p>
With many studies there is a conclusion based on a statistically significant
difference in results.  But are the difference in results really that important
or critical?  A set of learning procedures might be chosen because they serve
the greatest good for the greatest number, achieving a desired result within a
set period of time.  The <q>assembly line</q> approach works when those at the
low and high end of the distributions do not deviate that much from the mean
(cluster in the middle), but diversity in the population throws out that
kurtotic steepness for something flatter.  Research approaches are not dealing
with the anecdotal cases of individual differences, although learning must
be achieved with these cases as well.
<p>
Consider the story of the boy and the clock.  Given to him by his grandfather,
it quit running after 8 days.  He took it to researchers at the university, whom
he thought would open to examine the failure of the operation.  Instead they
commented that a study of one clock is not generalizable, so they did a research
project, collecting a sample of 100 clocks, including those with different size,
color, country of manufacture.   They precisely studied how long each clock ran.
They found smaller clocks ran longer than larger clocks, did not see differences
with respec to color.  Controlling size and color, they found Japanese clocks
running longer than Swiss.  They never opened them however:  had they done that
they would have seen that Japanese clocks ran on batteries and quartz, while
Swiss were pendulum.  They could tell the boy that he would have a better chance
of a longer-running clock if it were Japanese.
<p>
The moral here is that if one wants to know how students learn, then first find
out what makes them tick.  And rather than an impersonal sample, why not find
the students that belong to us?
<p>
This is not to dismiss the value of educational research.  Research becomes
a partner with experience in helping find answers to these questions.
But rather than the findings of research being <em>conclusions</em> to the
investigations into learning, they should be treated as a <em>start</em> into
that investigation.  Consider the first or the Seven Principles:  rather than
starting a program to increase student-faculty interaction, it is better to
discuss <em>why</em> this occurs.  Is it due to an active interest shown by
the faculty?

Development and Adaptations of The Seven Principles for Good Practice
in Undergraduate Education
<p class="Para1">
In the mid-1980s an undergraduate reform movement was being discussed.
Good practice in undergraduate education:
<ul>
<li>encourages student-faculty contact
<li>encourages cooperation among students
<li>encourages active learning
<li>gives prompt feedback
<li>emphasizes time on task
<li>communicates high expectations
<li>respects diverse talents and ways of learning
</ul>
<p>
Some adaptations of the seven principles have been put to use.  One is the
Student Inventory from the Seven Principles Resource Center at Winona State.
Other adaptations include the Learning Process Inventory and Assessment (LPIA).
<p>
With some disciplines having <q>low paradigmatic development,</q> such as history,
psychology, and sociology&mdash;fields where faculty are not much in agreement
about theory methods, techniques and problems characteristic of the discpline,
only four of the seven principles are used in teahcing: encouragement of
student-faculty contact and active learning, communication of high expectations,
and respect for diverse talents and ways of learning.

There is No <q>Why</q> in T-E-A-M
<p class="Para1">
Although individualism has been applauded, the use of teams in business
and industry is the <q>flavor of the month</q> probably because organizations
are faced with:
<ul>
<li>reality of flattened organizational hierarchies
<li>ambiguity of sudden, sweeping change
<li>cross-functional nature of most major decisions
<li>enormous consequences of a personal or organizational mis-step
<li>desperate need for something magical to spread risk and blame

  <li>explore an issue
  <li>make list of ideas
  <li>build something
  <li>work on project
  <li>ice breaker for first class in any course
  </ul>
  <td><ol>
      <li>form groups of no more than 5 people (4-5 per group)
      <li>show the following visual presentation in the format:
        <table  class="visual">
        <tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center;">
              <b>Form groups of four to five.</b><br>
             DECIDE WHAT QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ASK

         <tr><td colspan="2">Ask instructor any questions that you are feel are
             important to you.
        </table>
      <li>Suggest that the group members quickly get acquainted if they
       like, and instruct the groups to find one person to be a recorder of
		the questions.  Give them 5 minutes to complete the list.  Circulate
		around the room during this period.
		<li>Get a spokesperson from the group to ask the first question.
			To prevent monopolization of the exercise, allow only one question
			in a round.
      </ol>
	<td><ul><li>The grouping has allowed class members to become acquainted with
a subset of other class members.  <li>Because they pose the questions, they get
answers to the questions they have rather than information you supply.<li>The
instructor has put himself in the <q>hot seat,</q> and thus demonstrated shared
power and equality between all people in the room.</ul>

<tr><th colspan="3" class="activity-name">Please Form Small Groups
<tr><td colspan="3">Much of the curricula involves forming small groups or task team
learning approaches.  Advantages are:
  <ul style="margin:0;padding-left:1em;">
  <li>Group activity enhances learning as opposed to instructor-centered
activity
  <li>Students have less of a chance to hide (a cause for some anxiety) or be
forgotten (feeling of insignficance)
  <li>Students speak up more freely in small groups than in front of entire
class.
  <li>Giving same task to number of groups creates some competitive desire
which keeps groups on the task and increases productivity.
  <li>A person feels little responsibility to be part of the success of the class
whereas in groups there is greater incentive to contribute.
  <li>Individuals give more effort in the smaller group compared to the larger
one (the entire class).
  </ul>
<p>
Two person groupings have more requirements on them and research indicates that
they use antagonism-avoiding behaviors which may truly provide more alternatives.
Three-person groups are a minimum.  Ideal groupings have 4-5 persons per group.
Groups of 6-10 actually form internal subgroups that often divide the work but
sometimes fall off track and go into irrelevancies.

<tr><th colspan="3" class="activity-name">What's In A Name
<tr><td>There is a comfort to be addressed by name and for people to remember
your name.  Tent cards with names are provided by the University during the
first workshop.  The person props up their name or writes it in, on both sides
of the card.
<td>Variations on this activity:
  <ol>
  <li>Have students write present job, company, and other relevant information
in small letters in corners of the card.
  <li>Have students write on the <em>inside</em> <q>Only for you to see</q>
the completion of these sentences:
  <ul>
  <li>What I'd really like to do right now is...
  <li>I hope this course won't be...
  <li>What I would like to learn in this course include...
  </ul>
Although the information is confidential at this stage, instructor can get
students to volunteer the responses within the session or class.  This activity
gets the student to understand that the instructor wants to know what interests
the student or what is expected.
   <li>take-off of old go-around naming game:  after initial introductions or
maybe halfway through first class, ask class to bring chairs in a circle or
sit on table edges.  Explain that as child, there was a game played for
remembering names:  I will tell the person to my right my name, and then that
person turns to the person on his/her right and tells them my name and adds
their own.  This continues.</ol>
	<td><ul><li>Gets everyone to speak up in the group
   <li>increases chance of people calling each other by name
   <li>gets people to look at each other
   <li>usually good for a laugh</ul>

<tr><th colspan="3" class="activity-name">I Am...
<tr><td>This might be quite appropriate to certain courses.
  <td><ol>
   <li>Each person given paper (8.5" &times; 11") with the heading <b>I AM...</b>
	<li>All are asked to finish sentence in <b>SIX</b> different ways
	<li>show the following visual presentation in the format as an example of
    how to complete the exercise:
        <table  class="visual">
        <tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center;">I AM...
        <tr><td><ul><li>an engineer<li>a father<li>a stamp collector</ul>
         <td><ul><li>feeling a bit silly<li>fun<li>a non-smoker</ul>
        </table>
	<li>After time allowed to fiish, distribute tape to each person and attach
his/her sheet to his/her front.  The instructor should do this as well.
   <li>Instruct the class to get up and move around to see who is there.
All members should spend 30 seconds with each person to read the
sheet and associate a face with it. <em>No talking is permitted</em>.  The
instructor should set the example by doing it as well.  Remind class members
not to talk if they do.
	<li>Create a gallery where signs are now hung on the wall.  Invite them to
look at the signs during the break or before going home.
    </ol>
<td>Activity makes for conversation on very safe topics.  Class members more
likely to open up to each other.
<p>
Other variations include handing everyone paper.  Put pieces of tape on the
edge of the table hanging over it, within each person's reach.  The person
is instructed to write name in large/bold letters at top of sheet.  Then the
class is told to print 5 or 6 words telling something about themselves ending
with "ing" (can be who they are, what they like:  e.g., reading, cooking,
traveling, skiing).  Other possible word endings are "able" (approachable,
reasonable, capable), "ist" (optimist, realist, pianist, cyclist, specialist),
or "ful" (playful, careful, hopeful, delightful).
<p>
They then attach the paper and mill about room with instructor doing same.
There may be no talking at least for first two minutes, and then people can
be encouraged to stop and ask questions.

<tr><th colspan="3" class="activity-name">Interview
<tr><td>This technique works well in typical communications in business
culture.
  <td><ol>
    <li>Students are asked to turn to one of their neighbors and blink to
indicate <q>you are now a team of two!</q>.  The instructor says <q>I would like
you to spend 4 minutes together and interview the other person.  Find out at least
3 things (other than the name) of the interviewee.</q>
    <li>The instructor might suggest/offer examples of interview questions:
<q>Why are you taking this particular program offered by University of Phoenix?
Where do you come from?  What do you want to do when the course and program
are finished?</q>
    <li>After the 4 minute time period (although the period might be gauged
depending on the amount of talking), the students are brought back to attention
as a class: <q>Now I would like each of you to introduce your partner, the person
you have just interviewed.</q>  In fact, it helps if the instructor models
the introduction with a student if there are an odd number of class members:
<q>I would like you all to meet Barbara Jones, who comes from New York City.
This is her first course...</q>  You ask the introduced person to stand up
so <q>we can all see one another.</q>  The class is thanked for participation.
    </ol>
	<td>Again, it is a style of ice-breaking typical in business school culture.
Variations include
  <ol>
  <li>Arrange class in groups of 3 (triads), dispersing to arrange for privacy.
You might encourage the groups to form with people they know the least or
have never even talked to before.  Once the groups form, ask the members to
name/designate themselves as 'A,' 'B,' and 'C,' before giving further instructions.
Now say <q>Person A:  I would like you to tell the other two in your group as
much about yourself and your reasons for being here (expectations of this course)
as you feel comfortable saying.  You have 2 minutes.  then I would like persons
'B' and 'C' who have listened for two minutes to report back to 'A' what they
have heard.  The two can add anything that they assume 'A' said or meant to
say.  'A' should clarify so each of you understands what 'A' is indeed saying.
Then repeat the process, this time with 'B' speaking first while 'C' and 'A'
list and then report.  Continue finally to listen to what 'C' says about
himself or herself.</q>
  <li>Rather than personal introductions, a certain topic or issue could be
assigned.  This exercise gives a person a chance to be heard/listened to,
and also allows statements nand reference to be separated and discussed
afterwards with the entire group.
  </ol>

<tr><th colspan="3" class="activity-name">Expectation Survey
<tr><td>This activity is intended to help the instructor determine the needs and
expectations of the students for the course and its instructor.  Either before
the planning of a course, or early into it, the instructor should elicit the
opinions of students about needs/expectations for the course.  Students should
identify desired learning outccomes and even the methods they feel are optimal
to the learning process.
 <td><ol>
  <li>This activity period can last from 2 to 20 minutes, depending on time
necessary to discuss needs.  Either blank sheets of paper or prepared questionnaires
are used.
  <li>Prepare a questionnaire which contains a list of topics, issues, skills, etc.
Students choose which items they prefer by giving a rating ranking order.
  <li>Another approach is to give a sheet of paper to each person that has on
it questions like any of the following:
  <ul>
  <li>What do you want to learn during the course in terms of skills and
information (knowledge)?
  <li>What kinds of activities would prefer not to get involved in?
  <li>What kinds of activities make this course enjoyable for you?
  <li>What would SUCCESS look like for you at the end of this course?
  <li>What would SUCCESS look like for you at the end of this program?
  <li>How can the faculty member be most useful to you in your learning?
  <li>What contributions do you think that you can make to the learning of others
in the class?
  </ul>
Papers are collected and you can prepare a summary of ideas for distribution to
the class.  Random comments can be solicited along with answers to written questions
in starting off with discussion of expectations.
  <li>Yet another approach is to generate and process students' comments in
class:
   <ol>
   <li>Ask students to form sub-groups of 3-5 and isolate themselves from other
groups in the room.
	<li>Distribute felt pens and a sheet of paper to each group.
	<li>Ask groups to list 10 things they want to learn during the course.
One person will act as recorder (but not chair).  Inform groups that any
contribution is okay and no need to reach a consensus on any item in list.
Set a firm time limit to complete the list.
   </ol>
   Circulate about the room, and do not join in discussions except to clarify
the tasks.  Give two short strips of adhesive tape to each group.
   <p>Choose either one of two approaches for publication:
   <ol>
   <li>Have the group narrow down the list to 3-5 of the most pressing items,
giving a few minutes for them to reach agreement on ranking.  The recorder
of the group then reports to the class.  The instructor writes down items
on whiteboard or flipchart, arranging according to content, sequence or
under such headings as <q>possible in this course,</q> <q>not possible in this
course, but alternatives are available,</q> or similar headings of your choice.
   <li>Alternatively ask recorders to put the sheets along one wall of the room
and invite students to <q>visit the gallery.</q>
   </ol>
  </ol>
 <td>This activity has the following advantages:
 <ul>
 <li>The student is asked to think about and identify learning needs, and gets
an early sense of responsibility in the course
 <li>Student begins to see how an anonymous course becomes personal learning
project towards satisfying needs of student.
  <li>Student can hold instructor response if course deviates from expressed
needs of the end of the course.
  <li>Student can assess his/her own learning at end of course.
 </ul>

<b>LEARNING ACTIVITIES</b>.  The following table gives a rather large list
of faciltation techniques or methods that might be used by the instructor.
They are intended to represent good methods for facilitation.

</div> <!-- class=outerblock -->

<table class="activity" style="width:60em;margin:2em -10%;">

<tr style="font-size:115%;"><th>Purpose/Objective  <th>Method  <th>Result/Outcome/Advantage


<tr><th colspan="3" class="activity-name">Effective Use of Questions
<tr><td>Questions can be directed and effective when they do not embarrass
participants not having the <q>right</q> answer or without students trying to
guess what you want them to say, and without awkward pauses that follow when
the instructor asks, <q>Are there any questions?</q>
  <td>Try the following:
  <ul><li>Ask for more information by requiring responder to be more explicit
and sure of the answer:  <q>Can you give me an example?</q> or <q>When you
say x-y-z, what do you mean?</q>
  <li>Re-state what has been heard: <q>So, you are saying that people
should...or did I misunderstand you?</q>  The instructor indicates a point of
understanding and teh respondent can proceed from that point.
  <li>Have the student think more critically or in detail about the answer.
The instructor can say, <q>To  me that sounds like a rather simple answer.</q>
or <q>Why do you think this is so?</q> or <q>How would you explain that
to someone who feels or believes just the opposite?</q>
	<li>Intensify the student's statement if the response is important by
getting other students to expand on it:  <q>That was a good answer, Bob.
What implications would your statement have for...?</q> and look at the rest
of the class.
  </ul>
This style is effecive when the question is asked and there is a pause for
five seconds, then asking for the response.  Students will have already given
non-verbal signals they are ready to respond.
  <td>This has the effect of looking deeply into a discussed subject, drawing
out responses from students rather than the instructor.
<tr><th colspan="3" class="activity-name">Learning Contracts
<tr><td>A simple but explict agreement about the mutual expectations between
two or more persons.  Because it is a <em>contract</em>, the implication is
that its provisions are legitimate, fair, important, and possible.
  <td> <ul><li>The contract must be in writing.  It should be signed by all parties,
because it is a contract.
  <li>Part or all of the contract can be negotiated rather than written from just the point of
view of one party.
  <li> Provisions should include:
    <ul><li> specific goals of the learner <li>what is expected to be learned
    by the teacher <li>steps detailed to a degree that specifies how
goals are completed<li>the time/amount of reading and preparation outside the
  class<li>methods or processes of grading<li>requirements for
  participation/attendance<li>the topics and format instructions on
projects, papers, and presentations</ul>
  <li>The contract might include language as to how the
contract should be changed/altered/revised;  all amendments should be written
into the contract as it changes.
 <li>Both student and teacher should keep a copy, signed and dated.  Items
subject to renegotiation are to be indicated.</ul>
  <td>This process is quite effective at making students take responsibility for
their own learning.  It delineates clearly the functions and responsibilities
of the facilitator and student.
<tr><th colspan="3" class="activity-name">The Lecture
<tr><td>While it should not be the only method, learning is achieved using
lectures to avoid boring the students.  Experience indicates that lectures should
not last longer than 20 minutes.  Mixing lecturing in with other facilitation
techniques especially over a 4-hour time period is the best way to teach.
  <td><ol><li>Keep the points to a minimum.  About a half dozen in a 20-minute
lecture block. <li>Introduce and conclude:  summarize the points. <li>Pause
from time to time to let listeners think about what they heard. <li>Tell students
that you want to talk for a certain period, after which you will take questions.
<li>Make sure you fulfill your promise to answer questions, and make the promise
as well. <li>Make effective use, but not overuse, of visual aids. <li>The diction
and pace of the talk should be appropriate to the audience. <li>Ask questions
yourself to get all students to participate.  Ask questions in a way that forces
them to give long answers (think out loud).  Ask follow-up questions that pick
up on keywords in another's answer.</ol>
  <td>

<tr><th colspan="3" class="activity-name">Buzz Group
<tr><td>This device can be used when the instructor wants to:
 <ul><li>Discuss an assigned topic <li>Solve a problem (posed by you or group)
 <li>Make a list of questions, comments, idea <li>Relate a classroom theory
  to the participants' own experiences</ul>
  <td><ol><li>Have the class form groups in sizes of 4-6.  Students should be
  able to face one another (let seating be re-arranged if possible).
  <li>Present the issue or problem:  written on the board, or a flipchart,
  or overhead projector.
  <li>Give about 4-6 minutes for the <q>buzz.</q>  This outside the briefing
and reporting time.  At a minimum paper and pens are necessary.  If a gallery
is used for reporting, give tape.
  <li>During the buzz, suggest ways for approaching the problem.  Also keep time,
and warn the students once or twice how much time is remaining (2 minutes is
useful).
  <li>In reporting, have groups only bring up points not raised.  Ask students
how many points they found.
  <li>A variation is for each group to report only the main point...at most
three.</ol>

and dissuades domination of discussion by a certain few.  It also reinforces
to all students their responsibility to participate.
  <td><ol><li>Tokens (e.g. pennies) are distributed to all participants.  The
count of the tokens should be what you want in terms of contribution.
  <li>Begin the discussion for the group on the proposed topic.  Ask questions

what is going on in the classroom.  There is no lengthy discussion and
no one is left out.  Use it in the middle of the course to see if progress
is being made and also to find out students' feelings, thoughts, and attitudes.

Career-Long Teacher Development:  Policies That Make Sense
<p class="Para1">
Policymakers are realizing that ensuring high-quality teaching is the best
intervention in teaching. A major problem with improving the situation is that
experts in education know what works, but are not communicating best-practice
knowledge to classroom teachers.  Good teacher preparation programs exist, but
not all teachers have access.  States should establish a system for development
related with their expectations.  The system should include the range of
activities from recruitment to preparation, certification, induction, and
the balance of the teacher's career.  Research by Linda Darling-Hammond
shows that states showing progress in improving student achievement show
two key policy steps:
<ul>
<li>they identify teaching standards about what teachers should know and
be able to perform at different career stages
<li>standards are used to develop appropriate certification and licensing
systems, more productive teacher education and induction programs, more
effective professional development
</ul>
<p>
<b>Progress Toward Standards-Based System Of Teacher Development</b>. At
the start of the 20th century, physicians could prepare for clinical work
by taking rigorous science-based medical training or a three week course to
memorize symptoms and set of cures.  A 1910 study found that there was a
problem communicating signficant medical knowledge to practitioners however.
This led to a system of study, internships, residencies, and career-long
continuing education requirements.
<p>
Teaching may undergo such a transformation.  The system is moving towards
a means such that more attention is given to candidates likely to succeed
as teachers;  education programs for teachers are accountable for giving
access to a body of knowledge and giving candidates practical experience
to complement theory; licensing or credentialing is connected to standards-based
performance; standards are embeddded in induction process that includes
mentoring; performance assessment at end of probationary period is grounded
in same standards as preservice work; ongoing professional development
targets the kind of accomplished practice recognized by the National Board
for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS).  Many states are now developing
teacher licensing standards especially for beginners.
<p>
<b>Teacher Knowledge and Student Achievement</b>.  Teaching in the 20th century
was essentially based on an industrial model in which teachers were regarded
as semiskilled workers needing little knowledge.  Today the knowledge of teachers
is known to affect student achievement.  Factors such as class size, spending
levels, teacher salaries, or staff proportions of teachers are not related to
success; rather it is related to teacher quality.   Success is still obtained
even when student poverty and limited English proficiency are factored in.
Class size may have an affect on some teaching activities such as elementary
reading, but most effects are related to teacher quality.  A study of 900
TX school districts for test score variations and comparisons to teacher quality
showed that teacher expertise accounted for 40% of the variance in test scores
in math and reading from grades 1-11.  Note that teacher quality was measured
by education, licensing exam scores, and experience.  States leading nation
in math and reading student achievement have most highly qualified teachers:
MN, IA and ND have made long-standing investments in upgrading teacher qualifications
and capacities.
<p>
<b>How to Get Knowledge to Teachers: The Continuum of Teacher Development</b>.
In every case and discipline, the better prepared teacher is more successful
with students than the less prepared.  These teachers are likely to stay in
the profession and do well.  State policymakers can ensure that teachers are
encouraged or required to use NCATE or similar rigorous standards for preservice
programs, create incentives and sanctions encouraging hiring and support of
well-qualified individuals, create bodies establishing and enforcing teacher
standards.
<p>
<i>Recruitment</i>.  Since quality teaching has been identified as the greatest
factor in better learning, the recruitment process instilling quality is
essential.  Recruitment is targeted to those with vision, motivation, and
disposition to work effectively with children, and particularly those in
underperforming schools.  More effective programs interview candidates
individually and in groups to determine probability that candidate will be a
good teacher.
<p>
<i>Preparation</i>.  Teacher education programs suffer from having uncertain
goals or the lack of clarity of these goals for teaching; or from individually
determined course content; or uninspired pedagogy such as lecturing on groupwork.
Programs often provide theory out of context and experience idiosyncrasies of
practice without the theory to make sense of what happens.  <q>Extraordinary</q>
teacher preparation programs involve the following:
<ul>
<li>strong groundin in content areas to be taught and how to teach them to
children at certain ages
<li>curriculum development in subject area, i.e. on how concepts fit together
and add up
<li>emphasis on learning and use of assessment to understanding how and what
students are learning, what to do if they are not getting it
<li>commitment to broad repertoire of strategies to meet different needs of
learners
<li>connecting theory to practice: integrating  courses and clinical experience
<li>extended study with expert mentors in model setting (e.g., professional
development schools in state-of-art settings like <q>teaching hospitals</q>) with
all pieces in place to allow candidates to emulate good practice (18-30 weeks
of supervised student teaching).
<li>well-developed relationship with schools
</ul>
<p>
<i>Induction, Continuing Education</i>. Apprentice teachers with mentors and
other support are more likely to stay in the profession, and continue to learn
during the critical transition time. The new teachers will get feedback,
opportunities for guided reflection, and encouragement to experiment with and
modify strategies. Ongoing professional development will be a career-long
process, and policies must be in place to further them.
<p>
More than half of U.S. teachers get less than one day's professional development
each year, in contrast with teachers in other countries getting 10-20 hours
per week.  Much of the development is en masse as well.  There is no follow-up.
Time is given to teachers in other countries to plan curriculum and lessons
and to evaluate each other's teaching.

Stages of Group Development
<p class="Para1">
This model was first given as four stages in 1965 and then revised in 1977 (with
M Jensen) including a fifth stage.
<p>
<b>Stage 1: Forming</b>.  In the formation, individuals involved in the group
avoid conflict and controversy initially, worried more about organizing, roles,
meeting details (times, dates, places).  But they also attempt to learn about
each other, although the group goals are far from being realized.
<p>
<b>Stage 2: Storming</b>.  Now the group has to grapple with its purpose, and
its members start to fray on each other's nerves as disagreement about roles
and responsibilities emerge.  Some embrace the appearance of this stage while
others try to remain in stage 1.  Some disputes may continue or remain, having
been forced under the surface.  At this point, rules may be formulated, especially
to deal with these types of crises or resolve such problems.
<p>
<b>Stage 3: Norming</b>.  The group members have now all made known their side,
their way of doing things, revealed their type of personality.  Each is aware
of the skills and experience of the other, more or less.  There is now a
willingness to discard pre-conceived views or at least try alternatives offered
by the putative leaders.  Generally group cohesion and effectiveness is a feeling
of its members, and having worked hard to reach this stage, changes to the
group composition are resisted.
<p>
<b>Stage 4: Peforming</b>.  The <em>rare</em> group reaches this stage,
where there is much flexibility and interdependence.  The members work well
together and trust enough for independent activity.  Group identity, loyalty
and morale are high, and roles and responsibilities change according to need
in a seamless way.  With a high degree of comfort all energy is directed to
the tasks in hand.
<p>
<b>Stage 5: Adjourning</b>.  There is completion and disengagement, both from
the tasks and membership.  They reflect upon accomplishments and consciously
move on.  Because there is a sense of loss, stage 5 has also been described
as <q>Deforming and Mourning.</q>

The classcial 1939 Hawthorne Studies made discoveries in social phenomena that have
led to management theory and practices improving group identity and cohesion in
the workplace.  McGregor's Theory Y shows criteria for an effective work group,
and Likert calls his highest form of management the parcipative group or System 4.

Conducting Effective Meetings
<p class="Para1">
A recent survey within our company found that executives report they waste
7.8 hours a week, or 2.3 months a year in unnecessary meetings.  So if
you are called to hold a meeting, the following considerations should be
made:
<ul>
<li>Is a meeting necessary?  Is there a compelling reason to have one?
It should have a purpose that all attending persons should relate to and
support, even if only to brainstorm or do team-building.  If the issue can
be addressed by informal gatherings or email, then opt for that.
<li>Meeting venue is important.  A conference room is appropriate in
many cases but not all.  Consider an off-site location, or perhaps an office
or even outside courtyard.
<li>Determine who should attend, whose job responsibilities are impacted by
the topic of discussion.  Also consider individuals who can provide input.
If attendance is not critical, a memo of the meeting's results may be sufficient.
</ul>
<p>
Some might feel slighted if not invited:  send them a notice explaining the
agenda or purpose and leave the decision to them whether to attend.
<ul>
<li>A written agenda or meeting outline with key issues is essential and
should be distributed with enough prep time for participants.
<li>Always start on time.  Latecomers will be less motivated to be punctual
at future meetings if the meetings do not run on schedule.  Also end
meetings on time:  if some issues are to continue discussion, offer
to continue or get a consensus about re-scheduling for a future meeing.
<li>Make sure notes are taken.  Record key points made.  These notes are
a reminder of action and provide info for those who did not attend.
Distribute the notes promptly.
<li>The views of everyone in attendance should be solicited and heard.
This is essential.  Use techniques to get everyone to speak.
<li>Stick to the agenda and stay on focus.  While there is a risk of
discouraging creativity, it may be useful to postpone discussion of a
very popular issue for a future meeting and allotting much time for it.
The goal is to meet the objectives of the present meeting.
<li>For particular projects, there is a beginning, middle, and end phase.
It may not be necessary to have participants at all meetings when they
are only involved with a particular phase.  Solicit advice from others
about how to make these meetings productive and effective.

On Becoming A Team Player
<p class="Para1">
Although <q>A</q> is the first letter in the alphabet, it has no greater
significance than other letters.  Being first is not always significant.
What is important is the interaction with other words and other letters of
alphabet to form meaning.  What is important is not individual, but in
them joining to form teams.
<p>
Teamwork is the cooperative process that allows ordinary people to achieve
extraordinary results.  Ants and bees are the ultimate team model we get from
nature.  Everyone works together or we all sink or swim together.
Teams have synergy.  Members share a common goal or vision and team can
accomplish what individuals cannot do alone.  Proficiency is achieved  as the
team works cooperatively and practices procedures on a daily basis.
For a surgical team, although certain individual have major and leading roles
as part of the team, the team is nonetheless required and the focus is the
patient.  The surgical team success model was illustrated by Navahandi (1997)
and in order to insure success:
<ol>
<li>First, the members of the team must be selected carefully for the complimentary
skills and expertise.
<li>Second, the team members need to focus on and be committed to a team goal.
</ol>
<p>
Analogies abound with other team types (musicians, sportsmen) and also with
industry.
<p>
Working as individuals, the narrow scope of knowledge and skills and experiences
of the individuals.  Individuals as members of the team fill in specific
elements that are not present.  The Sistine Chapel ceiling was not actually
done by Michelangelo alone:  he directed its production between himself and
13 other individuals.

A Team Effort
<p class="Para1">
Skills and training of the individual members are as important as just having
teams.  Over past 15 years a growing count of American companies have been
creating <b>self-managed work teams</b> (SMWTs).  They produce or deliver service
without direct supervision.  Companies willing to shed the <q>John Wayne</q> model
of leadership and adopt participatory management practices achieve productivity
gains that are incredible.  Nonetheless only 28% of Fortune 1000 companies had
only about one-fifth of employees arranged in SMWTs.  Things can go wrong with
teams, initiatives are abandoned, and diagnosing and solving a team's own
personal problems can be crucial.
<p>
Challenges about in a team without a clear rank leader.  Discipline and conduct
problems arise with some members.   Managers in HR can provide technical assistance
in rewriting policies and procedures that fit practices in areas like hiring,
peer-based performance evaluation, and employee discipline.  A director of
the center of employee services says her company has five <q>best managed
behaviors</q>:
<ol>
<li>shared accountability and transparency
<li>ongoing listening and learning
<li>coaching colleagues
<li>participatory management
<li>competitive benchmarking and continuous improvement
</ol>
<p>
More senior employees tend to be skeptical of the team concept, thinking of
it as a management fad that comes and goes.  They may resist or undermine the
concept.  Some employees say <q>I told you so</q> at the first sign of trouble.
Team spirit can be affected by failing to rally around an agreeable strategy.
<p>
An external facilitator has an indispensable role in such cases, bringing
objectivity and mediating a solution.  This would be less likely than use of
of internal staff.  Generally the quiet resistors appreciate the company investment
in outside expert help to see success.  There may be problems with senior leaders
of the firm in accepting the team concept as well.  They must be patient as SMWTs
will show their worth in the long-term while getting through initial or periodic
short-term difficulties.
<p>
In 12-18 months the novelty of teaming is said to wear off, according to
organizational pscyhologists, boredom sets in, and former managers are prone to
try to reassert authority.  Even members will cherry-pick some responsibilities
and kick problems back to managers for resolution.  Both HR managers and outside
facilitators can help overcome slumps by suggesting new areas for training,
mini projects the team can start, and new long term goals for the team to work
toward.  The team should be reminded of sticking to good habits and practices
that brought them success to this point.
<p>
After 5 years there is a convergence of problems the forms the classic brick
wall that organizataions hit.  For example, there are many new hires that might
be unfamiliar with team concept.  There is a simultaneous need for the team to
reassess its role in the company.  During reassessment the team asks if the
process makes sense and if it needs revision.
<p>
At some times teams face employees who say they are not paid to think, which
refers less to defiance of management and more to insecurity about doing tasks
that are not rote.  To get people used to the idea of SMWTs it is useful to
acquaint them with new behavioral expectations, such as required attendance at
daily meetings and voluntary info sharing.  Training on sustainability skills
helps to break down resistance from employees protecting turf.
<p>
Managers will feel displaced by the new team and their role may evolve over time.
They may do certain tasks related to the team and the level would depend on team
sophistication.
<p>
As opposed to those who are natural leaders, bullies may try to take charge.
They seize power through physical or psychological intimdation to hold followers
or dominate others.  Insisting on respectful dialogue and having a strong policy
against violence, aggression, threats and menacing gestures should discourage
domination by bullies and control by natural leaders.
<p>
<b>Virtual teams</b> are those whose members work physically at long distances from
one another and lean heavily on communication technology to do the job.  Networks
that crash can reduce confidence of members of a virtual team.
<p>
The <b>critical incident analysis</b> is a useful tool to diagnose problems of
the SMWT.  Such an analysis identifies problems, looks at contributing risk
factors, determines trigger events and looks at how members reacted to a situation.
It is valuable tool when a member is ready to withdraw from a team.

Facilitation Skills Manual
<p class="Para1">
Goals of manual are
<ul>
<li>provide facilitation skills development and assistance to aid that task
<li>help both new and current faculty understand the learning process
<li>offer suggestions for practical applications within classroom
</ul>
<p>
The manual is divided into three parts.  Section One shows the teaching
and learning model, the instructor's role, and learning theory overview.
Section 2 shows <q>break the ice</q> activities and techniques with new
groups.  Section 3 shows activities involved with presenting information,
generating learner involvement and participation.  Section 4 is about
visual aids use effectiveness.  Sec 5 helps plan workshops and lessons
effectively.
<p>
These learning processes are aimed at working adults as the students.
Essential features of the model are described.
<p>
<b>Active Learning</b>.  Students learn the material better when they more
actively involved.  Univ. Phoenix are intended as dynamic learning spaces.
Instructors are expected to be facilitators of learning and manage the learning
process by engaging learners in a variety of activities (lectures being just
one of them).
<b>Collaboration</b>.  One of the learning techniques is group formation which
leads to cooperation and collaboration.  Traditional pedagogy emphasizes
top-down, vertical transfer of information.  Adults benefit from learning
techniques involving collaboration.  In this way, adults teach and learn from
each other.
<p>
<b>Emphasis on Application and Relevance</b>.  Adults learn best when bridges
are built between the new knowledge and the learner's experience.  Practices
that encourage reflection and application are based on the recognition that
a learner's experience provides a context through which there is better preparation
to construct meaning from new information.  Students say they are able to apply
at work the next day what they have learned in class the night before.
<p>
Carl Rogers in <i>Freedom To Learn</i> (1969) set the following <q>Guidelines
for Facilitation</q>:
<ol>
<li>The facilitator is largely responsible for setting the initial mood
or climate of the program.
<li>The facilitator helps to elicit and clarify the purposes of the
individuals in the class, as well as the more general purposes of the group.
<li>The facilitator relies upon the desire of each student to implement
those purposes that have meaning to him/her as the motivational force
behind significant learning.
<li>The facilitator endeavors to organize and make easily available the
widest possible range of resources for learning.
<li>The facilitator regards himself/herself as a flexible resource to
be utilized by the group.
<li>As the classroom climate becomes established, the facilitator
is increasingly able to become a participant learner, a member of
the group, expressing his/her views as an individual.
<li>The facilitator takes the initiative in sharing himself/herself
with the group - feelings as well as thoughts - in ways that neither
demand nor impose, but represent simply a personal sharing which
the student may take or leave.
<li>Throughout the course, the facilitator remains alert to expressions
indicative of deep or strong feelings.
<li>The facilitator endeavors to recognize and accept his/her own
limitations as a facilitator of learning.
</ol>
<p>
Three distinct skills are involved in effective facilitation:
<ol>
<li>Ability to plan and reflect on learning obejctives, designing activities
that lead to their accomplishment, and assessing learning and adapting
instruction accordingly.
<li>Using interpersonal skills that create a positive and productive relationship
with students and motivate them to work independently.
<li>Ability to give clear and intellectually exciting presentations and lead
challenging discussions.
</ol>
<p>
There are seven major aspects posed as questions related to the goal of self-directed learning:
<ol>
<li>What is to be learned, both in general and specific terms?
<li>How is the learning to be used?
<li>How is the learning to be accomplished?
<li>How is the learning to be consolidated, demonstrated, or shared?
<li>How and by whom is the learning to be assessed?  What criteria are to be
used to determine that a satisfactory, or better, level of learning has been
achieved?
<li>How, if at all, is the learning to be documented?
<li>What is the time limit, or schedule, for the effort?
</ol>
<p>
Facilitators will have dual roles as diagnosticians and negotiators.
The student's interests and priorities must be identified and the learning
effort is fit into that.  Additionally the facilitator must produce a reciprocal
and trusting relationship with the student and negotiate with the student to
revise objectives set by the student that are unachievable.
<p>
In order to do all this, a necessary set of competencies must exist for
self-directed learning.  Learning is motivated towards acquiring knowledge
truly relevant to life experience, not mere presentation of a subject that has
no relevance.  A methodology for adult education is the analysis of experience,
since it is experience that is the richest resource in the learning of adults.
In constructing classroom learning events:
<ol>
<li>Gain and control attention
<li>Inform learners of the expected outcome
<li>Stimulate recall of relevant prerequisites
<li>Present new material
<li>Offer guidance for learning
<li>Provide feedback
<li>Appraise the performance of students
<li>Make transferability possible
<li>Ensure retention

<p>
Courses have been designed at the University to have objectives from which
clear outcomes occur.  Outcomes verify that the student has attained an
objective.  Students cannot produce outcomes without having first achieved
the learning objective.  How they do this depends on the ability of the faculty
member to produce the desired result.  <b>Grades</b> and <b>grading</b>
<q>ought to reflect the degree to which a student has mastered the objectives
of a particular assignment or course.</q>
<p>
<b>GETTING ACQUAINTED ACTIVITIES</b>.  Instructors might walk into the first
session and get students to introduce themselves and give reasons why they
took the course.  The first person is caught off-guard and the students to
follow are rehearsing their intros without paying attention to what is being
said.  Ice-breaking activites should not put the student on the spot.
Described below are activities useful in the first class and introductory
sessions.  The instructor will actually show students how to get acquainted
and this will be a learning situation they can put to use immediately.

Applying The Science of Learning to the University and Beyond
<p class="Para1">
Many people believe that college professors have little do when class is not
underway.  They realize that research and committee work are other aspects of the
job but secondary to it.  They also believe that we understand how people learn
and that we apply this in teaching.
<p>
While biology is the scientific basis for medicine, cognitive psychology is not
the scientific basis of education (Nora Newcombe).  A meeting of several
teachers from various disciplines came up with empirically validated principles.
These can be applied to various teaching environments:  distance education with
online components, learning from texts, laboratory and classroom instruction,
and learning in informal settings.
<p>
<b>First and Only Goal:  Teach for Long-Term Retention and Transfer</b>.
Are colleges and universities all about the transfer of learning.  Underlying
rationale for any kind of formal instruction is assumption that knowledge,
skills, and attitudes learned in this setting are recalled accurately.
However, teaching for assessement given in the same context of learning is
different than teaching for long-term retention and transfer.
<ol>
<li>The single most important variable in promoting long-term retention and
transfer is <q>practice at retrieval.</q>  Learners need to generate responses
with minimal cues, repeated over time with varied applications so that recall
becomes fluent and more likely to occur across different contexts and content
domains.  Simply stated information that is frequently retrieved becomes more
retrievable.  In cognitive psychology, memory trace strength for any information
that is recalled grows stronger with each retrieval.
<p>
Practice retrieving reinforces memory.  Altering context for retrieval aids
the transfer of learning.  The act of teaching for example is a retrieval practice
concept.
<p>
Another finding is that <em>spaced</em> practice is preferable to <em>massed</em>
practice.  Spacing intervals that becomes increasingly longer between retrieval
instances is also good, but not so that retrieval accuracy (recall) suffers.
For example, one day after initial learning. the 2nd exam a few days after the
first, the 3rd exam a week after the second, and the fourth a month after the
third.
<li><b>Varying learning conditions makes it harder for students but results in
better learning</b>.  This is based on principle that key ideas have <q>multiple
retrieval cues</q> and are available in memory.
<li><b>Learning is generally enhanced when learners are required to take
information that is presented in one format and <q>re-represent</q> it in an
alternative format</b>.  Information is processed via a visuospatial and
auditory-verbal set of channels.  Learners integrate the information better.
<li><b>What and how much is learned in any situation depends heavily on  prior
knowledged and experience</b>.  <q>Construction of knowledge</q> (a psychologist's
term) is the new meaning a learner creates on what is already known.
Best predictor of what is learned at completion of lesson, course, program
of study is what learner thinks and knows at start of experience.
<li><b>Learning is influenced by both our students' and our own epistemologies</b>.
Academic motivation is related to underlying epistemological beliefs about learning
itself and about how learning works.
<li><b>Experience alone is a poor teacher</b>.  As an example a physician might
believe an intervention worked when a patient improved after a treatment, but
most patients might improve without the treatment anyway.  In some cases when the
patient does not improve even with the treatment, the physician dismisses it
as the patient being <q>too sick</q> to have benefited from the intervention.
<li><b>Lectures work well for learning assessed with recognition tests, but work
badly for understanding</b>.  Traditional lectures in introducty college courses
have a lecture with teacher giving notes while students take notes.   This works
only to produce learners who repeat and recognize information presented.  It
does not promote in-depth understanding.  The missing element here is the student
being required to assimilate the knowledge by interpreting it, by having to
put it to use in some way that is not just presented as a theoretical concept.
Multiple choice tests only tap in lower level cognitive processes, giving cues
to them to repeat back the course material.  The student may be unable to
recognize an application of the concept outside the course material.
<li><b>The act of remembering itself influences what learners will and will
not remember in the future</b>.  Asking learners to recall particular bits of
information they have been taught leads to <q>selective forgetting</q> of that
information they were <em>not</em> asked to recall.  Even when students do well on
a test soon taken after initial learning, they perform less well on a later test
after a longer retention interval.  Although recall is tested at different points,
each of these works according to standard <q>mamory trace</q> theory of how
one remembers and strengthens memory traces, and weakens (or fails to strengthen)
others.  Instructors are usually not aware of this effect and create inadvertently
activities that cause students to forget the information they want to retain.
In contrast frequent testing leads to overconfidence for learners who believe
wrongly that retention will be better than actualy is.
<li><b>Less is more, especially when we think about long-term retention and
transfer</b>.  Quite a few texts in social and natural sciences weigh as much
as the students who carry them around.  There is a balance between how much and
how well a subject is learned.  Careful choices on how much content is used must
be made.

Learning Team Handbook
<p class="Para1">
There are several reasons that students learn better in groups than as individuals.
Several characteristics hold true of effective learning teams.
<ul>
<li>They are <b>small</b>, made up of 3-6 members, but work best when they are
four or five members in a team.
<li>For Univ. Phoenix courses, they are formed at the <b>beginning</b> of the
course and <b>meet weekly</b> to study together and complete group assignments
and projects.
<li>When any team size is changed by attrition, students remaining in a smaller
group may need to be merged with another group to balance size.
<li>A team member may be expelled from a team and may need placement in another
group:  in this instance, the student may be required to petition membership in
another team.  A student may have to discuss with an Academic Counselor options
when there is failure to join a learning team, since participation is required
for submitting assignments and earning grades.
<li>For a typical three semeter-credit undergraduate course with five workshops,
teams meet between workshops for 5 hours per week.  For the graduate courses
with six workshops, meetings between workshops are four hours per week.
<li><b>Meeting Locations</b>.  For face-to-face meetings (typical), the location
must be conducive to learning.  Acceptable sites are Univ. of Phoenix classrooms
and study rooms; local, city or state libraries; university or college libraries;
company or corporate training or meeting rooms.  Student residences or other
locations are acceptable if they meet the following criteria:
<ol>
<li>Individual seating for each student
<li>A desk or flat writing surface for each student
<li>Adequate lighting to ensure the ability of each student to read
<li>A quiet environment with no ambient noise like loud music
<li>Adequate temperature control to allow for comfort of each student
<li>Electrical and phone service to allow student access to University's library
services and other online resources
<li>Adequate restroom facilities for both genders
<li>Adequate parking for convenience
</ol>
</ul>
<p>
In the first workshop facilitators give students time to form Learning Teams
and exchange contact information.  They also schedule the first meeting time
and place.  Teams with members who live close to each other may be convenient
for students.  Students beginning the course may have been students in a
previous course and worked as members of the same team, so it may be suitable for
them to form another team.
<p>
Team composition/membership should not be static.  It is useful for teams to disband
and form teams with new/different members in order to be exposed to other points
of view, and for members to learn new roles.
<p>
Teams must create a <b>charter</b> at the first meeting, and the charter
is from the University's template.  The members prepare it by collaboration
and submit to instructor at the 2nd workshop.  The charter specifies mission
or task, sets goals, and secures commitments to the achievement of the goals,
makes plans, and allocates resources.  It is competency related to workplace
success.  Also in re-forming new teams, new charters are developed so that
students do not get the idea that the process is rote or perfunctory.
<p>
Teams keep a log of activity, and this includes scheduling time, duration,
and place of the next meeting.  The log documents the attendance of members.
<p>
<b>Grading</b>.  The Learning Team assignments and projects/processes make up
no more than one-third of the course grade.  Grading is to evaluate the project
content/structure itself and to assess the degree to which each team member
contributed.
<p>
<b>Conflicts in Teams</b>.  Managing interpersonal difficulties and resolving
disputes is a primary objective.  This is because in the real world workplace
a team setting is probable.  Generally:
<ol>
<li>Conflicts should be managed within the team itself just as would happen in
the workplace.
<li>Team charter preparation processes are all about members practicing
conflict management and dispute resolution in a proactive way by encouraging
identification of potential conflicts beforehand and agreeing together on a plan
for dealing with those that arise.
<li>When conflicts occur, members need to look at the Team Charter first and
deal with the dispute, as outlined.  If team members are unable to work it out,
they can contact the faculty member for additional coaching and feedback.
<li>The faculty member can enforce an action, but might want to do so in
consultation with the Campus College Chair or Director of Academic Affairs.

Making Oral Presentations:  Some Practical Guidelines and Suggestions
<p class="Para1">
In business the effective oral communication can be the difference between
an idea getting accepted or not.  Ideas and results of research will not
be their message:  the message must be presented properly.  The <q>marketing</q>
of a presenter's ideas is as important as the ideas themselves.  In fact,
many executives in all industries are too busy to read detailed written
reports and will make judgments based on an oral presentation (at least
partly).  Organization in speech is reflective of organization regarding
all aspects of the project.
<p>
<b>Preparation</b>.  Good talks will not happen without it.  There are
probably four main phases of preparation:
<ol>
<li>Activities before the talk that set the stage
<li>During the talk:  activities including issues such as (a) organization of
materials; (b) visuals used; (c) oral communication issues
<li>concluding activities, rounding off the presentation
<li>post-presentation activities emphasizing the material, e.g. sending or
distributing summaries
</ol>
<p>
Ad-libbed presentations are so rare that most experienced speakers will want
to avoid them.  Some are sufficiently knowledgeable to be engaging speakers
and present material they have.  Preparation ensures that no critical points
are missed.  More inexperienced speakers absolutely require preparation.
Part of that preparation is knowing the audience:  what do they know about
the topic, what are they wanting to know from the talk, what do they need to
know?  In addition the speaker should find out the surroundings of the venue.
If possible, inspect the room ahead of time where it will be held...look at
the layout.  Try to test the systems of sound, overhead projection, and
computers.  Should multimedia content require CDs or USB drives?  At the very
least, put questions to those who know the venue.   Try to be overprepared
with respect your material content...anticipate problems in which one method
is not available, but you have an alternative at the ready.

Ten Simple Rules for Making Good Oral Presentations
<p class="Para1">
These rules apply broadly across disciplines.  Good presentations will do more
to disseminate the work and give it more attenion than might be found in the
written work.
<p>
<b>Rule 1:  Talk to the Audience</b>.  This means to prepare the talk in
a way that is targeted to its listeners.  Know who your audience is.  What
are their backgrounds, level of knowledge about the subject.  The topic should
be something they want to hear.  Talking to the audience is not strictly about
facing them, although eye contact establishes an intimacy and comfort in the
presentation.
<p>
<b>Rule 2: Less is More</b>.  Trying to say too much is a fault of the
inexperienced speaker:  it is need to prove to the audience that they know
a lot.  But the main message gets lost, and question time is curtailed.
Knowledge of the material will be revealed more during a Q &amp; A.  If
there are no questions, it probably means that other rules were not followed;
the talk was either incomprehensible or trite.  Too much material also means
you are trying to talk too quickly, and that creates a lost message.
<p>
<b>Rule 3: Only Talk When You Have Something To Say.</b>  Do not be overzealous
about what you think you will have available to present when the times comes.
Research never goes as fast as you would like.  Do not dwell on a lot of
uninteresting preliminary material.
<p>
<b>Rule 4: Make The Take-Home Message Persistent.</b>  If an audience member
can list a week later three points you made in the talk, then you were
effective.  However, they should remember the key points, not just three
points.  In that case the emphasis was wrong.  If they cannot even recall
three points, that too is a problem.
<p>
<b>Rule 5: Be Logical.</b>  The presentation is a story, with beginning, middle
and end.  This is the logical flow, with the end being the big finish to
repeat the main idea.
<p>
<b>Rule 6: Treat the Floor as a Stage</b>.  Try to be entertaining without
overdoing it and also knowing your limits.  Do not be humorous if you are not
humorous by nature.  If you are not good at telling anecdotes, then don't
try it.  Good entertainers will increase their chances of making Rule 4 work.
<p>
<b>Rule 7: Practice and Time Your Presentation</b>.  A rule that should
especially be followed by less experienced presenters.  Be careful about
deviating from the practiced presentation, and do not wander off in presenting
material that you know less about than the audience does.  Use visual cues
to keep you flowing the way you practiced and avoid running off on tangents.
<p>
<b>Rule 8: Use Visuals Sparingly But Effectively</b>.  Visuals are not
so much used for the audience as they are the speaker in order to prompt
the talk.  Some data cannot be explained just orally, but must be presented
as a graph or plot.  The usual rule is that if you have more than one visual
for each minute of the talk, you have too many and/or will run over time.
Some visuals can be shown and passed over quickly, while others will be
held up for a required lengthy time.  Don't read from visuals.  Bullet points
should not be sentences, but short sentence fragments containing keywords.
<p>
<b>Rule 9:  Review Audio and/or Video of Your Presentations</b>.  Try to
obtain a recording (video, if at all possible) of your presentation.  It
will quickly reveal to you how you can improve your presentation.  You will
identify bad habits.  The struggle will be to break those bad habits.  But
that will come with practice and working hard.
<p>
<b>Rule 10: Provide Appropriate Acknowledgements</b>.  Give enough time
for acknowledgements without overdoing it.  Give credit where credit is due.
Acknowledgement need not always come at the end:  it can be done at the
beginning or at the point where a particular contribution is noted.

They Teach, We Listen:  Helping Students Create Effective Oral Presentations
<p class="Para1">
A great many oral presentations are borning, tangential and a waste of
precious time only even though the topic might be quite interesting.
Quite a few students need help with their speaking skills more than with
their writing.  Students dread oral presentations because they  are few and
far between and thus have little practice, while writing assignments are
a constant activity with which they are more comfortable.
<p>
The stages of creation for oral and written presentations is the same however:
invention, organization, and delivery.  The problems in oral presentations
are the same with the written type:  they could have a weak structure (lack
clear introduction, organizing idea, conclusion, supporting evidence) or
there are too many undeveloped ideas, or the order of presentation is
chronological rather than thematic.
<p>
With speeches, their effectiveness is about one-third on content and two-thirds
on delivery.  They need more redundancy and clarity of structure than do
essays.  This clarity is achieved by a strong reliance on forecasting,
signposting, and recursivity.  Studies show that listeners retain only
20-30% of what is heard, so repetition is crucial to making sure that the
main point is driven home.
<p>
Some of the things learned are that students will communicate more effectively
orally when they are also doing so in writing, so improving their ability to
write good essays helps.
<p>
Also oral skills were strengthened when they think backwards from ends to
means.  Effective and engaging presentations should be simple and snappy,
to the point.  Delivery should be natural and conversational, and relevant
to the listeners.  Those who will prepare talks should:
<ul>
<li>brainstorm topics
<li>find the purpose of speaking:  to persuade, inform, entertain, demonstrate
knowledge, etc.
<li>decide on what the audience most needs to hear
<li>work out a clear and coherent argument
<li>select the main points, and provide the relevant evidence
<li>in the conclusion, make sure the main points are re-iterated
</ul>
<p>
In a short presentation, don't cover more than one or two main ideas.
<p>
After putting together enough content, then it is time to arrange it for the
delivery, including dropping the excess.  An element of oral presentations
is that they should be rehearsed, since it is a performance, and performances
benefit from rehearsal.  The information is now solidly in memory, so now
it must be presented with the right pace.  Speakers should learn to avoid
annoying non-verbal fluencies and use of verbalized pauses (<q>um,</q>
<q>you know,</q> <q>really</q>) that distract listeners.
<p>
Facility in public speaking has fallen to very low levels because practice
and training no longer are a priority in the American university or high
school.  We need to return to the era where it was done.

Become a better teacher: Five steps in the direction of critical thinking
<p class="Para1">
In planning one's professional development the question should be asked whether
the development activity improves student learning.  Teachers must connect
their improvement to student improvement.  One strategy cited in professional
development literature for improving teaching and student learning is enhancing
critical thinking skills.  A 5-step framework is presented that can be implemented
in any teaching or training setting moving learners toward critical thinking.
This compares the lecture-based course to an active-learning environment which
is more enjoyable and effective.  One problem with lecture-based teaching is
that it is rather passive form of learning.  It does little to stimulate critical
thinking though.  Critical thinking theory started mostly with Bloom's identification
of six level in the cognitive domain, each related to higher level of cognitive
ability.  Knowledge was about the rote memorization of information.
Comprehension is about relating and organizing previously learned information.
Application is about implementing the information according to rule or principle
in a specific situation.  Analysis is about critical thinking focused on parts
and their functionality in the whole.  Synthesis is critical thinking focused
on manipulating the parts to form a new and original whole.  Evaluation is
critical thinking focused on valuing and making judgments based on information.
For this paper critical thinking is considered to take place in the
Analysis-Evaluation range of the taxonomy.
<p>
While teachers encourage critical thinking, few know how to be systematic in
facilitating it.  A 5-step model is presented.
<p>
<b>Step One: What They Should Know</b>.  Teachers should first identify key
learning objectives that recognize what students should know when they complete
the course.  These objectives along with their activities and assessments must
include those connect to the higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy.  Well written
objectives should include a behavioral verb appropriate for chosen level of
the taxonomy.  The Knowledge level requires an answer with simple recall of
facts.  At this level behavioral verbs include who, what, describe, state, and
list.  Comprehension requires answer demonstrating understanding of information:
verbs includes summarize, explain, paraphrase, compare, and contrast.  Application
requires an answer demonstrating an ability to use information, concepts, and
theories in new situations:  the verbs include apply, construct, solve, discover,
and show.  Analysis is an answer demonstrating an ability to see patterns and
classify information, concepts and theories into component parts:  verbs include
examine, classify, categorize, differentiate, and analyze.  Synthesis requires
an answer demonstrating ability to relate knowledge from multiple areas to
create new or original work:  verbs are combine, construct, create, role play,
and suppose.  Evaluation requires an answer demonstrating ability to judge
evidence based on reasoned argument:  verbs are assess, criticize, recommend,
predict, and evaluate.  Combining well-written objectives with well-written
questions move the learner to critical thinking.
<p>
<b>Step Two:  Participation Through Questioning</b>.  Questions posed to the
student take the student out of the passive position to an active one.  Teacher
questions have the greatest impact.  Teachers should plan or prepare questions
since the level of preparation and thought challenges students even more.
Questioning can be thought of as two types.  Convergent questioning looks for
one or more very specific correct answers.  Divergent questioning looks for a
wide variety of correct answers.  Convergent questions go to Bloom's Knowledge,
Comprehension, and Application levels; divergent questions apply to Bloom's
Analysis, Synthesis and Evaluation levels.
<p>
Questions should be brief and concise, ready to be re-phrased if necessary,
and elicit additional responses.  Questions might be better targeted to wide
group discussion, rather than one-on-one.  Instructors are also advised to
facilitate rather than lead discussion.  Teachers must be prepared for different
personality types emerging into a wide-ranging discussion, from the shy to the
lazy to the overly talkative to students wanting to challenge the teacher.
Choosing the right discussion model is a must:  a more focused approach
works for natural sciences and engineering, being able to cover large amounts of
material, separating major from minor concepts.  For social sciences and
humanities there is seldom one correct answer or approach, so a wider range
discussion works.  Continuing to refine the question in style and content is
important.  Q&amp;A and discussion should guide the student to the answer or
to a resource providing additional explanation.  Redirecting questions from
students to the class also involves the group; sometimes a question can introduce
a related topic.  Learning is about asking questions in the first place:  getting
the information is a response to a question in nearly every case.  Teachers
ask questions of the student, and students must learn to ask questions of
themselves.
<p>
<b>Step Three: Practice What You Assess</b>.  Active learning is basically the
process of getting the student more involved in activities that cause them to
think and shows that they retain knowledge to a greater degree than a passive
technique.
