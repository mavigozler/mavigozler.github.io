<h2>Project Charter</h2>
<p>This is the "vision" document and should contain following:</p>
<ul>
   <li>name of project</li>
   <li>purpose of project and business case</li>
   <li>project team, including sponsor, key business stakeholders</li>
   <li>project approach, with technologies chosen and why</li>
   <li>project goal date & high-level milestones</li>
   <li>cost assumptions based on research</li>
</ul>
<p>
"Final discovery"
</p>
This is more detailed research to have information to put together
the scope and plan for the project. This can take from 1-3 months
for a $500K-$1M project; for a $5-20M range project, 6-12 months.
For a $250-500K project, 6-8 weeks. For < $250K, a month or less.
<p>
<p>      
This work will produce the "scope document" and "business requirements
document (high-level)". It is called Scope of Work by vendors. The
points addressed are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>What will specifically be done?</li>
   <li>System/application features and functions</li>
   <li>Features and functions excluded from work</li>
   <li>Who is doing what: roles</li>
   <li>Dependencies---this is part of risks</li>
   <li>Order of doing things (part of dependencies)</li>
   <li>Fitting a timeline of activity</li>
   <li>Unknowns and risks</li>
   <li>the budget</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is the "map", but not a detailed plan.
</p>

<b>"The plan for the plan"</b><br>
Consider a project to roll out a new website with new CMS, involving a 
data migration and a integration to back end with customer and financial data. 
Multiple teams are involved. These are the elements of the plan for this project:      
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Hosting
      % identify hosting partner
      % contract, licensing, negotiations
      % plan for integrations
      % test for performance
      % dependencies - multiple, need integration/performance testing
      % timeline:
         # July-Aug: plan identify
         # Sept: environment ready
         # Dec: load testing, performance testing
   </li>
   <li>Content Entry
      % what need over and above CMS content entry interface?
      % workflow
         # approvals
      % taxonomy and tagging
      % dependencies - content editing and entry, UAT
      % timeline:
         # July/Aug: requirements
         # Sept/Oct: build
         # Nov: UAT  
   </li>
   <li>Search</li>
   <li>Content Pages and Features</li>
   <li>Integrations</li>
   <li>Back-end System</li>
   <li>Data Migration</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of the remaining sections had some of the same detail. What this
multi-level outline list is basically a brainstorm. it was refined later.
</p>
<p>
This was a one-person listing by an
experienced person. Normally a team will be involved in the brainstorm.
Questions to be asked are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>what are the components of the project: these are the highest level</li>
   <li>Now try to itemize at the 2nd level</li>
   <li>what dependencies are there between the components?</li>
   <li>When would each component need to be completed to achieve the goal date?</li>
</ul>
<p>
This meeting should involve asking the question "what else?" several times.
Write everything down. It can be discarded later.
</p>

<h2>Project Scope & Plan (definitions, documentation)</h2>
<p>
   At this point of the project, detailed business requirements and the "plan for the plan"
   should be on paper. Scope is about the project deliverables
</p>
<ul>
   <li>project summary
      taken from charater, a paragraph or two, business case for project
   </li>
   <li>project deliverables
      identified in breakout meetings and plan for the plan notes
   </li>
   <li>what is out of scope
      important to identify this so stakeholders dont make assumptions
   </li>
   <li>constraints
      this is a "fixed object" that is not going to change. This would be like
      rules/laws/regulations of government affecting the project
   </li>
   <li>assumptions
      examples are when customer accepts project delivery date, when vendor
      can deliver their part by a certain date, project decisions not overturned
      by other business decisions, some piece of tech works as advertised
   </li>
   <li>risks
      examples are dependencies on 3rd parties work/tech, absolute date affecting
      a project (schedule risk)
   </li>
   <li>timeline
      this is either a bottom-up or top-down dtermination. If business is flexible,
      the team determines the timeline in bottom-up fashion. But when business
      sets a firm date, the timeline is top-down.
   </li>
   <li>budget

   </li>
   <li>success metrics
      This part includes discussing return on investment. Metrics are called
      key performance indicators (KPIs).
   </li>
</ul>
