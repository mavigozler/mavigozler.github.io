b) The reactant with the smallest coefficient in the balanced chemical equation.
*c) The reactant that determines the maximum amount of product that can be formed.
d) The reactant with the largest molar mass used in the reaction.
... The limiting reactant is completely consumed, thereby stopping the reaction and dictating the theoretical yield.

2. In a titration, what is the **equivalence point**?
a) The point where the volume of the titrant is exactly 25.00 mL.
*b) The point where the moles of the titrant added are exactly equal to the moles of the substance being analyzed in the flask.
c) The volume measurement on the buret after the titration has finished.
d) The point where the reaction mixture begins to change color.
... The equivalence point is reached when the stoichiometrically required amount of titrant has been added to fully react with the analyte.

3. A chemical reaction that releases heat into the surroundings is classified as **exothermic**. What is the sign of the **change in enthalpy** ($\Delta H$) for such a reaction?
a) Positive ($\Delta H > 0$)
*b) Negative ($\Delta H < 0$)
c. Zero ($\Delta H = 0$)
d. The sign depends on the pressure, not the temperature change.
... A negative $\Delta H$ signifies that the chemical system is losing energy (releasing heat) to the surroundings, which is the definition of an exothermic process.

4. Consider the thermochemical equation:
    $$\text{CH}_4(g) + 2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \quad \Delta H = -890. \text{ kJ}$$
    The enthalpy change ($\Delta H$) value of $-890. \text{ kJ}$ represents the heat change for which specific condition?
a) The heat absorbed when $1\text{ mole}$ of $\text{CO}_2$ is produced.
b) The heat released when $1\text{ gram}$ of $\text{CH}_4$ reacts with $2\text{ grams}$ of $\text{O}_2$.
c) The average energy released by the system over the duration of the entire experiment.
*d) The heat released when $1\text{ mole}$ of $\text{CH}_4$ reacts with $2\text{ moles}$ of $\text{O}_2$ at constant pressure.
e) The heat required to break all the bonds in the reactants.
... The $\Delta H$ value is the specific amount of heat exchanged (released, in this case) when the reaction occurs according to the exact molar ratios shown in the balanced equation at constant pressure.

5. What is the most common reason why the **percent yield** for a reaction is typically less than $100\%$?
a) The theoretical yield calculation failed to account for the molar mass of the product.
*b) The reaction vessel absorbs some of the product, causing an apparent loss.
c) The mass of the limiting reactant was calculated incorrectly before the reaction began.
d) The actual yield is always larger than the theoretical yield due to impurities.
e) The reaction itself is too fast, preventing complete conversion.
... The most common reasons for an actual yield being lower than the theoretical yield are physical losses, such as product adhering to glassware or being lost during transfer and purification.

6. If $3.0\text{ moles}$ of $\text{O}_2$ are consumed, how many moles of $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ are produced according to the following balanced equation?

a) $1.0\text{ moles}$
b) $4.5\text{ moles}$
*c $2.0\text{ moles}$

... **Calculation:** $3.0\text{ mol } \text{O}_2 \times \frac{2\text{ mol } \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3}{3\text{ mol } \text{O}_2} = 2.0\text{ mol } \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$
* **Rationale:** The mole ratio from the balanced equation is $3\text{ mol } \text{O}_2$ to $2\text{ mol } \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$.

a) $1.17\%$
*b) $85.2\%$
c) $117.4\%$
d) $2.3\text{ g}$
e). $15.5\text{ g}$
... **Calculation:** $$\text{Percent Yield} = \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100\% = \frac{13.2\text{ g}}{15.5\text{ g}} \times 100\% \approx 85.2\%$$
... The percent yield is the ratio of the actual mass recovered to the maximum mass theoretically possible, multiplied by $100\%$.

8. The combustion of methane has a $\Delta H$ of $-890.\text{ kJ}$ for one mole of $\text{CH}_4$ reacted. If only $0.25\text{ moles}$ of $\text{CH}_4$ is combusted, what is the **enthalpy change** ($\Delta H$) for the process?
    $$\text{CH}_4(g) + 2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \quad \Delta H = -890.\text{ kJ}$$
a) $+222.5\text{ kJ}$
b) $-890.\text{ kJ}$
c) $-445.\text{ kJ}$
*d) $-222.5\text{ kJ}$
... **Calculation:** $\Delta H$ is extensive. $0.25\text{ mol } \text{CH}_4 \times \frac{-890.\text{ kJ}}{1\text{ mol } \text{CH}_4} = -222.5\text{ kJ}$  The enthalpy change must be scaled proportionally to the amount of reactant. Since $0.25\text{ moles}$ is one-quarter of the amount in the equation, the heat released is also one-quarter of the value.

9. In gas stoichiometry calculations, what is the molar volume (volume of $1\text{ mole}$) of any ideal gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (**STP**)?
a) $1.0\text{ L}$
b) $6.022 \times 10^{23}\text{ L}$
*c) $22.4\text{ L}$
d) $8.314\text{ L}\cdot\text{kPa}/\text{mol}\cdot\text{K}$
... At STP ($0^\circ\text{C}$ and $1\text{ atm}$), one mole of any ideal gas occupies a volume of $22.4\text{ L}$.

10. A chemist needs to know the number of moles of solute in a $0.400\text{ M}$ solution. If the volume of the solution is $300.\text{ mL}$, how many moles of solute are present? ($1\text{ M} = 1\text{ mol}/\text{L}$)
a) $120.\text{ moles}$
b) $0.00120\text{ moles}$
*c) $0.120\text{ moles}$
d) $0.750\text{ moles}$
... First, convert volume: $300.\text{ mL} = 0.300\text{ L}$.
    $$\text{Moles} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.400\text{ M} \times 0.300\text{ L} = 0.120\text{ moles}$$
    Moles are calculated by multiplying molarity (moles/liter) by the volume in liters.

11. In the balanced equation:  
    \(\text{2 H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{2 H}_2\text{O}\)  
    How many moles of water are produced when 3 moles of oxygen react completely?  
a) 3  
*b) 6  
c) 2  
d) 1
... The chemical reaction equation shows reactant and product compound(s), and the coefficients show the ratios by which they are consumed or produced. The question asks how much product \(\text{2 H}_2\text{O}\) is made with a given amount of reactant \(\text{O}_2\). The reaction shows that for every one mole of \(\text{O}_2\), 2 moles of \(\text{2 H}_2\text{O}\) are produced. Since 3 moles \(\text{O}_2\) are provided, then \(3 \text{ O}_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol H}_2\text{O}}}{1 \text{ mol O}_2} = 6 \text{ mol H}_2\text{O}\)

12. Which of the following steps is **necessary** when converting grams of a substance to moles?  
*a) Divide grams by molar mass
b) Multiply grams by molar mass
c) Multiply grams by Avogadro’s number
d) Divide grams by atomic number
... The molar mass of a substance (compound, molecule, element) is the means by which to convert mass (grams) to amount in moles and back again. The units of the molar mass are \(\frac{\text{grams}}{\text{moles}}\) or \(\frac{\text{g}}{\text{mol}}\). Therefore, since the units grams must be canceled, the mass (grams) must be divided by grams per mole, which is the units of the molar mass.

13. Which laboratory technique is most commonly used to determine the concentration of an unknown acid solution by reacting it with a base of known concentration?  
a) Filtration  
b) Distillation  
*c) Titration  
d) Evaporation
... Titration typically make use of strong acids or bases as titrants, which is the solution put in the buret whose concentration has been established ("standardized") and whose volume needs to be very accurately determined for making the calculation 

14. At STP, 1.00 mole of an ideal gas what volume?
a) 1.0 L  
*b) 22.4 L  
c) 12.0 L  
d) 6.02 L
... If this value has not been memorized (like Avogadro's Number = \(6.022 \times 10^(23)\) the volume of one mole of ideal gas, it can be derived from the ideal gas law equation, \(PV = nRT\). Since STP has a \(T = 0\degree\text{C} = 273\text{ K}\) and \(P = 1 \text{atm}\) and using \(R = 0.08205 \text{ L atm mol}^(-1)\text{ K}^(-1)\), then \(V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{(1.00 \text{ mol})(0.08205 \text{ L atm mol}^(-1)\text{ K}^(-1))(273 \text{ K})}{1 \text{ atm}} = 22.4 \text{ L}\)

***

#### **Question 4**
The concentration of hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution is typically represented as the concentration of the hydronium ion, $[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+]$, rather than $[\text{H}^+]$. What is the primary reason for this preference?
A. The $\text{H}^+$ ion is larger and its concentration is harder to measure experimentally.

## 🧪 Chapter 13: Chemical Kinetics and Equilibrium Practice Quiz

Here are 10 questions covering the concepts from your Chapter 13 study guide, including three calculation-based questions and two questions with five answer choices.

***

#### **Question 1: Collision Theory (Conceptual)**
For a chemical reaction to be successful and convert reactants to products, collision theory requires that the colliding particles satisfy which two criteria?
A. High concentration and high temperature.
B. Equal kinetic energy and opposite charges.
C. Sufficient energy and correct geometric orientation.
D. Low activation energy and the presence of a catalyst.

* **Correct Answer:** C. A successful reaction requires the colliding particles to have energy greater than or equal to the **activation energy** ($E_a$) and to be oriented correctly to allow bond breaking and formation.

***

#### **Question 2: Potential Energy Diagram (Conceptual)**
A potential energy diagram (Reaction Progress Curve) shows that the **products** have a **lower** potential energy than the **reactants**. Which statement is true regarding this reaction?
A. The activation energy ($E_a$) is very large.
B. The reaction is **endothermic**, and $\Delta H$ is positive.
C. The reaction is **exothermic**, and $\Delta H$ is negative.
D. The reaction rate will be slow regardless of the temperature.

* **Correct Answer:** C. Since the potential energy decreases from reactants to products, energy is released into the surroundings, meaning the reaction is **exothermic** ($\Delta H < 0$).

***

#### **Question 3: Activated Complex (Conceptual)**
In a potential energy diagram, the peak of the "hump" represents the **activated complex**. Which of the following best describes this species?
A. It is the final product of the reaction.
B. It is a stable, unreactive intermediate that must be consumed before products form.
C. It is the catalyst for the reaction, which is not consumed.
D. It is an unstable, energetically excited **transition state** structure that either proceeds to products or reverts to reactants.
E. It is the substance whose concentration determines the reaction rate.

* **Correct Answer:** D. The activated complex is the highest-energy point along the reaction coordinate, representing a transient, unstable structure in the process of forming or breaking bonds.

***

#### **Question 4: Reaction Rate Factors (Conceptual)**
Increasing the **concentration** of reactants in an aqueous solution will generally increase the reaction rate. This is primarily due to an increase in which factor?
A. The number of moles of products being formed.
B. The **collision frequency** between reactant particles.
C. The potential energy of the products.
D. The activation energy ($E_a$).

* **Correct Answer:** B. Higher concentration means more particles are packed into the same volume, which increases the likelihood (frequency) of successful collisions.

***

#### **Question 5: Catalysis (Conceptual)**
A catalyst affects the rate of a chemical reaction by:
A. Increasing the potential energy ($\Delta H$) between reactants and products.
B. Increasing the average kinetic energy of the reactant molecules.

* **Correct Answer:** C. Catalysts speed up reactions by lowering the energy barrier ($E_a$), allowing more collisions to be successful without being permanently consumed or affecting $\Delta H$.

***

#### **Question 6: Equilibrium Expression ($K$) Calculation (Calculation)**
Write the equilibrium constant expression ($K_c$) for the following reversible reaction, and calculate the value of $K_c$ given the equilibrium concentrations:

D. $K_c = \frac{[\text{SO}_3]^2}{[\text{SO}_2]^2[\text{O}_2]} \text{, } K_c = 2.5$

* **Correct Answer:** C.
    * **Expression:** $K_c = \frac{[\text{SO}_3]^2}{[\text{SO}_2]^2[\text{O}_2]}$ (products over reactants, raised to stoichiometric coefficients).
    * **Calculation:** $K_c = \frac{(0.25)^2}{(0.50)^2(0.050)} = \frac{0.0625}{(0.25)(0.050)} = \frac{0.0625}{0.0125} = 5.0$

#### **Question 7: Le Chatelier’s Principle (Concentration Stress) (Conceptual)**
Consider the following equilibrium:
$$\text{PCl}_3 (g) + \text{Cl}_2 (g) \rightleftharpoons \text{PCl}_5 (g)$$
If a large amount of $\text{PCl}_5 (g)$ (product) is suddenly added to the container, in which direction will the equilibrium shift to restore balance?
A. Shift to the right (forward reaction) to produce more $\text{PCl}_5$.
B. Shift to the left (reverse reaction) to consume the added $\text{PCl}_5$.
C. There will be no shift, as adding a product does not affect the equilibrium.
D. The equilibrium constant ($K$) will increase.

* **Correct Answer:** B. Increasing the concentration of a product is a **stress**. The system counteracts this by favoring the **reverse reaction** to consume the excess product and produce reactants ($\text{PCl}_3$ and $\text{Cl}_2$).

***

#### **Question 8: Le Chatelier’s Principle (Pressure Stress) (Conceptual)**
Consider the exothermic reaction:
$$\text{N}_2 (g) + 3\text{H}_2 (g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3 (g)$$
If the **pressure** in the reaction vessel is **increased** by decreasing the volume, which statement describes the resulting equilibrium shift?
A. The equilibrium shifts to the left, favoring the side with 4 total moles of gas.
B. The equilibrium shifts to the right, favoring the side with 2 total moles of gas.
C. The equilibrium shifts to the right, and the $\Delta H$ becomes positive.
D. No shift occurs because there are gases on both sides of the reaction.
E. The equilibrium shifts to the left, which lowers the temperature of the system.

* **Correct Answer:** B. Increasing pressure favors the side of the reaction with the **fewest total moles of gas**. The reactant side has $(1+3) = 4$ moles of gas, while the product side has $2$ moles. The shift will be **to the right** (product side).

***

#### **Question 9: Acid Dissociation Constant ($K_a$) (Calculation)**
Hydrofluoric acid ($\text{HF}$) dissociates in water according to the reaction:
$$\text{HF} (aq) + \text{H}_2\text{O} (l) \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ (aq) + \text{F}^- (aq)$$
Given that the equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_a = 7.2 \times 10^{-4}$, and the ion product of water is $K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$, what is the value of the base ionization constant ($K_b$) for its conjugate base, the fluoride ion ($\text{F}^-$)?
A. $7.2 \times 10^{-4}$
B. $1.0 \times 10^{-14}$
C. $1.4 \times 10^{-11}$
D. $7.2 \times 10^{10}$

* **Correct Answer:** C. The relationship between an acid ($K_a$) and its conjugate base ($K_b$) is $K_w = K_a \cdot K_b$.
$$K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{7.2 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-11}$$

***

#### **Question 10: Solubility Product ($K_{sp}$) (Calculation)**
Write the $K_{sp}$ expression for the sparingly soluble solid, lead(II) chloride, $\text{PbCl}_2 (s)$, and calculate its $K_{sp}$ value if the equilibrium concentration of $\text{Pb}^{2+}$ is $0.0159\text{ M}$.
$$\text{PbCl}_2 (s) \rightleftharpoons \text{Pb}^{2+} (aq) + 2\text{Cl}^- (aq)$$
A. $K_{sp} = [\text{Pb}^{2+}][\text{Cl}^-] \text{, } K_{sp} = 2.53 \times 10^{-4}$
B. $K_{sp} = [\text{Pb}^{2+}][\text{Cl}^-]^2 \text{, } K_{sp} = 1.60 \times 10^{-5}$
C. $K_{sp} = [\text{Pb}^{2+}][\text{Cl}^-]^2 \text{, } K_{sp} = 4.02 \times 10^{-5}$
D. $K_{sp} = [\text{Pb}^{2+}][2\text{Cl}^-] \text{, } K_{sp} = 7.56 \times 10^{-5}$

* **Correct Answer:** B.
    * **Expression:** $K_{sp} = [\text{Pb}^{2+}][\text{Cl}^-]^2$ (solids are omitted).
    * **Concentrations:** If $[\text{Pb}^{2+}] = 0.0159\text{ M}$, then $[\text{Cl}^-] = 2 \times 0.0159\text{ M} = 0.0318\text{ M}$.
    * **Calculation:** $K_{sp} = (0.0159)(0.0318)^2 \approx 1.60 \times 10^{-5}$.

C. The heat generated by the radiation increasing the temperature of the tissue.
D. Neutrons being absorbed by the $\text{DNA}$ molecule, making it radioactive.

* **Correct Answer:** **B. The radiation knocking an electron off a nearby water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) molecule, creating highly reactive, damaging chemical species**. Indirect damage occurs when radiation ionizes surrounding water, which then chemically attacks the $\text{DNA}$.

***

***

#### **Question 9 (Conceptual)**
What is the principle behind using **radiometric dating** to determine the age of a fossil or ancient artifact?
A. Measuring the total number of protons in the sample and comparing it to modern standards.
B. Calculating the time it takes for an atom to fuse with another atom.
C. Determining the ratio of a parent radioisotope to its stable daughter product, using the radioisotope's known **half-life**.
D. Exposing the sample to $\text{X-rays}$ to observe how the energy affects the photographic film.

* **Correct Answer:** **C. Determining the ratio of a parent radioisotope to its stable daughter product, using the radioisotope's known half-life**. The constant rate of decay (half-life) allows scientists to calculate the time since the radioactive material was fixed within the sample.

***

#### **Question 10 (Conceptual)**
Which statement correctly describes a key difference between **nuclear fission** (used in current power plants) and **nuclear fusion** (the process in the sun)?
A. Fission involves light nuclei combining, while fusion involves heavy nuclei splitting.
B. Fission is controlled by magnetic fields, while fusion uses mechanical control rods.
C. Fusion requires incredibly high temperatures (millions of degrees), whereas fission operates at or near room temperature.
D. Fission produces less radioactive waste than fusion.
E. Fusion is currently used globally for commercial electricity generation, while fission remains experimental.

* **Correct Answer:** **C. Fusion requires incredibly high temperatures (millions of degrees), whereas fission operates at or near room temperature**. Fusion requires millions of degrees Celsius to overcome the electrostatic repulsion of the positive nuclei.
