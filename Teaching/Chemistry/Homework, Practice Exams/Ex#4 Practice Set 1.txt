a) Positive ($\Delta H > 0$)
*b) Negative ($\Delta H < 0$)
c) Zero ($\Delta H = 0$)

... **Calculation:** $3.0\text{ mol } \text{O}_2 \times \frac{2\text{ mol } \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3}{3\text{ mol } \text{O}_2} = 2.0\text{ mol } \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$

    $$\text{CH}_4(g) + 2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \quad \Delta H = -890.\text{ kJ}$$
a) $+222.5\text{ kJ}$
b) $-890.\text{ kJ}$
c) $-445.\text{ kJ}$
*d) $-222.5\text{ kJ}$
... **Calculation:** $\Delta H$ is extensive. $0.25\text{ mol } \text{CH}_4 \times \frac{-890.\text{ kJ}}{1\text{ mol } \text{CH}_4} = -222.5\text{ kJ}$  The enthalpy change must be scaled proportionally to the amount of reactant. Since $0.25\text{ moles}$ is one-quarter of the amount in the equation, the heat released is also one-quarter of the value.

a) $120.\text{ moles}$
b) $0.00120\text{ moles}$
*c) $0.120\text{ moles}$
d) $0.750\text{ moles}$

The reaction shows that for every one mole of \(\text{O}_2\), 2 moles of \(\text{2 H}_2\text{O}\) are produced. Since 3 moles \(\text{O}_2\) are provided, then \(3 \text{ O}_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol H}_2\text{O}}}{1 \text{ mol O}_2} = 6 \text{ mol H}_2\text{O}\)

The units of the molar mass are \(\frac{\text{grams}}{\text{moles}}\) or \(\frac{\text{g}}{\text{mol}}\). Therefore, since the units grams must be canceled, the mass (grams) must be divided by grams per mole, which is the units of the molar mass.

*b) The $\text{H}^+$ ion is highly reactive and exists only in a solvated form, $\text{H}^+(\text{H}_2\text{O})_n$, most simply written as $\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$.
c) The $\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$ ion is a weak acid, whereas the $\text{H}^+$ ion is a strong acid.
d) Using $\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$ ensures that the charges are always balanced in the equilibrium expressions.
... A bare proton ($\text{H}^+$) does not exist free in water, but is immediately bonded to a water molecule to form $\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$.

97. The **theoretical yield** is the maximum amount of product that can be formed from the initial amounts of reactants, while the **actual yield** is always greater than the theoretical yield
a) true
*b) false 
... The actual yield is typically less than or equal to the theoretical yield; it should not be more than $100\%$ due to experimental error

98. If a chemical reaction is **exothermic**, the potential energy ($\text{PE}$) of the products will be lower than the $\text{PE}$ of the reactants, resulting in a negative change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$)
*a) true
b) false 

99. Changing the stoichiometric coefficients in a thermochemical equation requires a proportional change in the energy value ($\Delta H$) associated with the reaction
*a) true
b) false 

100. $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ is considered **amphoteric** because it can undergo an acid-base reaction with itself, acting as both a proton donor (acid) and a proton acceptor (base)
*a) true
b) false 

101. The **hydronium ion** concentration $[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+]$ is often preferred over the hydrogen ion concentration $[\text{H}^+]$ because $\text{H}^+$ is a highly reactive bare proton that is always solvated by a water molecule in aqueous solution
*a) true
b) false 

102. A strong acid differs from a weak acid primarily because the strong acid is present at a higher concentration
a) true
*b) false
... The essential difference is the **degree of ionization** or dissociation, not the concentration

103. If the $\text{pH}$ of a solution is $3.00$, the corresponding $\text{pOH}$ of the solution must be $10.00$ because $\text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14.00$
*a) true
b) false 

104. According to **Collision Theory**, a successful chemical reaction requires colliding molecules to have sufficient kinetic energy **and** the correct geometric orientation.
*a) true
b) false 

105. A **catalyst** increases the rate of a chemical reaction by changing the potential energy ($\Delta H$) of the reactants and products
a) true
*b) false
... A catalyst increases the rate by lowering the **activation energy** ($E_a$) but **does not change** the potential energy of the reactants or products ($\Delta H$)

106. If the temperature of an endothermic reaction at equilibrium is raised, Le Chatelier's Principle predicts the equilibrium will shift to favor the reverse reaction (exothermic direction)
a) true
*b) false 
... Higher temperatures favor the direction where compounds have higher enthalpy (the **endothermic** direction)

107. When writing the equilibrium constant expression ($K$), the concentrations of pure liquids (like $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ in an aqueous reaction) and pure solids (like precipitates) are **omitted** from the expression
*a) true
b) false 

108. **Alpha particles** are the most penetrating type of common radiation and require thick concrete or lead shielding
a) true
*b) false
... **Gamma rays** are the most penetrating[cite: 136, 137]. [cite_start]Alpha particles are the least penetrating

109. A nuclear fission **chain reaction** is controlled in a power reactor by using special materials in control rods to capture the excess neutrons emitted by the fuel
*a) true
b) false 

110. The measurement unit **sievert ($\text{Sv}$)** assesses tissue damage by combining the energy dose (Gray, $\text{Gy}$) with a factor for the type of radiation (Relative Biological Effectiveness, $\text{RBE}$)
*a) true
b) false
