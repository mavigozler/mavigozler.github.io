Conceptual Answers
While both are units of mass, a gram is Avogadro’s number of atomic mass units so you would multiply the number of amu by 6.022x10^23 to find total number of grams
The correct way to state formula mass of ethanol is to show the units of mass which is amu.
No because moles and weight operate on different set of standards meaning that they’re not equal to each other. This means that moles of different compounds contain different weights. For example, 2 moles of Na = 2 x 22.989 g = 45.98g while 1 mole of Cl = 1 x 35.453 g = 35.453 g Cl. This makes the sodium react completely with chlorine. 2g of sodium would react with = (35.453/45.978) x 2 = 1.542 g Cl

The information required to determine the mass of the solute would be the molarity of the solution because once that is achieved, volume of the solution and molar mass of the solute can be used to calculate the total mass. A derivatization that achieves this goes as: Molarity = moles of solute / volume of solution in liter -> Moles = molarity x volume in liter -> Mass= moles x molar mass.

Answers

At the atomic level, a crystalline solid has a regular arrangement of atoms, whereas an amorphous solid has a random arrangement of atoms.
 
The oppositely charged ions are very strongly held together, so ionic crystals have high melting points. Ionic crystals are also brittle because any distortion of the crystal moves same-charged ions closer to each other, so they repel.
 
The covalent network solid is essentially one molecule, making it very hard and giving it a very high melting point.
