# Pre-Lab Quiz: Chem 3A Experiment 9a Solutions and Dilutions

Quiz Title:  Pre-Lab Quiz: Chem 3A Experiment 9a Solutions and Dilutions
Quiz Description: This is an EXTRA CREDIT opportunity! Doing this quiz helps you understand also what you need to do for the experiment and preparing the report.

The answers to the questions are in the lab manual and in the PDF of the PowerPoint prepared for this experiment.

Because this is a multiple choice format, You will be allowed TWO GUESSES to get the correct answer for each question. Once you take two guesses on a question and get it wrong, the opportunity on that question is lost. This is why I want you to do the necessary studying to understand what is being asked of you.

Finish the quiz by Tuesday at 5:00 pm to get this opportunity.

It is worth 20% (40 points) of a lab report value (200 points). Each question is 5 points.
