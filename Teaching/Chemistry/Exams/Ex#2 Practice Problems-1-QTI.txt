Things to Know:

Use the Yellow and Green Sheets to answer any of the problems that requires it
The mass of an atom, a molecule, or a forumla unit of an ionic compound is in units of 'amu'
The molar mass of an atom, a molecule or a formula unit of an ionic compound is in units of 'grams per mole' (g/mol)
One atom of carbon-12 (C) isotope has a mass of 12.00 amu
One mole of carbon has a mass of 12.01 g/mol: this is the weighted average of all isotopes of carbon

ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE BEING ASKED!!!
If you are being asked for a quantity whose units are in moles (mol), the units should be in moles (mol).
If you are being asked for a quantity whose units are in grams (g), the units should be in grams (g).
If you are being asked for a quantity whose units are in grams per mole (g/mol), the units should be in grams per mole (g/mol).
If you are being asked for a quantity whose units are in NUMBERS of atoms/molecules/particles, 
the units should be in in NUMBERS of atoms/molecules/particles.
The choices for answers to some questions can be eliminated immediately if the wrong units are indicated!
