Things to Know about doing Calculations with Gases
For all calculations in chemistry and the sciences:
1. 
-  Look at the units of your quantities (numbers): they must cancel in calculations
-  If a temperature is in Celsus, you MIGHT have to convert it to Kelvin



Use the Yellow and Green Sheets to answer any of the problems that requires it
The mass of an atom, a molecule, or a forumla unit of an ionic compound is in units of 'amu'
The molar mass of an atom, a molecule or a formula unit of an ionic compound is in units of 'grams per mole' (g/mol)



The best way to find significant digits is to first convert to scientific notation
