<h1 id="writingquestions">Writing Questions</h1>

The MyOpenMath question format is based on PHP.

<div class="h2">
<h2 id="questionparts">Question Parts</h2>

A question is formed in several parts:
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>:  A description of the question.  This is not shown to students</li>
<li><strong>Use Rights</strong>:  The rights you wish to grant other people (you always have full rights).  Options are:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Private</strong>:  Only you can use the question</li>
	<li><strong>Use, no modification</strong>:  Anyone can use the problem, but only you can modify the problem.  Anyone can add
	    library assignments, but cannot remove assignments.</li>
	<li><strong>Use, allow modification</strong>:  Anyone can use or modify the problem.</li>
	</ul></li>
<li><strong>Libraries</strong>:  The question libraries you wish to include this question in</li>
<li><strong>Question type</strong>:  The type of question.</li>
<li><strong>Common control</strong>:  General definitions needed for both display and scoring</li>
<li><strong>Question control</strong>:  Definitions only needed for question display</li>
<li><strong>Question text</strong>:  The actual question display.  This section should be HTML based, but
    can include variables defined in the common or question control.  For convenience, a blank line
    is automatically interpreted to be a paragraph break.  Use of &lt; and &gt; signs are usually
    handled ok, but use of the HTML &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; are recommended in their place.</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong>:  Code defining the answer</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:  All control code can be placed in the "Common Control" box; the Question Control and Answer sections do not have to be used.</p>

</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class="h2">
<h2 id="basiccontrolsyntax">Basic Control Syntax</h2>
<p>
Lines of the common control, question control, and answer sections usually take the form of variable
definition.  In MyOpenMath, variables are identified with a dollarsign ($) prefix.  For example,
$a is the variable a.  Most lines will take one of these forms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>$var = number.  Example:  $a = 3</li>
<li>$var = calculation.  Example:  $a = 3*$b*$c</li>
<li>$var = function.  Example:  $a = showplot("sin(x)")</li>
<li>$var = randomizer.  Example:  $a = rand(-5,5)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Variable Types</strong></p>
<p>
There are a few types of variables:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A number:  $a = 15.  A calculation like $a = 3^2 will also result in a number</li>
 <li>An array:  $a = array(6,8,10).  This is a collection of variables. You can reference the parts using an index (note that arrays are zero-indexed), so $a[0] = 6.</li>
 <li>A string:  $a = "hi there".</li>
 <li>Boolean:  $a = true</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that numbers are not in quotes, and strings are in quotes.  When you use
the double-quote mark (") to define a string, you can interpolate variables into
the string.  Example:
</p>
<pre>$a = 3
$b = 5
$str = "What is $a/$b"
</pre>
<p>
In this example, $str now contains "What is 3/5".
</p>
<p>Note that strings in single quotes will not interpolate variables</p>
<p>As a warning, strings are interpolated literally, so if you had $a = -4 and 
    then defined $b = "$a^2" you would end up with "-4^2", which may not be 
    what you intended.  Use explicit parentheses in these cases.
</p>

<p><strong>Array assignment</strong></p>
<p>
In some cases you want to define several variables at once.  There are two ways to
do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>$var1,$var2 = arrayfunction.  Example: $a,$b = diffrands(-5,5,2)</li>
<li>$ar = arrayfunction.  Example: $ar = diffrands(-5,5,2)</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the first example, variables $a and $b each take on a single value.  In the second example,
the variable $ar is an array; the elements can be accessed as $ar[0] and $ar[1] (note
that arrays are zero-indexed).  If you use this approach, enclose the variable reference in
parenthesis in calculations, like $new = ($ar[0])^2, and in curly brackets inside strings,
like $string = "there were {$ar[0]} people".
</p><p>
You can also literally define an array using the "array" function.
Examples:  $ar = array(2,3,4,5), or $ar = array("red","green","blue")
</p>
<p>You can also use a shorthand notation for an array, using square brackets. 
    Example: $ar = [2,3,4,5].
</p>

<p><strong>Working with Strings</strong></p>
<p>If needed, you can concatenate (combine) two strings using the . operator.  Example:</p>
<pre>$a = "string one "
$b = "string two"
$both = $a . $b
</pre>
<p>
Here, $both now contains the string "string one string two"
</p>
<p>
If you have a long command to type, you can put a "&amp;" at the end of a line to specify it continues on the next line.  Example:
</p>
<pre>$questions = array("this is choice 1",&amp;
"this is choice 2")
</pre>
<p>
If defining a string for display, you can put a "&amp;&amp;" at the end of a line to specify it continues on the next line and insert
an HTML line break.  Example:
</p>
<pre>$showanswer = "Do this first. &amp;&amp;
Then do this."
</pre>
<p>will be interpreted as:</p>
<pre>$showanswer = "Do this first. &lt;br/&gt;Then do this."
</pre>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>You can insert comments in your code by starting the comment with two forward slashes: //this is a comment.
Typically it's best to put comments on their own line, but they can also be placed after a line of code.</p>

<h3 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h3>

<p>
Any assignment line can be followed by one of two conditional:  "where" or "if".
</p>
<p>
"where" is used to repeat the previous assignment if the condition provided is not met.  The
"where" condition is almost exclusively used with array randomizers.  Example: to select two
different numbers that are not opposites:
</p>
<pre>$a,$b = diffrands(-5,5,2) where ($a+$b!=0)</pre>
<p>
</p><p>Beware that the system will give up if it's unable to meet the specified conditions after 200 tries, 
    so be sure your <code>where</code> condition has fairly high probability of success, ideally at least 10%.  If it doesn't,
    you should consider where there are other ways to generate your values.  Alternatively, you can 
    specify a fallback value to use if the condition fails using <code>else</code>:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>$a = rand(1,100) where (gcd($a,$b)==1) else ($a = 7)</pre>
<p>
"if" is used to make an assignment conditional.  For example:
</p>
<pre>$a = rand(0,1)
$b = "sin(x)" if ($a==0)
$b = "cos(x)" if ($a==1)
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of double equal signs (==) for testing equality.  A single equal sign (=) will
make an assignment (change the value of $a in this example) and return "true", which is probably not what you intended to do.
</p>
<p>
Comparison operators available for "if" and "where" statements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>==  Equal to</li>
<li>!=  Not equal to</li>
<li>&gt; Greater than</li>
<li>&lt; Less than</li>
<li>&gt;= Greater than or equal to</li>
<li>&lt;= Less than or equal to</li>
<li>isset($v) Whether $v is defined</li>
</ul>
<p>
To do compound conditionals, use || for "or", and &amp;&amp; for "and".  For example:
</p>
<pre>$a = nonzerorand(-9,9) where ($a!=1 &amp;&amp; $a!=-1)
</pre>
<p>
The "if" condition can also be used before or after a code block like this:
</p>
<pre>$a = rand(0,1)
if ($a==0) {
   $b = 1
   $c = 2
}
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>$a = rand(0,1)
{
   $b = 1
   $c = 2
} if ($a==0)
</pre>
<p>
When "if" is used before a block of code, it can optionally be followed
with "elseif" and/or an "else" statement, like this:
</p>
<pre>$a = rand(0,5)
if ($a==0) {
   $b = 1
} elseif ($a==2) {
   $b = 3
} else {
   $b = 2
}
</pre>
<p>
"where" can also be applied to a block of code:
</p>
<pre>{
  $a = rand(-5,-1)
  $b = rand(1,5)
} where ($a+$b !==0)
</pre>
<p>or with a fallback</p>
<pre>{
  $a = rand(-5,-1)
  $b = rand(1,5)
} where ($a+$b !==0) else {
  $a = -3
  $b = 5
}
</pre>

<h4>Conditionals in Question Text</h4>
<p>Within the question text, it's possible to have a section of text display based on the value of a variable.  
If the text is a single string, it's preferable to define the string conditionally in the question code, then 
insert the variable for the string in the question text.  Putting a conditional direclty in the question text 
is primarily intended for cases where there is a large block of text to control.</p>

<p>To do conditional text, wrap the text in <code>[if variable==value][/if]</code>. Note that the variable name 
should be given without the preceeding dollar sign here. You can use other simple comparisons like != or &lt;, but 
not more complicated expressions. The value should not be in quotes, even if it is text. It is fine to have things 
like $answerbox inside two conditionals, so long as only one will display at at time.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>[if graphdispmode==0]
Given f(x)=$func, estimate f'(x) at x=$x.  $answerbox
[/if]
[if graphdispmode&gt;0]
$graph
Given the graph above, estimate f'(x) at x=$x.  $answerbox
[/if]
</pre>

<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<p>There are several looping macros (such as calconarray) that can meet most needs.  For more general use
there is a "for" loop:</p>

<pre>for ($i=a..b) { action }</pre>
<p>
Here <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> represent whole numbers, variables, or simple expressions.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>$f = 0
for ($i=1..5) { $f = $f + $i }

$a = rands(1,5,5)
$b = rands(1,5,5)
for ($i=0..4) {
  $c[$i] = $a[$i]*$b[$i]
}
</pre>

<p>For associative arrays (arrays with non-numeric or non-consecutive keys) you can use a "foreach" loop:</p>

<pre>foreach ($arr as $k=&gt;$v) { action }</pre>
<p>
Here <em>$arr</em> is the associative array, and as it loops the keys will be assigned
to <em>$k</em> and the values to <em>$v</em>.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>$arr = ['red' =&gt; 3, 'green' =&gt; 5, 'blue' =&gt; 2]

$str = ''
for ($arr as $color=&gt;$num) {
  $str .= "There are $num balls that are $color. "
}
</pre>

<p>Conditions after the statement can be used <em>inside</em> a for loop, but not outside without explicit blocking</p>
<pre>for ($i=1..5) {$a = $a+$i if ($i&gt;2) }     WORKS
for ($i=1..5) {$a = $a+$i} if ($a&gt;2)     DOES NOT WORK
{for ($i=1..5) {$a = $a+$i} } if ($a&gt;2)    WORKS
</pre>

<p>Conditions using blocking inside a loop are fine</p>
<pre>for ($i=1..5) { if ($i&gt;2) {$a = $a+$i} }   WORKS</pre>

<p>Inside a <code>for</code> or <code>foreach</code> loop, 
   <code>break</code> can be used to break out of the loop, and 
   <code>continue</code> can be used to move on to the next iteration without executing 
   any further code in the block.

<div class="h2">
<h2 id="graphtablemacros">Graph/Table Macros</h2>
The following macros create graphs or tables:
<ul>
<li><strong>showarrays(string,array,[string,array]...,[options])</strong>:  Creates a tabular display of the data in the array(s) as column(s), with the strings
    as column headers.  Alternatively you can call this function with arguments
    showarrays(array of column headers, array of data arrays, [options]).  Options can be a string = "c", "l", or "r" to center, left-align, or right align data,
	  or can be an array with $opts["align"] for alignment, $opts["tablealign"]="center" to center the whole table,
      and $opts["caption"] to add a caption to the table.  To align each column differently, provide a
	  a string with a character for each column, like "rcc"</li>
<li><strong>showdataarray(array,[columns,options])</strong>:  Creates a tabular display of the data in the array with no headers.  Data is presented
    in one column unless second argument is provided, in which case the data will be distributed over the specified number of columns.
    Options can be a string = "c", "l", or "r" to center, left-align, or right align data,
    or can be an array with $opts["align"] for alignment, $opts["tablealign"]="center" to center the whole table,
    and $opts["caption"] to add a caption to the table.</li>
<li><strong>horizshowarrays(string,array,[string,array]...)</strong>:  Creates a tabular display of the data in the array(s) as row(s), with the strings
    as row labels.  Does not text wrap, so only use for small data sets.</li>
<li><strong>showrecttable(data array of arrays,columnlabels,rowlabels,[format])</strong>:  Creates a tabular display of a 2x2 data table, where $data[0] is the first row of the table.
    The rowlabels and columnlabels are arrays of labels. format = "c", "r", or "l" to center, left-align, or right align data.</li>
<li><strong>showplot(funcstrings,[xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,labels,grid,width,height])</strong>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>funcstrings</strong> is a single string or an array of strings each having at least the first of the following list:<br>
	"function,color,min,max,startmarker,endmarker,width,dash"
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Function</strong>: a single function of x, like cos(x), or a parametric function of t, entered like [sin(t),cos(t)], or x=c for a vertical line, entered like x=1</li>
		<li><strong>color</strong>: a color designator: black,red,orange,yellow,green,blue,purple</li>
		<li><strong>min,max</strong>: the min and max values for the input variable for which you wish to see this graph.  You can also exclude
		    point discontinuities; for example -5,5!0!2 for min,max would include all values from -5 to 5, excluding 0 and 2.</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><strong>xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax</strong>: Graphing window.  Defaults to -5 to 5 for both. Use "0:-n" (for some value of n) for xmin or ymin to only
	       have gridlines and labels after 0, while still using -n to adjust spacing. This is an alternative to using addplotborder to create
	       first quadrant graphs.</li>
	<li><strong>labels</strong>: spacing of axes labels.  Defaults to 1. Set to "off" or 0 for none.  Use "xlbl:ylbl" for different spacing on each axis. Use "xlbl:ylbl:xname:yname" to put a named label on the axes.</li>
	<li><strong>grid</strong>: spacing of grid lines.  Defaults to 1.  Set to "off" or 0 for none.  Use "xgrid:ygrid" for different spacing on each axis.</li>
	<li><strong>width,height</strong>:  The width and height (in pixels) of the graph.  Defaults to 200x200</li>
	</ul></li>
<li><strong>mergeplots($plot1, $plot2, [$plot3, $plot4, ...])</strong>: Merges multiple plots into one.  Usually
  	not necessary, since showplot can accept an array of funcstrings, but occasionally useful
  	when adding to a graph generated by another function.  The grid and border from the first
  	graph is used. To avoid weird behavior, try to ensure all plots were drawn using the same
  	grid.</li>
<li><strong>addfractionaxislabels(plot,step,[axis])</strong>:  Adds labels along the horizontal axis in steps of step to a plot created with showplot.
      Step is a fraction like "1/4", or a pi multiple, like "pi/4" or "2pi".  When using this, make sure to set the showplot x-axis label
      spacing larger than the domain to prevent the default labels from showing.  Set axis to "y" to add fraction axis labels on the y-axis.</li>
<li><strong>addlabel(plot,x,y,label,[color,loc,angle,size])</strong>: Adds a label to a plot created with showplot.
	<ul>
	<li><strong>plot</strong>: The plot created with showplot</li>
	<li><strong>x,y</strong>: The coordinates for the label</li>
	<li><strong>label</strong>:  The string label itself.  MathML cannot currently be displayed in labels</li>
	<li><strong>color</strong>: Label color.  Defaults to black.</li>
	<li><strong>loc</strong>:  By default, the label is centered at the x,y coordinates.  Use "left" to display the string to the left of the
	point, "right" to the right, "below" for below the point, "above" for above the point.</li>
	<li><strong>angle</strong>: Angle to rotate text.</li>
	<li><strong>size</strong>: font size for label.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<li><strong>addlabelabs(plot,x,y,label,[color,loc,angle])</strong>: Adds a label to a plot created with showplot. Parameters are the same as with
     addlabel, except x and y here are pixel values on the picture rather than values relative to the axes.</li>
<li><strong>addplotborder(plot,left,[bottom,right,top])</strong>:  Changes the pixel width of border (default 5) around a plot.  Labels
    will show within the border.  Typically used to add room for labels to show.</li>
<li><strong>adddrawcommand(plot,commands)</strong>:  Inserts arbitrary asciisvg drawing commands into an existing
    plot created with showplot or other drawing tools.</li>
<li><strong>showasciisvg(string,[width,height,alttext])</strong>:  If you know the ASCIIsvg language, this will set up an svg with "string" as the script.
    optionally you can specify the width and height (in pixels) for the svg.  For accessibility, you should always try to
    include alttext, which is text that displays to people requesting non-visual alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>replacealttext(image or graph, alttext)</strong>: Replaces the alt text (alt tag) in the image or graph with the specified text. This alt text
    will replace the autogenerated textual description for graphs produced by showplot.</li>
<li><strong>changeimagesize(image or graph, width, [height])</strong>: Changes the display width for an image.
    Note this doesn't resize the file itself, just changes the display size - it's always better to resize the original
    image file.</li>
<li><strong>textonimage(img,text,left,top[text,left,top,left,...])</strong>:  Overlays text over an image.  Image can be a URL or the variable for an uploaded
    image.  Specify the text string, and offset in pixels from the top left corner.  Can specify multiple strings to overlay.
    textonimage is not screenreader-friendly, so it's recommended you provide an alt text on the image, 
    which will be read to the screenreader instead of the image and any layered text.</li>
<li><strong>addimageborder(image, [border width, margin])</strong>: Adds a border to an image uploaded in 
    the question editor. Border width (default 1) and whitespace margin (default 0) can be specified.</li>
<li><strong>arraystodoteqns(xarray,yarray,[color])</strong>:  Converts an array of x-values and y-values into a form that can be used in
  showplot.</li>
<li><strong>connectthedots(xarray,yarray,[color,thickness,startmarker,endmarker])</strong>: Converts an array of x-values and y-values into a form that
  can be used in showplot to create a series of lines connecting the (x,y) pairs</li>
<li><strong>arraystodots(xarray,yarray)</strong>: Converts an array of x-values and y-values into a form that can be used in the Drawing answer type</li>
<li><strong>gettwopointlinedata(stuans, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height]) or gettwopointlinedata(stuans, [grid, snaptogrid])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing
  question and pulls out the two-point line data.  Returns an array of lines, each of form array(x1,y1,x2,y2) giving the coordinates

  and pulls out the two-point data for the given curve type.  Type should be one of 'line', 'lineseg', 'ray', 'parab', 'halfparab', 'horizparab', 'sqrt', 'cubic', 'cuberoot',
  'rational', 'exp', 'genexp', 'log', 'genlog', 'sin', 'cos', 'abs', 'vector', 'circle','ellipse'.  Returns an array of curve data, each of form array(x1,y1,x2,y2) giving the coordinates of
  the two points used.  They are returned in the order clicked.  For example, with 'parab' type, the first point is the vertex and the
  second point is an arbitrary point. Using 'genexp' or 'genlog' will return a 5th entry which is the value of the asymptote. Can use type 'circlerad' to return array(x-center,y-center,radius) or 'ellipserad' 
	to return array(x-center,y-center,x-radius,y-radius).</li>
<li><strong>gettwopointformulas(stuans, type, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height]) or gettwopointformulas(stuans, type, [grid, snaptogrid])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing question
  and returns formulas for curves drawn by the student.  Type should be one of 'line', 'lineseg', 'ray', 'parab', 'halfparab', 'horizparab', 'sqrt', 'cubic', 'cuberoot',
  'rational', 'exp', 'genexp', 'log', 'genlog', 'sin', 'cos', 'abs', 'circle','ellipse'.  Returns an array of expressions, each a function of x, for the curves drawn. They are returned in the order clicked.  For 
	'horizparab', output will be in terms of y. For 'circle' and 'ellipse', output will be expression in x and y equaling 1. Can give a final optional argument 'showequation,[xvar,yvar]' to output implicit equations with optional custom x 
	and y variables.</li>
<li><strong>getdotsdata(stuans, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height]) or getdotsdata(stuans, [grid, snaptogrid])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing
  question and pulls out the closed dots data.  Returns an array of dots, each of form array(x1,y1) giving the coordinates
  of the dot.</li>

  question and pulls out the open dots data.  Returns an array of dots, each of form array(x1,y1) giving the coordinates
  of the dot.</li>
<li><strong>getlinesdata(stuans, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height]) or getlinesdata(stuans, [grid, snaptogrid])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing
  question using the older non-twopoint line tool or the polygon tool, and pulls out the lines data.  Returns an array, with an element for each line/curve draw.  Each of those

	Returns an array of curve data, each of form array(style,x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3) giving the coordinates of
  the three points used.  They are returned in the order clicked.  style will be either 'ne' for strict inequality (dashed line),
	or 'eq' for inequality with equality (solid line).</li>
<li><strong>getsnapwidthheight(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height, snaptogrid)</strong>:  Takes drawing grid info and a snaptogrid
  value or string, and returns an array(width,height) giving a closeby drawing width and height that will guarantee that the snaptogrid values

<h2 id="formatmacros">Format Macros</h2>

The following macros help with formatting values for display:
<ul>
<li><strong>makepretty(string or array of strings)</strong>: Changes double add/subtract signs to a single sign.</li>
<li><strong>makeprettydisp(string or array of strings)</strong>:  Does makepretty (see above) and backquotes the string for math display</li>
<li><strong>polymakepretty and polymakeprettydisp</strong>:  Like makepretty, but for polynomials.  Cleans up 0*, 1*, ^1, and ^0 to make the polynomial look nicer.
   This function can do weird things for equations that are not simple polynomials, so test well</li>
<li><strong>makexpretty and makexprettydisp</strong>:  (deprecated - use makexxpretty instead) Like makepretty, but the X-tra version - attempts to clean up things like 1*, 0*, etc.  This function
   will often cause weird things to happen, so test well</li>
<li><strong>makexxpretty and makexxprettydisp</strong>:  Like makepretty, but the X-tra version - attempts to clean up things like 1*, 0*, x^1, x^0, etc.  Can occasionally cause strange output, so
   be sure to test.  Handles things better than the older makexpretty, but does not always produce 100% identical output.
   This function cannot handle |x| notation; use abs(x) instead.</li>
<li><strong>numtowords(number,[addth, numwithTh, addcommas)</strong>:  Creates a string containing number written out in words.<br>
   numtowords(1203) returns "one thousand two hundred three"<br>
   numtowords(1203,true) returns "one thousand two hundred third"<br>
   numtowords(1203,false,true) returns "1023rd"<br>
   numtowords(1203,false,false,true) returns "one thousand, two hundred three"
  </li>
<li><strong>fractowords(numerator,denominator,[options])</strong>: Creates a string containing 
    fraction numerator/denominator written out in words. By default, fractions will be reduced 
    to integers if possible, and pos/neg signs will be reduced. 
    Options is a string that can include combinations of 'mixed' or 'literal', 
    and 'over' or 'by', and 'hyphen'. Using 'over' or 'by' will connect numerator and 
    denominator with that word. Using 'mixed' will output a mixed number, and 'literal' 
    overrides the default simplifications. Does not allow division by zero. 
    If 'over' and 'by' both used, defaults to 'over'. If 'mixed' and 'literal' both used,
	defaults to 'mixed'. 'hyphen' will hyphenate the fraction.<br>
	fractowords(5,-2) returns "negative five halves"<br>
	fractowords(6,3) returns "two"<br>
    fractowrods(2,3,'hyphen') return 'two-thirds'<br>
	fractowords(-7,4,'mixed') returns "negative one and three fourths"<br>
	fractowords(-7,4,'mixed over') returns "negative one and three over four"<br>
	fractowords(6,3,'literal') returns "six thirds"<br>
	fractowords(6,3,'literal over') returns "six over three"<br>
</li>
<li><strong>numtoroman(number,[uppercase])</strong>:  Converts a number 0.5-3999.5 to a roman numeral string.  Defaults to uppercase; set second parameter to false to
    produce lowercase</li>
<li><strong>prettyint(number)</strong>:  Adds commas in thousands spaces of integers.  Example: prettyint(1234) will return "1,234".  The result is a string, which
   can only be used for display, not in calculations</li>
<li><strong>prettyreal(number,decimals,[comma])</strong>:  Adds commas in thousands spaces of number, and displays the value to a fixed number of decimals places (rounding if needed).
   Example: prettyreal(1234.567,2) will return "1,234.57", and prettyreal(1.8,3) will return "1.800".  The result is a string, which
   can only be used for display, not in calculations.  By default adds a comma as a thousands separator; set comma to "" to override.</li>
<li><strong>prettyreal_instring(string,decimals,[comma])</strong>:  Formats any number in the string
   using the same process as prettyreal.</li>
<li><strong>round_instring(string,[decimals])</strong>: Rounds any number in the string 
   to the specified number of decimal places (nearest whole number if decimal is left out)</li>
<li><strong>prettysmallnumber(number, [space])</strong>:  Prevents very small numbers from being displayed as scientific notation.
   Set space to true to add space in groups of 3, like 0.000 000 02</li>
<li><strong>prettysigfig(number,sigfigs,[comma,choptrailingzeros,scinot,sigfigbar])</strong>:  Rounds number to sigfigs significant figures.  By default it adds commas in thousands spaces; set comma to "" to override.
   Set choptrailingzeros to true to chop trailing zeros from the decimal part, even if significant. Set scinot to true to display in scientific notation. Set sigfigbar to true to put line over last significant, non-terminating zero, such as 42<span style="text-decoration: overline">0</span>0 having three sig figs (use only in math display).
   This is for display; to round a number for calculations, use roundsigfig.</li>
<li><strong>prettysigfig_instring(string,sigfigs,[comma,choptrailingzeros,scinot,sigfigbar])</strong>:  
    Rounds any number in the string to sigfigs significant figures. The rest of the options are the same 
    as for prettysigfig.</li>
<li><strong>makescinot(number,[decimals,format])</strong>:  Converts number to scientific notation.  If provided, rounds mantissa to decimals places.  Can specify format: "*" "E" as alternative to default cross.</li>
<li><strong>prettytime(value,informat,outformat)</strong>:  Creates a nice representation of a time.  Informat can be 'h', 'm', or 's' designating whether
    value is hours, minutes, or seconds.  Outformat can be any combination of these to specify output.  For example, 'hm' will return "__ hours and __ minutes".  Outformat
    can also be 'clock' which returns 3:42pm, or 'sclock' which returns 3:42:15pm</li>
<li><strong>dispreducedfraction(numerator,denominator,[doubleslash,variable in numerator])</strong>:  Takes two numbers as numerator and denominator of a fraction, returning a display form of the fraction,
    reduced to lowest terms.  Suitable for $showanswer.  Set doubleslash to true to produced "3//4" rather than "3/4".  Set variable in numerator to put a variable
    in the numerator, such as pi.</li>
<li><strong>makereducedfraction(numerator,denominator,[doubleslash,variable in numerator])</strong>:  Same as dispreducefraction, but not already in display form.<br>
    An alternate input form of makereducedfraction(numerator,denominator,'parts') will return an array of the 
    reduced numerator and denominator.</li>
<li><strong>decimaltofraction(decimal,[format,maxden])</strong>:  Converts a decimal to a fraction.  Can use format="mixednumber" to get a mixed number rather than improper fraction.
    Only works for denominators up to maxden (default 5000)</li>
<li><strong>htmldisp(string,[variables])</strong>:  Uses HTML instead of the math typesetter to display simple exponents and subscripts, and to italicize variables</li>
<li><strong>formatcomplex(real,imag)</strong>: Creates a string like "2+i" from the real and imaginary parts.</li>
<li><strong>rawurlencode(string)</strong>: Encodes a string for use in a URL query string parameter.</li>
</ul>

    To sort in reverse order, give the option second parameter as "rev". 
    To sort by key, give the optional second parameter as "key". 
    To sort by key (numeric only) and fill in any missing numeric keys with empty string values, 
    give the optional second parameter as "keyfill". In this case you can optionally provide a third

<h2 id="generalmacros">General Macros</h2>
These macros are fairly general purpose:
<ul>
<li><strong>ifthen(condition,trueval,falseval)</strong>:  Takes a comparison condition, and returns the trueval if the condition is true and the falseval otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>cases(testvalue,comparearray,outputarray,[defaultoutput, tolerance])</strong>:  Compares the 
  testvalue to each of the comparearray entries, and if a match is found, returns the corresponding 
  entry of outputarray. If there is no match, the defaultoutput is returned. Note that if both values 
  are numeric, the comparison is made with tolerance, otherwise the values are compared using string 
  matching (meaning 0.5 will not be considered equivalent to "1/2").  Tolerance defaults to 0.0015 
  relative error. Prefix with |, like "|0.1" for absolute tolerance.  Example: 
  <code>cases(3,[1,2,3,4],["a","b","c","d"])</code> would return "c".</li>
<li><strong>formhoverover(label,tip)</strong>:  Creates a hover-over definition or other tip</li>
<li><strong>formpopup(label,content,[width,height,style,scrollbars])</strong>:  Creates a link or button leading to a popup window.  Content can
  be a web address, or HTML content to put directly into the popup.  Style can be "link" or "button". Scrollbars defaults to false - set true for scrollbars.</li>
<li><strong>forminlinebutton(lable,content,[style,outputstyle])</strong>:  Creates a link or button that when clicked will reveal hidden content.
  Content can be any valid HTML.  Style can be "link" or "button".  Outputstyle can be "inline" or "block".  Block will allow any HTML, but will
  be displayed on a new line.  Use "inline" to have text stay on the same line.</li>
<li><strong>makenumberrequiretimes(array/list)</strong>:  Takes an array or list of numbers and generates a string suitable for use as a $requiretimes.  Writes
  the string so that every number in the array must show up in the student answer.  Automatically detects and adjusts for number overlaps
  (like 2 appearing in 32).</li>
<li><strong>ABarray(start, num)</strong>: Produces an array of strings of the form [AB#] which will get replaced with answerboxes if placed in the question text.
  start is the first value used, and num indicates the number of entries to create.
  ABarray(5,2) will output array("[AB5]","[AB6]").
  This macro is often used in conjunction with the showarrays macro.</li>
<li><strong>getntupleparts(string, [expected number of components, checknumeric])</strong>: 
  If fed a string from $stuanswers or $stuanswersval of an N-tuple or Calculted N-tuple question,
  this will extract the components of the n-tuple, returning them as an array.  It is recommended to
  provide a second argument of the number of components expected, and if the values are expected to
  be numeric, put true as the third argument.  This function will return false if the input is 
  not a valid ntuple.  This function only works for a single n-tuple, not a list of them.</li>
<li><strong>scoremultiorder(stua, answer, swap, type, [weights, options])</strong>: In a multipart question, allows questions or groups 
  of questions to be scored in any order.  Works for types 'number', 'string', 'calculated', 'numfunc', 'complex', 'calccomplex', 
  'ntuple', and 'calcntuple'.  <em>Note:</em> Use of the "list" option for individual question types is <b>strongly</b> recommended over 
  using this function if you're just asking for multiple answers.
  <ul>
    <li>Use like <code>$answer=scoremultiorder($stuanswers[$thisq],$answer,'0;1','number')</code></li>
    <li>stua: For numeric types, <code>$stuanswers[$thisq]</code> should be the first argument.  For calculated types, 
        <code>$stuanswersval[$thisq]</code> should be the first argument.</li>
    <li>answer: The second argument is always <code>$answer</code>. This function must be used after $answer is already defined.</li>
    <li>swap: The third argument shows what entries should be swappable. It can be a string or array of strings. Examples:
        <ul>
            <li><code>'0;1'</code> would say answers index 0 and 1 should be swappable</li>
            <li><code>'0;1;2'</code> would say answers index 0,1,and 2 should be swappable</li>
            <li><code>['0;1','2;3']</code> would say answers index 0 and 1 should be swappable, and 2 and 3 should be swappable</li>
            <li><code>'0,1,2;3,4,5'</code> would say answers with indices 0,1,2 should be swappable as a group with 
              the answers with indices 3,4,5.  Comparison is only made on the first entry to decide whether to swap the groups.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>type: should be the question part short name, like 'number' or 'calccomplex', for the entries that can be swapped.</li>
    <li>weights: optionally, you can include your answeights to have them swapped to.  In that case, use the form 
        <code>$answer,$answeights=scoremultiorder($stuanswers[$thisq],$answer,'0;1','number',$answeights)</code>
    </li>
	<li>options: an array of other options.  To use without enabling the weights, set weights to null.
		<ul>
			<li>variables: to change the variables when type is numfunc. Example:
				<code>$answer = scoremultiorder($stuanswers[$thisq],$answer,'0;1','numfunc',null,['variables'=&gt;$variables])</code>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="mathmacros">Math Macros</h2>
These macros are used for mathematical calculations:
<ul>
<li><strong>sin(t), cos(t), tan(t), sec(t), csc(t), cot(t)</strong>: The usual trig functions</li>
<li><strong>arcsin(v), arccos(v), arctan(v), atan2(y,x)</strong>: The inverse trig functions</li>
<li><strong>abs(v)</strong>: Absolute value</li>
<li><strong>sqrt(t), root(n)(t)</strong>: Square root and nth root</li>
<li><strong>gcd(a,b,[c,d,...])</strong>: Greatest common divisor of the inputs</li>
<li><strong>lcm(a,b,[c,d,...])</strong>: Least common multiple of the inputs</li>
<li><strong>sign(a,[option])</strong>:  Returns the sign of a, as 1 or -1.  If option is set to true, returns a string "+" or "-" instead. If option
  is set to "onlyneg", it returns the string "-" if a is negative, or "" otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>sgn(a)</strong>: Returns the sign of a, as -1, 0, or 1.</li>
<li><strong>v!</strong>: Factorial, like $a = $b!</li>
<li><strong>evalfunc(func,vars,val1,val2,...,[falseonerror])</strong>: Evaluates a function given the variables and values for each variable.
  for example evalfunc("x^2*y","x,y",2,3) will evaluate x^2*y with x=2, y=3.<br>
  This function by default will return <code>false</code> on invalid parameters. 
  With numerical inputs, it will return an empty string if the function is unable 
  to be evaluated due to a syntax error. Set the optional falseonerror parameter to 
  true to return <code>false</code> instead of an empty string in this case. 
  For non-numerical inputs, setting the optional parameter to true will skip 
  some additional cleanup steps that sometimes cause problems.</li>
<li><strong>evalnumstr(expr, [complex])</strong>: Evaluates a string representation of a numerical expression, like "(2pi)/3", to a decimal.  
  Avoid using this in place of direct calculation in most cases, but it can be handy if you already have generated the string 
  for display but then need to do a calculation with it.  Set complex to true if the calculation involves complex number expressions.</li>
<li>See also: calconarray and multicalconarray in the <a href="https://www.myopenmath.com/help.php?section=arraymacros">Array Macros</a> section</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class="h2">
<h2 id="conditionalmacros">Conditional Test Macros</h2>
These macros are used to test various conditions.  They typically return true or false, depending on whether the desired condition is met.
<ul>
<li><strong>getstuans($stuanswers, $thisq, [part number])</strong>: Pass this function the 
  $stuanswers or $sutanswersval arrays, $thisq for the question number, and a part number (omit 
  if it's a single part question) and this will return the corresponding value.  Use of this 
  function is recommended over directly accessing the array, as this function accounts for 
  undefined values in a way that won't trigger errors.</li>
<li><strong>stuansready($stuanswers, $thisq, array of part numbers, [anstypes, answerformat])</strong>: Before using 
    student answers, you need to check to make sure the student has actually answered them.
    Pass this function the $stuanswers or $sutanswersval arrays, $thisq for the question number,
    and an array of part numbers, and it will check to make sure a non-blank answer has been 
    provided for all of the part numbers.  A part number can also be given as "1 or 2" if answering
    either part is sufficient.  If it is a single part question, use null for the part number.
    To allow a blank answer, prefix a part number with a tilde. 
    It is good to wrap any multipart or conditional code using student answers in an "if" block 
    using stuansready as the condition.  It is advisable to pass $anstypes as a 4th input, which 
    allows the function to handle special cases like matrices better. $answerformat can be added 
    as an optional 5th input, which will check the student answer meets the answerformat (currently 
    only checks Calculated questions, and no lists). Or you can put 'checknumeric' for the answerformat 
    and it will check that "number" and "calculated" answers are numeric (must use $stuanswersval for calculated in this case).
    Note this won't work for list answers, only single numbers, and that it won't recognize answers 
    with commas like "2,345" as numeric.</li>
<li><strong>comparenumbers(a,b,[tol])</strong>:  Compares numbers or numerical expressions a and b to see if there are equivalent to the specified
  tolerance.  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>comparenumberswithunits(a,b,[tol])</strong>:  Compares numbers-with-units a and b to see if they are equivalent to the specified tolerance. Set tol to 
	specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance. Each of a and b must be of the form: 
	<code>[decimal number]*[unit]^[power]*[unit]^[power].../[unit]^[power]*[unit]^[power]...</code>, though 'per' may be used for division of units, and 'unit squared', 'square unit',
	'unit cubed' and 'cubic unit' may be used. Examples: <code>4 cm</code>, and <code>3.5E4 feet per second squared</code>
</li><li><strong>comparentuples(a,b,[tol],[option])</strong>:  Compares ntuples or calcntuples a and b to see if they are equivalent to the specified
	  tolerance.  Set a single tol to specify the relative tolerance for all entries in ntuple (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance,
		such as "|0.5". Can make tol an array (or list) to apply by element to the ntuple. By default, function compares the parentheses/brackets containing the
		ntuple. Can give option "ignoreparens" to only compare the entries in the ntuple, so (a,b) would be considered equivalent to [a,b].</li>
<li><strong>comparefunctions(a,b,[vars,tol,domain])</strong>: Compares functions a and b to see if they are algebraically equivalent.  Set
  vars to a list of variables (defaults to 'x').  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.
  Set domain to "xmin,xmax" to specify a domain for comparison, or "xmin,xmax,integers" to restrict domain to integer values.</li>
<li><strong>comparesameform(a,b,[vars])</strong>: Compares expresions a and b to see if they are 
    in the "same form". This means exactly the same, except for commutation of addition and 
    multiplication, multiplication by 1, implicit multiplication, and extra parentheses. This is picky,
    so use with caution. Set vars to a list of variables (defaults to 'x').</li>
<li><strong>comparelogic(a,b,vars)</strong>: Compares two logical statements, written using 
 ^^ for and, vv for or, ~ for not, -&gt; or =&gt; for conditional, and &lt;-&gt; or &lt;=&gt; for biconditional.
 vars should be a list or array of variables in the statements. </li>
<li><strong>isset($var)</strong>: Checks to see if $var is defined</li>
<li><strong>is_numeric(str)</strong>:  Checks if the string represents an integer or decimal number.</li>
<li><strong>is_nan(val)</strong>:  Checks if the value is NAN (not a number), which results from things like sqrt(-1). Only works on calculated values, not string expressions.</li>
<li><strong>scorestring($answer,$showanswer,words,$stuanswers,$thisq,[partn, highlight])</strong>: This function checks
  to see if the words in the list/array "words" appear in the student's answer. If they all appear, it redefines
  $answer so the student's answer is marked correct.  $showanswer is also redefined to show the original $answer 
  with all the required words highlighted. You can turn off the highlighting by setting the optional highlight 
  parameters to false.<br>
  For multipart questions, include the part number as an
  additional parameter.  Usage for single part questions (where $words is predefined earlier in the code):<br>
  $answer,$showanswer = scorestring($answer,"",$words,$stuanswers,$thisq)<br>
  Usage for multipart questions (again where $words is predefined). This is example is for part 2: <br>
  $answer,$showanswer = scorestring($answer,$showanswer,$words,$stuanswers,$thisq,2)</li>
<li><strong>checkanswerformat(string, answerformat)</strong>: Checks a single numerical expression 
    string, like "3/2" for whether it meets the answerformat listed.</li>
<li><strong>getsigfigs(value, [expected sigfigs])</strong>: returns the number of sigfigs in 
    value.  Include the expected sigfigs to resolve ambiguity on numbers like 1200.</li>
  </ul>
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class="h2">
<h2 id="feedbackmacros">Feedback Macros</h2>
These macros are used to select and format feedback messages to students.  They return a string which can be placed in the question text.
<ul>
<li><strong>getfeedbackbasic(correct msg, incorrect msg, $thisq, [partnum])</strong>:  Generates a feedback string based solely on whether the
  question was scored correct or not.  Provide the correct and incorrect messages to display, and provide $thisq.  Give a part number for
  multipart questions to get part-based feedback. Can give an array of part-numbers, in which case the 
  correct message only shows if all parts are correct.</li>
<li><strong>getfeedbacktxt(stuans, feedbacktxt, ans)</strong>:  Gives feedback on multiple choice questions.  <br>
  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from
   $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart. <br>
   feedbacktxt is an array of feedback responses, corresponding     in array order to the $questions, so feedbacktxt[1] is the feedback
   if the student selections $questions[1] as their answer.  <br>
   ans is the correct    answer; you can usually pass $answer if it's been defined already.</li>
<li><strong>getfeedbacktxtessay(stuans, feedbacktxt)</strong>:  Gives feedback on essay questions.  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from
   $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.  It is not actually evaluated or compared - it is only
   needed to see if the student has entered a response or not.  Once the student has entered any response, feedbacktxt will be returned.</li>
<li><strong>getfeedbacktxtnumber(stuans, partialcredit, feedbacktxt, defaultfeedback, [tol])</strong>:  Gives feedback on number questions.  <br>
  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.  For Calculated
  type questions, be sure to use $stuanswersval.  <br>
  partialcredit is an array or list of form array(number, score, number, score, ... ) where the scores are in the range [0,1].  <br>
  feedbacktxt is an array of feedback messages, corresponding in array order to the order of the numbers in the partialcredit list.<br>
  defaultfeedback is the default incorrect response feedback <br>
  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>getfeedbacktxtcalculated(stuans, stuansval, partialcredit, feedbacktxt, defaultfeedback, [answerformat, requiretimes, tol])</strong>:  Gives feedback on calculated number questions.  <br>
  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.  <br>
  stuansval should be the numerical value of the student answer, obtained from $stuanswersval[$thisq]. <br>
  partialcredit is an array or list of form array(number, score, number, score, ... ) where the scores are in the range [0,1].  <br>
  feedbacktxt is an array of feedback messages, corresponding in array order to the order of the numbers in the partialcredit list.<br>
  defaultfeedback is the default incorrect response feedback <br>
  answerformat can be a single answerformat to apply to all expressions, or an array with each element applied to the corresponding expression<br>
  requiretimes can be a single requiretimes to apply to all expressions, or an array with each element applied to the corresponding expression<br>
  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.<br>
  Example: <code>getfeedbacktxtcalculated($stuanswers[$thisq], $stuanswersval[$thisq], array("1/2",1,"1/2",.5), array("Correct", "Right value, but give your answer as a fraction"), "Incorrect", array("fraction",""))</code>
    will check the students answer against the answer "1/2" twice, the first time applying the "fraction" answerformat, and the second time not.</li>
<li><strong>getfeedbacktxtnumfunc(stuans, partialcredit, feedbacktxt, defaultfeedback, [vars, requiretimes, tol, domain])</strong>:  Gives feedback on numfunc (algebraic expression/equation) questions.  <br>
  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.<br>
  partialcredit is an array or list of form array(expression, score, expression, score, ... ) where the scores are in the range [0,1].  <br>
  feedbacktxt is an array of feedback messages, corresponding in array order to the order of the numbers in the partialcredit list.<br>
  defaultfeedback is the default incorrect response feedback <br>
  vars should be a list of variables used in the expression. Defaults to "x"<br>
  requiretimes can be a single requiretimes to apply to all expressions, or an array with each element applied to the corresponding expression<br>
  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.<br>
  Set domain to limit the test domain.  Defaults to "-10,10"

<h2 id="a11yalt">Accessible Alternative</h2>
<p>The accessible alternative option, near the bottom of the question editor, allows you to specify an 
	alternative question ID to display if the student has accessibility settings enabled.
</p>
<p><b style="color:red">You most likely should not use this feature.</b> It is intended for the rare 
    case where a question cannot be made accessible using the built-in accessibility features, like 
    some questions using jsxgraph, Geogebra, etc. If your question uses static 
	images, graphs generated using showplot, or is a standard Drawing type question, 
	you <b style="color:red">DO NOT NEED</b> this feature, and will make things worse by using it.
</p>
<p>The system automatically generates textual alternatives for graphs generated using <code>showplot</code>, <code>histogram</code>, 
	etc., and displays those when the student has the visual text alternatives setting enabled.  If the default 
	text alternative is insufficient or inappropriate, use <code>replacealttext</code> to replace the 
	default with a custom-written alternative. If using a non-interactive jsxgraph visual, you can use the 
	<code>description&gt;</code> option in <code>jsxBoard</code> to add alternative text. 
	To check what is generated and shown, you can test the question with 
	different accessibility settings in the question Preview.  Note you may need to use the browser's 
	inspector to "see" alt-text added to static images.
</p>
<p>Likewise, the system automatically provides a keyboard-based alternative for drawing questions when 
	the student has the keyboard based drawing setting enabled.
</p>
<p>It is always preferable to make the original question accessible when possible rather than 
	specifying an alternative. But if your question cannot be reasonably made accessible, this option allows 
    you to specify a different question ID to show the student instead.  Your goal should be to pick a question 
    that assesses equivalent concepts but in a different way.</p>
<p>For the "Use accessible alternative", you can select to have the alternative displayed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>"visual alt": when the student has Graph Display set to text alternatives. This is the 
		appropriate option if your question relies on visual information but does not involve any 
		user interaction that requires a mouse (cannot be performed with a keyboard alone). 
		In this case, rather than provide an accessible alternative, it might be better to wrap the 
		visual in <code>&lt;div aria-hidden=true&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> to hide it from a screenreader, and add

		of the visual element, which will be visually hidden but available to a screenreader.
	</li>
	<li>"mouse alt": when the student has Drawing Entry set to Keyboard and text-based. If your question has an 
		element that requires a mouse to operate and cannot be operated with keyboard, but does not contain any 
		visual elements that don't have alt-text, then use this option.
	</li>
	<li>"visual or mouse alt": if the question has both visual elements and elements that require a mouse,
		then select this option. The alternative will be used if the student has either accessibility setting 
		enabled.

</ul>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2 id="writingcommon">Common options to all types</h2>
<p>
All question types can support these options:
</p>
<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>For a single question (not multipart), to use hints, in the common control (or question control) section define the array $hints where:</p>
<pre>$hints[attempt number] = "hint text"</pre>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>$hints[0] = "This will show on first display"
$hints[1] = "This will show on second attempt (after 1 missed attempt)"
$hints[2] = "This will show on third and subsequent attempts, since no later values have been defined"
</pre>
<p>
It is fine, for example, to not define $hints[0] if you want nothing to display initially.
</p>
<p>
Then in the question text, place the location of the hint using the variable $hintloc.
</p>

<p>
In multipart questions, you can follow the process above if you just want a single strand of hints for the entire problem.  If you want per-part hints, define the $hints array as:
</p>
<pre>$hints[question part number][attempt number] = "hint text"
</pre>
<p>
Then in question text, place each hint using $hintloc[question part number]
</p>
<p>
To have the hint to display based on a set of previous answers, you can use:
</p>
<pre>$hints[question part number][attempt number] = array("hint text", [part num1, part num 2])
</pre>
<p>This will display the hint after all the parts listed have had the required attempts or are correct.</p>
<p>
To override the default <em>Hint:</em> text, set $hintlabel.
</p>


<h3>Help references</h3>
<p>To provide help of some sort for a question (typically, links to videos, book references, etc), define $helptext
in the common control section.  Any text assigned to this variable will show at the bottom of the question.  The
display of this text is controlled by the same "show hints?" option that controls the display of hints described above.</p>


<h3>Referencing Student Answers</h3>
<p>To create multipart questions that are graded on consistency, or to create a set of lab-type problems that rely on student-provided data, you can reference
students' previous answers in your question code.  You will only be able to reference the student answer to some question types</p>
<ul>
<li>$stuanswers[N] will refer to the student's answer on question N (not zero-indexed: N=1 is question 1)</li>
<li>$stuanswers[N][P] will refer to the student's answer on question N, part P (if multipart)</li>
<li>$stuanswers[$thisq][P] will refer to the student's answer on the current question, part P</li>
<li>$stuanswers[$thisq-1] will refer to the student's answer on the previous question</li>
<li>$stuanswersval[$thisq] or $stuanswersval[$thisq][P] will contain the numerical value of Calculated question types.</li>
<li>$stulastentry or $stulastentry[P] will contain the student's entered answer on the current question. 
    While $stuanswers will only contain submitted answers, $stulastentry will also include autosaved entries.</li>

</ul>
<p>
Notes (important!):
</p>
<p>
1) If the student has not answered the question, then $stuanswers[N] === null, with the exception of drop-down select
questions, where $stuanswers[N] == "NA" if no selection is made.
If used in an equation, it will take on the value 0.
To prevent divide-by-zero errors and to prevent students from exploiting this, it is highly recommended that you do something like:
</p>
<pre>$a = $stuanswers[$thisq][0]
$a = rand(1,100) if ($a===null)
</pre>
<p>
Perhaps also include:
$warning = "You MUST answer question 1 before this question" if ($a===null), then put $warning in the question text.
</p>
<p>
2) If you use $stuanswers in your $answer, $showanswer will generally not be defined.  If you follow the advice in #1 above, then your
$showanswer will reflect the random number assigned to $a.  For this reason, it is highly recommended that you custom define the $showanswer.
</p>
<p>
3) If using the $stuanswers array in a string or in the Question Text, you must enclose it with curly brackets:
Your answer was {$stuanswers[0][0]}.  If using it directly in a calculation, enclose it in parentheses just to be safe.
</p>
<p>
4) $stuanswers[$thisq] is defined for question scoring, but may not be for question display.
</p>
<p>
5) You can use the function getstuans($stuanswers,N,P) to retrieve a student answer value.  This method bypasses some strange things that happen
when there is a multipart question with only one part, so is recommended.
</p>
<p>
6) You can use the function stuansready($stuanswers,$thisq,[p1,p2,...]) to determine if the parts 
have been answered, instead of checking for null.
</p>

<h3>Other Reference Variables</h3>
<p>A few other special purpose variables can be referenced:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$scorenonzero</strong>: This variable is only available on display, not during scoring. $scorenonzero[$thisq] (or $scorenonzero[$thisq][partindex] for multipart)
   will be -1 if the question is unanswered, 0 if the score is zero, and 1 if the score is anything above 0.</li>
<li><strong>$scoreiscorrect</strong>: This variable is only available on display, not during scoring. $scoreiscorrect[$thisq] (or $scoreiscorrect[$thisq][partindex] for multipart)
   will be -1 if the question is unanswered, 1 if the score (before any penalties) is perfect, and 0 otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>$attemptn</strong>: This variable holds the attempt number of the current attempt.  0 is the initial attempt, 1 is the next attempt, etc.</li>
<li><strong>$partattemptn[part number]</strong>: For multipart questions, this holds the attempt 
    number on each part.</li>
<li><strong>$requestclearla</strong>:  If you set $requestclearla=true in your code, it will request the display to clear out the student's last answer.
  This might be useful if your question branches based on attempt count.  Example: <code>$requestclearla = true if ($attemptn==2 &amp;&amp; !$scoreiscorrect[$thisq])</code></li>
<li><strong>$graphdispmode</strong>: This will be 0 if the student has text-based alternatives 
  for graph display enabled, and 1 or 2 if an image-based mode is enabled.</li>
<li><strong>$drawentrymode</strong>: This will be 0 if the student has keyboard-based 
  alternatives for drawing entry enabled, or 1 for mouse-based entry.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reusing Code</h3>
<p>You can import in the Common Control code from another question using</p>
<pre>includecodefrom(questionid)</pre>
<p>
where questionid is the ID number of the question you want to import the code of.  In the
source question, the variable $included will automatically be set to true when the question
has been included, so it can be used to determine if the question has been
imported into another question, or is running independently.
</p>
<p>For example, in the master/source question, you might use the code:</p>
<pre>if (!$included) {
 $type = rand(0,4)
}
do stuff here
</pre>
<p>
In a question using this code, you could limit to a specific type using:
</p>
<pre>$type = 0
includecodefrom(1234)
</pre>
<p>Question text can be also brought in from another question by using</p>
<pre>includeqtextfrom(questionid)</pre>
<p>
somewhere in the Question Text portion of the question.
</p>
<h3>Teacher Notes</h3>
<p>In the question text, you can add a note that will only be viewable by the teacher while grading.
    Do this by wrapping the teacher note in the [teachernote] shortcode like this: <code>[teachernote]This is the note[/teachernote]</code>
</p>

<h3>Hiding/Toggling content</h3>
<p>If you need to hide content from view, you can wrap it in <code>&lt;div class="hidden"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
  Be aware the content is still in the page, so a student can still view the hidden content
  using the browser inspector, so don't use this to hide secret info, but it can be helpful 
  if you need to hide an answerbox that is being populated by some other means.</p>
<p>If you want to toggle a block of content, one option for shorter content is to use 
    forminlinebutton.  For longer content, you can wrap the content in a block using 
    <code>&lt;div data-toggler="Title for button"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.  That will
    hide the wrapped content, and add a button with the specified title for toggling the 
    content.  You can optionally add a <code>data-toggler-hide</code> attribute as well 
    if you want a different button label once the content is showing.

<h2 id="questiontypes">Question Types</h2>

The question types available are:

<div class="h3">
<h3 id="number">Number</h3>
<p>
The student is asked to enter a number (integer, decimal, or scientific notation).
The answer is compared to a given tolerance.  Can also accept DNE, oo (Infinity), and
-oo (Negative Infinity) as answers.
</p>
<p><strong>Required Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$answer = a number or calculation resulting in a number, like $answer = 5 </dt>
	<dd>Defines the answer.  Define multiple acceptable answers in a string separated by or:  $answer = "3 or 5 or 7".
	Alternatively, you can provide an interval notation range of
	acceptable answers, like $answer = "(2,5]".  Providing a range will override any tolerances set.  If $answerformat is set
	for list answers, then this should provide a list of correct answers, like $answer = "1,2,3".</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Optional Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$reltolerance = a decimal value </dt>
	<dd>Defines the largest relative error that will be accepted.  If this is not set, a relative error of .001 (.1%) is
	used by default.</dd>
<dt>$abstolerance = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the largest absolute error that will be accepted.  This will override the use of $reltolerance</dd>
<dt>$reqdecimals = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the minimum decimal accuracy required (ie 2 for two decimal places).  This will put a message in the answer tips stating the
	decimals required.  If neither $abstolerance or $reltolerance is set, this will set the tolerance, otherwise the provided tolerance
	will be used (even if it doesn't agree with the $reqdecimal setting).<br><br>
	$reqdecimals = "=2" can be used to require exactly 2 decimal places in the answer, regardless of how the value rounds (so 3.5 would get marked
	wrong when the answer is 3.50 if "=2" is used).  If you use the "=2" form, it will also round your $answer if needed for the $showanswer.
	<br>
	$reqdecimals = "r2" can be used to require rounding to 2 decimal places in the answer, not checking for trailing zeros (so 3.5 would get marked
	correct when the answer is 3.50 if "r2" is used).  If you use the "r2" form, it will also round your $answer if needed for the $showanswer.
	<br>When the "=2" or "r2" form is used, it overrides both $reltolerance and $abstolerance, and by default tests that the student answer exactly matches
	the correct answer ($abstolerance=0). 
	<br>To override the tolerance use +- in the setting, like this:
	<br>$reqdecimals = "=2+-.01" checks for exactly 2 decimals, but allows the answer to have an absolute error of .01
	<br>$reqdecimals = "=2+-1%" checks for exactly 2 decimals, but allows the answer to have an relative error of 1% (equivalent to $reltolerance = .01)</dd>
<dt>$reqsigfigs = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the significant figure accuracy required.  Use $reqsigfigs = 2 for at least 2 sig fig accuracy, or
	$reqsigfigs = "=2" to require exactly 2 sig figs in the answer, or $reqsigfigs = "[2,3]" to require 2 or 3 sigfigs.  This will put also a message in the answer tips stating the
	significant figures required.  If you use the "=2" form, it will also round your $answer if needed for the $showanswer.
	<br>This setting overrides both $reltolerance and $abstolerance, and by default tests that the student answer rounded to the specified sigfigs matches
	the correct answer.  To override the tolerance use +- in the setting, like this:
	<br>$reqsigfigs = "=2+-.01" checks for exactly 2 sigfigs, but allows the answer to have an absolute error of .01
	<br>$reqsigfigs = "=2+-1%" checks for exactly 2 sigfigs, but allows the answer to have an relative error of 1% (equivalent to $reltolerance = .01)</dd>
<dt>$answerformat = "list", "exactlist", "orderedlist", "set", "integer, "units", "nosoln", or "nosolninf"</dt>
	<dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Answerformats can be combined, like $answerformat = "nosoln,list"</li>
            <li>$answerformat = "list", "exactlist", or "orderedlist" specifies that a list of answers is expected.</li>
            <li>If $answerformat="list", then duplicate values are ignored.</li>
            <li>If $answerformat="exactlist", then duplicate values are not ignored.</li>
            <li>If $answerformat="orderedlist", the list must be in the same order and contain identical counts of values.</li>
            <li>$answerformat = "set" behaves like "list", but expects the answer list to be wrapped in curly braces as a set.</li>
            <li>$answerformat = "integer" changes the entry hint to only indicate integers, and rejects answers that contain decimals (except it does allow 2.0 instead of 2)</li>
            <li>$answerformat = "units" adds unit checking.  Supply the answer like <code>$answer = "3 kg/m^2"</code>.  
                The student's answer can be in other equivalent units, so "300 cm" is considered equivalent to "3 m".
                The answer must be in the format <code>[decimal number]*[unit]^[power]*[unit]^[power].../[unit]^[power]*[unit]^[power]...</code>, 
                though multiplication can be implied.  Also, 'per' may be used for division of units, and 'unit squared', 'square unit',
								'unit cubed' and 'cubic unit' may be used. Note that the units do not require mathematically-proper parens around the denominator.
                The decimal number can include basic scientific notation in 3E5 or 3*10^5 formats. Examples: <code>4 cm</code>, and <code>3.5E4 feet per second squared</code>
                Note that tolerances are scaled to the unit, so $answer = "3m" with $abstolerance = .1 would mean 
                .1 meters, so "310cm" would still be within tolerance.  If $reqsigfigs is set, the specified 
                number of sigfigs will need to be present in the student's answer, regardless of units.
                </li>
            <li>$answerformat = "nosoln" or "nosolninf" adds a list radio buttons for "no solutions" and optionally "infinite solutions". 
                $ansprompt can override the default statements like this: $ansprompt = "One value, x=;No values;Many values"
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
<dt>$requiretimes = a list, like "E,=0" </dt>
	<dd>Adds format checking to the student's answer.  The list can include multiple checks, which come in pairs.  The
	first is the symbol to look for.  The second describes what is acceptable.  For example, in the string shown above,
	the symbol "E" would be required to show up exactly 0 times.<br>
	Be aware that if you search for "5,=1", it will match both 5 and 15 and 2.5, since all three strings contain a 5.  When
	searching for numbers, you can avoid this by putting a "#" before the number, like "#5,=1", which would match the 5 but not 15 or 0.5.
	Beware this type of search ignores signs.<br>
	You can	use just "#" in the symbol location to match any number (including decimal values); 3.2^5 would match twice.<br>
	You can match either of two symbols by putting || between them, like ".5||1/2,&gt;0"<br>
	You can use a regular expression by putting in the symbol location "regex:expression"<br>
	You can put "ignore_commas,true" at the beginning of the $requiretimes to ignore commas in the answer<br>
	</dd>
<dt>$requiretimeslistpart = a list, in the same format as $requiretimes </dt>
	<dd>Similar to $requiretimes, but this check is applied to each element of the answer list when a list $answerformat is used,
	where $requiretimes would be applied to the entire list of answers. </dd>
<dt>$partialcredit = array(number,score,[number,score,...]) </dt>
	<dd>Allows you to specify partial credit for other answers.  The array should be given in the form array(number,score,number,score,...), where
	number is the value to compare to the student answer, and score is a proportion between 0 and 1 to award as partial credit.  Note this
	currently only works for single number answers; "or" and list answers are not supported.</dd>
<dt>$ansprompt = string </dt>
	<dd>A string that will be displayed in front of the input box.  Example: $ansprompt="y="</dd>
<dt>$displayformat = "alignright" </dt>
	<dd>Aligns the text in the answer box to the right side</dd>
<dt>$answerboxsize = number </dt>
    <dd>Determines the number of characters space provided for entry of an answer.  Defaults to 20.</dd>
<dt>$readerlabel = string</dt>
    <dd>A string that will be used as a visually hidden label on the input box for screenreaders.</dd>
<dt>$answerbox (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>Using the variable $answerbox in the Question Text will place the question input box in that location</dd>
<dt>$showanswer </dt>
	<dd>The answer to show to students (if option if available).  Defaults to $answer.  Use this to give a detailed answer,
	or a rounded off answer.</dd>
<dt>$hidetips = true </dt>
	<dd>Hides the question entry tips that display by default.
This should only be used when a question type is being used in an unintentional way,
or if the question type gives away critical info to the student.</dd>

A student is asked to enter a function
<p><strong>Required Variables</strong></p>
<dl>

	<dd>Defines the answer function, entered as a string.  For example, $answer="2sin(x)".  You can
	specify multiple acceptable answers by separating with "or", like $answer="x^2 or x^4"<br>
	Note: The system will accept any algebraically equivalent answer. To only allow answers of a
	specific format, you'll also need to define $requiretimes (see below).</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Optional Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$variables = string </dt>
	<dd>A list of all variables in the function (including letters representing constants).  Defaults to "x".  Can use
	"f()" to indicate a symbol represents a function.</dd>
<dt>$domain = "inputmin,inputmax" </dt>
	<dd>Defines the domain on which to compare the given answer and correct answer functions.  The same domain
	applies to all variables.  An option third list element "integers" can be given, which limits the domain to integer
	values.  The domain defaults to real numbers from -10 to 10.  If using multiple variables, can extend domain to
	define domain for each variable separately.  Example: $variables = "x,y"; $domain = "0,5,20,25"</dd>
<dt>$requiretimes = a list, like "^,=3,cos,&lt;2" </dt>
	<dd>Adds format checking to the student's answer.  The list can include multiple checks, which come in pairs.  The
	first is the symbol to look for.  The second describes what is acceptable.  For example, in the string shown above,
	the symbol "^" would be required to show up exactly 3 times, and "cos" would be required to show up less than 2 times.  You can
	use "#" in the symbol location to match any number (including decimal values); 3.2x+42y would match twice.<br>
	You can use a regular expression by putting in the symbol location "regex:expression"<br>
	You can match either of two symbols by putting || between them, like "x^-3||/x^3,&gt;0"<br>
	Include "ignore_case,false" to make the search case sensitive.<br>
    You can put "ignore_spaces,true" at the beginning of the $requiretimes to ignore spaces in the answer<br>
	Include "ignore_symbol,$" (or some symbol other than $) at the beginning of the $requiretimes to ignore that symbol in the answer<br>
	Note that commas are ignored by default with Function type, and a basic exponent like x^(-3) is converted to x^-3 before the check.</dd>
<dt>$answerformat = "equation" or "inequality" or "generalcomplex" or "toconst" or "scalarmult" or "nosoln" or "nosolninf" or "sameform" or "list" or "casesensitivevars" (can combine, like "equation,nosoln")</dt>
	<dd>By default, the student answer is expected to be an expression, and be equivalent (at points) to the specified answer.  This option changes
	this behavior.<br>
	"equation": Specifies that the answer expected is an equation rather than an expression.  The given
	answer should also be an equation.  Be sure to specify all variables in the equation in $variables.  This may fail
	on equations that are near zero for most values of the input; this can often be overcome by changing the $domain<br>
	"inequality": Specifies that the answer is expected to be an inequality rather than an expression.
	The given answers should also be an inequality.  Be sure to specify all variables in the equation in $variables.  This may fail
    on equations that are near zero for most values of the input; this can often be overcome by changing the $domain<br>
    "generalcomplex": Specifies the answer is a complex function, involving i.<br>
    "list": Allow a list of expressions or equations to be entered. Does not ignore duplicates. You cannot
       use this in combination with $partialcredit.  $requiretimes will apply to each element of the list.<br>
	"toconst": Specifies that the answer provided by the student is allowed to differ from the specified answer by a constant
	for all inputs.  Appropriate for comparing antiderivatives.  This may fail on expressions that evaluate to very large
    values or raise numbers to very large powers.<br>
    "scalarmult": Specifies that the answer provided by the student is allowed to differ from the specified answer by a 
    scalar multiple.<br>
    "allowplusminus": allow use of +- in the answer. Will enable the 'list' option if not already included.<br>
	"nosoln" or "nosolninf" adds a list radio buttons for "no solutions" and optionally "infinite solutions".
	$ansprompt can override the default statements like this:
    $ansprompt = "One function, f(x)=;No such function exists" <br>
    "sameform": requires the student's answer be in the "same form" as the correct answer. This means 
        exactly the same, except for commutation of addition and multiplication, multiplication by 1,
        implicit multiplication, and extra parentheses. (2x-3)(5-x) would be "sameform" as (-1x+5)(2*x-3), 
        but 2/4x and 1/2x and 0.5x would not be "sameform". Use with caution.<br>
	"casesensitivevars": By default answers with incorrect case variables (like X instead of x) will be accepted. 
	   Add this option to not ignore case on variables.

		<li>ignore_case: ignores capitol/lowercase differences</li>
		<li>trim_whitespace: trims leading and ending whitespace (spaces)</li>
		<li>compress_whitespace: compresses multiple spaces to one space and trims</li>
		<li>remove_whitespace: removes all whitespace (spaces)</li>
		<li>ignore_order: treats ABC and CBA as equivalent</li>
		<li>ignore_commas: removes commas</li>
		<li>partial_credit: awards partial credit based on Levenshtein distance between strings</li>
        <li>all_words: gives credit the student answer contains a list of key words.  $answer 
            should provide a comma-separated list of words to look for, and partial credit 
            will be given for each word found. Cannot be combined

		<li>allow_diff=n: gives full credit for answers with Levenshtein distance between strings ≤ n </li>
		<li>in_answer: gives credit if $answer is contained anywhere in the student answer</li>
		<li>regex: interprets $answer as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Ov1JUMDv4">regular expression</a> (pattern) to evaluate the student's answer.  For example, $answer="cost.*increas" will give credit if the word <em>cost</em> appears before <em>increas</em> in the student's answer.  $answer="increas|ris" will accept any of the following: <em>increas</em>ing, <em>increas</em>es, <em>ris</em>ing, or <em>ris</em>en etc.</li>
		<li>special_or: use <strong>*or*</strong> for separating answers rather than <strong>or</strong>.</li>

 <dt>$snaptogrid = spacing </dt>
	<dd>Turns on snapping, where points will jump to a grid.  $snaptogrid = 1 will jump to the nearest

	2 in the x and 4 in the y.  Does not have to match the actual grid line spacing.  Be aware that due to pixelation, the snapping
	may not land on exact values correctly.  This is usually corrected for automatically, but it sometimes fails if the correction would be
	too large.  In that case, use the getsnapwidthheight macro to compute an imagewidth and imageheight that will be pixel accurate.</dd>

<p><strong>Optional Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$grid = "xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,xscl,yscl,imagewidth,imageheight" </dt>
	<dd>Defines the grid to be drawn on.  Defaults to "-5,5,-5,5,1,1,300,300".  You can set all or just some of the
	    values.  For example, to just set the window, you could use "0,10,0,10"<br>
	    If using $answerformat="numberline", set ymin and ymax to 0.<br>If desired, you can set separate label and grid
	    spacing using "xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,xlabelspacing:xgridspacing,ylabelspacing:ygridspacing,imagewidth,imageheight".  You can specify axis labels using
	    "xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,xlabelspacing:xgridspacing:xaxislabel,ylabelspacing:ygridspacing:yaxislabel,imagewidth,imageheight".
	    To create first quadrant graphs, use "0:-n" (for some value of n) for xmin and/or ymin to only have gridlines and labels

<dt>$background = equation or array of equations, using the showplot macro format </dt>
	<dd>Define a graph to display in the background, to be drawn on top of.  Example:  $background = "x^2,red".

        Note that initPicture and axes will already have been called, so do not include them. 
    <br>You can also set $background to "none" to remove axes and the grid.
	<br>To specify alt-text for the background, add an element to the background array, like 
	    <code>$background = ["x^2,red","alt:a parabola"]</code>.  For a background using draw, add the alt at the

<dt>$abstolerance = grading cutoff</dt>
	<dd>Sets all-or-nothing grading.  If score &lt; $abstolerance, the student receives 0 for the question (note: score is

<dt>$scoremethod = "takeanything", "direction", "relativelength", "ignoreoverlap", "ignoreextradots"</dt>
		<dd>When "takeanything" is used, this will give full credit for any non-blank answer.  This might be of use with the freehand drawing option.
            <br>
            "direction" and "relativelength" are only used for vectors.  
            "direction" will score the initial point and direction for position vectors, but not length, and 
              will only score direction for displacement vectors.
            "relativelength" will score like "direction", but will also check that the drawn vectors have 
              correct lengths relative to each other.
              <br>
            "ignoreoverlap" only works with $answerformat="line", and will not deduct for overlapped lines.<br>
            "ignoreextradots" only works with $answerformat="polgon" and "closedpolygon", and will ignore any 
            extra dots drawn along a side of the polygon.

    <p>Algebraic N-Tuple questions require the student to enter an n-tuple or list of n-tuples of algebraic expressions.
    This can be used for parameterized points or vectors, or any other n-tuple of algebraic expressions.
    This is similar to the other N-tuple answer types, but allows students to enter algebraic expressions
    rather than just numbers, such as (x, x^2, 4-x).

    <p><strong>Required Variables</strong></p>
    <dl>
    <dt>$answer = a string containing an n-tuple or list of n-tuples </dt>
        <dd>Defines the answer n-tuple or list of n-tuples.  N-tuples can be any dimension,

    <dt>$variables = string </dt>
        <dd>A list of all variables in the function (including letters representing constants).  Defaults to "x".  Can use

<dt>Question part variables</dt>
	<dd>For each question part, you will need to define the variables (like $answer, $questions, etc.) you would normally
	need to define.  However, you will need to suffix the variable with a part designator.  For example, based on $anstypes
	above, the first answer is a number.  Instead of $answer = 5, enter $answer[0] = 5.  This designates that this answer belongs
	to the first element of $anstypes.  Likewise, to set the variables for the "numfunc" type, you'd set $variables[5] = "x".</dd>
<dt>$answerbox[partnum] (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>The array $answerbox will contain the entry boxes for each answer type.  In the question text, you will need to position
	these boxes within the question.  For example:  "Enter a number: $answerbox[0].  Now a function: $answerbox[1]".  Alternatively, you

<dt>$scoremethod = "singlescore" or "allornothing" </dt>
	<dd>Instead of recording individual scores for each question part, these will cause a single score to be
	recorded for the question.  "singlescore" totals the individual part scores, while "allornothing"
    will only give full credit or no credit.  If you need to specify per-part indexed 
    scoremethod values as well, you can define this as the array value 
    $scoremethod['whole'] instead.</dd>

	$showanswer, which will be the only answer shown for the problem (ie, $showanswer = "x=$answer[0], y=$answer[1]")</dd>
<dt>$showanswerloc (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>Optionally, you can use $showanswerloc to place a single $showanswer "Show Answer" button,

	of the form [SAB] or [SABn] (like [SAB2]). Note that if you use this to place one
	Show Answer button, you must place all of them, or else the remainder will not show.  Use $showanswerstyle = 'inline' to

<p>Scaffolded questions, also know as Sequential Multipart questions, allow you 
    to break a question up into chunks, where the second chunk only shows after the 
    first chunk is correctly answered or the student runs out of tries.  This 
    allows you to use the answer to the first chunk in the second without 
    "giving away" the answer, and allows a student who gets stuck on the first 
    chunk to move on to the rest of the question.</p>
<p><em>Note: scaffolding is only available in the new assessment interface. 
    If you are using the old interface, the question will behave like a 
    regular multipart question.</em></p>
<p>Scaffolded questions are an extension of Multipart questions.  To turn a multipart 
    question into a scaffolded question, just add an isolated line with three or more slashes
    in the Question Text where you want the chunks broken apart.</p>
<p>An example: (in the Question Text)</p>
<pre>To simplify $a(x+$b) + $c, first we need to distribute:

$a(x+$b) = $answerbox[0]

///

Next, combine like terms:

$a x + $ab + $c = $answerbox[1]
</pre>

<div class="h3">
<h3 id="conditional">Conditional</h3>
<p></p>A variation on multipart questions, a conditional question can include multiple answer boxes, but assigns
a single score.  The score is based on applying some comparison or conditional test to the student answers, referenced through
the <a href="https://www.myopenmath.com/help.php?section=writingcommon">$stuanswers</a> array.  This allows the question writer to essentially create their
own question type.<p></p>

<p><strong>Required Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$anstypes = an array or list of answer types</dt>
	<dd>Defines the answer type for each part.  Example: $anstypes = "number,number".  See the Multipart help above
	for the list of short names</dd>
<dt>$answer = any of these:</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>A boolean (true/false) expression</strong>: Something that evaluates to true or false. <br>
	Example: $answer = ($a&gt;3) <br>
	Example: $answer = comparefunctions($f,'x^2') &amp;&amp; ($a!=0)</li>
	<li><strong>A single numerical value</strong> in the interval [0,1]: will award that percentage of the total possible points.</li>
	<li><strong>array('function',$a,$b)</strong>:  Will compare the functions $a and $b and mark the question correct if they
	   are equivalent.  Can set $variables, $reltolerance, $abstolerance, and $domain as needed, like with Function type
	   questions</li>
	<li><strong>array('number',$a,$b)</strong>:  Will compare the numbers or numerical expressions $a and $b and mark the question correct if they
	   are equivalent.  Can set $reltolerance or $abstolerance as needed, like with Number/Calculated type
	   questions</li>
	<li><strong>Multiple comparisons</strong>: You can mix the two types above by creating an array of comparisons.  All must be true
	   for the question to be marked correct.  <br>
	   Example: $answer = array($a&gt;3, array('function',$b,c), array('number',evalfunc($b,$a),5))</li>
	</ul>
</dd><dt>Question part variables</dt>
	<dd>For each question part, you will need to define the variables (like $questions, etc.) you would normally
	need to define, except you <strong>should not</strong> define an $answer.  However, you will need to suffix the variable with
	a part designator.  For example, based on $anstypes
	above, the first answer is a number.  Instead of $displayformat = "select", enter $displayformat[0] = "select".
	This designates that this setting belongs
	to the first element of $anstypes.
	</dd>
<dt>$answerbox[partnum] (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>The array $answerbox will contain the entry boxes for each answer type.  In the question text, you will need to position
	these boxes within the question.  For example:  "Enter a number: $answerbox[0].  Now a function: $answerbox[5]"</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Optional Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>Question part options</dt>
	<dd>You can define any optional variable for each question part.  Like above, suffix the variable with the part designator.
	Note that $variables, $domain, $reltolerance, and $abstolerance may be used for the comparison, and should not be set for
	individual parts.</dd>
<dt>$showanswer</dt>
	<dd>By default the $showanswer for conditional types is "Answers may vary".  Set $showanswer to override this.</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Scaffolding</strong></p>
<p>While not as simple as scaffolding multipart questions, 
    you can add scaffolding to a Conditional question.  As with multipart,
    put an isolated line with three slashes in the question text to indicate 
    where the breaks occur. Then you will need to set <code>$seqPartDone[pn]</code>
    to <code>true</code> for each part index once that part should be considered 
    completed.  The scaffolding will move onto the next chunk when 
    all parts in the previous chunk have <code>$seqPartDone</code>
    set to <code>true</code>.

<h4 id="accessibility">Accessibility and Display Preferences</h4>
<p>
The Accessibility and Display Preferences in the user profile allow you to personalize
how you interact with the system, and allow you to work around technical issues.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Math Display</strong>: This option allows you to customize how math equations
	are displayed in the system.
	<ul>
	<li>MathJax: The recommended default is MathJax, which
	generates high quality display of math and provides the best compatibility
	with screenreaders and other assistive technology. </li>
	<li>Katex: provides faster math display with good quality, but not quite
	as nice as MathJax.</li>
	<li>Image-based: this uses images to display math. The quality is not as
	good, but this option can help workaround issue if the browser is having
	trouble using MathJax.</li>
	<li>Calculator-style: this uses an inline, text-based, calculator style
	display, like <code>x^2+4sqrt(x)</code>.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Graph Display</strong>: This option allows you to customize how graphs are
 	displayed in the system.
 	<ul>
	<li>SVG: The recommended default, this is the highest quality display,
	which will look clear and sharp even when zoomed in.</li>
	<li>Image-based: this option uses images to display graphs. The quality
	is not as high and will look fuzzy if zoomed in.</li>
	<li>Text alternatives: this option will replace auto-generated graphs
	with a text alternative, typically a table of values for the equations or
	a text description of a chart.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Drawing Entry</strong>: This option controls how answers to drawing questions
 	are entered.
 	<ul>
	<li>Mouse-based: The default, a mouse or touch device is used to plot
	points on a graph to create the drawing.</li>
	<li>Keyboard and text alternative: this option provides a text-based
	alternative for drawing entry, which can also be controlled entirely
	using the keyboard.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Text Editor</strong>: This option controls how large text entry is done.
 	<ul>
	<li>Rich text editor: The default, this option provides an editor
	with formatting buttons and "what you see is what you get" editing.</li>
	<li>Plain text entry: this option provides a basic text entry box with
	no buttons or other clutter.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Course styling and contrast</strong>: This option allows you to customize
 	the contrast styling of the course.
 	<ul>
	<li>Instructor chosen theme: The default, this option uses the instructor
	chosen styles for the course.</li>
	<li>High contrast, dark on light: this option overrides the course styles
	with extra-high-contrast styles, featuring dark text on a light background.</li>
	<li>High contrast, light on dark: this option overrides the course styles
	with extra-high-contrast styles, featuring white text on a dark background.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Live preview</strong>: This option controls how the preview of your answers updates
 	as you type.
 	<ul>
	<li>Show as I type: This default option will auto-update a preview of your
	answer as you type it out.  This can help you catch entry mistakes early.</li>
	<li>Only show a preview when I click: this option will stop the auto-update
	of a preview, and only display the preview when you request it. This option
	can reduce the distraction and flicker of the auto-update.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Time Zone</strong>: This option allows you to control the time zone that due
 	dates and other times are displayed based on.
 	<ul>
	<li>Use timezone reported by browser: When you log in, the system asks
	your computer what time zone you're in. By default, this timezone is the
	one used when displaying dates. You can check the listed timezone to make
	sure it's the correct one. If it is wrong, you can either adjust your
	computer's timezone then log out and back in, or override the detected time zone.</li>
	<li>Use a specific timezone for this session: this option allows you to override
	the detected timezone for this one login session. The next time you log in, the system
	will again detect your currect timezone. This option can be helpful if you don't
	want to change your computer's clock, but want to adjust the timezone temorarily.</li>
	<li>Always show times based on specific timezone: this option allows you to override
	the detected timezone every time you log in. This can be helpful if you
	travel a lot, but always want the times to display based on your home
	timezone.</li>

<h2 id="takingassessments">Taking Assessments</h2>
When you take an assessment, it will be displayed to you in one of several ways:
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Test</strong>:  You may see the entire test at once</li>
<li><strong>One at a time</strong>:  You may have to answer one question before proceeding to the next</li>
<li><strong>Full test, submit one at a time</strong>:  The full test is displayed, but you only answer one question at a time</li>
<li><strong>Skip Around</strong>:  You may see a list of questions.  You can skip around between questions by clicking on these links,
  and answer the questions in any order.</li>
</ul>

There are several question types.  When you click on the answer box, a hint will typically display below it telling you
what kind of answer is expected.  Some of the types:
<ul>
<li><strong>Number</strong>:  You will be asked to enter a number, like 3, 5.5, or -6</li>
<li><strong>Calculated</strong>:  You will be asked to enter a number, or a calculation, like 2/3, 5^2, or sin(2).  You can
    press the "Preview" button to ensure that the system is interpreting your answer the way you intended.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple-Choice</strong>:  You will be given a set of choices, and asked to select the correct choice</li>
<li><strong>Multiple-Answer</strong>:  You will be given a set of choices, and asked to select all the correct choices</li>
<li><strong>Matching</strong>:  You will be given a list of items with input boxes in front of them.  In each box, enter the letter
    of the item in the right-hand column that matches that item</li>
<li><strong>Expression</strong>:  You will be asked to enter an algebraic expression, like "sin(x)" or "3x^2-5" or "x^2/5".  Make sure you use the
    same variables in your answer than were specified in the question.  You can press the
    "Preview" button to ensure the system is interpreting your answer the way you intended.  It will also check to
    make sure that it understands your answer, and will tell if you if the syntax is ok.</li>
<li><strong>String</strong>: You will be asked to enter a word or list of letters</li>
<li><strong>Numerical Matrix</strong>:  You will asked to enter a matrix of numbers.  In some case, a grid of input boxes will be provided
    for you to enter the values.  If not, you will need to enter the matrix in ASCIIMath notation, like [(1,2,3),(4,5,6)]
    for the 2x3 matrix with first row: 1,2,3</li>
<li><strong>Calculated Matrix</strong>:  Like a numerical matrix, but each entry can be a calculation, like 2/3 or 5^2 or sin(2).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enteringmath">Entering Math</h3>
<p>
For some types of questions, you need to enter a mathematical expression.  The system
follows order of operations, so use grouping symbols as much as necessary.
</p>
<p>Many times, you can click a yellow arrow that displays next to the answer box when you click in it, which will
open up the MathQuill equation editor, which you can use to help enter your answers.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can enter your answer using calculator-style notation. Here is some help on how to enter expressions:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>* / + -</td><td>Multiply, divide, add, subtract</td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td>Powers.  2^3 = 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>sqrt</td><td>Square root.  sqrt(4) = 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>( )</td><td>Parentheses, for grouping.  (2+6)/2 = 4, while 2+6/2 = 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>e, pi</td><td>The standard constants</td></tr>
<tr><td>abs</td><td>Absolute Value.  abs(-4) = 4</td></tr>
<tr><td>sin,cos,tan,sec,csc,cot,sinh,cosh</td><td>Standard trig function.  Be sure to enter as sin(2), not sin 2</td></tr>
