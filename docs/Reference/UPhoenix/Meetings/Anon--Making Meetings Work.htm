<H1 class=delivery-title>MAKING MEETINGS WORK </H1>
<P class=body-paragraph>Meetings should be an integral part of work--otherwise, 
why have them at all? Yet many people view even teambuilding meetings as 
disrupting, rather than contributing to work processes. That's because most 
meetings are prone to a number of problems, ranging from lack of focus to lack 
of follow up. How good are you at solving these problems so that your meetings 
are productive? Find out by taking the quiz below, prepared by Donna Deeprose of 
Deeprose Consulting in New York. Pick the best solution to each problem from the 
choices offered. Then compare your answers to the analysis on the next page. 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 1: </STRONG>Many meetings seem to have 
no clear purpose. </P><PRE class=ct>     a.   Restrict meetings to one issue only.
     b.   Prepare an agenda in advance, including the desired
          outcome for each agenda item.
     c.   Prohibit people from raising issues not on the agenda.
</PRE>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 2: </STRONG>People arrive late so 
meetings never start on time. </P><PRE class=ct>     a.   Allow an extra five minutes only for latecomers.
     b.   Start on time. As latecomers arrive, quickly
          summarize for them what's happened before their arrival.
     c.   Start on time. Appoint a note taker to make detailed
          meeting notes on flipchart pages. As latecomers
          arrive, refer them to the notes to catch up on
          what has happened.
</PRE>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 3: </STRONG>Meetings drag on and on. 
</P><PRE class=ct>     a.   Set a rule that all meetings will last only one
          hour.
     b.   Hold stand-up meetings.
     c.   Appoint a timekeeper whose job is to be fanatical about
          sticking to a schedule with predetermined ending times.
</PRE>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 4: </STRONG>The boss dominates the 
meeting. </P><PRE class=ct>     a.   Advise the group in advance on its role for each agenda
          item: to acquire information, to give input so the boss
          can make an informed decision, or to make a group
          decision.
     b.   Appoint a facilitator, other than the boss, who can
          take responsibility for ensuring everyone is heard.
     c.   As the boss, keep silent until everyone else has spoken.
</PRE>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 5: </STRONG>Meetings are like broken 
records. People repeat over and over the same things they said at previous 
meetings. </P><PRE class=ct>     a.   Restrict everyone to speaking just once on each agenda
          item.
     b.   Ask people in advance to avoid dragging out their
          favorite hobby horses.
     c.   When people repeat themselves, point to where their
          comments are already recorded on the flip chart.
</PRE>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 6: </STRONG>One or two individuals 
dominate the meeting. </P><PRE class=ct>     a.   Restrict everyone to speaking just once on each agenda
          item.
     b.   Thank the talker for all his or her helpful input and
          ask the person to be patient while others share their
          ideas.
     c.   For the next meeting, appoint the talker to be
          facilitator or recorder.
</PRE>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 7: </STRONG>Some people are negative 
about everything. </P><PRE class=ct>     a.   For each idea, get pluses first, then minuses.
     b.   Ask the naysayers to prove their allegations.
     c.   Seat negative types so they are surrounded by more
          optimistic people.
</PRE>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 8: </STRONG>Discussions turn into 
arguments. </P><PRE class=ct>     a.   Cut off arguments immediately.
     b.   Set a ground rule: Agree before refuting.
     c.   Conflict is healthy. Let people fight it out.
</PRE>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 9: </STRONG>When a decision is made by 
majority vote, the dissenting minority doesn't support it on the job. </P><PRE class=ct>     a.   Make every effort to come to consensus decisions.
     b.   Assign the dissenters specific roles in implementing
          the decision and monitor their performance carefully.
     c.   Avoid giving important implementation roles to
          dissenters.
</PRE>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Problem 10: </STRONG>People leave meetings 
confused about the outcomes and what is expected of them. </P><PRE class=ct>     a.   Close each meeting with a question and answer
          period.
     b.   Close each meeting by assigning follow-up tasks to
          everyone.
     c.   Close each meeting by recapping the key discussion
          points and confirming all actions to be taken.
</PRE><A name=AN9502082712-13></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>How did you rate? 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Best answers to the quiz on the preceding page: 1-b, 
2-c, 3-c, 4-a and b, 5-c, 6-b and c, 7-a, 8-b, 9-a, 10-c. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Let's take a closer look at solving common meeting 
problems. </P><A name=AN9502082712-14></A>
<H4>Meetings with No Clear Purpose </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>The first commandment of meeting management is: Always 
prepare an agenda in advance. Include not only topics to be addressed but also 
the time for each topic and the expected outcome. An expected outcome isn't a 
predetermined solution. It is notification of what's expected of meeting 
participants. For example, if "cost cutting" were an agenda item, the expected 
outcome might be "three viable approaches to cutting department costs by 15 
percent." </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The preset agenda isn't cast in stone. As the meeting 
begins, invite participants to add to the agenda and renegotiate allotted times, 
taking new items into account. Limit items to a number that can be addressed in 
the time allowed. </P><A name=AN9502082712-15></A>
<H4>Late Starts </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>If you wait even five minutes to accommodate latecomers, 
more people will come five minutes later next time. People adjust their arrivals 
to when they expect the meeting to start. If you always start on time, you send 
a powerful message. And you won't have to disrupt the meeting to update 
latecomers if you appoint a recorder to keep detailed notes on flipcharts. 
Latecomers can catch up by reading the notes. </P><A name=AN9502082712-16></A>
<H4>Meetings That Drag on Interminably </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>When conversations get intense, it's hard to attend to 
time constraints. So, appoint a timekeeper and adhere zealously to his or her 
reminders. When a topic deserves extra time, either the manager or group should 
decide whether to drop an agenda item to allow more time for the hot one or to 
defer continued discussion of the hot one to another meeting. The latter course 
allows time for a new perspective and for the gathering of new information. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Some people are advocates of stand up meetings to keep 
people from settling in. While the stand-up approach works for ad hoc meetings, 
it's not feasible for two hours of agenda items. </P><A 
name=AN9502082712-17></A>
<H4>When the Boss Won't Let Go </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>Managers can dominate meetings in two ways. Either they 
do all the talking, or they ask for input but make decisions that ignore it. 
After a few such meetings, people tune out mentally. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Be upfront. If people are there just to listen, tell 
them so in advance. If you want their opinions so you can make a good decision 
yourself, tell them that, and show them how what they say will help you. If you 
commit to group decision making, stick to that promise. Be careful not to coerce 
others into agreeing with you just because you are the boss. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The best way to police yourself is to appoint someone 
else to facilitate the meeting. Then you can participate like everyone else. Be 
sure to pick a facilitator with the skill and courage to restrain you if, in 
your enthusiasm, you begin to take over. </P><A name=AN9502082712-18></A>
<H4>Meeting Reruns </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>You know the scenario. Everyone brings a favorite axe to 
grind. Restricting how often people talk doesn't work because it restricts new 
input also. Restraining people from raising their pet peeves just validates 
their conviction that no one is listening to them. Instead, to discourage the 
rehashing of old issues, begin by legitimizing them: Record all remarks on the 
flip chart. The second time an issue comes up, point to the record to indicate 
the concern has been heard. </P><A name=AN9502082712-19></A>
<H4>Nonstop Talkers </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>Writing meeting notes on flip charts helps control the 
nonstop talker too. While thanking the person for giving input, you can point 
out all her recorded remarks. Their abundance will be a reminder that she has 
dominated the meeting. Ask her to join you in encouraging others to share their 
ideas. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>You may be able to control a loudmouth next time by 
appointing him or her facilitator or recorder. Both roles are highly visible, 
which will make an attention-seeker happy, but both restrain the job holder from 
giving input. </P><A name=AN9502082712-20></A>
<H4>Negative People </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>To keep the naysayers from poisoning the atmosphere, 
make it a practice to defer negative comments until you have a list of what 
people like about an idea. With the pluses staring them in the face (from the 
flipchart), people won't be so strongly swayed by negative comments. The owners 
of each idea will have backing to support their opinions when confronted by 
"That'll never work." </P><A name=AN9502082712-21></A>
<H4>Meeting or Melee </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>To keep meetings from disintegrating into arguments, try 
this ground rule: First agree, then refute. That means that before anyone 
criticizes someone else's idea, the critic must find something in that idea to 
agree with. Then the critic states his or her opinion as an addition to the 
idea, not a negation of it. </P><A name=AN9502082712-22></A>
<H4>Majority Rules But Minority Wins </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>Voting produces a win-lose solution. And sometimes the 
losers take all by sabotaging implementation. Guide the group to a consensus 
decision instead. Remember, consensus doesn't mean everybody has to love the 
outcome. Rather, it means everyone can live with it. So work on revising those 
parts of a potential solution that some participants can't live with. </P><A 
name=AN9502082712-23></A>
<H4>What Next? </H4>
<P class=body-paragraph>Before closing any meeting, summarize all the key 
discussion points. Then ask each person to recap what he or she is going to do 
to implement the decisions made. And be sure to follow up with a written record 
of the decisions and tasks. Then keep in touch with people to find out how they 
are progressing. </P>
