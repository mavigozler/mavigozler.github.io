<H1 class=delivery-title>CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE MEETINGS </H1>
<P class=body-paragraph>Like most accounting professionals, you undoubtedly find 
yourself attending many meetings throughout your work week--from department 
get-togethers to discussions focused on specific company initiatives. While many 
of these meetings are productive, there have likely been times when you've 
questioned why you were asked to attend. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>In a recent survey by our company, executives reported 
that they waste 7.8 hours per week, or 2.3 months per year, in unnecessary 
meetings. So what can you do to ensure you don't create this type of situation 
when it's your turn to lead a meeting? Here are some tips: </P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Determine whether the meeting is necessary. Is 
  there a compelling reason to have one? Every meeting should have a purpose 
  that everyone can relate to and support--even if it's simply to bring people 
  together for brainstorming or team-building exercises. Consider whether the 
  issue at hand can be addressed effectively through informal gatherings or 
  e-mail communication instead. </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Select the right location. While a conference 
  room may be the appropriate venue for some meetings, it may not be the best 
  option for others. For example, if your goal is to generate new ideas to 
  improve your company's accounting procedures, an off-site location may provide 
  a more creative environment. Or if you want to encourage a casual discussion, 
  consider holding the meeting in a less formal place such as someone's office 
  or an outside courtyard. </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Focus on the primary objective when selecting 
  participants. Determine whose job responsibilities will be impacted most by 
  the topic of discussion. Can anyone else provide valuable input? Is attendance 
  critical, or would a memo detailing the meeting's outcome suffice? 
</SPAN></LI></UL>
<P class=body-paragraph>Keep in mind that some people may feel slighted if 
they're not asked to attend. When in doubt, explain the purpose of the meeting 
and let the individual decide whether to participate. </P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Create a written agenda. Provide attendees with 
  an outline before the meeting so they can prepare to address key issues. An 
  agenda will help ensure that your meeting about year-end financial reporting 
  requirements doesn't stray into a discussion about what people plan to bring 
  to the company picnic. </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Be punctual. Unless there's a critical reason 
  for a delay, always start your meetings on time. When people arrive late and 
  see that the discussion hasn't even started yet, there's little incentive for 
  them to show up on time for future meetings. Also be sure to end at the 
  appointed time. If important issues still need to be reviewed by the end of 
  the meeting, offer attendees the option of staying or rescheduling at another 
  time. </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Take notes. Make sure someone writes down key 
  points brought up during the meeting. These notes will serve as a reminder of 
  action items and a summary of what happened for those who couldn't attend. 
  </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Solicit input from everyone. As the facilitator, 
  it's your responsibility to lead the discussion and encourage participation 
  from those who may not otherwise express their views during meetings. </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Keep the group focused. While you don't want to 
  discourage creativity, make sure that attendees follow the agenda items. If 
  topics come up that require significant time for debate, consider whether they 
  can be addressed at another meeting. Remember, your goal is to achieve the 
  objectives you've identified for this particular discussion. </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Reassess how you conduct meetings. Recognize 
  that what worked well for you in the past may not be the best method under 
  current circumstances. For instance, now that a particular project is coming 
  to an end, it may no longer be essential to hold weekly meetings with all 
  participants. Ask others for feedback on how you can make your meetings more 
  productive and effective. </SPAN>
  <LI><SPAN class=medium-normal>Monitor how the group interacts. Try to pay 
  attention to how the attendees work together. If someone seems to have 
  concerns about any aspect of the meeting, talk with him or her individually 
  afterward. Also, take note of any problems with the overall team dynamic. If 
  the group will be meeting regularly, it may be useful to bring in an outside 
  facilitator where practical to resolve any conflicts so future discussions can 
  progress smoothly. </SPAN></LI></UL>
<P class=body-paragraph>Companies today are encouraging interdepartmental 
communication through greater use of project teams while also demanding 
heightened employee productivity and efficiency. This makes it critical to know 
how to manage group discussions. By giving careful consideration to each 
discussion and taking the time to evaluate which techniques work best for you, 
you can help everyone get the most out of meetings. </P>
