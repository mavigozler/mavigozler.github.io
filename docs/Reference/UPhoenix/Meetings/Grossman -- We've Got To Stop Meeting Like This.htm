<DIV class=print-ft-content>
<H1 class=delivery-title>WE'VE GOT TO START MEETING LIKE THIS </H1>
<P class=body-paragraph>We've all been there. Stuck in yet another agonizingly 
boring, ineffective, unproductive meeting. When, we wonder, can we get back to 
our real work? We're happy to report that there are exceptions to this sad state 
of affairs. We've checked out a variety of organizations to see what we could 
learn about making meetings work. Here's a look at some of the more creative 
strategies and tools we discovered. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>"OK, hands up." </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>With that simple phrase and a raising of the leader's 
hand, meetings at City Year, a Boston-based, nationwide nonprofit service 
organization, are called to order. Other hands shoot up as one by one, 
conversations cease, until all is quiet. Although City Year uses this physically 
engaging meeting-start-up technique in groups as small as a dozen, it's 
especially valuable with large groups, says Edith Buhs. Buhs is the national 
director of the Academy, the training arm of City Year, which teaches 
effective-meeting techniques and provides tools--not only to City Year's 1,200 
staff and corps members but also to interested nonprofit and for-profit 
corporations. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Effective-meeting workshops were originally deemed 
necessary because of the youth and diversity of City Year's members, but 
experienced meeting goers could easily adopt some of City Year's power tools. 
Most meetings begin with a warm-up exercise of some kind. At a recent meeting 
anticipating the organization's 10th anniversary, a four-by-eight-foot 
magazine-cover mock-up commemorating the event encouraged big thinking: 
participants generated ideas for the stories the "magazine" would feature. Other 
meetings might begin with what are called "ripples," named for a phrase in a 
speech by Robert F. Kennedy, in which he said that acts of courage send a "tiny 
ripple of hope." Anyone can share a ripple. The ripple may be something that 
happened within the organization. Or maybe it's something from last night's 11 
o'clock news. The point is to celebrate the good, to create an updraft of 
positive emotion. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Most City Year meetings employ a ground rule called 
NOSTUESO to keep domineering or wordy individuals from monopolizing discussions 
and to ensure that all voices are heard. The acronym stands for "No One Speaks 
Twice Until Everybody Speaks Once." </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Meeting leaders are also taught to end their meetings 
with another meeting, a minimeeting called "+(delta)." The mission: to quickly 
assess the meeting itself. Under the plus sign, leaders write down what worked. 
Under the delta symbol, they record changes that need to be made, phrasing those 
recommendations in positive terms: not, for instance, "Meeting too long," but 
rather "Meeting should be shorter." </P><A name=AN0000423208-2></A><SPAN 
class=medium-bold>The Computer-Aided Note Taker </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Organization: Mattel Media, a division of giant Mattel 
Toys in El Segundo, Calif. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Purpose of Meeting: To develop products </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>"If people are writing things down, they're often not 
paying attention," says Andy Rifkin, senior vice-president of creative 
development for Mattel Media. Thus, there's no note taking allowed at Rifkin's 
new-product-idea meetings, creative huddles of seven or eight people. Just one 
self-proclaimed "technographer," Bernie DeKoven, records everyone's ideas on a 
laptop, the entries appearing before the group either on a 35-inch color monitor 
or projected onto the wall. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>DeKoven--whose title at Mattel is "doctor fun/staff 
designer"--is not your ordinary note taker. An expert in meeting dynamics, he 
founded the Institute for Better Meetings, which nowadays takes a backseat to 
his full-time duties at Mattel. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Unlike whiteboards, which fill up and have to be erased, 
the holding tank in DeKoven's computer is boundless. Following the group's 
direction, he can edit ideas as he goes along, drag related notions alongside 
each other, rerank choices, and, without saying a word, redirect everyone's 
attention merely by scrolling back to earlier notations. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Even without a meeting maven like DeKoven on board, you 
still might want to consider the idea of having one person take notes on a 
computer, because of a key additional benefit: everyone can leave the meeting 
with a hard-copy record in hand, and that instant meeting record can be E-mailed 
to the rest of your company. As a plus for Mattel, DeKoven stores what he and 
Rifkin call "boneyard" ideas--ideas that are rejected in the meeting--in a 
separate section of the notes. Out of sight but easily brought back to mind, 
some of those dismissed notions often become valuable later on in the context of 
another project. Touring with toy buyers a while back, Rifkin heard repeated 
requests for activity-based toys for boys. Picking through the boneyard of a 
year-old meeting, he found a Hot Wheels CD-ROM concept for designing and 
decorating cars and printing licenses and tickets. Thus did Hot Wheels Custom 
Car Designer go from idle to high speed in about 6.5 seconds. It has disappeared 
from toy-store shelves almost as quickly. The meeting moral: Don't flush your 
rejects. </P><A name=AN0000423208-3></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Standing-Room 
Only </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Organization: The Phelps Group, a Santa Monica, Calif., 
marketing agency </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Purpose of Meeting: To build camaraderie and cooperation 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Every Monday at 9:28 a.m., Joe Phelps goes on the 
public-address system with a "two-minute warning." Each of his 50 or so 
employees heads for an all-purpose room, where most of them remain standing. The 
carrot for prompt attendance and the first item on the agenda: a $100 bill to 
the employee whose phone extension is drawn at random--if he or she can 
correctly answer a question from the employee handbook. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The meetings themselves move through the same five 
agenda headings each week. After the drawing, the second item on the agenda is 
for the company's teams--advertising, direct marketing, production, and 
media--to show off their new work. The third is to announce important agency or 
client business. The title of the fourth agenda item, "Minutes," is a clarion 
call for brevity. Each of the teams delivers a one-minute mini-lesson, teaching 
the group about some key piece of expertise or perhaps handing out and 
summarizing a helpful article. There's also a technology minute, a grammar 
minute (on the use of quotation marks, for instance), and an office-machine 
minute (which might cover, say, copier jams). </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The last agenda item: the Atta Boy/Atta Girl Award. This 
two-by-two-foot wooden plaque, festooned with personal effects (pennies from the 
company controller, a Pez dispenser), is awarded each week. The current award 
holder selects the next recipient and passes on the ever-more-decorated plaque, 
which has become a powerful company totem. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>"It's great to have a group experience at the beginning 
of the week," says CEO Phelps. It's one counterbalance to the increasingly 
technology-enabled workplace, which fosters less and less face-to-face contact. 
</P><A name=AN0000423208-4></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Get Ready, Get Set--Type! 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Organization: Any group with $5,000 to spend on one 
meeting </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Purpose of Meeting: To generate and select ideas </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>For $5,000 a day, meeting facilitator Douglas Griffen, a 
managing partner of D.S. Griffen &amp; Associates, of Scottsdale, Ariz., will 
arrive at your doorstep with networked laptops, a server, a laser printer, and 
even a CD player. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>At one particular meeting, the question on the table is 
"What new markets can we enter?" The question appears on 20 laptop screens set 
up around a U-shaped table. You type a suggestion and hit the submit key. Your 
screen clears and asks, "What else?" You can see everybody's ideas on the top 
half of your screen. One of those suggestions gives you an idea, which you 
quickly type and submit. Fifteen minutes of brainstorming passes--and nobody has 
said a word. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>What does this get you? More ideas and quick, reliable, 
computer-assisted skimming of the cream, says Griffen. Lively jazz pumps up the 
energy level. Theoretically, all 20 people at the meeting can talk 
simultaneously--and anonymously. No more wasting time kissing up to the boss's 
idea. No more inhibitions on those reluctant to speak up. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>With brainstorming in progress, Griffen watches as many 
as 200 ideas bubble up on his screen, as he scans for the 12 to 15 prominent 
themes. He projects a tentative list of those themes onto a big screen for all 
to see, and the group adds and subtracts ideas. Then it's back to the laptops. 
Participants now rank the ideas--"Tag 'em, move 'em, drop 'em"--on their 
screens. As soon as the last person hits the vote key, the results are 
instantaneous. The advantage: participants can spend time focusing on the 
top-rated ideas instead of wasting time shooting down the easy marks. </P><A

<P class=body-paragraph>Organization: Domino's Pizza </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Purpose of Meeting: To review an employee's aspirations, 
needs, and achievements </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Tom Monaghan, founder and president of Domino's Pizza 
Inc., with headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich., conducts individual job-planning 
and review (JP&amp;R) meetings--each at least two hours long, and sometimes far 
longer--with his six executive vice-presidents, plus his chief of staff, once a 
month. "My first job planning and review with Tom Monaghan lasted eight hours," 
says Don Vlcek, who was hired in the late 1970s and ran the company's 
$600-million-a-year distribution subsidiary until 1994, when he left to form his 
own consulting firm in Plymouth, Mich. Now JP&amp;R sessions are a key component 
of Vlcek's executive workshops. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Spending several hours a month with those you supervise 
may seem like Meeting Impossible. But don't stop reading. Other aspects of these 
reviews may strike a chord with you. For one thing, talk of salary is forbidden 
in a JP&amp;R meeting. Even more interesting, the subordinate, not the superior, 
leads the discussion, moving point by point through 10 areas of a review form 
that the subordinate has filled out in advance. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Vlcek's JP&amp;R meetings include a discussion of the 
subordinate's dream or mission (a chief financial officer, for instance, might 
strive for 100%-accurate profit-and-loss statements that are never a day late, 
with zero past due in collections or payments to suppliers), an analysis of his 
or her role (what the employee does on a regular basis), a discussion of the 
employee's needs (both professional and personal, or the need for new software 
or more employees), and a report on achievements (accomplishments of the last 30 
days) and struggles (which provides an opportunity to admit screwups before the 
boss identifies them). The benefit to the boss: a framework to diplomatically 
address job concerns. He or she might say, "Instead of this, I think I'd like to 
see you doing more of that." The meeting closes with a review of the goals and 
an action plan to meet them. And 30 days later, you're back revisiting those 
goals. Over time, says Vlcek, you learn to ask yourself, Can it wait till the 
JP&amp;R? "Eighty-five percent of the time, it can," he says. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>But how do you find time for all the hours spent in 
JP&amp;Rs? Vlcek tells of an executive who countered, "I have seven people 
reporting to me; I can't spend 21 hours a month doing this." Vlcek handed him a 
stopwatch and provided these instructions: "Keep it with you. When you're 
spending your time on something that's screwed up, on something that other 
people are paid to do and now you're doing, when you're reexplaining things, 
start this stopwatch. I guarantee you, over the course of a month you'll spend 
more than 21 hours--because you and your people haven't come to mental agreement 
on key issues." The executive called back five days later; he was already up to 
25 hours on the stopwatch. </P><A name=AN0000423208-6></A><SPAN 
class=medium-bold>Follow the Dots </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Organization: An educators' task force </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Purpose of Meeting: To write a vision statement for a 
new-concept high school in two sessions </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>To get from ground zero to a developed concept in only 
two sessions lasting two and a half hours each: that was the task facing a dozen 
educators charged with drafting the vision statement for a new public high 
school, a magnet-style school to be located on the grounds of the Minnesota 
Zoological Gardens. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The group succeeded, thanks to a high-speed, 
high-performance meeting powered by--no kidding--index cards. These workaday 
note cards form the backbone of a meeting method called "compression planning." 
A low-tech equivalent of computer-mediated meetings, the technique is taught in 
workshops by the McNellis Co., in New Brighton, Pa. GM has used it. So has 
Habitat for Humanity. And so did facilitator Burton A. Cohen, to run the 
meetings that gave birth to the now three-year-old School for Environmental 
Studies, in Apple Valley, Minn. (Cohen is now a teacher and administrator at the 
school.) </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>One idea of this storyboarding system that could be 
adapted to almost any meeting: there's no clean slate at the start. On the first 
board is a statement announcing the purpose of the meeting. On other boards 
appear ground rules: "We listen to each other." "No speeches." "We address 
ideas, not people." A meeting leader need only point to a statement to remind 
attendees of the guidelines. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>At the school meeting, two designated people recorded 
ideas on three-by-five cards. Another person stuck them on fabric-covered boards 
four feet square. A designated timer watched the clock, signaling the 
facilitator when it was time to move from the exploration or brainstorming phase 
of the meeting to the focusing phase, then to the concept board, and finally to 
the action board. In the focusing phase, ideas were winnowed out and categorized 
by colored dots. Everybody converged on the boards, selecting their favorite 
ideas by sticking a dot on the appropriate card. Consensus was easy to spot. 
Everything was out in the open, and all eyes were on the ideas. </P><A
