<H1 class=delivery-title>A LEADERSHIP PROFILE OF AMERICAN PROJECT MANAGERS </H1>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>• </STRONG>Abstract </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>This paper reports the results of a survey of senior 
project managers. The results clearly and unequivocally identify positive 
success and negative leadership as the cause of project failure. The 
characteristics of leadership are further identified, as well as the project 
management tools that are most useful and most often used. It can be concluded 
that organizational effectiveness requires project managers to combine their 
technical competency with the ability to develop and display leadership. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Keywords: leadership; organizational effectiveness; 
project management tools; effective project management </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Although the needs and demands of clients have always 
been the highest priority for any project manager, increasing global 
competition, ever heightening client expectations, and the magnitude of the 
projects impact on a firm's bottom line has begun to place greater emphasis on 
the skills necessary to successfully lead today's project teams. Historically, 
strong technical skills and knowledge of the industry would have been the key 
selection criteria. It was, in many cases, simply assumed that men and women who 
possessed these qualities would lead the project to a successful completion. 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Today's complex project environments require even 
greater skills at leadership than ever before. "Cookie-cutter" formula-based 
management was probably never correct, but in today's environment it will 
inevitably lead to disaster. Performance expectations for quality, cost 
effectiveness, timely delivery, and a host of other client measures are 
ratcheted-up a notch each year. In the highly competitive arena in which most 
projects operate, be they external or internal, the requirement to produce 
results that exceed client expectations has become the norm. As one respondent 
shared, "I have not worked on a project in the past five years that was not 
viewed by the client as being 'fast track;" The stakes are high, and getting 
higher. The days when cost overruns and delayed completion were common are 
history. So are the projects where technical personnel were once allowed to 
"experiment" until they got it right. With the managerial practices of 
outsourcing, downsizing, total quality management and continuous improvement 
becoming even more prevalent in our organizational environment, it can be 
expected that project managers are experiencing increased performance pressures. 
Internal project managers are possibly just as vulnerable to not having their 
contracts renewed as external consultants and contractors. </P><A 
name=AN0000317033-2></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Recent Literature </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Jeffrey Pinto and Om Kharbanda shed light on this 
problem in two journal articles published in Business Horizons, "Lessons for an 
accidental profession" (1995) and "How to fail in project management" (1996). 
These authors emphasize the increased need for project managers. "Increasingly 
technically complex products and processes, vastly shortened time-to-market 
windows, and the need for cross-functional expertise make project management an 
important and powerful tool in the hands of organizations that understand its 
use" (Pinto &amp; Kharbanda, 1995). In their follow-up article, "How to fail in 
project management," the authors write a stinging criticism of the practices 
that combine to produce project failures (Pinto &amp; Kharbanda, 1996). Karen 
Ayas (1996) takes a broader brash to the whole issue through what she describes 
as a "project network structure." The design of the system should "stress the 
synergies between organizational strategy, structure, culture and systems to 
allow organizations to build and expand learning capacity." The application of 
"process management view" to project management was reported recently in Harvard 
Business Review. The study of leading companies such as AT&amp;T, 
Hewlett-Packard and Raychem over an eight-year time span led the author to 
report that, "managers can benefit by applying a process management approach to 
their product development process. Companies can create an aggregate plan that 
allows them to assign practices to their projects with an estimate of needed 
resources ... managers can eliminate congestion and long hours by evening out 
workloads" (Alder, Mandelbaum, Nguyen, &amp; Schwerer, 1996). (See also Jungen 
&amp; Wowalczyk, 1995.) </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Bob Lewis (Info World, 1996) sets forth the five keys 
that he believes differentiate successful projects from the others: scope 
control; regular, concrete, reasonable results; weekly status meetings; team 
buy-in to the plan; and walking around. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Project management is considered a vital tool for the 
implementation of business process reengineering. "Project management allows 
organizations to break things down into simple processes and assign these 
activities and modules to individuals. This approach helps organizations 
identify existing built-in dependencies among processes ... A multidimensional 
forum for enterprisewide visibility is essential and will lead to significant 
productivity and cost savings. ... Project management is the organizational 
'glue' that binds together dispersed, high accountable teams throughout the 
organization. Teams will seek and demand a framework to ensure their success 
under the new rules of rapidly changing intensely competitive markets. Project 
management provides the framework, encourages dispersed leadership and provides 
visibility of effort to stakeholders throughout the organization" (King 1996). 
Clearly, project managers are being viewed as pivotal leaders in the 
introduction and implementation of both operational and behavioral managerial 
changes. Are project managers viewing their roles and responsibilities in the 
same light as the authors of leading journal articles? What do practicing 
project managers believe are the critical characteristics necessary to be 
effective? On the other hand, what factors contribute to producing ineffective 
project managers? On the operational side, what do they see as the primary 
causes of projects that fail to meet budgetary and time constraints? What do 
they see as the most effective project management "tools," and the extent to 
which these "tools" contribute to the success of a project? Finally, how 
powerful is "the leadership factor" in the success of a project and what are the 
specific characteristics and behaviors of leaders that will have a positive 
influence on organizational effectiveness in the next decade? The authors found 
no research that specifically addressed these questions nor reported results 
obtained directly from project managers. </P><A name=AN0000317033-3></A><SPAN 
class=medium-bold>Research Instrument Design </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>The research instrument was compressed of both 
open-ended and forced-answer questions. In addition, the respondents were asked 
their agreement or evaluation of several statements through the application of a 
traditional five-point Likert scale ranging from a high of 5 to low of 1. The 
completed instrument was then pretested by 12 project managers and executives in 
a number of firms. All suggestions were incorporated into the final research 
instrument. The research instrument was then mailed to a selected sample of 100 
senior-level project managers who, it was assumed, would possess a wealth of 
experience regarding the issues being studied. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The authors received 76 usable responses to the research 
instrument from the mailing of 100. The extremely high response rate was due in 
part to an aggressive premailing and postmailing telephone campaign. The 
respondents were all relatively senior project managers with a minimum of 10 
years experience in project management. All of the project managers surveyed 
were employed in large architectural and engineering consulting companies. 
</P><A name=AN0000317033-4></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Research Results and 
Discussion </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>What Are the Characteristics of Effective Project 
Managers? The following results (presented in Table 1) were obtained from an 
open-ended question that asked respondents to list, in rank order, the 
characteristic that they believed was essential for effectiveness. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Possibly the most interesting aspect of the project 
manager's responses to this question was the fact that technical competence was 
the third highest rated characteristic. Eight of the nine characteristics were 
managerial in nature, reflecting a basic understanding that effectiveness is 
directly related to the ability of the project manager to lead and manage more 
than simply possess exceptional technical skills. This finding is consistent 
with the academic literature, but is more powerful when drawn from open-end 
responses of experienced practicing project managers. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>What Factors Contribute to Ineffectiveness Among Project 
Managers? In order to examine the question of effectiveness in a different 
light, the project managers were then asked, via open-ended questions, the 
specific nature of personal flaws of project managers that directly contribute 
to ineffectiveness, as well as the organizational factors that produced the same 
results. The intent of these questions was to identify how both personal flaws 
and organizational factors contributed to producing an ineffective project 
manager. To a large degree the personal flaws are a reverse image of the 
characteristics of effective project managers from Table 1. There seems to be a 
good deal of internal consistency among the respondents (see Table 2). The 
organizational factors that contribute to becoming an ineffective project 
manager are equally relevant, but not surprising. Lack of upper-management 
commitment and support is a well-documented source of project problems. The 
project management literature has addressed each of the organizational barriers 
to effectiveness and it is again reinforcing to discover that the responses 
document that practicing project managers' perceptions fully support the 
literature. The past few decades have not seen the elimination of these classic 
sources of organizational ineffectiveness, although their negative impact on 
project performance has been known for some time. Resistance to change and a 
reactive approach to environmental turbulence are signs of a firm struggling 
with adjusting to new competitive conditions. Traditional reward systems are 
generally not well suited to project management. Traditional reward systems tend 
to have very little direct linkage between the performance criteria of a project 
and compensation. With competition being very intense in some sectors, some 
projects are priced and sold at dangerously thin multipliers with little 
opportunity to show a significantly positive return. When the realistic 
expectations for the project are not considered in the compensation plan, it can 
be expected that dissatisfaction with the compensation or reward systems are 
bound to be voiced. Project managers know that under difficult competitive 
conditions, jobs are taken to keep the staff utilized and the expected profit 
margin is possibly at breakeven. It is often just as difficult to manage a 
project with no expected profit than one with above average profit expectations. 
In addition, reward systems seldom reflect the nature and varying degrees of 
difficulty of the task and often focus solely on the final profit numbers. 
Failure to develop a reward system that reflects the specific nature of the 
project can create potential long-term conflicts. Consider how new market entry 
is normally achieved: the firm "buys" a project. The firm intentionally bids a 
project below what established competitors minimum bid to get the work and, 
hopefully, enter a new market successfully. Logic would suggest that a firm 
would want one of its best project managers to lead such a project to ensure 
success. But if the project affords no opportunity to earn a performance bonus 
based on project profitability who would volunteer to "take on" a known loser? 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph>In too many cases, organizational insensitivity to the 
negative realties created by poor organizational practices and policies are not 
understood or simply ignored. The result of these negative practices and 
policies is the eventual erosion of a potentially high-quality professional 
staff. The lack of upper management support and commitment results in a complete 
breakdown of trust and respect. One of the sure killers of motivation is when 
project managers become conditioned to being abandoned by their management at 
the first sign of client conflict. As one project manager described the 
situation: "it's like discovering that your management is sitting on the client 
side of the table at every meeting, and that you are left alone to defend every 
decision." It doesn't take too many such experiences before project managers 
modify their style of management to protect themselves. Under these conditions 
one is not likely to find that the project team is performing to the maximum 
potential. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>What Are the Primary Reasons That Projects Experience 
Budgetary and Timely Completion Problems? Table 3 reports the respondents' 
reasons for why projects run into budgetary and timing problems. The most 
frequent responses reflect both organizational and managerial problems. As an 
example, "failure to utilize the tools available to manage a project to 
completion in a timely fashion and within budget" was the most frequent 
response. "Poor leadership on the part of the project manager" was the second 
most frequently reported cause of problems. "Lack of effective 
interorganizational communication" and a "lack of timely decisions and 
corrective action" were also reported. The only external factor mentioned by the 
respondents was "the client's failure to respond in a timely fashion." Almost 
every project manager has dealt with clients who seemed unable or unwilling to 
make timely decisions yet retained their expectations that the project would be 
completed on time and within budget. It seems that managing the client is an art 
that only experience can teach. This need to learn the diplomacy of client 
management becomes increasingly important as a client-oriented strategy is 
recognized as essential to survival. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>What Are the Project Management "Tools" Most Often Used 
and How Effective Are They? Managing the project requires the skillful 
application of project management tools that are designed to assist the project 
team complete the project on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of the 
client. Table 4 reports the responses from experienced project managers 
regarding the extent to which they use eight recognized project management tools 
and the extent to which the tools contribute to the success of a project. As you 
would expect, the two highest rated tools (actually tying for first) were the 
project schedule and the project budget. Irrespective of project size or 
complexity, these project tools were rated highest in use and first and second 
in terms of contribution to the success of the project. Of the eight project 
management tools that the respondents were asked to evaluate, none were reported 
to be of no value. Some of the more detailed tools were used less often and 
consequently may have been perceived as less valuable to project success. 
Despite the discussion in the project management literature regarding the need 
to increase the degree of accuracy in the determination of the percentage of 
project completion, the "earned value reporting tool, was rated the least used 
and correspondingly reported to have made the least contribution to the success 
of a project. The top five project management tools most often reported as used 
(project schedule, project budget, project cost system, project execution plan, 
and client communication log) were also rated as making the greatest 
contribution to the success of the project. Clearb; more effective project 
managers exercise managerial discipline in the consistent application of what 
they have found to be the most valuable project management tools for achieving 
success. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>What Are the "Other" Factors That Contribute to the 
Success of a Project? In addition to the direct managerial actions that project 
managers can take through the implementation of project management tools, 
project managers focus on their managerial and leadership skills as controlling 
sources of influence that contribute to the successful completion of projects. 
Table 5 reports the source of influence on successful completion of a project as 
reported by the project managers surveyed. As expected, "the decision made by 
the client" was the strongest influence, with "responding to the changing client 
request" second. The third source of influence on the successful completion of a 
project is the "desire to excel," reflecting the strong positive personal 
motivation of project managers to make every project they lead a success. "The 
decision made by the project team" and "the pressures from inside the project" 
were the next highest rated sources of influence reflecting the need for the 
project manager to focus on the leadership of the project team. Equally 
interesting are the lowest rated sources of influence on the success of a 
project. Respondents give little or no credence to "luck" or "external politics" 
as barriers to success. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>How Critical Is the "Leadership Factor" to Project 
Success? Given the many factors that can directly or indirectly influence the 
success of a project, do project managers believe that there is one overriding 
factor that contributes to whether a project will be a success or a failure? In 
fact, the answer is yes. When asked to weigh the percentage of success or 
failure of a project that can be contributed directly to the pressure of either 
positive or negative leadership the responses were powerfully revealing (see 
Table 6). Positive leadership contributes almost 76% to the success of a 
project. Consider what this response means. Variation in project success can be 
contributed to the leadership displayed on the project by 76%. Equally 
meaningful is the second statistic: negative or poor leadership contributes 67% 
to the failure of projects. Clearly, firms that fail to train and reinforce the 
need for project managers to practice positive leadership seem to run an 
unacceptable risk. In a recent interview with five vice presidents of major 
engineering consulting firms, a question was posed regarding the number of 
projects in the past five years that failed due to a lack of technical 
competence on the part of the project manager or the project team. In what was 
estimated by them to be more than 1,000 projects, both large and small, the 
executives could recount only 10 failures due to lack of technical competence. 
Yet, when you ask most company executives what the most critical criteria for 
promotion to project manager is, technical competence generally leads the list 
of responses. Possibly what is absent is the recognition that technical 
competence must be supported by persons who are capable of managing a project 
and providing positive leadership to the team. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>All the evidence of recent research supports the idea 
that successful projects are led by individuals who possess a blend of technical 
and management knowledge, but beyond both, leadership skills. Sensitivity to the 
client's needs, the composition of the project team, the strategic importance of 
the project to the firm, and the technical requirements of the project reflect 
themselves in a continuous stream of communication and personal interactions 
that serve to reveal the true nature of the project manager. Project managers 
were asked to rate 50 characteristics or behaviors that they believed, based on 
their experience, would have a positive influence on organizational 
effectiveness in the next decade. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Tables 7 and 8 highlight the highest and lowest rated 
characteristics and behaviors and reveal some very interesting findings. The 
highest rated characteristics and behaviors build a profile of an individual 
that most of us would wish to work for. The profile reveals a leader who 
recognizes that it is absolutely essential to build a project team, reinforce 
positive behavior, communicate, demonstrate trust and respect, develop team 
members and empower them to perform and set goals while remaining flexible to 
respond to the inevitable changes. Important by their absence from the "golden 
dozen" are characteristics and behaviors such as technical expertise, 
individualistic, effective organizational politician, or detail oriented. The 
profession has moved beyond the mind-set that the best-qualified individual to 
promote to the project manager's position is the best technical person or some 
flashy politically savvy character with the "right contacts." Table 8 reports 
the characteristics and behaviors that practicing and experienced project 
managers rated as the 12 least important characteristics for the achievement of 
organizational effectiveness. Some of these responses were a surprise to the 
researchers while others were not. Project managers rated "strategic thinker" 
very low. This may be explained by the fact that many project managers are 
totally operations-oriented and become involved only when the job is sold. In 
terms of preparation for promotion into the firm's executive ranks this 
shortcoming could be costly. Yet, this lack of recognition of the need for the 
practice of strategic thinking may explain the managerial practices of some 
firms who employ project managers. </P><A name=AN0000317033-5></A><SPAN 
class=medium-bold>Conclusions </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>The results of this research should never be assumed to 
suggest that technical competence is no longer a relevant factor in project 
management selection. What can be concluded is that organizational effectiveness 
requires project managers to combine their technical competency with the 
application of proven project management tools that support project planning and 
control, and the need to practice leadership skills that are compatible with the 
internal motivation of the project team and externally compatible with client 
focus strategies. Figure 1 serves to combine these two approaches. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>As the pressures of global competition become more 
pronounced and the client's need to develop strategic partnership grows, 
performance expectations will increase correspondingly. It should be expected 
that our turbulent global competitive environment will remain a continuing 
source of change. Only firms that master the skills of early identification, 
selection, training, and development of project managers can expect to remain 
successful. Once the key project managers are in place, the firm's upper 
management must develop and implement a mutually beneficial reward and 
reinforcement process that recognizes the organizational reality that all 
revenues and profits are earned at the project level. In the long-term, upper 
management cannot be considered competent if the projects that generate 
shareholder value fail. The linkages between long-term organizational 
effectiveness and the management of the firm's total resources flow directly 
through every project leader. What has always amazed the authors is that 
high-powered successful project managers that consistently produce results cost
