<P class=medium-bold>Controlling the Project Variables </P>
<P class=body-paragraph><STRONG>Systems development productivity has always 
depended on competent project management. Effectively planning and controlling 
three variables--work, resources, and time--is what ensures project success. 
This article points out both the problems and the opportunities associated with 
project control. By understanding the dynamics and interrelationships of these 
variables, you can better manage resources, balance time and people, and keep 
your projects on course. </STRONG></P>
<P class=body-paragraph>EVERY IS MANAGER HAS BEEN involved in systems 
development projects that were less than totally successful. A survey by a large 
consulting firm found that 25% of large projects were canceled, 60% experienced 
significant cost overruns, 75% had quality problems, and less than 1% of all 
systems development projects were delivered on schedule and met requirements. 
This represents an awesome waste of an organization's resources. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>When faced with a potential systems development 
disaster, can the IS manager turn a project around and achieve success? Better 
still, can you institute measures that prevent projects from failing in the 
first place, thereby ensuring productive use of systems development resources? 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The answer is yes. This article offers a prescriptive 
approach to project control that has been consistently successful in achieving 
on-time delivery of systems that meet requirements. </P><A 
name=AN9705294351-4></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>KEYS TO GETTING STARTED </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>The key activities that occupy the project manager at 
the start of the project are planning and scheduling. These activities must also 
be repeated when attempting to salvage a project that is heading for disaster. 
</P><A name=AN9705294351-5></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Project Requirements 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Projects can and do fail if requirements are known, but 
there has never been a complete disaster when all requirements were fully 
defined, documented, understood, and agreed on by all involved parties. Many 
projects fail when resources are devoted to doing the wrong things. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>System scope, objectives, and requirements must be 
completely defined, documented, reviewed, and approved. This definition must 
take place before the initiation of a project or as the first activity 
undertaken during project execution. When a project is in trouble, requirements 
must be revisited, restated, and reapproved. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>In addition to defining the scope and objectives of the 
system to be developed, the project manager must also define the project in 
detail. This definition addresses the work to be done, the resources devoted to 
that work, and the time that the effort will take. Management must review and 
approve this project definition to ensure that resources are being applied 
productively. Systems development productivity results from the ability of the 
project manager to produce the greatest amount of work with the least resources 
in the shortest possible time. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Work. The work to be performed should be defined in such 
a way that when it is accomplished, the project will be successfully completed. 
Although it may sound elemental, this is not always the case. Given the current 
state of the art of systems development, it is unlikely that any two project 
teams, attempting to develop the same system within the same organization, would 
perform an identical set of tasks or activities in the same manner or sequence. 
It is also unlikely that they would produce the same results. No two systems are 
exactly alike. Each project defines its own work. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Standardized work processes are essential to systems 
development success. Stable and repeatable systems development procedures are 
required if IS managers are to effectively plan, schedule, and control work. 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Resources. Resources consumed are primarily the efforts 
of the personnel assigned to the project, but they also include dollars, 
computer time, purchased software, supplies, and management and support time. 
Resources may also be defined to include the tools and methodologies used. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Time. Time is defined for this article as the elapsed 
calendar time from the inception of the project to its successful completion. 
</P><A name=AN9705294351-6></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>PROJECT PLAN AND 
SCHEDULE: RELATING THE KEY VARIABLES AT PROJECT INCEPTION </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Once you have defined the work to be done, you can apply 
resources over time to accomplish that work. Intuition tells us that if one 
variable is held constant--in this case, the work to be done--then the other two 
variables can be adjusted in opposite directions. More resources to do the same 
work ought to take less time. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Intuition is correct, but only within certain limits. 
Unless project managers understand the dynamic interaction of the three 
variables of work, time, and resources, the negative effects of these dynamics 
during project execution will drive the project to disaster. </P><A 
name=AN9705294351-7></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Resources Versus Time </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Resources assigned past a certain level will not shorten 
project time. Beyond a point, more resources will actually lengthen the time it 
takes to develop a system. Brooks' Law states that adding resources to a late 
software development project makes that project later. Even at project 
inception, this holds true. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Usually, the formula is that no more people can be 
productively used on a project than the square root of the total amount of 
estimated worker months needed. If a project is estimated to take 100 worker 
months (8 1/2 years) of effort, then more than 10 people assigned to the project 
will not shorten the calendar time it takes to complete the project. Excess 
resources become wasted or counterproductive. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>This dynamic holds true because of the nature of systems 
development project work. Certain tasks require the output of other tasks. Tasks 
must be performed in a specified sequence. There is a limit to the number of 
concurrent tasks that can be performed effectively. After a certain point, tasks 
cannot be effectively broken down and assigned to more than one person. In 
addition, the more people assigned to a project, the more overhead is incurred 
in communications, management, and coordination of activities. If one person had 
all the requisite skills to complete a 100-worker-month project, that person 
could probably do so more efficiently and use less resources than a larger 
project team. However, you don't want to wait 8 1/2 years to find out. </P><A 
name=AN9705294351-8></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>The Law of Marginal Utility 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>The law of marginal utility operates in systems 
development projects. Accordingly, the second person assigned to a project will 
contribute less than the first; the third less than the second, and so on. 
Although each new person makes a positive contribution and thereby reduces the 
overall calendar time it takes to complete the project, at some point the 
marginal utility curve turns on us, and the next person's contribution becomes 
negative. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The actual contribution of the eleventh person in this 
example will probably not be negative, but you begin to see rapidly declining 
marginal contribution at about that point. Therefore, a 100-worker-month project 
should take at least 10 calendar months to complete no matter how many resources 
are assigned to it. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Because the productivity of each additional person added 
to the project will be less than the preceding person's, the average 
productivity of the entire project team is reduced. In allocating resources, 
management must achieve the optimal size of the project team that balances 
resources against time to achieve the most productive mix. </P><A 
name=AN9705294351-9></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Overall Elapsed Time </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>If after estimating the total elapsed time for the 
project you find that the project will take more than one calendar year to 
complete, you should seriously think about redefining the project. You can break 
the project into phases or define multiple projects. A 144-worker-month (12 
year) project,is about the largest discrete systems development project you 
should contemplate tackling. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>There are some compelling reasons not to undertake very 
large systems projects. First, an organization loses its attention span at some 
point. Other priorities intervene. Resources tend to disappear, through either 
attrition or reassignment. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Second, business conditions change. If a project cannot 
be completed within one calendar year of its inception, this project risks the 
delivery of an obsolete system from a business standpoint. Competition is moving 
more rapidly all the time. The government regulatory climate may change (this 
applies to virtually any industry). Reduced cycle time is a concept being 
preached for all products and services. It has always been true for effective 
information systems. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Third, the larger the project the greater the risk of 
failure. Even the best project managers and the best project management 
methodologies and tools become strained when attempting to control projects that 
are too large. Degrees of error in planning or estimating that would be easily 
correctable on small projects can be overwhelming on large ones. A 50% overrun 
on a project of one worker year can be handled. The same 50% overrun could prove 
fatal to a 20-worker-year project. Management must have the visibility and the 
ability to control overruns and cut losses, and this is much more likely on 
smaller projects. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Many organizations have obviously undertaken very large 
projects. Chances of success are significantly enhanced when a project is carved 
up so that a major implementation occurs at least once a year. This method also 
provides ongoing visibility and organizational commitment to the project. </P><A 
name=AN9705294351-10></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>The Role of Estimates </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Every organization has a way of estimating systems 
development projects. Whether this involves drawing lines on a Gantt chart, 
applying sophisticated estimating algorithms, or just stating what the dates 
must be, the project manager either develops or is given an estimate of how long 
a project should take. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Estimates that are based on fact and are accurate can be 
a tremendous advantage in project LLcontrol. Estimates that are no more than a 
guess or someone's wish can be extremely detrimental. Unless estimates have a 
real basis in fact and are developed by the individuals actually assigned to do 
the work, they are best ignored except when reporting progress to management. 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The value of estimates is in productively allocating 
resources and in coordination of task interdependencies. Estimates should not be 
used as evaluation tools. The project manager must be free to adjust plans and 
estimates on the basis of actual project feedback without having to explain why 
initial estimates were not totally accurate. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Remember, plans are guides. Estimates are just 
that--your best and most educated guess about what should happen. The reality is 
the actual project work that is being performed. If the reality does not always 
conform to the plan, it is likely that the plan may need some modifications. 
</P><A name=AN9705294351-11></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>FACTORS THAT DISRUPT THE 
BALANCE BETWEEN WORK, RESOURCES, AND TIME </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Systems development projects that cannot be completed in 
one calendar year should be restructured as multiple or phased projects. More 
than a certain amount of resources assigned to a project will not be productive. 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph>In many organizations, there are other factors that 
further reduce the manager's ability to productively plan and schedule resources 
over time to work on systems development projects. These factors work against 
the ideal relationships between work, resources, and time. </P><A 
name=AN9705294351-12></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Systems Development Methodology 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>A systems development methodology consists of two 
components: a systems development life cycle and a project management 
methodology. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is the guide 
that the project team follows; it defines the tasks that must be performed 
during the systems development process. Furthermore, it provides for correct 
ordering and interrelationships between these tasks. An SDLC should provide the 
stable and repeatable work processes that are essential to productive systems 
development planning and control. Without this definition, large projects are 
simply too complex to successfully plan and control. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Project management is not software. An automated project 
management system will not manage projects. Software is merely a tool to 
automate some of the functions of project scheduling and status reporting. In 
the hands of an effective project manager using a proven methodology, software 
may provide some benefits. However, the chief benefactors of these tools are 
higher-level management who want to know where resources have been expended. 
</P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Without a proven systems development methodology, 
organizations cannot hope to successfully accomplish projects requiring the 
effort of more than one or two persons. They can muddle through on smaller 
projects but are in trouble when they try to tackle anything larger. </P><A 
name=AN9705294351-13></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Systems Development Standards 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>A second factor that limits an organization's ability to 
productively use optimum levels of project resources over time is a lack of 
standards. People are limited in their ability to work independently on 
concurrent tasks because no one knows what will be produced by a task until that 
task has been completed. The quality of the work becomes purely subjective. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Where standards do not exist, management's span of 
control is reduced. Project managers must directly supervise personnel at a much 
closer level of detail. A manager may be able to supervise the work of 10 to 12 
people on a project for which standards are in force. Without standards, that 
same manager may only be able to coordinate the efforts of three or four people. 
For the organization, this has the further negative effect of reducing the 
contribution of the best people, because they must closely monitor the work of 
others. Lack of standards usually lowers overall organizational productivity. 
</P><A name=AN9705294351-14></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Task Splitting </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>A third factor that reduces an organization's ability to 
use resources productively is task splitting. By assigning personnel to more 
than one project, management may think that more things are being accomplished 
or that resources are being used more productively. In fact, the opposite is 
true. Task splitting has a negative effect on productivity and efficiency, and 
this reality should not be ignored. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>A person can devote 100% of his or her time to one 
project. That same individual will be productive only 40% of the time on each of 
two projects, 20% on each of three projects, and so forth. Deciding among tasks 
adds coordination and decision time. Time is lost in switching from one task to 
another. Task splitting is a notorious resource stealer. Dedicated resources are 
always the most productive. </P><A name=AN9705294351-15></A><SPAN 
class=medium-bold>PROJECT STATUS REPORTING: MONITORING PROGRESS AGAINST THE PLAN 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>For the project manager, project execution involves 
monitoring progress against the plan and schedule on a regular basis, 
recognizing deviations, and taking appropriate corrective action. The project 
manager is chiefly responsible for ensuring that the work meets all quality 
standards and that it conforms to requirements and specifications. Providing 
high project visibility to users and management is also a primary project 
management task. </P><A name=AN9705294351-16></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>It's 
90% Done--Or Work Completed, Resources Expended, Time Used </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>The project manager must invoke regular and formal 
status reporting. All project team members should report progress against the 
plan and schedule weekly. This reporting should be done at the lowest task 
level. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Each week, the project team members should answer the 
following questions about their assigned tasks: </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Is it done? </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>If it isn't done, when will it be done? </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>If it is behind schedule, what are the reasons? </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The intent of status reporting is to chart real progress 
and at the same time to verify the efficacy of the project plan, schedule, and 
estimates. Avoid any reporting of percentage of completion on any task, however, 
because this reporting is invariably overly optimistic and conveys no real 
information that the project manager can use. In any event, the tendency to 
report percentage of completion usually indicates that tasks are too large to be 
accomplished in a time period in which they can be effectively controlled. 
</P><A name=AN9705294351-17></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Provide High Visibility 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>When project managers report status to management and 
users, they should emphasize deliverable products. Managers should report 
progress against major milestones and major deliverable products as defined in 
the project plan. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>A project cannot be too visible. High visibility ensures 
management support. Management meddles in projects when it doesn't know what is 
going on. When and if the project hits rough sledding, the project manager will 
need the support of management to take action. This support must be nurtured 
through the confidence that comes from keeping management informed. </P><A 
name=AN9705294351-18></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Frequency of Status Reporting 
</SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Each member of the project team should have at least one 
task due for completion each week and on which to report. Under no circumstances 
should a team member ever have more than two weeks between task completion 
dates. If this is the case, go back to the plan and break the tasks down 
further. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Management isn't interested in weekly task level 
reporting, however. Status reporting that is too detailed (or too frequent) 
usually obfuscates rather than clarifies project status. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>A major milestone or deliverable product should be 
scheduled each month. Never let a project go more than two months without 
planning some significant event. The completion of a project phase with a formal 
report, including submission of the plan for the next phase, dramatizes progress 
most forceful!&gt;. The submission of a major deliverable product that requires 
management and user review and approval is also a critical event. If at least 
one of these events does not happen in more than two months, the project should 
be restructured and replanned. </P><A name=AN9705294351-19></A><SPAN 
class=medium-bold>Recognize Deviations Early </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>Equipped with accurate project status information, the 
project manager can assess progress and detect any deviations or problems at the 
earliest possible point. An axiom of effective project management is act early, 
act small. Corrective action can be instituted in small doses and in ways that 
will not be disruptive. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Upon receiving weekly project team status reports, the 
project manager must post actual progress against the plan and note any 
deviations. If the project or some members of the project team are consistently 
ahead or behind the estimates, think about adjusting estimates accordingly. 
Minor adjustments in estimates, scheduled task completion dates, and task 
assignments should be done weekly as the project progresses. These minor 
adjustments need not be communicated beyond the project team as long as they do 
not affect the scheduled dates for major milestones or deliverable products. 
</P><A name=AN9705294351-20></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>Identify Causes of 
Deviations </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>In even the best planned projects, deviations will 
occur. The first place to look for corrective action is in the plan itself. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>There will be times in the course of any project when 
monitoring progress and making minor adjustments to the plan will not be 
sufficient to keep the project on schedule. This may happen for any number of 
reasons, and the reasons will undoubtedly influence the actions the project 
manager may take. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The work may change because of changes in project scope. 
Resources may be lost to the project. Technology may be poorly understood. The 
project team may have problems interacting effectively. Computer time may be 
unavailable. When projects deviate significantly from plan and schedule, the 
dynamics of the key variables of work, resources, and time will determine the 
likelihood of success of any action that is taken to get the project back on 
schedule. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Leaving aside those occurrences that significantly alter 
the work to be done (such as changes in scope or incorrect requirements 
definition) the most frequently encountered problem is severe or persistent 
schedule slippage. The easiest course of action is to admit that estimates were 
overly optimistic and that the project will simply take more time to complete. 
However, persistent schedule slippage is more likely to be a symptom of 
underlying problems than the cause of the problem. Extending project time will 
not cure these problems and may only allow the project team to dig a deeper hole 
for itself. It is lack of time that forces most project teams to face the 
reality of failure. </P><A name=AN9705294351-21></A><SPAN

<P class=body-paragraph>If the project manager is thoroughly convinced that the 
problem is simply caused by overly ambitious estimates and schedules, then the 
schedule should be altered. Otherwise, under no circumstances will increasing 
resources against the same overall schedule be successful in and of itself. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>The project manager must subject a troubled project to 
detailed analysis, usually with the help of an independent party. Unless the 
underlying causes of problems are eliminated, the project will only experience 
greater problems as the project manager (and others) attempt to apply corrective 
action. Management must be supportive of this process. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Once appropriate corrective action has been initiated, 
the project manager must then go back to square one and prepare a formal project 
status report. Bearing in mind that the dynamics of work, resources, and time 
will be much different from what they were when the project was initially 
planned, the manager can then develop a new project plan and schedule. </P><A 
name=AN9705294351-22></A><SPAN class=medium-bold>CONCLUSION </SPAN>
<P class=body-paragraph>A predictable pattern results when project managers fail 
to understand the dynamics of work, resources, and time. First, schedules are 
extended, usually more than once. When this does not work, resources are added, 
making problems that much worse. Finally, in an attempt to bring the project to 
a conclusion, the work effort is cut back, often to the point at which the 
resulting system no longer meets the requirements it was originally meant to 
address. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>Heroic efforts to meet the original schedule by working 
large amounts of overtime for extended periods will not work. Error rates will 
soar, project communication will become increasingly difficult, and teamwork 
will be severely strained. Often this drives the project into a never-ending 
sequence of testing and error correction. These consequences often result 
because of management's inability to distinguish between effort and 
productivity. </P>
<P class=body-paragraph>By understanding and managing the interaction of the key 
variables of work, resources, and time, the project manager can productively 
plan and control systems development projects. Potential failures can be turned 
into successes. New projects can be launched with confidence in the likelihood 
of success--delivering systems that meet requirements on schedule and within 
budget and make the most productive use of the organization's systems 
development resources. </P>
