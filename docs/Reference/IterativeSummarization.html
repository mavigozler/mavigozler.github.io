<section style="border-top:none;">
Eons ago when I was a pre-med undergraduate at the University of California,
Davis, and among the 500 hopeful future applicants for every one admission to 
medical school available&mdash;at the same time <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_of_the_University_of_California_v._Bakke">one
Allan Bakke sued</a> to get into the medical school on my campus too&mdash;I was
extremely stressed about my lackluster performance in my freshman year at the
university.
<p>
I had never developed good studying habits in high school, because basically
high school was not much of a challenge to me.
<p>
It was easy to impress the teachers, get a 4.0 grade point average, and stand
at the top of the class. I always harbored some suspicion it would not be so 
easy at the next level&mdash; at a pretty good institution like the University 
of California.  I knew that my work ethic, which always had a healthy
dose of academic laziness and pathetic studying habits, would be my undoing.
<p>
In my first (freshman) year at the university, I was always allowing myself to
be distracted, to have my attention diverted to tangents. I was in the dorms
(dormitories). We had been liberated newly from the homes of our parents, and
we were not adults. Playing games. Putting off homework until tomorrow. Parties
in the dorm areas. Of course, that leads to never getting anything done, and to
misplaced priorities.  And at the end of my first year, the damage report came
in.  I was in a half comatose stare thinking, <q>Well there goes med school!</q>
<p>
So I resolved to make amends, and straighten up and fly right in order to get
into medical school.  Entering my second (sophomore) year, I was wondering to
myself about how I could retain such vast amounts of text that had to be read.
I knew that just sitting there and reading did nothing except put me to sleep.
I also knew that the fluorescent pens to highlight text was just as ineffective.
And then an idea struck me.
<p>
I basically improved my studying technique, one which falls into the category
of <i>active learning</i>.  I had developed something I call <dfn>iterative
summarization</dfn>.
</section>

<section>
What is <dfn>iterative summarization</dfn>?
<p>
The name has been chosen carefully.  Of course <q>iterative</q> refers to a
<em>repetitive process</em>.  And <q>summarization</q> refers to a process of
distilling the important or priority or essential elements or points from
a large body of information or text.
<p>
The only missing word in my ten dollar-phrase concept is <b>written</b>: the
process involves the act of writing, of forming written words that do not at
all copy-and-paste select sentences or paragraphs, but force the learner to
think about the large amount of information in front of the learner.
</section>

<section>
Rather than explain iterative summarization in the abstract,
let us proceed straight to an example.
<p>
In my days as an undergraduate, when students might have been assigned a large
number of pages from a textbook or book or other monograph to read as part of
the study, students would be in the library, mostly half-asleep, with their
yellow fluorescent highlighting pens in their hands, <span class="fluor-yellow">
marking up pages of text in yellow color like this,</span> for what they
considered to be the essential points of what they were reading.
<p>
This is a passive learning technique, at least compared to iterative
summarization.
<p>
What they instead should have been doing was the following:
<ol>
<li>Get out several pieces of blank (scratch) paper.
<li>As they were reading the text, write down a summary of what they were reading.
This summary might be somewhat long in wording, but in this initial step of
summarizing, of recording essential points, even if they are sentences or
sentence fragments, that was not to be something to worry about.
<li>In the course of doing reading and basically recording important or significant
concepts and points, the learner must take a break every now and then.  At least
once an hour.  For a four hour period of study, getting up and taking a 30 minute
food and drink break is mandatory.
<li>When the recording of points is done, and the learner has slept on them for
at least a day, the second phase begins:  a fresh set of scratch paper pages
are obtained, and the learner takes his first set of notes in hand and starts
reading them over.
<li>While reading those notes, the learner will be motivated to make more notes,
which become <q>notes of the notes,</q> or <q>a summary of the summary.</q>
One may not believe this works, but it does.
<li>Again the learner needs to take a break from this activity when a rather
long period passes, or it defeats the process of learning.
<li><b>Another iteration?</b>   For most cases, this first iteration or
summarizing the first summary is sufficient for having learned the material for
an undergraduate or even graduate level course, and certainly for those in
primary and secondary school.  For those engaged in very intense scholarly work
in which they are preparing to author a book, they might use this technique to
perform one more iteration, which would help them in developing an excellent
outline for any massive written work they hope to prepare and publish.
</ol>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Results?  When I adopted this technique, I started getting <q>A</q> grades and
making the Dean's list on a regular basis.  Oh, yes, there were some courses that
were particular challenges and I did not get an <q>A</q> every time&mdash;maybe
the occasional A&minus; or B+&mdash;but I am fairly sure if I had not incorporated
this technique into my study habits, I'd might have even flunked out as an
undergraduate.  I surely do not believe I would have gone to graduate school
to get a Ph.D.
<p>
Since my first use of iterative summarization, I have modified the learning
method for the 21st century.  I no longer really read texts from printed books
any longer and pretty much have become accustomed to reading PDFs on the screen
(yes, you can get used to it).  I also do not make notes on paper either as the
written form:  I type them into a simple text editor that eventually gets
HTML markup in it to make web pages.  The elements of iterative summarization
still apply
</section>

<h1>The Process</h1>
<section id="boxed">
<ol>
<li>Two things are necessary:
 <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
 <li>the reading material:  it might be a textbook or book, either in the form
 of a printed page or matter, or in digital format (PDF, etc).
 <li>the writing material:  it might be several pieces of blank (scratch)
 paper with a good (ballpoint) pen, or it might be the keyboard on a computer
 in which you have opened a simple text editor (Notepad in Windows, or your
 favorite one)
 </ol>
<li>After getting into a studying frame of mind, start the reading.  While reading
and comprehending, write down what is comprehended on the paper or entered into
the editor as a note in the form of a summary, or perhaps at this stage, as
a direct recording of sentences, sentence fragments, or phrases of what is read.
Call this the <b>first level summarization</b>.  
<li>When the reading is finished, and after a long break (overnight is recommended),
take the recorded notes or summaries, and obtain a new set of blank pages or
open another blank instance of the text editor application.  While reading the
notes or summaries, record selected or significant notes of those notes: in
other words, make a summary of the summaries.  Call this the <b>second level
summarization</b>.  
<li>When finished, and again after taking another long break, review the second
level summarization recordings.  Stick with those.
<li>Then it is recommended that the first level summarizations be reviewed.
<li>Third and fourth level summarizations are recommended
</ol>
<p>
Incorporate also into the method the following points:
<ul>
<li>At any time or point, refer to the original text that was read to clarify
unsure points or knowledge.
<li>As all studying techniques must do, this studying technique encourages
taking short breaks from time to time.  When you find yourself having to re-read
text to understand it, you are probably fatigued and need to talk a walk for
a while.
<li>Never study when sleepy:  it does not help in retaining knowledge and ends
up being a waste of time.  Get up and take a long nap or get a good night's sleep.
Do not drink strong coffee or take caffeine pills to force yourself in a wakeful
state.
</ul>
