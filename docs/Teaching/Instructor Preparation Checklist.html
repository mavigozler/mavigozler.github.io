      <li>Confirm that all lab apparatus, chemicals, and safety gear 
         (goggles, gloves, lab coats) are prepared.</li>
      <li>Check that any specialized instruments (spectrophotometers, pH meters, etc.) 
         are calibrated and functioning.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure that demonstration equipment (if youâ€™re doing a live example) is set up and tested.</li>
<li>**Safety Protocols:**

   </ul>
</li>
<li>TA/Assistant Coordination
   <ul>
   <li>Meet briefly with lab assistants to review any unique aspects of the dayâ€™s experiment.</li>
   <li>Verify that they understand their roles and the safety responsibilities.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>ðŸ”„ During Class and Lab</h1>

<h2>Lecture Session</h2>

<ul>

</li>
<li>**Time Management:
  <ul>
   <li>Stick to your planned schedule and allow time for discussion or questions.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<h2>Lab Session</h2>

<ul>
<li>Active Monitoring
   <ul>
      <li>Circulate during the lab to observe student adherence to safety procedures.</li>

   </ul>
</li>
<li>Documentation
   <ul>
      <li>Keep notes on any issues or questions that arise for future reference.</li>
      <li>Ensure that lab assistants record attendance and any safety incidents.</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h1> âœ… After Lecture & Lab</h1>

<ul>
<li>**Review and Reflect:**
   <ul>
      <li>Gather feedback from students (verbal or via a quick survey) on

<p>
This checklist provides a framework to ensure youâ€™re prepared, that the technology and 
materials are in place, and that youâ€™re ready to manage both the educational content 
and the safety protocols needed for a successful chemistry lecture and lab. 
Adjust or expand it according to your personal teaching style and your departmentâ€™s 
guidelines. Enjoy your day in the lab!
