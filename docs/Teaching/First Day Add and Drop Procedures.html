First Day Add &amp; Drop Procedures
</p>
<div class="container">
<p>
Proceed in this order:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell students that you will only consider adding them if they are on the official waitlist.
   Advise them to talk to a student counselor to look at their options.
</li>
<li>Wait 10 or 15 minutes after start of session to start taking attendance.</li>
<li>If students "no-show", give them a day to contact you, then drop them in Self Service.</li>
<li>At that point, students on the official waitlist who also attended the first day 
must be allowed to add in the order they are listed in Self Service.</li>
<li>Never add students beyond the 30 student class capacity.</li>
<li> Officially you have up to 3 weeks to process adds and drops.</li>
<li>After that point, you will be required to "certify" your roster throught Self Service. 
No students may be added after that. The first day of the 4th week is "Census" on that day, 
you go into self service and "certify" your roster verifying that the students listed are attending class.
</li>
</ol>
