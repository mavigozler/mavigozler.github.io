Read this carefully before uploading your lab report

1. Mass: whenever you are asked for a mass value, on the DATA sheet, you asked to record the stabilized number that is shown on electronic balance. All the numbers. Not the numbers you think should be rounded off. ALL the numbers. And after the number, you put the units: "g" for grams

2. Volumes: if using rulers to measure, understand that a centimeter ruler with millimeter marks is said to be precise to "1 mm times 10%" = 0.1 mm (or 0.01 cm). So your number should "3.00 cm" or "5.70 cm" for using such a ruler.

For 100 mL graduated cylinders with 1 mL finest division marks, the precision will be "1 mL x 10%" = 0.1 mL, so it is NOT "30 mL" but "30.0 mL" or NOT "57 mL" but "57.0 mL"

3. Measured Quantity? Numbers PLUS UNITS. Lab reports get marked DOWN for any failure to show numbers with units, if those numbers have units, whether a (measured) quantity or even a natural constant or conversion factor. (Remember, conversion factors have a numerator/denominator style when used a factor in calculating a product.)

4. Making a calculation in a report?  Show your calculation (write expressions!), not just the final answer. Writing out the calculation--on a separate scratch paper sheet if it helps you compose it--can actually help you detect potential errors.

5. Signficant figures/digits and decimal places: Are you doing math operations? What are they? Multiplication and division, where sigificant digits can affect your final answer? Addition and subtraction, where decimal places can also affect the final answer? You don't need to do any intermediate rounding in calculations, but keep in mind how they affect the final answer.
