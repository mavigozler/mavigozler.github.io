   Preparing Better Lab Reports
</p>
<div class="container justify" style="width:45em;">
<h1>Scope</h1>
<p>This is not the complete guide to lab report preparation, or else it would be titled
something like <i>Mastering The Chemistry Lab Report</i>.</p>
<p>This is more of a <q>Dont's</q> and not a <q>Do's</q> document for the moment.
These are things I have noticed students doing that they should not do or things 
they should to make it better.</p>
<p>
This document was created based on recent evaluations of lab reports and hopefully
this is a way that can improve the reports being submitted.
</p>

<h2>Using the (Electronic) Balance To Determine Mass</h2>
<p>
Some of the students' experiments have been complicated by getting incorrect mass 
readings. An example is when a group is asked to get the mass reading 
of an empty container (Reading #1) and later to get another mass reading 
(Reading #2) of the container with important sample inside. 
When Reading #2 is subtracted with value of Reading #1, the number is 
actually negative!  Since masses cannot be less than zero, what happened?
</p>
<p>
To be certain of Reading #2, the students read the mass maybe once or twice or 
three times, and those multiple readings continue to agree with each other with only
the small expected variation. The students now have to wonder that it was 
Reading #1 that was wrong, and they wished they had taken that reading more than 
once, which can not be done now that the sample is in the container. (Actually there 
can be ways to recover.)
</p>
<p>
What the students are doing in this activity is realizing that perhaps 
instruments that seem very sophisticated like an electronic balance should 
probably not be read just once, particularly if the reading is not to be 
an approximate mass, but rather one recorded on a data line that will be 
significant in experimental calculations.
</p>
<p>
And this is a good thing and something generally that experienced, 
professional scientists do. They take an instrumental reading 
<em>multiple times</em> on a critical sample to be very sure of the value 
of the property of that sample (in this case, mass). They especially 
take multiple readings on the instrument if they are concerned that 
the instrument might not be performing optimally, or if there is a 
question that it might be out of calibration, or that it has been 
some time since the last maintenance operation or inspection.
</p>
<p>
So if you have any doubt about your reading, or you want to sure that 
you have an excellent mass reading on a critical sample, this is a 
suggestion for you on procedure for using a balance to get a mass:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully take three (3) readings of the mass, taring the balance 
each time. Note the <i><b>minimum</b></i> and <b><i>maximum</i></b> of the 
three values, and also calculate the <b><i>mean (average)</i></b>
as well.</li>
<li>Calculate <span class="math-inline">
   \( \displaystyle \textit{percent difference} = 
\frac{\textit{maximum value} - \textit{minimum value}}{\textit{mean}} 
\times 100\text{%} \)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the difference is 1% or less, the balance can be assumed to be 
highly reproducible and be used with confidence. Note it is not always
necessary to take triplicate readings of masses unless the chemist 
might be determining a very critical measurement. The above procedure 
is only done periodically to ensure instruments are operating in an 
expected manner.

<h2>Experiment 5a: Empirical Formula</h2>
<p>This laboratory session involved heating magnesium (Mg) metal ribbon pieces
so they would react with atmospheric oxygen in the following reaction. The reaction is:
<span class="chemical-equation">
   2 Mg (<i>s</i>) + O<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i>) 
   <span class="reaction-arrow">&srarr;</span> 2 MgO (<i>s</i>)
</span>
<h3>The <q>No Work Shown on Calculations</q> Part of The Report</h3>
<p>
In the course of the experiment, students must record the mass of the 
container itself (empty), then of the magnesium in the container (the starting 
reactant), then of the product that forms in the container. (These data are not 
shown in the image below. The image was edited to change from the handwriting 
of the student to machine-based chracter lettering, but is a facsimile of 
the entered data.)
<img class="center contain" src="BetterLabReport_assets/CalculationsNotShown-masked.png" 
   alt="example of not showing calculations in reports"></p>
<p>
Then it is time for the calculations, which are shown in the form above.</p>
<p>Notice that there seems to be a lot of vacant real estate in the spaces between 
items numbered 4, 5, and 6?
</p>
<p>
Well there really shouldn't be. This space is for <q>messy calculations</q>, 
the area where students show their work and thinking in writing. 
It's a bit clear that the students need instruction or guidance on how 
to fill that space.</p>
<p>So an instruction will be added to the lab manual 
exhorting students to show their work, to write out their calculations.
Perhaps it will be added as preface to the lab manual, with the further 
incentive that if the student's out-of-nowhere value is found to be in 
error, they will lose more points on that item in the lab report than
if they had shown their work, in which case, far fewer points are
deducted.
</p>
<p>
In case students are under the impression that professional level 
career chemists with years of experiment in the lab coats never write 
out their calculations&mdash;even the most basic operations in math used
in chemistry&mdash;they would be wrong in that thinking. Good chemists 
actually do fill up their lab books with that detail because a quick glance 
generally stops them from having to wonder how a certain quantity came to
appear seemingly out of nowhere.
</p>
<h3>How Did You Do That Calculation?</h3>
<p>
When one sees a calcuation like below&mdash;which actually has the 
correct answer&mdash;this is the kind of finding that is most disturbing.
Because this report has students working in partners as groups of two, 
it seems clear that the partner knew what was going on but the understanding
did not catch up with the student.
<img class="center" src="BetterLabReport_assets/WrongUnitsShown-masked.png" 
   alt="Calculation with Wrong Units and Wrong Math Operation">
The calculation was determine the mole amount of the element oxygen 
that was formed in the MgO product using oxygen's molar mass. 
The quotient shows a dividend in moles and it should be in grams,
and while the divisor value of <b>15.99</b> is generally correct 
for oxygen's molar mass, the units should be <b>g/mol</b>. The result
has the correct units, but the student's understanding of math in 
chemistry should have shown that the units would cancel and the 
resulting value would be dimensionless, which of course would 
be an unwanted result.
</p>
<p>
The calculation would more properly look iike a product yielding 
the wanted result
</p>
<p class="math">
\[ 0.0801 \text{ g O} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol O}}{16.00 \text{ g O}} =  0.00500625 \text{ mol O} \]
</p>
<p>
Note quite carefully how the expression is written.  The <b>molar mass</b> value
like any conversion factor is written in numerator-denominator style as a factor 
of a product expression, as all expressions and equations should be written. This 
makes it easy to see how the expression is evaluated and how the units would cancel
properly without necessarily having to show the cancel operation as below.
</p>
<p class="math">
\[ 0.0801 \cancel{\text{ g O}} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol O}}{16.00 \cancel{\text{ g O}}} =  0.00500625 \text{ mol O} \]
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that the student was instructed not to be concerned with 
significant digits with the use of that value as an intermediate in subsequent
calculations. This was an incorrect instruction actually. If an intermediate 
result in a series of calculations is to be obtained, that intermediate
result should be presented with the correct precision, that is, taking into 
account significant digits. But that precision-determined result would not 
be used in subsequent steps.  So the correct reporting of the result would be
<b>0.00501 mol</b> or <b>\( 5.01 \times 10^{-3} \text{ mol}\)</b>. In fact
conversion of any final calculated result to scientific notation since 
it actually help the student to evaluate better what the precision is (significant
digits are). The student can then elect to convert the result back to 
standard notation.
</p>
<h2>Understanding the Math In Determining Empirical Formula</h2>
<p>
Since the laboratory experiment was set up to show how empirical formula,
it is important to understand the math and apply it correctly.
</p>
<p>
Students were told to find the calculated mole value for all the elements 
in the compound. Then they were to use the <em>lowest</em> (or <q>smallest</q>, howver
one prefers) of values as a divisor for all the mole values (as dividends)
of the elements of the compound, including the mole value chosen to be 
the divisor. (This would result in value of <b>1</b> for the operation.)
</p>
<p>
The results for all the other values should be quotients greater than 1.
Did the students understand why they were performing this calculation in 
this way? The lab report below shows that there was a failure to help 
the student understand the concept.
</p>
<p>
<img class="center contain" 
src="BetterLabReport_assets/WrongCalculationOfMoleRatioEmpircalFormula-masked.png"
 alt="example of empirical formula wrongly determined">
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it be explained with the following example.
</p>
<p>
Suppose an unknown compound having a 50.0 g total mass is found by elemental
analysis to be 25.302 g barium (Ba), 11.106 g oxygen (O), and 5.6320 g 
sulfur (S). The sheet below then shows the calculations for determining 
the empirical formula.
</p>
<p>
<img class="center" style="transform: scale(1.25);margin:2.5em auto;" 
src="BetterLabReport_assets/EmpiricalFormulaCalculations.png"
  alt="Excel sheet showing example empirical formula calcuations the right way and wrong ways">
</p>
<p>
The <b>moles</b> calculation column showed that sulfur had the lowest 
mole value. Look at the column <b>S mole ratio</b>: when all the mole 
values are divided by the moles of S, all the values are greater 
than 1.00. This is how the calculation should be. The empirical formula
Ba<sub>1.05</sub>S<sub>1.00</sub>O<sub>3.95</sub> is obtained, which is 
close the actual formula for what looks like barium sulfate, 
BaSO<sub>4</sub>.
</p>
<p>
Now suppose instead of dividing by the lowest mole value which is sulfur (S),
one elects to divide by oxygen (O), the values shown in the <b>O mole ratio</b>
column. That results in a formula of Ba<sub>0.27</sub>S<sub>0.25</sub>O<sub>1.00</sub>.
Chemical formulas are about whole numbers of atoms, not fractions of an atom, 
so trying to determine whole numbers of atoms in this way is unproductive. 
One soon realizes that all the values as subscripts of atoms would have to be
multiplied by 4 to obtain the sensible whole number values. And so this is 
why the process involves dividing by the smallest of the mole values from 
the experimental determinations.
