To control thermal shock and prevent crucible breakage, you must introduce heat and remove it gradually and evenly. The key is to avoid rapid temperature changes that create uneven expansion and contraction within the porcelain.

### **Best Practices for the Heating Stages**

* **1st Stage: Melting the Sulfur**
    * **Use an Insulating Surface:** Instead of placing the crucible directly in the Bunsen burner flame, set it on a **clay triangle** supported by a **tripod**. This diffuses the heat and prevents the direct, concentrated flame from shocking one specific spot on the crucible. You can also place the tripod and crucible on a **ceramic gauze** to distribute the heat even more. 
    * **Begin with a Gentle Flame:** Start with a low, non-luminous flame and slowly increase the heat. This allows the crucible to warm up gradually and uniformly, minimizing thermal stress. You should not have the crucible "red hot" at this stage. Sulfur has a low melting point (around $115^\circ \text{C}$), so a gentle heat is all that's required to melt it.
    * **Preheat the Crucible:** If possible, you can preheat the empty crucible in a low-temperature oven or on a hot plate before adding the sulfur and placing it over the Bunsen burner. This is a common practice in advanced labs to ensure any residual moisture is removed and to begin the heating process slowly.

* **2nd Stage: Burning Off Excess Sulfur**
    * **Increase Heat Gradually:** After the sulfur has melted and reacted with the copper, you will need to increase the heat to burn off the excess. Do this slowly by adjusting the Bunsen burner to a hotter flame over a period of several minutes.
    * **Avoid Quenching:** After the experiment is complete, do **not** take the hot crucible and place it on a cold lab bench or other cold surface. The rapid cooling will cause significant thermal shock. Instead, turn off the flame and allow the crucible to cool **naturally** while still on the clay triangle. Once it's cool enough to handle, you can move it with tongs.
    * **Monitor the Flame Position:** Ensure the hottest part of the Bunsen burner flame (the tip of the inner blue cone) is positioned just **below** the crucible, not directly touching the bottom. This allows for more even heat distribution.

By following these steps, you're controlling the **rate of temperature change**, which is the primary factor in preventing thermal shock in brittle ceramic materials. This ensures a safer procedure and more reliable results for all your students.
