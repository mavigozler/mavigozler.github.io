<h1>Measured Quantities</h1>
<p>
In making quantitative observations in chemistry, you will be determining 
a (measured) <mark>quantity</mark>
</p>
<p>
The quantity will have a <mark>number</mark> (numerical value) and <mark>units</mark> associated with it, 
creating a dimension. Whenever you report data in your laboratory notebook, you are almost always 100% 
reporting a measured quantity that requires that number with its units. Failure to properly record 
that number with units creates problems at the professional level of laboratory science, and it's 
points off on scoring at the student level.


<h1>Significant Digits</h1>
<p>
   Also called <mark>significant figures</mark>, the significant digits of a value are
   <em>at least</em> the number of digits that extend from the first nonzero number to the
   last nonzero number, with all the zero digits that are in between as well. "123.45" has 
   five significant digits.
</p>
<p>
   Digits which are zeroes between a non-zero digit to the left and a non-zero digit on 
   the right are called <q>sandwich zeroes</q> and are always significant. For example, 
   the number "1005" has four significant digits.
</p>
<p>
   Digits having a zero <i>to the left</i> of the first nonzero digit are not
   significant, whether they come after the decimal point or not.  "0.0075" has two 
   significant digits.
</p>
<p>
   Digits having a zero to the right of the last nonzero digits <em>are</em>
   significant if they come after the decimal point, or when there is a
   decimal point indicated in an integer number.
   <br><b>1200</b> has two significant digits.
   <br><b>1200.</b> has four significant digits (note the decimal point).
   <br><b>1200.00</b> has six significant digits.
</p>
<p>
   Most do not consider the zeroes to the right of the last nonzero digit
   of an integer as significant (see the use of scientific notation in
   helping decide what digits are significant).
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
   These examples will be presented in tabular form with explanations.

<p>
   Here's another way that helps you to determine significant digits:
   converting the value to scientific notation. The list below takes the
   numbers in the table above and converts them to scientific notation:
</p>
<ul class="no-space">
   <li>2.084307 &times; 10<sup>2</sup></li>
   <li>2 &times; 10<sup>5</sup></li>
   <li>2.00000 &times; 10<sup>5</sup></li>
   <li>2.000000000 &times; 10<sup>5</sup></li>
   <li>9.043 &times; 10<sup>−6</sup></li>
   <li>9.0430000 &times; 10<sup>−6</sup></li>
   <li>2.300000090430000 &times; 10<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>
   Numbers in scientific notation have two components: the <mark>significand</mark>
   (formerly called the <b>mantissa</b>), which is a number between 1 and 10 with a 
   digits after a decimal point, and the <mark>exponent</mark>, which is 
   a power of 10 (it has format with a 10<sup><i>n</i></sup> value).
</p>
<p>
   The significand part requires that the number be written exactly
   according to the significant digits of the number. Notice has the
   significand is written for the numbers that are all equal to 200,000: the
   zeroes that become signficant must be expressed to their accuracy in
   the significand. Thus converting a number to scientific notation forces
   one to think about just what the significant digits are.
</p>
<h2>Exact Numbers</h2>
<p>
   These quantities, such as constants and conversion factors, are not 
   measured quantities and are exact numbers. This means they have an infinite
   number of significant digits. Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Numbers obtained by counting discrete objects: 12 eggs, 5 students.
      There is no uncertainty in this determination which requires indicating 
      a level of precision</li>
   <li>Conversion factors: these are exact numbers that should not be treated
      as measured quantities for purposes of determining precision (significant 
      digits, decimal places)
   </li>
</ul>
<h2>Rounding Numbers</h2>
<p>
   Before getting into this important subject of showing results of
   operations, a reminder on <b>rounding off</b> numbers.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Rule: when the digit used to determine rounding off is between 0 and 4, 
   one rounds <em>down</em>; when it is between 5 and 9, one rounds
   <em>up</em></b>. Rounding down is equivalent to just truncating (lopping off) the
   digts from the rounding digit to the right. Rounding up is the equivalent of 
   truncating the numbers as well, but adding 1 to the digit to the left of the rounding digit.
</p>
<p>
   Suppose the number 8.49918365107 is to be rounded off to a certain digit.
</p>
<p>
   Suppose the number is to have the format x.xxxxxxx, that is 7 digits after 
   the decimal point. This means that the 8<sup>th</sup> digit after the decimal point, 
   the number "5," is to be used in rounding off. Since "5" indicates 
   that rounding up occurs on the 7<sup>th</sup> digit, which is "6," 
   then the value becomes 8.4991837 when rounding up and truncation occur.
</p>
<p>
   Now suppose that number will have format x.xx, or 2 digits after the
   decimal point. This means that the 3rd digit after decimal point, or
   "9," will lead to a rounding up of the number to be formatted: 8.50.
   This was a tricky round up in fact, because 1 was added to the 9 in
   the 2nd digit after the decimal point, which then carries a one to the
   9 in the 1st digit after the decimal point, and so there were multiple
   changes of the digits as a result of these digits valued at "9."
</p>
<h2>Significant Digits of the Results of Operations On Numbers</h2>
<p>
   The first principle involving determining the number of significant
   digits of the result of a binary operation is that the result will
   have the same number of significant digits as the number involved in
   the operation that has the least significant digits.
</p>
<p>
   Here's an example. Evaluate and give the result with the correct
   number of significant digits the operation:
   \[ 9.7 \times 12.35 = ? \]
</p>
<p>
   If one merely enters the values into the calculator and writes down
   all the digits reported by the calculator, the result is:
   \[ 9.7 \times 12.35 = 119.795 \]
</p>
<p>
   However, as a scientific result, this is not correct. For example, if
   the number 9.7 were a volume in milliliters (ml), and 12.35 were a
   concentration in micromole per milliter (which is millimolar, or mM),
   then the result is a number of micromoles, which is 119.795 micromoles
   (µmol). No scienist believes that the mass is that accurate. Since the
   number 9.7 has 2 significant digits, and 12.35 has 4 significant
   digits, the result will have signficant digits that are the least of
   the significant digits of one of the two numbers, namely 2 digits.
   Thus the result is rounded to 120 µmole, which is the answer:
   \[ 9.7 \times 12.35 = 120 \]
</p>
<p>
   The same is true if we had divided numbers, for example:
   \[ \frac{35.155}{250} = 0.14062 = 0.14 \]
</p>
<p>
   That result was rounded off to 2 significant digits because the
   denominator 250 only had 2 significant digits by the rules, even
   though the numerator had 5 significant digits.
</p>
<h2>Addition and Subtraction Operations</h2>
<p>
   Addition and subtraction of numbers work on the same principle.
   Suppose the addition of 6.55, 8.235, and 10.95. Perform the addition
   operation and do the rounding:
</p>
<h2>Intermediate Result Determinations on Combined Operations</h2>
<h1>Setting Up A Calculation: The Numerator-Denominator Principle in the 
   Use of Conversion Factors</h1>
<p>
   A calculation is really an <b>equation</b>, and an equation must 
   have an equal sign in standard mathematics.
</p>
<p>
   On one side of the equal sign is the <b>answer</b>, the
   <b>result of the calculation</b> (usually on the right side of 
   the equation for people who think left-to-right).
</p>
<p>
   On the other side of the equation are the <b>factors</b>: all 
   the numeric values that will be used to make the calculation. By
   definition, factors are multiplied to one another, and that is the
   case for pretty much 99.9% of all calculations in this setup. In rare
   cases, you will use algebra where you set up numbers that are added or
   subtracted from one another, but they become quantities (values
   enclosed in parentheses) either in the numerator or denominator of a factor.
</p>
<p>
   All the factors will be represented in a numerator or denominator
   fashion. That is, if a factor is used in a division operation, then it
   will appear as its inverted value (that is, if value <i>x</i>
   is used to divide the factors in the calculation, it will be
   represented as 1 / <i>x</i> and multiplied to all factors).
</p>
<p>
   The equation will then have the form that looks much like this:
   \[  \frac{w \text{ dim1}}{\text{dim2}} \times 
   \frac{x \text{ dim2}}{\text{dim3}} \times 
   \frac{\text{dim3}}{y \text{ dim4}} \times 
   \frac{z \text{ dim4}}{1} = a \text{ dim1} \text{ [1]} \]
</p>
<p>
   The
   <span style="font-size: 83%; font-weight: bold">dim <i>n</i></span>, where
   <i>n</i> = 1, 2, 3, …, actually refers to the name of a dimension or unit, 
   such <b>mg</b> (milligram) or <b>µl</b> (microliter). The values <i>w</i>,
   <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>
   are numbers expressed in any form (real or floating point or decimal;
   integers; scientific notation); they are the factors in this product.
   The product itself is the value <i>a</i>. Note that the value of
   <i>y</i> is in the denominator, that is the factor is 1/<i>y</i>.
</p>
<p>
   But what is important here is not the values <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, etc. 
   It is the dimensions <span style="font-size: 83%; font-weight: bold">dim
   <i>n</i></span>. The values were merely arranged in this style in order 
   to arrange the dimension to produce the desired final dimension with its value.
   Note how <span style="font-size: 83%; font-weight: bold">dim2</span>,
   <span style="font-size: 83%; font-weight: bold">dim3</span>, and
   <span style="font-size: 83%; font-weight: bold">dim4</span> all cross out, 
   leaving <span style="font-size: 83%; font-weight: bold">dim1</span>
   in the final answer. One can remove the dimensions and then just be
   left with multiplying all numbers in the numerator, then multiplying
   all in the denominator, and finally dividing the product in the
   numerator by the product in the denominator to get the final answer.
</p>
<p>In constructing the equation (calculation):</p>
<ul>
   <li>It is essential to know what one really wants as the answer, which
   is a value and possibly a dimension. For instance, if a volume is
   asked for, then the dimension must be in units that represent a
   volume (µl, ml, L). If the target answer is a mass, then it should
   be in some form of grams (mg, g) or possibly moles. For concentrations, 
   this is really solution density, or mass units per volume units.</li>
   <li>Write down all the factors available, even if they will not be used
   in the final calculation.</li>
   <li>The missing factors in a calculation are typically <b>conversion units</b>. 
   That is, the conversion of one expression of the volume into
   another. Thus there are 1000 µliters (µl) in 1 milliliter (ml), and
   1000 milliliters in 1 liter (L). Know your conversion units by
   reflex. Note that these are not <b>constants</b>: a constant is 
   value reflecting a fundamental physical or chemical property in nature 
   or the universe. Planck’s constant is 6.62 &times; 10<sup>−34</sup> J s, 
   and not a conversion of one value into another form.</li>
   <li><b>Constants</b>. A typical constant in solution density determinations is the
   molecular or atomic weight of a substance, which is the amount of
   grams in one mole of the substance. This is typical missing factor
   whenever one factor is expressed in grams and the answer sought in
   some form of moles.</li>
</ul>
<p>
   In setting up the final equation which is the product of these
   factors, the solution is arrived at by doing what is called a
   <b>dimensional analysis</b>, which was the process described above.
