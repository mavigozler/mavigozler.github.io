# In-Class Exercises Using Canvas App "Classic Quizzes"

If you want to run an **in-class quiz** using the Canvas app, the easiest setup is to create a standard Canvas *Quiz* (or *New Quiz* if your institution uses the newer engine), but adjust it for your “live” setting.

Here’s how you can set it up so students can do it during lecture:

---

## **1. Create the quiz in Canvas (web browser is easiest for setup)**

* Go to your course in Canvas.
* Click **Quizzes → + Quiz** (or **+ New Quiz** if available).
* Give it a title like *In-Class Quiz #1*.
* Add your questions.
* In the settings:

  * **Uncheck "Shuffle Answers"** if you want everyone to see the same order.
  * **Set the time limit** (e.g., 5–10 minutes) so it fits into your lecture slot.
  * **Set "Available From" and "Until"** times so the quiz is open *only* during your class.
  * If you only want participation credit, make the quiz **Ungraded Survey** (Classic Quizzes) or give it a **0-point value** but keep it as a quiz.

---

## **2. Use the Canvas Teacher app (during class)**

* Log into the **Canvas Teacher** app on your phone or tablet.
* Go to the quiz you created.
* When class begins, tap to **publish** the quiz so students can access it immediately.

---

## **3. Have students use the Canvas Student app**

* Students open the **Canvas Student** app.
* Navigate to your course → **Quizzes** → tap your quiz.
* They complete and submit it on their devices right there in class.

---

## **4. Monitor responses live (optional)**

* In the Teacher app or browser, you can see **who has submitted** in real time.
* This is useful for confirming participation before closing the quiz.

---

**Tip for "participation-only" grading:**
In Classic Quizzes, choose **"Ungraded Survey"** type — it still lets you collect answers but automatically gives everyone credit for submission.
In New Quizzes, you can set it to **0 points** and grade on completion.

---

Here’s a **Canvas “in-class quiz” settings template** you can follow each time so it works smoothly for *live participation* and doesn’t require extra grading work.

I’ll break it into **Classic Quizzes** and **New Quizzes** since Canvas schools vary.

## **Template: In-Class Participation Quiz**

### **For Classic Quizzes**

1. **Quiz Type** → **Ungraded Survey**

   * This makes it auto-complete for everyone who participates.
   * If you want to award specific points, choose **Graded Survey** instead.
2. **Points** → `0` (if truly ungraded)
3. **Time Limit** → e.g., `5` minutes
4. **Allow Multiple Attempts** → Off (unless you want retries)
5. **Shuffle Answers** → Off (keeps the same question order for all)
6. **Show One Question at a Time** → Optional (can prevent scrolling ahead)
7. **Quiz Availability Window**

   * **Available From**: Class start time (e.g., 10:05 AM)
   * **Until**: A few minutes after expected finish (e.g., 10:15 AM)
   * This ensures only in-class students can take it.
8. **Let Students See Their Responses** → Off (or “after until date” if you want a review later)

---

### **For New Quizzes**

1. **Assignment Points** → `0`
2. **Display Grade As** → *Complete/Incomplete*
3. **Time Limit** → Same as above (`5` minutes, etc.)
4. **Restrict Student Result View** → Enable restrictions so they can’t copy questions after class.
5. **Shuffle Answers** → Off (unless you want individualization)
6. **Availability Window** → Same narrow “Available From” / “Until” time slot.
7. **Scoring Policy** → Default (“Latest Attempt”) unless multiple tries are needed.

---

### **Reusable Workflow**

* Keep a **“Quiz Template – In-Class Participation”** in Canvas with these settings saved.
* Before each lecture quiz, **duplicate** it, rename it (e.g., “In-Class Quiz #5”), replace the questions, and adjust the *Available From* / *Until* times.
* Publish just before starting class.

---

This approach means you can *walk into class, publish the quiz from the Canvas Teacher app, tell students to open it in Canvas Student app, watch submissions come in, and close it when time’s up*.

Here’s a **Canvas “In-Class Quiz” Live Session Checklist** you can keep handy during lectures so it runs smoothly every time.

## **📋 Live Session Checklist — Canvas In-Class Quiz**

### **Before Class**

1. **Prepare quiz in advance**

   * Duplicate your “In-Class Quiz Template.”
   * Add/edit questions.
   * Set *Available From* and *Until* to the class window (e.g., 10:05–10:15).
   * Double-check it’s **Published** but not open yet.
2. **Have Canvas Teacher app ready** (phone/tablet or laptop browser).
3. **Ensure stable internet** — switch to campus Wi-Fi if needed.
4. **Announce to students** that the quiz will open only in class on their **Canvas Student app** or browser.

---

### **During Class**

1. **Open with a countdown** (“Quiz starts in 1 minute — get devices ready”).
2. **In Canvas Teacher app**:

   * Go to the quiz.
   * Verify “Published” (green check).
   * Check “Available From” matches your start time — adjust if starting early.
3. **Announce quiz code/location** (if using Modules, tell them exactly where).
4. **Monitor submissions** live in Canvas Teacher app:

   * Tap the quiz → “Moderate” to see progress.
   * Confirm everyone has started.
5. **Call “1 minute left”** so stragglers finish.

---

### **Closing the Quiz**

1. When the *Until* time hits, verify no late entries appear.
2. In **Classic Quizzes**, submissions after “Until” are blocked automatically.
3. In **New Quizzes**, verify “Availability” end has passed.

---

### **After Class**

1. Check the **Quiz Summary Report**:

   * Classic: “Quiz Statistics” → see participation count.
   * New Quizzes: “Reports” → “Item Analysis” for participation count.
2. If using **Complete/Incomplete**, grade automatically fills.
3. Post a quick announcement or verbal feedback next class if needed.

---

💡 **Pro tip:** Keep a laminated one-page copy of this checklist in your lecture folder. Even when you’ve done it 20 times, it’s easy to skip a step under time pressure.

---

If you want, I can now **bundle this with the reusable Canvas quiz template** into a single “instructor kit” you could use all semester — that way it’s just *duplicate → rename → run*. That kit could also include emergency fixes if Wi-Fi dies mid-quiz.
