# Seth Yates Advice

- I need to know if I should get a budget laptop to take for lecturing, or basically, whatever you do.

   Not necessarily. There is an internet connected computer at the instructors station in every class. Lots of people bring their lecture powerpoint, etc. on a flash drive. Others log into a cloud service when they arrive. Some just put everything necessary on Canvas and simply login there. There are other tools in canvas, like the gradebook and attendance tools that you might want to be using anyway and it can host files for you.

- the checklist you go through as an instructor on what to take to lecture and lab on the day of class

   Not much. I bring my laptop and whiteboard markers (because I never trust that there will be enough in the classroom) (-also, we provide these, you don't need to buy them). I store my lab coat and goggles in or near the classroom so I don't have to bring them every day.
   I generally don't bring separate notes, because I use powerpoint for this, but sometimes for special reasons, I bring paper notes.

- Email

   I would recommend using your FCC email account with students and using Canvas, but that's really up to you.

- Office Hours

   Adjunct are not required to do office hours. There is a way to apply to be paid for some office hours- talk to Stephanie if you want to know the details on this.

- Communication Plan

   I usually don't fill out (hide) this section of simple syllabus. It's not required. If I did fill it out, I would just tell students to email me or contact me through Canvas with any questions. I try to respond within 24 hours M-F.
   On that note, You are allowed to turn off sections in Simple Syllabus. I have attached the official rules for what must be included in a syllabus at FCC.

- Attendance

   The canvas tool is pretty nice.
   Another option I often use is a list of students passed around the room for them to initial if they are present.
   I forget sometimes and have to re-create it from lab submissions or other class records.

I can look at other sections when I see the full document.

A couple other items.

This folder contains a wealth of resources for the class, but it may be slightly out of date.
This form is how we get things printed. There are some other options in a pinch, but use this as often as possible. Sometimes it takes a few days, but usually things are printed in 24 hours.

I'm sure there are a million other things to share. Please keep the questions coming and ask for clarification if I don't answer well
