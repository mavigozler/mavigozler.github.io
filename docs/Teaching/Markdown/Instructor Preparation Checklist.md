## âœ… **After Lecture & Lab**

* **Review and Reflect:**

  * Gather feedback from students (verbal or via a quick survey) on the lecture/lab experience.
  * Note any technical or procedural issues to improve for next time.
* **Follow-Up:**

  * Update your Canvas or other course management system with any additional resources, announcements, or clarifications.
