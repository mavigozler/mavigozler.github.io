# Attendance with Google Forms

Got it — let’s build you a **Google Forms + rotating QR code** attendance system that you can run in a couple clicks before each class.

---

## **Step 1 – Make the Google Form**

1. Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com).
2. Click the blank form (`+`).
3. Title it something like **Chemistry Attendance – Fall 2025**.
4. Add fields:

   * **Name** (short answer → make it *Required*)
   * **Student ID** (short answer → make it *Required*)
5. Optional: Add “Section” (Lecture / Lab-Tue / Lab-Thu) as a dropdown.
6. Turn on:

   * ⚙️ **Settings → Responses** → *Collect email addresses* (optional if you want auto-verification)
   * **Limit to 1 response** (only works if students are logged into their school Google accounts).
   * Automatically collect **timestamp** (Google Forms does this by default).

---

## **Step 2 – Get the Link**

1. In the form, click the purple **Send** button (top right).
2. Click the **link icon** (🔗).
3. Click “Shorten URL.”
4. Copy that link — this will be what your QR code points to.

---

## **Step 3 – Make the QR Code**

1. Go to [qr-code-generator.com](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) (or any free QR maker).
2. Paste the shortened Google Form link.
3. Generate the QR code and **download it as PNG**.
4. You can paste this into your lecture slides or display from your computer.

---

## **Step 4 – Rotate the Code Each Class**

To prevent students from scanning an old QR from home:

1. **Duplicate the Google Form** before each lecture/lab (right-click → Duplicate).
2. Rename it for the date (e.g., “Chem Attendance – Sep 2”).
3. Repeat the steps above for a new shortened link + QR code.
4. Close form responses after class (click **Responses → Accepting responses** to toggle off).

---

## **Step 5 – View & Export Attendance**

* In your Google Form, click **Responses → Google Sheets icon** to send all data into a spreadsheet.
* This lets you sort by date/time and section.
* You can upload the attendance file into Canvas if you want records in your LMS.

---

✅ **Advantages of this system**

* Free, no Canvas integration headaches.
* Timestamp + section separation for labs.
* Works on any phone/tablet without an app.
* Scales to 60+ students instantly.

If you’d like, I can **make you a sample Form + matching QR code** so you can see exactly what it would look like to the students.
Do you want me to prepare that mock-up?
