    I discovered&mdash;much too late in life unfortunately for my own good&mdash;that 
    the most effective way of retaining knowledge in rote memory is a process of 
    <em>active learning</em>. Passive learning involves just reading the material to be learned.

    This document discusses an enhancement to that.
