      <h3>Proprietary Substrate Surfaces</h3>
      <p>
        Manufacturers often feature a product line of TC plastic with a
        substratum that is
        <q>modified</q>
        or
        <q>enhanced,</q>
        and the nature of the modified surface is
        <q>propietary,</q>
        meaning that it might be a trade secret. Alternatively, its molecular
        structure is revealed, but the manufacturing process is a trade secret.
        Usually because of a patent, no other manufacturer may produce TC
        plastic with such features anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultured cell types will not grow on every kind of surface however. Read
        the product catalog to identify which cell types have been shown to grow
        well—probably without the addition of serum!—and consider whether your
        cell type might not also grow or maintain on such a surface. Ask for a
        free sample of the plastic before buying a whole case, telling customer
        support what sort of cell type you have. They may want to collaborate in
        some way.

        Tissue Culture Practices: Conserving Resources and Keeping Material
        Costs Low
      </h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Vulliet says that materials/supplies costs on grants do not even
        amount to more than 15-20% of a grant application. He will tell you that
        labor costs 80% of a grant, and so cost-effectiveness in grant
        management would be for the head of laboratory to make sure his
        postdocs, graduate students, and techs are thinking and working
        efficiently in laboratory experimentation, rather than fretting about
        consumables. Dr. Vulliet makes the vitally important point: if an extra
        pipet for a single use meant possibly reducing the risk of a
        contamination that might ruin, say, 8 or more man-hours of work, then
        one has spent 20¢ on an extra pipet to save perhaps $100 in salary time
        and overall material use. Moreover, one is that much closer to the thing
        that brings in grants: publishable experimental results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, with especially critical work, and when much time and effort
        has been spent in an experiment, most of us do not get stressed about a
        possibly wasteful use of materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it is possible to get into certain good habits that do not impose a
        higher risk of significant loss of time and effort due to contamination,
        while helping both the environment and the laboratory budget because of
        reduced use of materials.
      </p>
      <h3>Changing Media in Flasks</h3>
      <p>
        Some people use a disposable pipet to remove the old media from flasks,
        then they have to use a second pipet to transfer in the new media.
        However, experience shows that one only need pour out the old media into
        a waste container rather than use a pipet to remove it. There is
        apparently a needless fear that media collects around the lip of the
        container opening and can serve as place for biological contamination.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Pipetting from cleaner to
        <q>dirtier</q>
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are other ways to minimize the use of sterile disposable pipets.
        Before opening the wrapper on the pipet, think about how it can be
        employed in
        <em>multiple</em>
        ways before being tossed in the waste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you have to prepare some solutions and cell suspensions, and
        that you will be pipetting balanced salts solutions (HBSS), complete
        (serum-containing) medium, and solutions containing cell suspensions. It
        is possible to make use of a single pipet (say a 10 ml pipet) by first
        pipetting all your salts solutions first without the pipet making
        contact with anything
        <em>but</em>
        the salts solutions, then pipetting media without the same pipet
        contacting anything but the media, and then pipetting cells in
        suspension so as to distribute them to containers or prepare dilutions,
        all by using a single pipet. In fact, when making dilutions, always
        pipet in the solution in which the cells will be diluted first, then
        transfer the cells. If you were to transfer the cells first to an empty
        container, you would have to use a second pipet to add the diluent, and
        you would not be economizing.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the next section for complete examples in which the number and type
        of pipets are counted and use in a best and worst case of materials use.
      </p>
      <h3>Complete Examples of Minimizing Materials Use</h3>

      <h4>Preparing Complete Medium</h4>
      <p>
        Preparation of medium is quite a common practice. For the bone marrow
        cells, concentrated stocks of supplements, namely serum, glutamine, and
        antibiotics are routinely added to commercially prepared essential
        medium. In a maximal materials use scenario, a pipet selected for the
        appropriate volumetric capacity would be used for each concentrated
        stock. For glutamine and antibiotics, pipetted at 5 or 6 ml, that would
        be either a 5 or 10 ml pipet. For serum, usually aliquotted to 50 ml
        with the entire aliquot in the container used, that would be a 25 ml
        pipet (perhaps a less commonly used 50 ml pipet). This would be three
        pipets.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible to use only a single 10 ml pipet however. This is
        certainly no problem if the entire contents of the concentrated stock
        for each solution are to be used up and the containers discarded, since
        there is no anxiety about cross-contamination.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if only a part of the whole aliquot/volume of the concentrated stock
        is to be used, and this is shared by others, or there is some concern
        for cross-contamination, it is possible to use a single pipet but select
        which stock is pipetted first. This follows the
        <q>from cleaner to dirtier</q>
        rule. For example, are you more worried about antibiotics in your
        glutamine stock than glutamine in your antibiotics stock? This would be
        the case if, in the future, you wanted to make antibiotics-free medium
        supplemented with glutamine and serum. Then if you are to use a single
        10 ml pipet, pipet
        <em>first</em>
        from the glutamine stock, then from the antibiotics stock.
      </p>
      <p>
        And suppose you wanted to make serum-free medium in the future (a likely
        possibility), and all the media you would ever make always contains
        glutamine and antibiotics supplements. In this case, you can use a
        single pipet first to pipet glutamine, then the antibiotics, and then
        the serum. Note that with a 10 ml pipet, which has about a 13 ml marked
        capacity, you would have to pipet about 4 times to get 50 ml, but that
        is not so onerous or time-consuming, and the benefit is conserved
        resources and reduced costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence in a maximal use scenario, three pipets are used to transfer the
        required volumes of three concentrated stocks to the media bottle. In a
        minimal use scenario, a single 10 ml pipet can be conveniently used
        without adverse affects on cell cultures.
      </p>
      <h4>Media Change</h4>
      <p>
        In this situation flasks containing adherent cells are emptied of the
        old medium when it is time to do so, and given fresh medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people are wary of the risk of contamination involved with pouring
        out medium and getting the lip of the opening wet with medium, which
        might allow growth of contaminating organisms. Hence they use a pipet to
        remove the old medium, then a fresh pipet to add fresh medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        However in most if not all cases, it is possible to eliminate all pipets
        used to remove old media, and to pour them out from their containers
        directly. Save the pipet.
      </p>
      <p>
        One might ask that, if it is not a problem to pour out old medium, why
        not save even the one more pipet (using
        <em>no</em>
        pipets) and pour in fresh medium?
      </p>
      <p>There are several reasons why one should not do this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Flask necks (openings) are quite narrow, and it is difficult to pour
          fluids into narrower openings, especially from containers with wider
          necks (openings), which are typically of stock media containers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pouring gives less control of the stream entering the flask or
          container of cells. The stream should not be poured directly on to the
          surface to which the cells are adhering, for the cells getting the
          force of the stream can detach. Hence use of a pipet allows one to
          control the force of the flow and to direct the stream toward a
          surface or part of the container least likely to result in cell
          detachment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dishes and wells have no volumetric markings to indicate the volume of
          medium being received. The markings on flasks are also not accurate at
          the typical small volumes transferred for cultured cells. Hence use of
          the pipet gives much more precise control of the volume pipetted. This
          also goes a long way in the conservation of another material resource,
          namely the medium.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Therefore in a maximal use case of changing medium, two pipets are used.
        In a minimal use case, only one is used.
      </p>
      <h4>Subculturing</h4>
      <p>
        If one knows that cells are confluent and wants to subculture to a
        fraction of confluence (rather than inoculate a flask with a known
        count/concentration of cells, see next section), then subculturing is as
        simple as using a very minimal amount of detaching medium (trypsin
        and/or metal chelator), adding a small amount of medium and/or Hanks,
        and then transferring a fraction of that to a new flask containing the
        bulk of the old medium, or removing a fraction from the old flask and
        re-using the old flask. Consider a couple of examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose a 75 cm
        <sup>2</sup>
        flask contains 100% confluent cells, and a new flask will be seeded at
        10% confluence. About 2-3 ml of detaching medium is added, and the
        proper time is allowed for all cell-to-plastic and all cell-to-cell
        contact to occur. Assuming 20 ml medium fills a 75 cm
        <sup>2</sup>
        flask, then the following is done in order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pour—do not pipet—out the old media from the flask of cells to be
          subcultured.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take a sterile plastic 5 ml pipet, and add 5 or 10 ml of HBSS, wash
          the cells, and pour out.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the same pipet, add a minimal amount of detaching medium (usually
          not more than 2-3 ml for a 75 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask).
        </li>
        <li>
          Get a new 5 ml pipet (unless you consider a detachment medium-used
          pipet not too dirty for putting back into HBSS), and add 5 ml of HBSS
          to the old flask with cells without touching the pipet to the flask.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the same pipet, add 20 (for the more exacting, 19.5) ml culture
          medium to a new 75 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask; these pipets contain overflow markings, so it can be done in 3
          instead of 4 pipettings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now take the 5 ml pipet into the flask with cells, mix well with the
          pipet, and transfer 0.5 ml to the new flask.
        </li>
        <li>Mix the cells in the new flask well and set in the incubator.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This used only a single 5 ml pipet and new 75 cm
        <sup>2</sup>
        flask. Novices would have used 3 or more differently sized pipets.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one is re-using the flask (possible for many cell types), the
        following steps might be considered:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pour out the old media.</li>
        <li>
          Use a 5 ml pipet to add a minimal volume of detachment medium, and
          wait for the production of suspended, unclumped cells to occur.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour (or get a new 5 or 10 ml pipet), and add a volume of HBSS (or
          growth medium, depending on the fraction of cells to be recovered)
          that equals the total pipet volume less volume of detachment medium
          added. You may want to spike the HBSS with 5-10% of your serum to
          inhibit trypsin, if it is in the detachment medium, but often diluting
          it is sufficient to negate adverse effects of the continued action of
          trypsin.
        </li>
        <li>
          If cells are to be counted, add a drop from the well-mixed cell
          suspension to a small tube (0.5 ml conical microtube, sterility is not
          important), and count the cells in a hemocytometer using the usual
          method.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove all but the volume representing the fraction of suspended cells
          to remain for re-seeding in the old flask. For example, if there is 10
          ml of suspended cells, and 5% of the total cells are to remain for
          re-seeding, remove 9.5 ml of the suspension and discard.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a more than 20% of the cells are to be recovered for subculturing,
          then the use of HBSS as a dilution medium is unwise, and especially if
          cells are not to be counted, but subculturing is done instead as a
          fraction of confluence. Instead, add growth medium itself to prepare
          the suspension, and remove the fraction of cells not to be
          subcultured. To limit the waste of growth medium, keep the total
          volume added lower than you might use in HBSS added for cell counting:
          add just enough for accurate pipetting. In general using a 5 ml pipet
          allows accurate pipetting to ± 0.1-0.2 ml, so if you want to keep 20%
          of the cells for subculturing, and 3 ml of detachment medium was
          added, add 3 ml of growth medium, mix the cell suspension well, and
          then remove 4.8 ml of the suspension, done quite accurately with a 5
          ml pipet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get a new pipet and add enough growth medium to fill the flask to its
          appropriate volume, and place the suspension in the incubator.
          Grow/expand the cells as usual.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In this last procedure you have used two, at most three, disposable
        pipets, and whatever materials you normally use for cell counting.
      </p>
      <h4>From Flasks to Wells in Plates with Cell Counting</h4>
      <p>
        It is common when planning treatments of cultured cells to take cells
        being grown in flasks and to seed them in multi-well dishes at a certain
        count of cells per unit area (per square centimeter) of the well. Here
        is a suggested approach for minimizing the use of materials in doing
        that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pour out the medium to waste, and use an appropriate pipet to add
          detachment solution. Wait for the appropriate time and provide the
          appropriate conditions for producing single cell suspensions in the
          detachment process. Do not discard the pipet (keep it in the
          pipettor).
        </li>
        <li>
          Pipet the cell suspension into an appropriate conical spin tube (15 or
          50 ml tube) and spin appropriately (avoid using too many gravities and
          too long a time, a commonly wrong practice). Again, do not discard the
          pipet (it is wise to hold on to a pipet until you are certain you need
          a new/clean one).
        </li>
        <li>
          Either pour off, or use the pipet you have (probably better, since
          cell pellet packing is not tight—nor should it be!!!—and
          unpredictable) to remove the supernatant. Discard the pipet.
        </li>
        <li>
          With a new pipet, add enough HBSS to provide the correct volume
          estimated for getting good cell counts. A cell suspension too
          concentrated and too dilute—especially too concentrated!—gives
          inaccurate counts. You generally want at least 25 and no more than 400
          cells in a quarter grid of the hemocytometer, representing a range of
          about 250,000 to 4 million cells per milliliter (but cell size can
          alter that factor up or down). Add a drop from the well-mixed cell
          suspension to the tube to be used for preparing dilutions for counts
          (if trypan-blue is to be added, for example). Do not discard the
          pipet.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the count is complete and the calculations done, then it is time
          to make adjustments. Make sure that you are aware of certain
          <a href="#rules">rules</a>
          when planning distribution of cells to the multi-well plates or to
          dishes. If making dilutions, use a single appropriate pipet to fill up
          containers with the appropriate volume of any diluent medium, and then
          use the pipet to take a volume from the cell suspension, and move it
          from container to container in a serial dilution process, always using
          the same pipet. If you use single-tube serial dilution process, you
          need to remove the fraction of medium to be discarded, and then use a
          new pipet to add diluent medium; you could alternatively pour in
          dilution medium to a volumetric mark on the tube, but pouring in
          medium requires a steady hand not to overshoot the mark, and this
          should not be done when cell counts per unit volume are critical at
          the lower densities. For example, some studies actually want no more
          than 5-10 cells/cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          , which means for a 6-well dish (10 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          per well), no more than 50-100 cells per well can be added, and that
          50-100 cells/ml will be necessary if 1 ml is added to the well
          (followed by 2 ml plain medium), or 17-33 cells/ml if 3 ml is added
          (the typical volume of a well in a 6-well dish). Here the balance here
          is the use of more tubes or pipets. Depending on the tube used, pipets
          usually run more cheaply (even individually wrapped sterile ones).
        </li>
        <li>
          If it is decided that plates will get a volume of cell suspension
          followed by a volume of an additional medium to bring them up to
          capacity, or to mix in a treatment medium not added directly to cell
          suspensions, then pipet out plain medium first to wells, then either
          treatment medium or cells. Always work from the medium to which all
          cells would be exposed to the pipetting of cells that would be exposed
          to the previous medium (the clean-to-dirty rule). Use a new pipet
          whenever there is doubt. Never give a higher priority to minimizing
          pipet/container use when there is the possibility of ruining an
          experiment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        As always, the minimization of your material use must be balanced
        against the cost in time lost and in labor/salaries when minimizing
        material use puts too much of a risk for contamination. This can only be
        learned through experience in culturing in general, and through
        culturing specific cell types.
      </p>
      <h2 id="rules">Rules To Live By In Culturing</h2>
      <p>
        This is one person's opinion about rules to live by when culturing or
        preparing cells for treatment or other experiments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Never increase the number of variables in an experiment which can
          increase the error, uncertainty, or doubt about the resulting data.
          For example, if you calculate that you need 100 ml of cells at 20,000
          cells per milliliter to distribute to the wells of plates, prepare a
          single volume of 100 ml of cells at that concentration. Do not prepare
          a 50 ml suspension, and then another 50 ml suspension (either by
          design or by the realization that a mistake was made and you need
          more). This adds unwanted variation and shows poor planning. Use a
          large flask, which can take as much as 500 ml of a cell suspension, if
          necessary, but rarely do well-planned experiments require that much.
        </li>
        <li>
          Never take on more than can be managed, especially if treatments are
          measured in minutes instead of hours or days. Plan the count of
          replicates and treatments (dose or time inputs) to a manageable level.
          If there are multiple variables to be tested, do each variable in a
          single experiment rather than all of them in a single experiment (if
          possible). With each experiment, one can determine the optimal
          treatment, and then proceed to the next variable in a subsequent
          experiment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Walk through in your mind, i.e. imagine, the steps you will take in
          the culture room before you do them. Scratch them done in an ordered
          numerical list of steps to take. You may not think of everything by
          this process, but then again, you might.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have to dilute by a few orders of magntiude (that is, you find
          you have 20 million cells and you only need 20,000 cells total), then
          there are several approaches you can take. One is to do serial log
          dilutions within the tube of cells (i.e. bring it up to 5 or 10 ml,
          then remove 4.5 or 9 ml, respectively and discard, and repeat the
          process), or the other is to do dilutions by serial transfers (i.e.,
          prepare a series of tubes with 9 or 4.5 ml of diluent medium, and then
          transfer 1 or 0.5 ml from tube to tube after mixing).
        </li>
        <li>
          If you find that want to freeze and/or subculture the balance of cells
          that you will not use in the multi-well plates, do those things last
          rather than first: the multi-well plate inoculations represent your
          experiments most likely, and thus should be given a higher priority.
          Cells are hardy enough to sit while you do the pipetting. Do freezing
          and/or subculturing ahead of multi-well plate seeding only if you have
          experience that delaying freezing and/or subculturing seriously
          reduces viability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="subculture">Subculturing Cells: General Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        The method details involved in the
        <q>passaging</q>
        or subculturing of cells will vary from one cell type to another. Each
        cell that adheres to a culture substrate varies in its ability to be
        unbound or forcibly removed from its substratum. The particular method
        for your cell type will depend much upon gaining experience with how the
        cells behave in culture.
      </p>
      <h3>Detachment of Cultured Cells by Trypsin/EDTA</h3>
      <p>
        Cultured rat bone marrow cells are rather typical in their ability to be
        detached as cells adhering to uncoated tissue culture plastic. The cells
        make use of trypsin/EDTA solutions that are generally ready-made
        commercially. The time required for detachment depends somewhat on the
        passage number as well as how confluent or overgrown the cells may be.
        Early passage cells tend to form bipolar-shaped cells that orient
        themselves in axes that are described as "swirling," where as later
        passage cells tend to look more stellate, broad and flat. Early passage
        cells detach more quickly, while later passage cells are more resistant
        (require a longer time).
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If your purpose in detaching cells is to freeze (cryopreserve) them,
          then cells should be healthy. This means that they have not been
          sitting in media that should have been changed days ago. Cells
          weakened by improper feeding are more likely to revitalize (thaw from
          cryopreservation) in lower numbers than those cells more fit because
          of proper care.
        </li>
        <li>
          The commercially available trypsin/EDTA usually comes as a 10 × stock
          (2.5% trypsin and 5 mM EDTA). This is diluted with a balanced salts
          solution to the desired concentration, typically 1 ×. Aliquot large 10
          × stocks to containers that prevent repeated thawing and freezing.
          Trypsin is an enzyme/protein, and repeated freezing and thawing
          reduces its proteolytic activity. Trypsin is also auto-proteolytic,
          meaning that it is a protease that will digest itself. It is not a
          good idea to leave it in a 37° water bath for several hours, for it
          may be much reduced in activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour out the media in the flasks containing your cultured cells to be
          detached. (Note, you need not use a pipet to remove media; just pour
          out the old media into a waste beaker, taking care not to let anything
          splash back into the flask. See
          <a href="#goodprac">good tissue culture practices</a>
          for more information.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Rinse your flask of cells with HBSS. Add sufficient volume to cover a
          couple of millimeters in depth, and swirl the rinse well. Pour out the
          salt solution into the waste. The purpose of rinsing the cells in the
          salt solution is to remove traces of serum present in the medium.
          Serum contains anti-trypsin inhibitors, and this can slow or inhibit
          the action of the trypsin-EDTA solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a minimal amount of trypsin-EDTA solution. This is usually enough
          just to cover the cells. Some people use half the volume of what
          covers the cells, and then spreads the solution all around so that all
          cells make contact with the solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inspect the flask under the microscope. Perhaps it is possible to see
          cells already detaching. There are cell-substratum and cell-cell
          attachments to break. I think the trypsin tends break the cell-cell
          connections, while the EDTA ties up the Mg
          <sup>2+</sup>
          and Ca
          <sup>2+</sup>
          salts that make cell-substratum attachment more likely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the flask in the 37° incubator for a few minutes. The optimal
          temperature for trypsin activity is 37°, and so it will work faster.
          From time to time, remove the flask from the incubator. Inspect the
          progress of detachment. Swirl the flask back and forth. If &gt;95% of
          the cells have lifted from the surface, it is okay to continue with
          the next step. Although it is common to see experienced cell
          culturists banging the flask with the heel of their hands to jar cells
          loose, the use of this method to dislodge cells is not recommended:
          such a technique will break cell-substratum contacts, but does not
          break cell-cell contact, and so cells will come off in sheets rather
          than as single cell suspensions.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is useful to add in a small volume (at least 1/3 to 2/3 of the
          volume of trypsin-EDTA) of serum-containing medium to the flask: the
          anti-trypsin in the serum can be used to neutralize the trypsin. This
          is optional although recommended.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the pipet to draw in a small amount of medium now containing cell
          suspension, and forcefully blow out along all the floor surface on
          which the cells adhered. This may be done several times to cover the
          floor. This washes loose any further cells.

        <li>
          It is possible to remove cells in the trypsin-EDTA solution and
          inoculate them directly into new flasks for subculturing if:
          <ul>
            <li>
              a minimal amount of trypsin-EDTA was used such that the volume of
              medium to which the cells would be transferred would exceed by
              more than 15- to 20-fold the volume of trypsin-EDTA used
            </li>
            <li>
              the cells were not sensitive to either trypsin or EDTA or their
              growth inhibited in culture
            </li>
          </ul>
          Add sufficient medium, and then inoculate the flasks with the initial
          cell density desired. Normally cells are diluted at least by half
          (1:2), but a typical subculturing can be 1:3 to 1:5.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the trypsin-EDTA is to be removed (always a safe practice), choose
          the correct spin tube and transfer the cell solution in the flask to
          the tube. Spin for 5 min at 50-100 ×
          <i>g</i>
          (or the appropriate settings for the cell type).
        </li>
        <li>
          If the cells were centrifuged from the trypsin-EDTA step, remove the
          supernatant. If the cell pack is firm and will not come loose, then
          just pour off the supernatant. If there is doubt that the cell pellet
          is loose or can pour off, use a pipet to remove the supernatant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add media to the spin tube (if you decided to spin out the
          trypsin-EDTA solution), and resuspend the cells. Inoculate new flask
          at the desired cell density.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="freezing">Freezing and Thawing Cells</h2>
      <p>
        Freezing and re-vitalizing (thawing) cells can be a tricky business. The
        conditions by which to freeze them sometimes need to be optimized
        especially for sensitive cell lines. Some things are universally
        understood. A cryopreservative agent (DMSO, glycerol) is used to lower
        the freezing point; this prevents damaging crystal formation. Moreover
        the rate at which temperature decrease occurs is slowed so that crystals
        do not form inside the cell and puncture the membrane.
      </p>
      <h3>Freezing</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The cells to be frozen should be in the most fit condition. If the
          cells are proliferating (have active cell cycles), the ideal cells are
          in logarithmic growth phase, in medium that is 1 or 2 days old at the
          most.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare your cryopreservation medium (thaw it or make it). The kind of
          medium varies, but typical components are serum (fetal bovine), growth
          medium, and a cryopreservative (DMSO). For bone marrow cells a
          cryopreservation medium of 60% growth medium, 35% FBS, and 5% DMSO is
          used.
        </li>
        <li>
          Detach the cells from the flask as usual (trypsin/EDTA). Spin them
          down. Resuspend in 10 or more cell pellet volumes of HBSS. Take an
          aliquot and determine the total cell count. It is really necessary to
          count the number of cells you intend to freeze, so that the person who
          thaws them (it may not be you) knows how many cells he might get.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare your cryovials on a rack. Loosen but do not remove the cap for
          easy opening, filling and closing.
        </li>
        <li>Spin down the cells again and remove the HBSS rinse.</li>
        <li>
          Add the volume of cryopreservation medium you intend to use (it's the
          product of the volume you want per vial and the number of vials you
          have). It's a good idea to adjust the number of vials and volume of
          your cryomedium so that you have at least 1 million cells per
          milliliter. More than 5 million cells per milliliter is probably too
          dense, but then you may have a luxury of cells too. Resuspend the
          cells very well! You should not see clumps or aggregates of cells. If
          you do, let them settle out and make sure you do not pipet them into
          the vials.
        </li>
        <li>Distribute the cell suspension to the cryovials.</li>
        <li>
          Place the vials with a special container designed to freeze cells.
          Nalgene (?) makes a product called
          <q>Mr. Freeze</q>
          which is filled with isopropanol and is designed to slowly freeze
          cells.
        </li>
        <li>
          Archive the cells with a reasonable effort at organization. Long-term
          storage of cells is best in a liquid nitrogen container, but a −70°
          freezer can store cells as long as 6 months.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3><a name="thawing">Revitalization (Thawing)</a></h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Have your growth medium warmed at 37° before taking cells out of the
          freezer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have all the things you will use to re-vitalize the cells ready to go,
          in the hood or at hand. Disposable pipets, flasks, spin tubes (if
          used).
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare the hood as usual: place sash at the position you will want
          it, then start blower motor, wait at least 15-20 min for sterile
          containment to develop. You might also want to mist (spray upward) the
          chamber with 70% ethanol. Your work area should be uncluttered,
          especially with the tools of others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Retrieve the cells from the freezer, and immediately place them in a
          37° water bath. Rapid thawing is absolutely preferable to slow
          thawing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do either (a) or (b):
          <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
            <li>
              <b>Lazy revitalization</b>
              . This technique works but depends on how hardy your cells are
              (most are). The rapidly thawed cell suspension is just added to
              the medium in your flask, and the cells are allowed to detach
              overnight. You can then replace the medium the next day to remove
              components present in the freezing medium (particularly DMSO).
              Note this technique is similar to the
              <q>lazy</q>
              serial passaging method of confluent cells, in which a bare
              minimum of trypsin and/or EDTA is used to detach cells, and then
              the cells (or a fraction of them) are recovered after diluting
              with medium and without removing (by centrifugation) the
              trypsin/EDTA.

      <h3 id="ratprep">Preparing the Rat</h3>
      <p>
        More than one rat can be prepared at a time. The experienced individual
        will attempt at most a half dozen rats, if the bone marrow of each rat
        is to be handled separately; more rats, if all the cells can be pooled
        and cultured.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obtain the rats from the housing facility. There are no real
        restrictions on the size of the rat. Rats obtained in the 150-175 g
        weight range will double their weight in a few weeks easily. The quality
        and yield of stem cell could be age/weight-related. The equipment used,
        such as the needle gauges for flushing marrow, will certainly depend on
        the size of the rat used.
      </p>
      <h4 id="heparin">Heparin</h4>
      <p>
        Before the rat is sacrificed, it is thought that the flushing of the
        marrow is assisted by administration of the anticoagulant heparin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weigh the rat, and inject intraperitoneally (i.p.) 2-3 units heparin per
        gram body weight.
      </p>
      <p>Wait about one hour before the sacrifice.</p>
      <h4 id="halothane">Sacrifice by Halothane Poisoning</h4>
      <p>
        The animal handling protocol specifies and demands that the animal be
        killed using halothane poisoning (
        <q>lethal anesthesia</q>
        ).
      </p>
      <p>
        Obtain a large dessicator with ceramic inner support. Cover the support
        with a paper towel; the animal will rest upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Place the dessicator in a fume hood.
        <strong>
          Any dessicator or container to be used for this poisoning procedure is
          NOT to be placed outside an operational fume hood. Halothane is quite
          volatile, and will kill technicians, if mishandled, as effectively as
          it kills rats.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        With the dessicator and bottle of halothane inside the fume hood, open
        the bottle of halothane within the fume hood, and pour out 5&nbsp;ml or
        so (often a capful) into the lower chamber of the dessicator (where the
        dessicant usually goes). It can be poured on to a towel or cotton wool,
        although it is not necessary. Close the dessicator lid immediately, if
        the rat is not placed in immediately. This also allows the halothane to
        distribute in the dessicator.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technician should wear gloves (not latex, but nitrile) when handling
        the halothane. Halothane is a fluorocarbon that can pass through skin
        (?), and this should be kept in mind when giving the greatest respect to
        this substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will take about 10-15 minutes for the animal to be ready. It
        generally moves around for a while, then goes limp, but continues to
        breathe for a while. It seems that the breathing becomes quite rapid
        until it stops.
      </p>
      <p>
        One can take the animal while it is breathing, but it is important to
        cut the animal open quickly and cut a major artery such that it bleeds
        profusely. Otherwise the animal can recover. However, leaving the animal
        in a bit longer after it has stopped breathing will assure the
        technician more time in cutting the animal open and bleeding it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="dissect">Dissection</h3>
      <p>
        Obtain
        <em>sharp-pointed</em>
        scissors that have been cleaned with water in mild detergent, and given
        a wipe with 70% ethanol (referred to just as ethanol hereafter). A large
        and small size pair of these scissors is useful.
      </p>
      <h4 id="hindlimbs">Removing the Hind Limbs</h4>
      <p>
        Lay out a disposable covering (such as plastic-backed absorbent paper)
        for working with the animal and catching any blood. The animal is laid
        on its back, and the abdomen soaked in ethanol prior to the first cut.
        On the inner side of the hind leg, begin cutting into the skin/fur at
        the most posterior point and proceed to cut the skin anteriorly to the
        anterior of the hind leg, then cutting dorsally. The intention is to
        remove as much skin covering the hind leg, and expose the muscles of the
        hind leg. Short cuts can be done to pull back skin and fur from the hind
        leg. Cut the skin also toward the ankle of the leg.
      </p>
      <p>
        With skin pulled back as much as possible, begin cutting muscle located
        at the head of the femur, muscle which proceeds toward the knee. This
        makes the femur more movable at wider angles, and allows the hind leg to
        be bent backwards to break the capsule that forms the hip joint and
        expose the ball joint of the femur head.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technician should be careful not to lose time in butchering the hind
        leg: feel for the femur with the gloved hand, and cut only the muscle
        alongside it near its head, enough to allow its greater angular movement
        and exposure of the hip joint. The pearl-white appearance of the ball
        joint liberated from the acetabular capsule will be apparent. Cut free
        the hind leg from the body. Repeat the same process for the other hind
        leg.
      </p>
      <h4 id="bonefrommuscle">Freeing Bone from Muscle</h4>
      <p>
        The red marrow of the long bones is used. This means recovering the
        femur and tibia. The muscle and ligaments surrounding and attaching to
        these bones is not so much cut away, but pulled away. Generally the
        tibia is the cleanest, with few if any insertions of tendons. The femur
        requires some trimming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enough skin must have been cut in the anterior of the ankle to expose
        the bones and ligaments of the ankle. Grasp the ankle/foot, and pull the
        foot backwards. A cracking noise should be heard, and the ankle pulled
        with sufficient force backwards (dorsally) and then up (anteriorally)
        such that the tibial articulation is exposed. Observe carefully that a
        tendon or ligament does not cause any resistance to the pulling action.
        Cut it first before proceeding. Pull the ankle with attached ligaments
        anterior to expose more of the tibia. When enough tibia is exposed to
        grasp it, firmly hold the bone and pull downward and at an angle. This
        will cause the tibia to separate completely from the muscle. The tibia
        should be entirely free of muscle. The wire-thin fibula may be attached
        as well, if it was not broken in the handling; it can be removed (broken
        off).
      </p>
      <p>
        To liberate the femur, feel for the long capsule forming the patellar
        joint. Use scissor to cut into it, and crack it open. Do not cut through
        all the way. The opening in the patellar region provides an opening to
        force the patellar end of the femur through. Attempt for the femur
        through the opening, cracking the patellar capsule if necessary. Pull
        back and upward the mass of muscle and capsule until enough of the femur
        is exposed to grasp it. Grasp the femur and continue pulling more muscle
        away from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examine the bones for any excess muscle and fat, and trim these away as
        much as possible. The smaller-sized scissors may be useful for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Place the bones in something like a weighing boat. Liberally apply
        ethanol to all areas and surfaces of the bone.
        <strong>
          Do not let the bones sit in a pool of ethanol. Pour off the excess.
        </strong>
        Take the ethanol-bathed bones dry to the sterile hood and let them dry
        within the hood. Do not let them dry outside the hood.
      </p>
      <h3 id="underhood">Under the Sterile Hood</h3>
      <p>
        These steps should have been completed just after the rat was kept
        waiting after injection of heparin.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Place a polymer kitchen cutting board in the hood. It should be washed
          with mild detergent (Alkonox, etc.), rinsed liberally, then sprayed
          with ethanol, and allowed to dry in the hood under the UV light.
        </li>
        <li>
          Obtain a very fine tooth saw (or whatever will be used to cut through
          the bone). It should be washed (if not already clean) and sprayed with
          ethanol and kept in the hood.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have available a selection of needles: 22-, 18-, 16-, and 14-gauge,
          washed and sterilized or packaged sterile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have available a 3-, 5- or 10-ml sterile syringe. 5-ml is comfortable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sterile 15-ml polystyrene tubes (at least half a dozen) should be
          available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sterile Ficoll-Paque or suitable lymphocyte enrichment/purification
          medium should be available (3-4&nbsp;ml per animal prepared).
        </li>
        <li>
          Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (about 30-50&nbsp;ml per animal) should
          be available
        </li>
        <li>
          A sterile 75&nbsp;cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          tissue culture plastic flask.
        </li>
        <li>
          About 25-30&nbsp;ml growth medium will be necessary. Rat stem cells
          appear to like α-Modified Essential Medium with 2 mM glutamine, 100
          units pencillin/ml, 100 μg streptomycin/ml, and 20% fetal bovine
          serum.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="bonesawing">Sawing the Bones</h4>
      <p>
        The bones having been allowed to dry after the brief ethanol soaking
        should be examined for any need to trim excess muscle or fat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grasp the ethanol-cleaned fine-tooth saw and grab the first long bone.
        The head of the bone will be cut first. If it is the femur, begin
        cutting at the trochanteric angle where it meets the diaphysis of the
        bone. If it is the tibia, start about 1 mm below the condyles. Cut at a
        right angle to long axis of the bone. Do not saw back and forth; the
        sawing action works better if the saw is pulled towards the technician.
        Concentrate on starting the initial cut, then the sawing proceeds more
        easily. There is usually no need to press down while sawing. Saw clean
        through. Sometimes the bone separates in a
        <q>greenstick</q>
        manner, but saw through the separation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeat the same for the other end. For the femur, just above the
        condyles will do. For the tibia, the red marrow appears to extend down
        only to a halfway point along the diaphysis, and it is wise to saw at a
        point 1-2&nbsp;mm above an obvious change in the body of the tibia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cut only one bone at a time and proceed to the next (flushing) step. Do
        not cut all bones at once, then go to flushing.
      </p>
      <h4 id="flushing">Flushing the Marrow</h4>
      <p>
        The bones can be grasped with a hemostat that has been sprung slightly
        such that it hooks the first catch without applying excessive pressure.
        Usually hemostats apply too much pressure to the cut bones when one
        tries to hook the first catch, which is why that springing the hemostats
        even to the second catch with a rod approximating the bone diameter is a
        useful idea. Save the ideally sprung hemostat in a special place, and
        designate for the marrow recovery method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fit a syringe (5 or 10&nbsp;ml probably is ideal, but 3&nbsp;ml will
        work too) with a 20 or 22 gauge needle, and draw in fully Hanks’
        Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). (If that’s too slow, fit first with an 18
        gauge needle and draw in, then switch to the smaller needle.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Grab the bone held by hemostats in the weak hand and hold it over the
        mouth of a 15&nbsp;ml sterile centrifuge tube (keep the lid handy and
        clean). One end of the shaft will point down into the mouth of the tube,
        and the other end will have a needle inserted into it. It is probably
        better to insert the needle into the larger end, with the red-colored
        cancellous bone evident.
      </p>
      <p>
        While inserting the needle, twist in a clockwise-counterclockwise
        back-and-forth action and push in a little bit at a time. Push on the
        plunger a little bit to fill the penetrating hole with fluid, but not so
        much as there is a backflush that drips from the insertion point.
        Continue penetrating and filling with fluid until the needle is well
        into the bone. When pushing on the plunger, do not apply the pressure
        slowly, but in quick rapid pulses designed to apply maximum pressure in
        less than a second before releasing the pressure. Continue penetrating
        until the needle emerges on the other end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bring the needle back, not all the way, but about to the middle again,
        and try
        <q>digging</q>
        or penetrating at another angle, as if to scrape the inside of the shaft
        with the needle. Do this at several angles. Combine it with forceful
        ejections of a small amount of solution to flush out the marrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this combined scraping and flushing action, it is possible to
        observe the very red marrow perhaps emerging out of the end of the cut,
        and perhaps hanging on to it. Continue working the needle around it
        until the tissue comes out completely free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remove the needle. Check the amount of solution in the syringe, and fill
        if more than half was used. Now insert the needle into the other end,
        and try scraping as well the other end. To be more effective, it is
        useful to change to a larger needle, though small enough to be able to
        insert into the bone. The length of all needles used however must be
        greater than the length of the bone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspect the bone for thoroughness of flushing. It is unlikely that all
        red marrow will be recovered, but if greater than 80% is obtained, that
        is often sufficient. It is often possible to look down and through the
        long bone’s shaft after a successful flushing.
      </p>
      <h4 id="breakingup">Breaking Up the Tissue</h4>
      <p>
        Single cell suspensions are important in liberating stem cells from
        clusters of cells that may hide them, and prevent them from adhering to
        the floor of tissue culture plastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by drawing in and out with a 5&nbsp;ml pipet the tissue to try to
        break it into clumps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then take a syringe fitted with a larger needle (14 or 16 guage), and
        draw it in and out in the same way. Proceed to successively smaller
        (higher gauge) needles to create a more uniform dispersion.
      </p>
      <h4 id="centrifuge">Density Medium Centrifugation</h4>
      <p>
        Spin the tube at no more than 100 ×
        <i>g</i>
        (not greater 900 rpm in the model in Room 2101), as low as 50 ×
        <i>g</i>
        . The time of the spin will depend on distance between the top of the
        volume and the bottom of the tube. With tubes that are more full, about
        5 or more minutes is okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it is spinning, set up in new 15&nbsp;ml tubes (one for each set
        of bones from a single animal processed) about 3&nbsp;ml of a
        mononuclear density separation medium, such as Ficoll-Paque, Histo-Paque
        177, or other suitable cushion.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the spin completed, either draw off from the supernatant enough
        volume so that 3-4&nbsp;ml of solution remains, or draw it all off, and
        add 3-4&nbsp;ml HBSS. In that 3-4&nbsp;ml volume, resuspend the cell
        pellet. Wait 15-30 seconds for bone spicules and heavy material that
        does not resuspend to settle. Draw up as much volume as possible,
        without drawing up the settled material. With the volume in the pipet,
        wait to see if something settles out into the tip: push that part in the
        tip out.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the blow-out switch on the pipettor set for
        <q>S</q>
        (slowest), insert the pipet into the 15&nbsp;ml tube, which has been
        angled to 30-45° off the vertical. The pipet tip should come to rest
        against the lower of the inside of the 15&nbsp;ml, just above the level
        of the Ficoll, and the body/shaft of the pipet is support on the
        15&nbsp;ml tube mouth edge, touching the tube on the opposite of its
        diameter. This gives steady support for the pipet inside the centrifuge
        tube. Slowly squeeze the blow-out control of the pipettor such that the
        cell suspension is layered gently over the top of the Ficoll without
        undue mixing or disturbance of the more dense cushion. The flow rate
        could be as slow as 0.5 to 1&nbsp;ml/min, at least initially. Raise the
        pipet tip so that it is always above the level of the suspension as it
        is dispensed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carefully move the layered tube to the centrifuge, and spin at 400 ×
        <i>g</i>
        for 30-40 minutes (this is about 1900 rpm for the centrifuge in 2101).
      </p>
      <p>
        When complete, the layers appear almost as when they were loaded. The
        pink-colored phase on top is the Hanks’ solution which should largely be
        composed of platelets. The bottom white phase will be rather opaque, and
        is supposed to be rich in granulocytic cells. The dark-red pellet at the
        bottom are hemoglobin-rich cells (erythryocytes at some stage of
        maturity or development). At the interface between the white- and
        pink-colored phases is the band where the mononuclear cells will
        migrate: this usually yellow-colored band includes lymphocytes,
        monocytes, and stem cells.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recovery of the cells at the interface involves plunging—somewhat
        deliberately but without mixing—a 5&nbsp;ml pipet with the tip on, or
        better, just slightly below the interface. With the suck-in control of
        the pipettor set to
        <q>S</q>
        (for slow), draw in the cells at the interface with a slow circular
        movement of the pipet tip to sweep the area. It is possible that a good
        portion of the pink upper phase and the white lower phase will also be
        collected. This is to be more liberal rather than conservative in
        recovering cells, worrying less about the presence of contaminating cell
        types and more about recovering all possible stem cells. It is possible
        that as much as half (3&nbsp;ml) of the total volume is recovered in
        drawing out the mononuclear cells.
      </p>
      <p>
        The collected material is put into a fresh 15&nbsp;ml tube. Add 2
        volumes of Hanks to this material, and mix well. Spin 50-100 ×
        <i>g</i>
        for 4-5 min. Remove the supernatant.
      </p>
      <h3 id="final">Final Handling</h3>
      <p>
        If the cells are to be counted at all, it is a better idea to resuspend
        in HBSS, because it is calcium- and magnesium-free, although cells do
        not really clump at all in medium (serum in medium makes any trypan blue
        use more dark however).
      </p>
      <p>
        If the cells are to be set up for primary culture, they can be
        re-suspended in about 5&nbsp;ml of culture medium. (Rat cells appear to
        like α-MEM with 2 mM Gln, P/S, and 20% FBS.) The entire yield from a
        tibiofemoral set of a single animal (from 5-20 million cells) can be
        plated to a 75&nbsp;cm
        <sup>2</sup>
        flask. A 2-3 mm depth of culture medium requires 15-25&nbsp;ml.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cells in primary culture should be left at least 24 hours for cells to
        adhere. In fact, 72 hours may be ideal for allowing cells to establish
        themselves (see Haynesworth et al.,
        <i>Bone</i>
        <b>13</b>
        : 81, 1992). The medium is changed about every 3-4 days (twice a week)
        to maintain logarithmic growth and healthy cells. At about 12-16 days,
        the colonies of cells have multiplied sufficiently to make it confluent,
        and the flask is ready for its first trypsin-EDTA-mediated detachment.
        Follow the seed lot storage protocol to maintain lots of cells properly.
      </p>
      <h3 id="vary">Variations in Isolation</h3>
      <p>
        There are many variations/modifications to the method described above:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Canine nail clippers are used to cut off the ends of the bones rather
          than a fine-tooth saw
        </li>
        <li>
          It is possible to omit the Ficoll (density separation medium) step.
          However there are more contaminating cell types to deal with, and the
          sheer numbers of cells packed into a culture flask could inhibit or
          otherwise affect the ability of stem cells to establish themselves.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="passaging">Passaging Cultures</h3>
      <p>
        Cells can be detached from coated or uncoated tissue culture plastic by
        a combination of treatment with trypsin and ethylenediamine tetraacetate
        (EDTA). Cells probably adhere to plastic or matrix coats with a
        combination of proteins and magnesium and calcium salts; the protease
        trypsin disrupts the proteins, while EDTA chelates the divalent ions.
        Trypsin and EDTA are dissolved in an isotonic unbuffered medium
        (balanced salts solution, possibly with a phenol red pH indicator), with
        EDTA usually at 0.5 millimolar, and trypsin at 0.25-0.5% (w/v). The
        level of trypsin and EDTA—particularly the level of trypsin—can vary
        according to cell type and how adherent a cell is or to the extent of
        confluence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detachment (trypsinization) of cells can be done in two ways. One method
        does not bother to wash cells free of trypsin (it also uses less
        resources such as a wash tube), and the other does wash cells. The
        does-not-wash method would be suitable for cell types whose survival is
        not overly sensitive to the presence of trypsin, and especially where
        the passage involves splitting one flask into three or more, where the
        trypsin can be diluted to sure harmlessness. If not sure, then the
        does-wash technique is always safe.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Detachment with Trypsin
        <i>Without</i>
        Washing
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Obtain sufficient Hanks’ balanced salts solution (HBSS) for rinsing
          out serum-containing medium from the flasks for the number of
          containers to be treated. Sterile trypsin-EDTA is usually aliquoted
          into 17&nbsp;×&nbsp;100 mm (polypropylene) tubes to contain 10-12 ml
          and stored in the freezer. Place tubes to thaw. If tubes are placed to
          thaw in pre-warming (37°) water bath, place them in the bath only for
          the time needed to thaw them, since trypsin auto-proteolyzes, and the
          extent of auto-proteolysis is temperature- (and time-)dependent.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the sterile hood, pour out (or pipet off) culture/growth medium
          into a waste container.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pipet in sufficient volume for a 1-2 mm depth of serum-free balanced
          salts solution. For example, for a 75 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask, this would be 7.5-15 ml volume (= 75 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          × [0.1 to 0.2] cm = 7.5 to 15 cm
          <sup>3</sup>
          ). Rotate in a circular motion the flask a few times to ensure a good
          washing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the wash step with balanced salt solution (about half of the
          first wash volume can be used). The second washing is because a bare
          minimum of trypsin-EDTA solution is used, and it is even more
          important to wash out serum-based medium. Rock/rotate the flask in a
          circular motion a few times.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pipet in a volume of trypsin-EDTA just sufficient to coat (and no
          more) the portion of the flask upon which the cells grow. Put the cap
          on the flask tight (to maintain sterility).
        </li>
        <li>
          Look at the flask under the microscope. It may be possible to observe
          clusters of cells breaking free from the plastic floor, and cells from
          each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most cell types require an incubation time of 4-5 min. Place the flask
          in the incubator (the temperature optimum of trypsin is 37°). After
          the period, remove the flask from the incubator and look at it under
          the microscope to see if most (&gt;90-95%) of the cells have detached.
        </li>
        <li>
          If cells have not detached to expectation, rock the flask in a
          circular motion to swirl to coat the flask again. Place back in the
          incubator for another 3-5 min. If most cells have not detached still,
          try another minimal volume of trypsin-EDTA, and repeat the incubation.
          It is advised
          <em>not</em>
          to shock the flask with the heel of the hand to dislodge cells: cells
          will come off in sheets from the flask without detaching from each
          other to form single cell suspensions, and it will not be understood
          correctly what conditions of trypsin-EDTA produce single cell
          suspensions.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the detachment to single cells (or small clusters) is sufficient,
          add a volume of serum-containing medium that is about one-tenth (in
          ml) of the area of the flask (2-3 ml for a 25 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask, 6-7 ml for a 75 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask, 12-15 ml for a 150 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask). The serum in the medium contains anti-trypsin agents to stop
          the action of trypsin. Draw in a pipetful of cell suspension, and blow
          it (with medium force) across the floor where the cells were growing.
          This dislodges any more cells and washes the floor of cells. Repeat
          this a few times until the floor has been well covered.
        </li>
        <li>
          The detached cells are ready for use as is. If plating to fresh flasks
          without counting the cells, it is only necessary to divide the volume
          in the used flask so that each flask gets an equal amount. If part of
          the detached cells are to be distributed to wells of plates or to
          dishes, or to be used in other experiments, it is probably useful to
          obtain a count on a hemocytometer first, then divide the cells as
          needed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When manipulating multiple containers, it is possible to perform each
        step on all containers, rather than all steps only on one container
        before proceeding to the next container.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Detachment with Trypsin
        <i>With</i>
        Washing
      </h4>
      <p>
        If the trypsin-EDTA is to be washed from the cells after detachment
        (more typically done), the following modifications to the does-not-wash
        method can be done.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is less critical that the bare minimum volume—one just enough to
          coat the cell layer—of trypsin-EDTA in Step #5 be used. Using a volume
          that covers a 0.5 mm depth (for a 75 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          , that would be 75 cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          × 0.05 cm = 3.75 cm
          <sup>3</sup>
          , or 4 ml or so) is probably good enough. Rock or swirl the solution
          in the flask as for the does-not-wash method.
        </li>
        <li>
          At Step #10, transfer the cells to sterile conical centrifuge tube of
          the appropriate size (15 or 50 ml tube). Spin the cells gently (50-100
          <i>g</i>
          for about 5 min) to pellet them, and remove the supernatant. Resuspend
          cells in growth medium, or in the appropriate solution for use of
          cells for experimentation. It is probably useful to count cells as
          well.

      <h3>By Trypan Blue</h3>
      <p>For ethidium bromide/acridine orange viability, see next section.</p>
      <p>
        A typical method is that described by M. K. Patterson (1979)
        <i>Meth. Enzymol.</i>
        <b>58</b>
        , 191-152. 1 vol of suspension of cells of about 300,000-500,000 per ml
        in serum-free maintenance medium is mixed with 1 vol of 0.4%-2.0% trypan
        blue dye in PBS, and cells excluding dye are counted. The total volume
        must be sufficient to fill a hemocytometer platform with a grid for
        counting. This is usually 10 μl. The hemocytometer platform must be
        neither overfilled (fluid
        <q>bulging</q>
        beyond the platform border) nor underfilled (fluid not covering all the
        platform).
      </p>
      <p>
        Allow at least a couple of minutes for the dead cells to take up the
        dye. The microscope is ideally set with a 10× phase objective with a
        green filter (the human eye is most sensitive and visual acuity is
        likely to be greatest to the middle of the visible spectrum, that being
        green light).
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire grid on a hemocytometer has 9 major zones, arranged in a 3 ×
        3 grid, marked by triple lines. Within the major zones at the four
        corners, single line grids form 16 minor zones arranged in a 4 × 4 grid.
        Within the major zones that are centered between the corner zones and
        the very center of the grid itself, the lines forming the minor zones
        are double lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the 9 major zones is a 0.1&nbsp;cm × 0.1&nbsp;cm square. When
        the coverslip is placed over the hemocytometer, its surface is supposed
        to be 0.01&nbsp;cm from the floor of the surface with the grid.
        Therefore, the cells within the major zone occur in a volume that is 10
        <sup>−4</sup>
        &nbsp;cm
        <sup>3</sup>
        , or 10
        <sup>−4</sup>
        &nbsp;ml. Therefore, if one counted the cells in just a single major
        zone, multiplied by any dilution factor, then multiplied by 10,000, one
        would have the number of cells per milliliter.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not usual to count only one zone, but rather to sample several
        fields (zones) for a count, average them, and then use the average for
        the calculation. The standard method is to count all of the four corner
        zones, and some count the zone at the very center of the grid, for a
        total of five zones. During counting, many cells will fall across
        (straddle) a line, either the line bordering a major or minor zone. The
        usual rule is to count the cell if it falls on the line/border that is
        at the top and left of the zone, and to disregard the cell if it falls
        on the right or bottom of the zone. Develop a total cell count for each
        major zone counted, sum each of the totals of the zones, divide by the
        number of major zones counted to get the average, then multiply by the
        dilution factor and 10
        <sup>4</sup>
        to get the cells per ml.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the viable cell count, count the cells that do not take up the blue
        dye. To report the percent viability, divide the mean value of cells not
        taking up dye by the mean of all cells counted (both those that are blue
        and those that are phase bright).

          explained in the sections that follow.
        </p>
        <h3>Preparation of Cells</h3>
        <p>
          Prepare the cells as they would be prepared for doing a primary
          culture in a flask. It is highly recommended that cells be enriched in
          the type of adherent cell desired, since contaminating cells, whether
          adherent or not, might complicate the formation of colonies or the
          development by staining. The preparation of bone marrow mesenchymal
          stem cells, in particular, should involve a cell type separation via
          density centrifugation on a Ficoll-Paque cushion.
        </p>
        <p>
          CFU-F assays are possible
          <em>only</em>
          if the suspension is of single cells, and not cells clumped together.
          Strategies for producing single cell suspensions include mechanical
          means in which the cell suspension is passed serially through needles
          of successively higher gauges, such as from 18 gauge to 20 gauge. It
          is important also to use a Ca
          <sup>2+</sup>
          - and Mg
          <sup>2+</sup>
          -free medium in producing the single cell suspensions.
        </p>
        <h3>Counting Cells</h3>
        <p>
          Count the cells using a correctly gated automated analyzer (e.g.,
          Coulter) or manually by hemocytometer.
        </p>
        <p>
          To continue the example of the bone marrow stem cells, suppose 1.5
          million mononuclear cells have been determined.
        </p>
        <h3>Planning and Preparing Dilutions</h3>
        <p>
          If it is understood that all cells are not capable of forming colonies
          but the proportion that are is unknown, it will be necessary to
          perform logarithmic dilutions. The number of dilutions is
          log(cell&nbsp;count)&nbsp;−&nbsp;1, where the log(cell&nbsp;count) is
          rounded to the nearest integer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, if the proportion of cells capable of forming colonies is
          known either from previous experience or published research, a
          particular starting and ending dilution can be used to obviate the
          need to test a broad set of titers. Many publications re-iterate that
          1 in 10
          <sup>5</sup>
          mononuclear cells from bone marrow are stem cells. That would suggest
          that in 1.5 million cells, 15 cells are stem cells. Since each stem
          cell is capable of originating a colony, then 15 colonies would
          probably be counted. Providing that cells are well-dispersed (single
          cells) and well-mixed, it may be possible to plate all cells into a
          single container, such as a 75&nbsp;cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask or 100 mm culture dish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of just plating all cells at a single targeted dilution in one
          container, it is probably better to have at least two different
          dilutions (it may include the 1/1 dilution, or no dilution) and
          replicates within dilutions. Use of replicates (duplicates,
          triplicates) might indicate how well the cell suspenion is dispersed
          as well as pipetting technique. Instead of large containers for the
          replicates, consider smaller flasks (25&nbsp;cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          ) or dishes/multi-well plates.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the factor of the dilution, logarithmic (factor of 10)
          dilutions are adequate, and even the wise choice if there is a need to
          cover a range of several dilutions. In a follow-up experiment, once
          the proportion of colony-forming units to total cells is known, a
          smaller factor starting from the intial dilution will probably give a
          more precise count, if the follow-up is only to confirm numbers from
          the previous study.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine first the number of dilutions in the series that will be
          done, and the number of replicates per dilution. In the example, it is
          decided to look at cell suspension that is undiluted, at 1/10, and at
          1/100. It is also decided that duplicates will be plated at each
          dilution, in 25&nbsp;cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flasks. One 25&nbsp;cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask holding a culture medium with a 3 mm depth can only receive
          7.5&nbsp;ml medium maximally (25&nbsp;cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          × 0.3&nbsp;cm = 7.5&nbsp;cm
          <sup>3</sup>
          ). 90% of the total cells will be distributed to the total of the
          replicate flasks of a single dilution. If the 1.5 million cells are
          suspended as single cells, spin them down if they are not already in
          the plating medium. Re-suspend the cell pellet in plating medium to a
          final volume whose value is divisible by 5 or 10 to make calculations
          easier. Dilute cells out with plating medium to the starting dilution
          (not necessary if the starting dilution includes undiluted
          suspension). For successive dilutions by a factor of 10 from the
          starting dilution, add 90% of the volume of the starting dilution
          volume to empty sterile tubes using plating medium. In the example,
          the 1.5 million cells are resuspended in 10&nbsp;ml plating medium,
          and therefore 9&nbsp;ml of medium is added to two empty tubes
          representing the 1/10 and 1/100 dilutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.0&nbsp;ml is now taken out of the original cell suspension (a
          5&nbsp;ml pipet will do this more accurately than a 10 or 25&nbsp;ml
          pipet certainly) and placed into the 1/10 dilution tube. A 10&nbsp;ml
          pipet can then be used to draw in and out about a dozen times the
          diluted cell suspension, with the suspension being relatively well
          mixed. The process of using the right pipets and measuring out the
          same volumes is repeated: 1.0&nbsp;ml is drawn out of the 1/10 tube
          then and placed into the 1/100 tube, and then mixed. For the example,
          that ends the dilutions.
        </p>
        <h3>Plating the Cells</h3>
        <p>
          Appropriately label the containers with the standard identifying marks
          (date, initials, cell type, perhaps abbreviated description of project
          or study) and what they will receive (dilution, perhaps replicate
          number).
        </p>
        <p>
          The volumes in each dilution are then distributed equally among the
          number of replicates. In the example, since duplicates are used and
          since there are 9.0&nbsp;ml in each tube except the last one, which
          has 10.0&nbsp;ml but of which only 9.0&nbsp;ml will be used as for the
          other tubes, that means that each 25&nbsp;cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask will get 4.5&nbsp;ml.
        </p>
        <p>
          To economize on the use of pipets, use the appropriate pipet on the
          most dilute tube in the series first, and proceed to the most dense.
          In the example, take a 5&nbsp;ml pipet and draw out 4.5&nbsp;ml from
          the 1/100 tube, place it in a 25&nbsp;cm
          <sup>2</sup>
          flask. Draw out the other 4.5&nbsp;ml and place it in a second flask.
          Without changing the pipet, draw out 4.5&nbsp;ml from the 1/10
          dilution tube, and place it in a fresh flask. Repeat the process of
          pipetting all volumes without the need to change the pipet until done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the culture vessel volume is less than the ideal one determined
          of 7.5&nbsp;ml (3 mm depth), add the balance (3.0&nbsp;ml) to each
          flask with plating medium.
        </p>
        <h3>Culturing and Staining</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of the CFU-F assay is to stain a colony that will be
          visible to the naked (unmagnified) eye and be quite distinct as a
          colony (circular, with well-defined borders to the color spot). The
          eye can see a spot 2-3 mm in diameter comfortably as a recognizable
          colony. The diameter of a microscope field with the 20 × objective set
          is 0.9 mm, with the 10 × objective, double that diameter. If one can
          visualize 50 cells in the field of a 20 × objective when the cells are
          just confluent (no piling on), and the 20 × field is 0.9 mm, then a
          spot 2-3 mm in diameter (3-fold the diameter) would have 9 times the
          number of cells, or about 450-500. What is important to consider the
          number of cells in an expanding colony necessary to stain a colony
          recognizable to the naked eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          If each colony begins with a single cell, then the time required to
          produce a stainable colony is equal to the following:
        </p>
        <table class="eqn">

              <td rowspan="2">×</td>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          If the cell cycle time is 1 day (24 h), then to grow 500 cells takes
          about 9 days. However, in practice, it takes about 12-14 days to
          produce colonies sufficiently large for good visualization with a
          stain. The colonies are usually larger and there is a lag phase in the
          growth of stem cells in primary culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it is judged that the colonies are sufficiently large for
          characterization, then:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Remove the medium from the cells and wash 3 times with
            phosphate-buffered saline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 0.5% crystal violet in methanol. Leave at least 5, and about 10
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gently rinse in water to remove the excess. Do it several times in
            small volumes until no more excess is removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Count the colonies and verify their appearance in a microscope.
          </li>
          <li>Leave the colonies to dry.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Processing The Data</h3>
        <p>
          To determine the number of CFU-F in the original source material—which
          may be the entire contents of the marrow of one femur or more long
          bones, count the number of discrete colonies, verifying them as
          colonies using a magnifier (both compound microscope and disssecting
          scope with adjustable zoom helps). If they are replicates, determine a
          mean and measure of variation. Multiply by the appropriate dilution
          factor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose in the example, the two wells of the 6-well plate holding
          undiluted material were overgrown (confluent) with cells, thereby
          making it possible to see a clear separation between colonies. No
          count is possible for these replicates. In the next set of duplicates
          representing a 1:10 dilution, the count is 31 for one duplicate and 22
          for the other, although it was rather difficult to count colonies
          since some had overlapped with each other. In the next set of
          duplicates representing the 1:100 dilution, 5 colonies were counted in
          one, and 6 in another, and the colonies seemed to be the most
          well-delineated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 1:100 solution gave a mean ± standard deviation of 5.5 ± 0.7 while
          the 1:10 dilution gave a value of 26.5 ± 6.36. This is 550 ± 70 and
          265 ± 64. The two mean values (or single values, if no replicates were
          done at each dilution) should be close to each other. They are about
          2-fold off, and it is good if the 95% confidence interval of one mean
          overlaps with the other, in which case the differences between values
          in not signifcant. A calculation shows they do not overlap, so it
          might come down to having to favor one set of replicates as more
          reliable than the other, if a single value is to be reported. This
          would probably be the 1:100 dilution values, despite their lower
          counts reducing the power of the data.

                Glands are cut from "calves" and defatted. At the lab, a
                balanced salt solution which is 10 mM glucose and 5 mM
                HEPES-buffered is used. It is essentially the same as Ca-Mg-free
                Locke's but has about a 10-fold higher phosphate content. The
                solutions used are all at room temp.

                Glands are injected with buffer until the RBCs are removed (red
                color gone). The gland is then rinsed with 70% EtOH while the
                adrenal vein port is covered. They are allowed to soak in buffer
                until use.

                Half (30 ml) of the collagenase B solution (0.15% collagenase P
                in buffer) is used to work up the 8 to 10 glands. Each gland is
                injected until turgid and placed in a 800 ml beaker. The syringe
                is held until the count of 5 and the plunger released. 10 ml of
                collagenase should be pushed through ea. gland in this way.
                Glands are arranged so that they lie flat and put into a shaking
                water bath (37°). After 8.5 min (which may vary with
                effectiveness of the collagenase lot), the second half of the
                0.15% digestion solution is used for fresh injections. Lay the
                gland on its opposite side.

                Using forceps (tweezers) and a scalpel, excise the medulla if it

                on polyethylene cutting boards. Cells are filtered through

                (Sigma D-5025). This is incubated on a rotary shaker at 85 rpm
                (64 ml in 250 ml Erlenmeyer) for 17.5 min. Watch the shaking.

                Cells from the first digestion are spun at 400 rpm for 5 min
                (IEC Model K). The cells are washed in buffer (25 ml) with
                trituration using a blue tip on a pipettor. The wash is repeated
                to remove collagenase. The cells from the second digestion are
                filtered through mesh and washed and spun in the same manner.
