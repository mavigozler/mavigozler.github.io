<h1>The Alimentary Tract As A Microbial Habitat</h1>
<p>
Normal flora in the gut provide two effects:
<ol>
<li>they stimulate development of immunological components of the
gastrointestinal tract
<li>they act as a host defense barrier to disease
</ol>
<p>
Shortly after birth, the sterile GI tract is populated with various
microorganisms as the new individual (animal) begins feeding and drinking.
The microorganismal populations are established in an orderly process
as follows:
<ul>
<li>Stomach: Yeasts and lactobacilli, with transients also from the
  oral cavity, that is, &alpha;-streptococci
<li>Upper small bowel:  &alpha;-streptococci, <i>Veillonella</i>, yeasts,
 lactobacilli
<li>Lower small bowel:  equal numbers of facultative anaerobes (enterics)
 and obligate anaerobes
<li>Colon:  99% obligate anaerobes, with a few facultative anaerobes
</ul>

<h2>Normal Flora As Host Defense Barrier</h2>
<p>
Pathogens in the GI tract cause disease through a mechanism involving
selective adsorption to a target cell and then causing the disease state
by one or more of the following actions:
<ol>
<li>producing toxin
<li>penentrating tissues/cells (the mucosa) superficially
<li>penetrating tissues/cells/systems/organs deeply or systemically
</ol>
<p>
Normal flora can provide a barrier to attack by pathogens providing
an ecosystem that favors their own survival against the survival
of pathogens.  By attack and destroying the host, the pathogens
also compromise the security and survival of the normal flora.
<p>
Normal flora can elaborate surface structures such as <b>fimbria</b>,
<b>agglutinins</b>, and <b>capsules</b> which provide for their own
survival and attachment to the host.  They can elaborate <b>bacteriocins</b>
which inhibit or destroy other species from gaining any advantage.
They can affect substrate availability.  The host also provides for
its own defense via:
<ul>
<li>Immune cells located in the intestinal mucosa
  <ul>
  <li>M cells, or membraneous epithelial cells having macrophage-like behavior
  <li>Peyer's patch cells, precursors to <q>homing</q> cells
  <li>Cells involved in secretion of immunoglobulin (sIgA, sIgM)
  </ul>
<li>increased peristalsis or symptomatic diarrhea, providing an ability to
  prevent the accumulation of especially large populations of pathogens
</ul>

<h1>A Taxonomy of Pathogens</h1>
<h2>TRIBE Escherichieae</h2>
<p>
The three important members are <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>,
and <i>Shigella</i>.  However, other members include <i>Klebsiella
pneumoniae</i>, implicated in infant diarrheal diseases.  Soil-dwelling
<i>Proteus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> and others are only likely to make
trouble in severely immunocompromised animals.

<h3>Escherichia coli</h3>
<p>
<i>E coli</i> is a facultative anaerobe.  Although its habitat is
unlimited and the organism is ubiquitous, its preferred home is the
almost certainly the gut.
<i>E coli</i> possesses certain structural features which distinguish it:
<ul>
<li>H antigens
<li>O antigens
<li>Capsular elements
<li>Fimbrial antigens (K88 in swine, K99 in cattle, and
    colonization factor in humans) coded on plasmid that contains
    elements for conjugal transfer
</ul>
<p>
Although a significant member of the normal flora of humans
and animals, <i>E coli</i> can cause disease in some situations:
<ul>
<li>as an opportunistic pathogen in urinary tract infections
<li>as an enterotoxigenic form seen in infantile and traveler's diarrhea
<li>as an agent in dysentery-like disease
<li>as a cause of septicemic disease
</ul>
<p>
The enterotoxigenic <i>E coli</i> is coded for on a plasmid known as
<i>ent</i>.  The toxin has a heat-stable (ST) and heat-labile (LT) form,
with the latter causing increased adenyl cyclase activity in intestinal
mucosal epithelia, resulting in net ion movement out of the cell to the gut
with concomitant osmosis.  The mechanism by which ST works is unknown.
LT is immunogenic.
<p>
With the dysenteric-like pathogenesis, <i>E coli</i> provides a mechanism
for invasion of the colonic mucosa after adsorption.  Examination of the
feces reveals considerable numbers of epithelial and inflammatory cells.
This disease is often seen in stressed individuals.
<p>
Septicemic disease is seen in immunocompromised individuals.  Cells
adsorb to the small bowel and then invade the tissues, where they enter
the lymphatics and into the blood stream.
<p>
Transmission of <i>E coli</i>, pathogenic or not, is invariably by
a fecal-oral route, usually through contaminated food or drink.
<p>
The first line of defense against pathogenic <i>E coli</i> is secretory
IgA (sIgA), although cell-mediated immunity may play a role as well.

<h4>Clinical</h4>

<h5>Diagnostic</h5>
<p>
If available, all pathogens can be identified using <b>serological</b>
tests to specific markers (antigens).
<p>
Non-invasive pathogens might be explored using the following laboratory
tests and routines:
<ul>
<li>ligated gut loop
<li>Chinese hamster ovary cells
<li>Y-1 adrenal cells
<li>infant mouse
</ul>
<p>
Invasive pathogens can be diagnosed using:
<ul>
<li>HeLa cells
<li>Sereny test
</ul>

<h5>Therapy and Prophylaxis</h5>
<p>
Tetracycline and members of the penicillin group still prove effective.
Handling of food products with clean hands is the best prevention.

<h3>Salmonella spp.</h3>
<p>
<i>Salmonella</i> are all facultative anaerobes, like most enterics.
Over 1400 serotypes have been identified.  <i>Salmonella</i> are
classified according to the Kaufman-White serological
scheme, with testing of Vi (virulence), O, and H antigens.
<p>
<i>Salmonella</i> causes disease in three different ways:
<ol>
<li>enteric, also called typhoid fever, and caused by <i>S. typhi</i> in humans
   <br>Adsorption to the small bowel mucosal cells is followed by
       regional lymph node invasion, with cycles of bacteremia (septicemia)
<li>septicemic, also called paratyphoid fever, and caused by
      <i>S. paratyphi</i> A + B and by <i>S. cholerae-suis</i><br>
     it has same characteristics of typhoid fever but is less severe
<li>gastroenteritis, which is caused by almost all <i>Salmonella</i>,
  notably <i>S. typhimurium</i>
  <br>a local inflammatory response is seen after selective adsorption to
   the mucosa, and severe diarrhea results from synthesis of a prostaglandin
</ol>
<p>
Salmonella prefer growing in the gastrointestinal tract of both
warm and cold-blooded animals.  Invariably they seek an
intracellular environment, usually RE cells.
Transmssion is by fecal-oral route of contaminated food and drink.
<p>
Immunity to <i>Salmonella</i> is mediated both secretory (sIgA and sIgM)
and circulatory antibodies (IgM and IgG), as well as by cytotoxic
lymphocytes and macrophages.

<h3>Shigella spp.</h3>
<p>
These are immotile facultative anaerobes.  They are
the common cause of bacillary dysentery, seen particularly in pandemics
resulting from poor sewage treatment.  The genus has four species (groups)
and several types within each group:

<table>
<col><col span="2" style="text-align:center;">
<tr><th>Species                  <th>Subgroup       <th>Types
<tr><td><i>S. dysenteriae</i>    <td>  A            <td>1-10
<tr><td><i>S. flexneri</i>       <td>  B            <td>1-6
<tr><td><i>S. boydii</i>         <td>  C            <td>1-15
<tr><td><i>S. sonnei</i>         <td>  D            <td>1
</table>
<p>
The genus features O and K antigens (no H), useful in laboratory serology.
This organism is pathogenic largely to humans and non-human primates.
Pathogenesis involves adsorption to colonic mucosa with invasion of the
epithelia usually not further than the lamina propria.  The stool is
characterized by a bloody discharge containing large numbers of
epithelial mucosal cells.  Fimbriae play a role in attachment, followed
by secretion of an enterotoxin with a neuroparalytic effect.  The organism's
chromosome (and not a plasmid) appears to contain all the elements for
pathogenesis.
<p>
Immunity is achieved both by serum and secretory antibodies, and the
effect of CMI is not established.

<h5>Diagnostic</h5>
<p>
Culture followed by biochemical tests establishes subgroup identity.
Various serological tests establish types.

<h5>Therapy and Prophylaxis</h5>
<p>
Antibiotics more than effective.  Proper sewage treatment eliminates
the incidence.

<h2>TRIBE Vibrio</h2>
<p>
Contains but a single pathogenic member.  Certain organisms once
classed in the genus <i>Vibrio</i> have been re-classed:
<ul>
<li><i>Vibrio fetus</i> is now <i>Campylobacter fetus</i>
<li><i>Vibrio parahemolyticus</i> is now <i>Beneckea parahemolytica</i>
</ul>
<p>
All Vibrio are facultative anaerobes and possess certain
morphological and biochemical distinguishing characteristics:
<ul>
<li><b>oxidase-positive</b>:  not a feature of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>
<li><b>fermentative</b>
</ul>

<h3>Vibrio cholerae</h3>
<p>
Cause of cholera in humans.  This organism is classed into 6 different
groups based on O-antigens, with O1 causing cholera.  Within group O1
are two biotypes, El tor and cholera.  Biotypes can be serologically
identified as Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima.  There are also non-cholera
vibrios (NCV) and non-agglutinable vibrios (NAG).
<p>
All vibrios prefer the GI tract as a habitat.  Pathogenesis is caused
by a powerful toxin that causes severe electrolyte and fluid depletion
via the gut, with a watery diarrhea.

<h2>TRIBE Beneckea</h2>
<p>
This genus contains three members causing disease in humans:
<ul>
<li><i>B. parahemolytica</i> usually found in contaminated seafood and
   causing gastroenteritis
<li><i>B. alginolytica</i> and <i>B. vulnifica</i> causing soft tissue
  infections
</ul>
<p>
These facultative anaerobes live in marine environments, in sludge and
water.  They are fermentative, oxidase-positive, and are often called
<q>marine enterobacteria.</q>
<p>
Ingestion of contaminated seafood is the usually mode of transmission,
although this bacteria can sometimes enter through wounds.  <i>B.
parahemolytica</i> is seen in shell fish.  <i>B. vulnifica</i>
causes a high mortality in severely immunocompromised individuals.
<p>
Laboratory diagnosis should include analysis of halophilic organisms.

<h2>Non-Spore Forming Anaerobes</h2>
<p>
These are obligate anaerobes since they have no coding for superoxide
dismustase.  These are not aggressively pathogenic, but 66% are
involved in pyonecrotic processes and 33% are seen in pure culture.
However, obligate anaerobes are seen with the following incidences
in the pathological conditions below:
<table>
<tr><th>Pathological Condition<th>Incidence
<tr><td>bacteremia            <td>4 in 5
<tr><td>brain abscess         <td>2 in 3
<tr><td>chronic sinusitis     <td>4 in 5
<tr><td>aspiration pneumonia  <td>1 in 2
<tr><td>lung abscess          <td>2 in 3
<tr><td>liver abscess         <td>2 in 3
<tr><td>obstetrical-gynecological<td>1 in 3
</table>
<p>
The typical laboratory routines for identification are Gram staining,
morphology, and the fatty acids produced from carbohydrate sources.
<p>
These organisms also possess particular antigens, such as flagellar
H antigens and capsular K antigens.  The possession of K (capsules) antigens
can help in anti-phagocytic action.  Some anaerobes elaborate proteolytic
toxins.

<p>
<b>Actinomycosis</b> is caused by <i>Actinomyces</i>: <i>A. bovis</i> in 
domestic animals, <i>A. odontolyticus</i> in humans and animals, <i>A. 
israelii</i> in humans and occasionally cattle, <i>A. naeslundii</i> in humans, 
and <i>A. viscosus</i> in human periodontal disease.  Sometimes trauma 
inoculates them within the oral cavity and they infect bony tissues (causing 
"lumpy jaw").
<p>
Not much is known about how host immunity controls these obligate anaerobes, 
although serum titers can be shown.  Delayed-type hypersensitivity may be 
involved in traumatic actinomycosis.
<p>
With the exception of <i>B. fragilis</i> showing resistance to these classes, 
antibiotics of penicillin-type and the tetracyclines are very effective in 
eradication.  Surgical intervention is required for pyonecrotic processes (organ 
abscesses and actinomycosis).

<h2>Campylobacter</h2>
<p>
These are Gram negative, bent rods.  They are microaerophilic and not 
fermentative (unlike <i>Vibrio</i> or <i>Beneckea</i>), and they are 
oxidase-positive.  Preferred habitat is the GI tract.
<p>
In domestic animals, members of this species causes infertility and
abortion.  In humans, enteritis and septicemia typical.  The single
clinically important species is <i>C. fetus</i>, of which there are
three subspecies:
<ol>
<li><i>C. fetus fetus</i>
<li><i>C. fetus intestinalis</i> (affects humans)
<li><i>C. fetus jejuni</i> (also affects humans)
</ol>
<p>
Transmission is usually by contaminated feces.
<p>
The two subspecies pathogenic to humans are usually identified in blood 
cultures.  The <i>jejuni</i> subsp. is often a cause of childhood enteritis. 
Laboratory identification requires use of a special <q>campy</q> plate incubated 
in microaerophilic conditions, as well as demonstration of Gram-negative bent 
rods.

<h2>Pseudomonas</h2>
<p>
These Gram negative motile rods are rarely involved in disease.  However they 
will inhabit burn units or oncologic wards where immunity and host defense is 
severely compromised.  These organisms strongly resist antibiotics.  They are 
sometimes encapsulated.
<p>
All are obligate anaerobes and oxidase-positive.  <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is the 
most common and produces a bacterocin called <b>pyocin</b>, an important 
identifier in clinical diagnosis.  Pseudomonads are ubiquitious, and found in 
the stools of 5% of healthy people (and about 50% of hospitalized patients). 
Other species of pseudomonads include <i>P. cepacia</i>, <i>P. multivorans</i>, 
<i>P. fluorescens</i>, <i>P. putida</i>, <i>P. stutzeri</i>, and <i>P. 
maltophilia</i>. <i>P. pseudomallei</i> causes meliodoses in humans and <i>P. 
mallei</i> causes glanders in horses (rarely seen in the US).
<p>
<i>P. aeruginosa</i> produces an exotoxin called <b>PA toxin</b>, which is a 71 
kDa protein with an identical action to diphtheria toxin, although these toxins 
are structurally distinct.
<p>
Treatment against opportunistic pseudomonad infection usually involves specific 
penicillins (carbenicillin) and new aminoglycosides such as tobramycin and 
amikacin.  An R (resistance) plasmid has been found however.

<h1>Respiratory Tract As a Microbial Habitat</h1>
<p>
The respiratoy tract contains many species as normal flora, and is a site for 
bacterially caused disease.
<p>
Anatomical structures of the respiratory tract are designed to minimize disease 
and morbidity.
<ul>
<li>Nasopharynx &amp; Nose
  <br>Coarse hairs in nose ideal for trapping particles &ge; 15 &mu;m in diameter. 
The nasal turbinates were specifically designed to cause most particles between 
10 and 15 &mu;m in diameter to be thrown against the nasal mucosal wall, and to 
trap these (impaction), a function provided by angulation of the back of the 
pharynx as well. The rich vasculature and tortuosity of the turbinates also both 
warms and humidifies the passing air to make it suitable for the lower tract. 
Adenoid and tonsillar tissue in the pharyngeal wall is also designed to filter 
out bacteria-laden air, and to initiate immune responses.  Particulate matter is 
moved by mucocillary action to areas where they are swallowed and expelled, and 
away from entry to lower respiratory tract.  Normal flora also provide 
environment to inhibit growth (cidal action?) of pathogens
<li>Larynx and Tubular Air Passages
  <br>There is no resident flora here.  The epiglottis closes during swallowing to 
prevent gross contamination of the RT.  Parts of larynx and the entirety of the 
trachea and bronchi to the level of the respiratory bronchioles are lined with 
ciliated epithelia which have mucus-secreting cells.  Together a muco-cillary 
"escalator" is created to dispose of contaminants in tract.  Bifurcations in 
bronchiolar structure may provide additional tortuosity to trap unwanted 
particles and pathogens between 5-10 &mu;m dia.  In the smaller bronchioles, 
impaction becomes less important than <b>sedimentation</b> where particles 0.5 
to 5 &mu;m dia. settle into the mucocillary apparatus, (between 15th and 23rd 
branching generation).  The cough reflex is provided by this compartment.
<li>Alveoli
  <br>There is no resident flora or mucocillary escalator here.  The main defense 
is phagocytic cells and inflammatory processes that produce scarring.  The 
alveolar macrophage is perhaps the most important cell type here. 
Bacteriostatic substances may be present in the mucus (neutralizing antibodies 
and other substances).
</ul>

<h2>Mucocillary Apparatus</h2>
<p>
Ciliated epithelium covers the linings of all the leading passages of the
RT.  Pseudostratified type forms the nose, trachea, and larger bronchi;
columnar type lines the smaller bronchi and bronchioles; and cuboidal
type lines the terminal bronchioles.
<p>
Cilia are cellular processes which number ca. 200 for each cell.  Each
cilium is 5 &mu;m long and 0.3 &mu;m in diameter.  The cilium is formed
by a regular <q>9 + 2</q> arrangement of microtubules that can
alter their conformation in a coordinated (<q>metachronal</q>)
fashion to produce a wave-like beating motion with a frequency of
1000-1500 beats per minute.  The process is highly ATP-dependent
(and therefore oxygen-dependent, since the source of ATP is the mitochondria).
<p>
Mucus-secreting cells also form the apparatus. <b>Goblet cells</b>
are abundant in the upper respiratory tract, rarer in number as
travel goes from bronchi to bronchioles.  They are absent in the terminal
bronchioles.  There are also serous fluid-producing glands in the nose
and turbinates.
<p>
A serous (periciliary) fluid layer bathes the ciliated epithelia for
about the length of the cilia.  This layer is a "low shear" fluid.
The mucus is a "high shear" viscous gel formed at the tips of the cilia
and occurring in a discontinuous (patchy) manner, with a height of
2 &mu;m.  It is moved, along with its trapped particles, in the direction
of ciliary beating.
<p>
The periciliary fluid layer is required for the apparatus to work.
The velocity of clearance is 5-20 mm/min in trachea.  In smaller airways
of 1-2 mm dia., it is 0.5-1 mm/min.  Large airways can be cleared in
an hour, and all ciliated airways are cleared within 24 h.  Substances
inhibiting mucociliary clearance include:
<ul>
<li>carbon dioxide
<li>sulfur dioxide
<li>pentobarbital and other barbituates
<li>atropine
<li>drying caused by tracheostomy
<li>temperature extremes
<li>dust
<li>cigarette smoke inhaled via the mouth
<li>viral respiratory infection
<li>alcohol
<li>Mycoplasma infection (<i>M. pneumoniae</i>)
</ul>
<p>
Present in the mucus/serous layers might be any of the following
bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal substances:
<ul>
<li>lysozyme (muramidase) &mdash; hydrolytic action on muramic acid in cell wall
<li>&alpha;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin &mdash; inactivates proteolytic enzymes
    of both bacterial and lysosomal origin (lysosomes released during
    by inflammatory defense cells)
<li>lactoferrin &mdash; iron chelator
<li>IgA (secretory) &mdash; probably more effective in anti-viral
     activity as a neutralizer, with location in larger airways
<li>IgG &mdash; maybe normal component of serum or locally derived from
    inflammatory processes; has multiple functions as being an antitoxin,
    antiviral, and antibacterial
<li>interferon &mdash; secreted from immune cells (lymphocytes and macrophages)
<li>complement &mdash; an effective antibacterial, generally in small amts
</ul>

<h2>Pulmonary (Alveolar) Macrophage</h2>
<p>
These are large pleomorphic cells about 20-40 &mu;m in diameter, with
vesicular nuclei, typically one in number.  The abundant cytoplasmic
granules are lysosomes.  The cell surface is <q>ruffled,</q> with
many feet processes.  These cells are highly motile, adhesive to many
surfaces, and actively phagocytic.  Their lifespan is 1-5 weeks.
<p>
These are activated monocytic cells derived from bone marrow stem cells.
The monocytic cells that populate the alveolar spaces actually
differentiate themselves from other monocytic cells by adapting to
a more aerobic metabolism (they may have more mitochondria than monocytic
cells elsewhere).
<p>
Phagocytic action and bacterial killing in phagolysosome may not
be as oxygen-dependent as for other phagocytic cells.  Alveolar
macrophages instead use glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways
to produce energy for bacteriocidal action.  Bacteriocidal action
does not involve myeloperoxidases but does generate
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
<p>
Alveolar macrophages lose effectiveness in viral disease, with
no effect on phagocytosis, but inhibition of bacteriocidal action
intracellularly.  Cigarette smoking, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur
dioxide, and ozone also impact on the effectiveness of the macrophage.
(NO<sub>2</sub> also suppresses interferon production).

<h2>Staphylococci</h2>
<p>
This family <b>Micrococcaceae</b> has two Gram positive genera, the aerobic
<i>Micrococci</i> with a DNA G+C content of 66-73%, and the
fermentative <i>Staphylococci</i> with a DNA G+C content of 30-38%.
<p>
The name <b>staphylococcus</b> means <q>cluster of grapes</q> because
the spherical cells divide in all dimensions and take on that appearance.
A few strains produce capsules composed of either polypeptide or
polysaccharide, the function of the capsule being anti-phagocytic.
<p>
The cell wall is composed of
<ul>
<li><b>Protein A</b>, which binds the F<sub>C</sub> portion of the
   the IgG molecule (this is exploited by biochemists)
<li><b>Polysaccharide A</b>, a ribitol teichoic acid found in <i>S. aureus</i><br>
   <b>Polysaccharide B</b>, a glycerol teichoic acid found in <i>S. epidermidis</i>
<li><b>Peptidoglycan</b>, similar to that in other bacteria
</ul>
<p>
The presence of peptidoglycan can elicit fever and inflammatory processes,
and activate complement.
<p>
Another interesting feature is the ability of <i>Staphylococci</i> to
produce carotenoid pigments that give them a distinctive color (hence
for <i>S. aureus</i> its golden color).  The carotenoids are produced
only during aerobic growth, are localized in the membrane, and may
serve an antioxidant purpose.
<p>
The <i>Staphylococci</i> are catalase-positive.  Species within this
genus are distinguished largely by biochemical tests and anti-microbial
susceptibility:

<table>

</table>
<p>
<i>Staphylococci</i> are significant causative agents of food poisoning since 
they grow rapidly in vitro in rich media.  These organisms also resist difficult 
environments, surviving at temperatures up to 60&deg; C for 30 min., salt 
concentrations up to 7.5%, in a pH range between 4.0 and 9.5, and they resist 
antimicrobials such as sulfas, penicillins, tetracyclines.  R plasmids are known 
and transmitted by defective phages.
<p>
The susceptibility of <i>Staphylococci</i> to different phages is used as a 
basis of classifying (typing) these microorganisms. Serological testing is not 
that useful.  Colonies are described as S, R, G, and L, and are related to 
changes in the makeup of the cell wall.
<p>
Pathogenic <i>Staphylococci</i> have a wide array of mechanisms to produce 
disease.

<ul>
<li><b>lipases</b> and <b>esterases</b>
   <br>on skin inhabitants, might cause acne
<li><b>coagulase</b> and <b>clumping factor</b><br>
   these are useful on in the diagnosis of pathogenic forms,
   since they are always present in pathogens, absent in nonpathogens;
   it is not known if these cause any symptoms themselves
<li><b>staphylokinase</b><br>
   has fibrinolytic action
<li><b>hyalouronidase</b><br>
   this hydrolytic agent enables the organism to spread
<li><b>hemolysins</b> (four types)
 <ul>
 <li>the alpha type can alter cell membrane permeability interacting
     with membrane lipids, and is hemolytic, dermonecrotic (this protein
     coded by a temperate phage)
 <li>the beta type is a phospholipase C and attacks sphingomyelin
     and causes <q>hot-cold</q> lysis
 <li>the gamma type is a cationic protein
 <li>the delta type is a surface-active cytotoxic polypeptide, and is
   leukotoxic
 </ul>
<li><b>leukocidin P-V</b> (Panton-Valentine)<br>
   increases membrane permeability to cations and causes degranulation
   and lysosome destruction
<li><b>enterotoxin</b> (type A)
   <br>found in 30% of strains, this heat- and lytic-resistant
       neurotoxin which acts locally and can also stimulate
       vomiting reflex; 6 antigenic types;  found in forms causing
      food poisoning but not dysentery or gastroenteritis; transmitted
      by temperate phage
<li><b>exfoliatin</b>
   <br>this plasmid-coded protein found in 3-5% of strains and
     is responsible for <q>scalded skin syndrome</q>
</ul>
<p>
The presence of Protein A, capsular polysaccharides, and teichoic acids may 
function in anti-phagocytic activity.  Bacteria may also elicit mechanisms of 
cell-mediated hypersensitivity.
<p>
In humans, <i>Staphylococcus</i> may cause many diseases.
<ul>
<li>Suppurative processes:  abscesses in both skin (boils, furuncles,
carbuncles) and organs, such as liver, lung, and bone marrow
<li>Food poisoning:  usually an enterotoxigenic (producing a neurotoxin)
strain is ingested
<li>Scalded skin syndrome in infants
<li>Toxic shock syndrome in menstruating women using very hydrophilic tampons
</ul>
<p>
In dogs, suppurative diseases, esp. pyoderma and urinary tract infections 
(urolithaisis) are known.  In cattle, Staph. is common cause of mastitis. Other 
pyogenic infections seen in warm blooded animals, including birds.
<p>
Most disease processes caused by predisposition:  wounds, immunodeficiencies, 
intercurrent infections (viral), antimicrobial overtreatment, metabolic 
disorders (diabetes).
<p>
Humoral immunity is quite important in control.  Serum (IgG and IgM) antibodies 
work against toxins and enzymes secreted by Staph.  Secretory IgA may control 
entry of Staph.  Opsonins and complement also have antibacterial influence. 
Agammaglobulinemic patients highly susceptible to Staph. infections.  It is not 
certain what role cell-mediate immunity plays.
<p>
Therapy for infection varies.  Wounds must be cleaned sterilely as a means of 
prophylaxis.  Abscesses in organs usually require surgery to drain the abscess 
combined with systemic antibiotics.  80% of strains are penicillin-resistant, so 
the penicillins not inactivated by penicillinase (oxacillin, cloxacillin, 
methicillin, etc.) are usu. effective.  Erythromycin, cephalosporin and 
lincomycin are alternatives.

<h2>Streptococci</h2>
<p>
The streptococci are responsible for a wide variety of disease, although
many species are normal flora and avirulent.
<p>
In the pharynx, pathogenesis leading to <q>strep throat</q> can become otitis, 
which can be complicated to mastoiditis.  Infections of lymph node, scarlet 
fever, sinusitis, and bronchopneumonia complicating to pleurisy also derive from 
strep throat.
<p>
Injuries, surgery, childbirth, insect bites, and burns form wounds that
can become septicemic, abscessed, or pyodermic.  Septicemia can complicate
to cerebral abscesses, meningitis, and death.
<p>
Streptococcus are Gram positive, catalase-negative with diverse ecology,
living free or being obligate parasites.  Classification is based on
growth on blood agar, biochemical activity, and serology.  Three divisions
are made on the nature of growth on blood agar:
<table class="liststyle">
<col style="font-weight:bold;">
<tr><td>Alpha
  <td><q>alpha hemolysis</q> is the greenish discoloration
  (<q>viridans</q>);  this is not a complete destruction of blood cells.
<tr><td>Beta
  <td><q>beta hemolysis</q> is fully hemolytic, with clearing of agar
<tr><td>Gamma
 <td>this streptococcus does nothing
</table>
<p>
Similarly to Staphylococci, the surface of this group is quite elaborate:

<table class="liststyle">
<tr><td>Capsules
  <td>contain hyalouronic acid and other polysaccharides
<tr><td rowspan="4">Cell Wall
 <td>Surface proteins type M, T, R found on consistently pathogenic groups
<tr><td>Lancefield group specificity (groups A through T) determined using
    polysaccharide C substance
<tr><td>Peptidoglycan
<tr><td>Lipoteichoic acid
<tr><td>Cell Membrane
<tr><td>Intracellular Components
 <td>P proteins
</table>
<p>
Streptococci are facultative anaerobes and chielf draw energy from fermentation. 
They are less resistant than staphylococci to antibiotics: the Lancefield group 
A are particularly sensitive to penicillin, temperatures &gt; 40&deg;, and are 
inhibited with salt concentrations are 6.5%.  Moreover, the Lancefield group A 
and other pathogens have exacting nutritionaly requirements, requiring complex 
media (including proteins) for optimal growth. Certain intestinal streptococci 
(Group D, the <q>enterococci</q>) tolerate higher penicillin doses, can tolerate 
high salt (6.5%) and even high temperatures (62&deg; for 30 min). 
<i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (the pneumonococcus) cannot tolerate surface 
active agents:  it is dissolved by 10% bile among other natural detergents, and 
it is inhbited by <b>optochin</b> (ethylhydrocupreine).
<p>
Colonies appear mucoid or can hve a <q>matt</q> look, which occurs when the 
capsule dries out.  It can also be glossy in the noncapsulated bacteria.  There 
are also L-forms.
<p>
Serology of streptococci is by group- and type-specific.  Groups are according 
to Lancefield, based on chemistry of C substance.  Type is protein-based:  M, T, 
or R.
<p>
Habitat is according to Lancefield grouping.  Transmission is both by contact 
and can be airborne.
<p>
Pathogenesis mechanisms vary to species:

</table>
<p>
Other cell constituents include allergens and cell-bound toxins.
<p>
In humans, group D causes subacute infections, such as bacterial endocarditis 
(by the enterococci).  Acute infections in infants are caused by group B, where 
the disease is septicemia and meningitis. Enterococci (group D?) cause urinary 
tract infection. The pneumococci cause lobar pneumonia, septicemia, and 
meningitis. Dental caries are associated with <i>S. mutans</i>.
<p>
Certain diseases are <i>poststreptococcal</i>:  <b>rheumatic fever</b> is a 
progressive life-threatening destruction of connective tissue of the heart, 
joints, and central nervous system following Group A pharyngitis in which 
auto-immunity occurs as a result of this group's attempt to mimic 
histocompatibility.  This disease is also commonly recurring. 
<b>Glomerulonephritis</b> is associated with Group A streptococci, but of only a 
few types, and does not recur, and it follows pharyngitis or pyoderma.  It is 
generally benign.
<p>
Group A infections are typically acute.  Entry occurs through several portals: 
injury, surgery, childbirth, insect bites, burns are all wound infections. 
These can lead to erysipelas, pyoderma, abscesses, and if the lymphatics are 
penetrated, to septicemia. Septicemic sequelae are particularly worrisome:  if 
death does not occur rapidly in 24-48 h, complications include septic arthritis, 
cerebral abscesses (serous fluid infections), meningitis (also serous), and 
osteomyelitis.  Another major entry portal is the pharynx: the classic 
<b>pharygotonsillitis</b> (<q>strep throat</q>) can lead to scarlet fever, 
infection of adjacent tissues, lymph node invasion, ear infection (otitis) or 
bronchopneumonia.  If the sinusitis or mastoiditis persists, it can lead further 
to osteomyelitis. Bronchopneumonial complications can lead to a serous membrane 
infection known as pleurisy.
<p>
In farm animals, bovine mastitis is associated with several groups: B, C, and E? 
Equine strangles, genital, and neonatal infections arise from action of Group C. 
Cervical lymphadenitis in swine is a Group E cause.  Other pyogenic infections 
arise from Groups C, G, and others.
<p>
The normal flora of the nasopharynx include members of the &beta;-hemolytic 
streptococci (<i>S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae</i>).  In horses, <i>S. 
zooepidemicus</i> is part of the normal flora.  1 in every 2 to 5 children 
carries <i>S. pyogenes</i>.  Many streptococci present in the normal genital 
tract.  The source of urinary tract infection caused by enterococci is usually 
from endogenous populations.  Skin infections are associated with poor personal 
hygeine.
<p>
As far as disease prevention, there is doubt about the effectiveness of 
immunization.  There is a real fear that any attempt could precipitate rheumatic 
fever.  Horses can be vaccinated for strangles.  A polyvalent pneumococcal 
vaccine containing capsular polysaccharides of 14 common types has been licensed 
for 25 years.
<p>
Treatment is most commonly with penicillins, which are generally effective 
against the complications of simple infections (bacteremia, pyemia, scarlet 
fever, poststreptococcal disease).  Resistance is seen in some pneumococcal 
types.

<h2>Legionella pneumophila</h2>
<p>
A member of the sapronoses, this saprophytic gram-negative bacteria
is soil- and water-living and can cause human lung infections that
can become systemic and result in variable mortality.
<p>
The membrane takes up gram stain poorly.  Gimenez's carbol fuchsin stain is more 
diagnostic.  The outer membrane appears to contain a weakly endotoxic 
lipopolysaccharide.  There is no DNA homology with other bacteria.  Some are 
flagellated.  Unlike any other micro-organism, its membrane incorporates 
phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyethanolamine, and branched fatty acids.
<p>
These bacteria are very slow-growing, taking up to 10 days to form visible 
colonies.  Media requires the presence of cysteine and ferric iron.  A strict 
aerobe, optimal growth includes 2.5-5% carbon dioxide.  It can survive 12 months 
in tap water. More diagnostic growth conditions include Isovitalex (this 
contains enzymes, coenzymes, minerals, and amino acids), and CYE (charcoal-yeast 
extract) agar.
<p>
Six serological groups based on cell wall antigens identified.
<p>
It is thought that infection can be by airborne bacteria, though not from person 
to person.  Endo- and exotoxins are the probable mechanisms of pathogenesis, 
though not well-defined.  The typical disease is a pneumonia featuring high 
fever followed by a dry and later productive cough and pleuritic chest pain. 
There are also gastrointestinal, CNS and genitourinary tract signs.  There was 
15% mortality in the original Philadelphia epidemic, but an 80% mortality is 
seen in the immunocompromised.
<p>
Pontiac fever is a nonpulmonary infection with a short febrile illness (5 days), 
with high morbidity and no mortality.
<p>
The epidemiology shows that mostly middle-aged males are affected. Many cases 
are nosocomial and involving the immunosuppressed.  The greatest incidence is in 
the summer and autumn, and may be associated with cooling device use, or with 
construction sites, in which soil and water come in contact with cooling water.
<p>
Treatment is usually with erythromycin, and perhaps rifampin. All legionella 
have active beta-lactamases and therefore penicillin is ineffective.
<p>
To diagnose lung tissue samples or pleural effusions are prepared using 
immunofluorescence.  Presence in sputum samples is not necessarily diagnostic. 
Culture involves Mueller-Hinton agar with 2% IsoVitaleX and 10% hemoglobin; 
charcoal-yeast extract (CYE) is also used in culture.  Guinea pigs or yolk sacs 
of embryonic chicken eggs can be used to propogate legionella.  Seroconversion 
takes about 6 weeks, seen as 4-fold rise in titer;  indirect immunofluorescence 
is diagnostic.

<h2>Neisseria meningitidis</h2>
<p>
The gram-negative diplococci Neisseria are generally nonpathogenic, except for 
<i>N. meningitidis</i> and <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>.  Diplococci are spherical 
bacteria arranged in pairs.  Capsules are polysaccharide and there is an 
endotoxin in the cell wall components.
<p>
The Neisseria are fastidious in many respects:  nutrition, temperature,
atmosphere, and pH.  Many substances inhibit the growth of Neisseriae;
the bacteria autolyze easily.  The bacteria are aerobic and secrete
acids in response to strong oxidation of glucose.
<p>
Capsular antigens form major (A, B, C) and minor (D, X, Y, 29E, 135, BO)
groups.  The bacteria are susceptible to penicillins, chloramphenicol.
They used to be sensitive to sulfas.
<p>
Neisseria make the nasopharynx (of humans) and the genital tract their natural 
home.  Infection can be by aerosolized droplets. To establish pathogenicity, the 
bacteria make use of attachment pili, possibly an IgA protease, endotoxins 
(glycolipid, nucleoprotein), and the polysaccharide capsule which is 
antiphagocytic.  High incidence in winter months.
<p>
Prevention includes vaccines developed against A and C groups. Immunity probably 
develops against capsule (humoral type), although the antibody does not rid the 
person as a carrier.  Prophylaxis in an epidemic includes use of minocycline 
(has neurotoxic side effects) or rifampin (some resistance developing). 
Treatment is best with penicillin (chloramphenicol in case of allergy); sulfas 
are ineffective now that there is resistance.  Carriers can be treated with 
rifampin, although it is difficult since resistance to it develops.

<h2>Haemophilus</h2>
<p>
These gram negative rods feature capsules made of a polysugar phosphate
which may be antiphagocytic.  Their cell wall contains an endotoxin,
and they are not motile.
<p>
They have strict growth factor requirements for X (hemin), V (NAD), and XV. A 
considerable CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere favors growth of many strains. They are 
very delicate and tend to autolyze;  bile detergents can solubilize them. 
Metabolism is usually by carbohydrate fermentation.
<p>
Serological types are `a-f,' and related to pathogenicity.  Ampicillin
resistance is found in some.
<p>
30-50% of the normal flora of human nasopharynx is Haemophilus.
There is no capsulation with the nonpathogenic forms.  Factors in
disease could be age- and socioeconomic status-related.  The `b'
serotype is most common cause of meningitis.
<p>
Resistance to disease is by opsonizing antibodies.  Immunization with capsular 
polysaccharides is possible by not practiced.  Population &lt; 2 years old is at 
risk because of poor immune response. Disease treatment is with ampicillin, but 
if beta lactamase-resistant, then chloramphenicol.

</table>
<p>
<b>Patterns of meningococcal infections by Haemophilus</b>.  Bacteria have 
natural reservoir in nasopharynx after coming in by anterior nares. They might 
progress to tonsils.  Rhinopharyngitis and/or sinusitis can lead to otitis, and 
then to septicemia.  From sepiticemia can progress to joints or precipitate 
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and also target adrenals, skin, 
and heart valves.  The most significant disease complication in Haemophilus is 
meningitis and encephalitis.  Bacteria may go directly from nasopharynx to brain 
areas via cribiform plate.

<h2>Corynebacterium</h2>
<p>
The corynebacteria are Gram-positive, non-sporulating, facultatively anaerobic, 
pleomorphic rods.  <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i> is an important pathogen 
in humans which occurs in three forms, and which elaborates a toxin that can 
cause upper airway obstruction and which can cause cardiac, renal, and neural 
effects if distributed systemically.  The <b>diphtheroids</b> are other species 
of <i>Corynebacterium</i> that infect other animals (<i>C. pyogenes, C. renale, 
C. pseudotuberculosis, C. equi</i>).  These diphtheroids can cause pyogenic and 
necrotizing lesions.
<p>
The bacteria appear as pleomorphic rods (Gram-positive coccobacilli), single 
cells seen with branching filaments that are <q>palisading</q> (lined up 
side-by-side). The cells are often said to have a <q>Chinese letter</q> 
appearance which is due to their unique cell division mechanism.  Cell division 
is observed to have a <q>snapping</q> motion, with odd shapes forming in numbers 
as they group together.  Other morphological features include metachromatic, 
Babes-Ernst granules formed from pyrophosphate, amd the absence of flagella or 
spores;  capsules are rare.
<p>
The habitat of <i>Corynebacterium</i> is typically in the nasopharynx
of carriers.  It is transmitted by being airborne in droplet nuclei.
<p>
Corynebacterium are difficult to culture and not active on many
lab substrates compared to other bacteria.  They ferment starch and glycogen.
The ability to produce the characteristic toxin requires the presence
of a temperate phage (beta) and a low iron content in the medium.
When grown on selective potassium telluride (which inhibits growth of
other bacteria), <i>Corynebacterium</i> appear as black colonies.
<p>
<i>C. gravis, C. intermedius</i>, and
<i>C. mitis</i> all produce a toxin that is isoantigenic, but from
<i>C. gravis</i> to <i>C. mitis</i>, the severity of disease becomes
less.  The appearance of colonies in culture media is quite distinct
for the three species.
<p>
The <i>C. diphtheriae</i> toxin is a proenzyme with mass 63 kDa.
Fragment A is a 24 kDa polypeptide that contains the toxic activity,
and Fragment B creates the ability to attach and to penetrate into
cells.  The toxin, which is thought to be the gene product of the
beta phage, inhibits protein synthesis, which causes cell death
and necrosis.  The mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis
involves hydrolysis of NAD coenzyme into nictonamide and ribosyl-ADP, and the
latter forms an adduct with elongation factor 2 (EF-2), a peptidyl
transferase in complex with the ribosome essential to adding
amino acids from tRNA to the elongating polypeptide.  EF-2 is thus rendered
inactive.
<p>
The progression of disease usually starts as a laryngo-pharyngitis
after colonization.  Dead host tissue accumulates around the bacteria
and a <q>pseudomembrane</q> forms.  Eventually an obstruction of
the airway occurs leading to asphyxiation.  Infection can occur on other
mucous membranes or skin:  the toxin is absorbed and disrupts the tissue.
Myocarditis, renal necrosis, damage to myelin are other manifestations;
these cause myocardial defects, neurotoxic action.  Skin diphtheria is
common in warm climates.  <i>C. diphtheriae</i> is confirmed as the cause
by identification of the toxin.
<p>
Immunity can be produced naturally or artificially (by vaccination with
toxoid);  the antibody is to the toxin.  The Schick test can be used
to evaluate immune status:  this involves intradermal injection of
the toxin and of toxoid.  If the toxin site is red and there is no
reaction at the toxoid site, then the individual is not immune.  If
both sites are reddened, the individual is immune and hypersensitive.
if there is no reaction at either site, the individual is immune but
not hypersensitive.
<p>
The best treatment is prevention by vaccination.  But when disease
is present, administration of antitoxin and antibiotics (erythromycin;
penicillin also useful) is done.  In the past, disease was demonstrated
by an <i>in vivo</i> test:
<ol>
<li>the suspect organism is inoculated into one side of the skin of a rabbit
<li>6 h later bacteria and antitoxin are injected on the other site.  If
it remains clear after 24 h, the <i>C. diphtheriae</i> is confirmed.
</ol>
<p>
There is also an <i>in vitro</i> immunodiffusion test in which the suspect 
sample and a positive control <i>C. diphtheriae</i> extract are placed in 
Ouchterlony plate with anti-diphtherial antibody and precipitin lines are 
observed.
<p>
The animal diphtheroids and their characteristics are given in the table below.

<p>
<b>History</b>.  Klebs isolated the organism in 1883.  In 1884 Loeffler
demonstrated it was the cause of diphtheria.  In the same year
Roux and Yersin isolate the toxin.  In 1890, von Behring and Kitasato
develop an antitoxin from horse serum.  Ramon treats the toxin with
formaldehyde to form an immunogenic toxiod in 1924.  In 1951
Freeman showed that the toxin is produced by an organism lysogenic
for phage &beta;.  The toxin is only produced in low concentrations
of Fe<sup>2+</sup>.

<h2>Bordetella</h2>
<p>
These are a group of strictly aerobic, parasitic, Gram negative
coccobacilli which inhabit the mucous membranes of the respiratory
tract.  These used to be classed under <i>Haemophilus</i> but were
distinguished since they require no blood (X, V factors).  The
significant pathogen in this group is <i>B. pertussis</i>,
the causative agent of whooping cough (pertussis).
<p>
The tiny Gram negative coccobacillus may feature capsules in
young colonies, and show fimbrial strucutures resembling pili
(possibly serving an attachment function).  There are no true
flagella;  they do not form spores.  The organisms are cultured
on special Bordet-Gangou medium which is inoculated by direct
coughing on to the agar.  These organisms are slow-growing, with
exacting nutritional requirements.  They are sensitive to many
toxic factors (have low resistance).  They are catalase-positive
despite being inert in several standard biochemical test panels.
Growth is inhibited with broad-spectrum antimicrobials.
<p>
Most of the antigens are poorly characterized, and the nature of
immunogenicity unknown.  There are four phases of growth that
lead to progressive lose of surface antigens.  In Phase I, the bacterium
possesses the required immunogenicity for use in a vaccine.
<p>
The normal habitat of <i>B. pertussis</i> is the ciliated epithelium
of the respiratory tract of patients.  There are no carriers:
the presence of the bacterium is always associated with symptomatic
disease.  Infection is transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei.
It is believed that the bacteria express pili to attach to
tracheal and bronchial mucosa.  The bacteria then express a
heat-labile toxin (HLT), i.e., protein, that is necrotizing.
They also feature a heat-stable toxin, which is a lipopolysaccharide
endotoxin.  A heat-labile <b>histamine sensitizing factor</b> (HSF),
which seems to be a nitrogenous lipid and forms or is associated with
the cell wall, is part of the pathogenic mechanism.  Another
protein expressed in the <b>lymphocytosis promoting factor</b> (LPF).
The relationship to disease manifestations is not clear.
No secreted exotoxin has been identified with <i>B. pertussis</i>
<p>
Infection by <i>B. pertussis</i> proceeds in four stages:
<ol>
<li>incubation
<li>catarrhal
<li>paroxysmal
<li>convalescent
</ol>
<p>
Each stage is approximately 2 weeks long.  A necrotizing inflammation
of the trachea and bronchi interfere with mucociliary function.
The bacteria do not invade beyond the mucosal border, and symptoms of
disease do not involve other tissues, organs, and systems.
<p>
<b>Epidemology</b>.  Only infected individuals which are typically mild
cases (i.e., have not progressed in severity) serve as sources of infection.
The most contagious stage is the catarrhal stage.  Humans are the only
host.  It is extremely contagious.  Factors contributing to high risk
include age, the absence of maternal antibody.  Unvaccinated pre-schoolers
are the highest risk and greatest source.
<p>
Immunity is primarily humoral (IgG), with roles of IgA and cell-mediated
immunity unknown.  Passive immunization is with killed suspension.  It
is believed that immunity diminishes over time.  Re-immunization of adults
and older children is considered risky because of development of allergies.
Standard antimicrobial therapy for cases involves erythromycin, tetracycline,
chloramphenicol.
<p>
<i>Bordetella bronchisepta</i> is a semi-commensal in dogs;  it may be
responsible for <q>kennel cough</q> similar to the way <i>B. pertussis</i>
works in humans.  This organism may cause atrophic rhinitis in pigs as well.
In rare cases it may cause pertussis-like symptoms in humans.
<p>
<i>Bordetella parapertussis</i> may cause milder form of pertussis.

<h2>Mycobacteria</h2>
<p>
The genus <i>Mycobacterium</i> is a member of the family Actinomycetales, which 
features a bacillary (rod-shaped) morphology and a high lipid content in the 
cell wall.  This lipid-rich nature of the cell wall contributes to the 
characteristic <b>acid fastness</b> during staining.  Several spp. in this genus 
are pathogens, causing chronic granulamatous diseases. <i>M. tuberculosis, M. 
bovis, M. avium</i> and <i>M. microti</i> are known as the <q>tubercle 
bacilli.</q>  Other members are referred to as <q>atypical</q> mycobacteria, 
which cause TB-like diseases in humans.  The causative agent of leprosy (now 
called <q>Hansen's Disease</q> for political reasons), <i>M. leprae</i>, falls 
within this genus.  Other pathogens include <i>M. marinum, M. ulcerans</i>, and 
<i>M. paratuberculosis</i>.  There are also saprophytic spp. in this group.

<h3>The Tubercle Bacilli</h3>
<p>
Conspicuous characteristics of this and all Mycobacteria are acid fastness 
during cell wall staining.  This is because the cell wall is rich in <b>mycolic 
acids</b> found in the glycolipids and waxes.  60% of the dry weight of the cell 
wall is lipid.  The cell wall figures prominently in the pathogenesis of these 
organisms.  The Waxes D is an important component in the immunogenicity of the 
organism. The presence of mycolic acids, with the structure 
R-CH(OH)-C(COOH)-C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>49</sub>, distinguishes the Mycobacteria. 
The acid group esterifies with glycolipids or glycoproteins, and these esters 
are important in classification.
<p>
The tubercle bacilli are among the slowest growing of any microorganisms, with a 
generation time &gt; 12 hours.  They are strict aerobes, and this explains why 
they colonize in locations where a high O<sub>2</sub> tension is found.  A 
complex organic, rich medium is best to begin isolation and propagation: 
potato-glycerol-egg (Lowenstein-Jensen, Petragnani).  Wetting agents (tweens) 
promote growth.  The bacilli are sensitive to heat (pasteurization), UV light, 
and phenol. The bacteria are very resistant to exposure to acid, alkali, and 
detergents.
<p>
A definitive diagnostic work-up includes demonstration of the results of the 
acid-fast stain, staining with the fluorochrome dye auramine, and biochemical 
testing with niacin production, nitrate reduction, hydrolysis of the surfactant 
Tween-80.  The latter tests are done from digestion and concentration of 
cultures treated with 4% NaOH and cultured after centrifugation, followed by 8 
weeks of growth.
<p>
The presence of a <q>cording factor</q> is related to the virulence of the 
tubercle bacilli.  Certain <q>antigens</q> really only aggravate the virulence 
without being antigenic.  Resistance to standard treatment (streptomycin, INH) 
is growing and common.
<p>
The habitat of the tubercle bacilli are only within infected hosts. There is 
some host specificity for these mycobacteria, but it is not strict.  Typically, 
<i>M. tuberculosis</i> will infect primates and pet birds (guinea pigs are 
experimental hosts).  <i>M. bovis</i> infects most mammals, including rabbits 
and guinea pigs. <i>M. avium</i>, which has several serotypes, is found 
primarily in birds and pigs, and in rare cases, humans.
<p>
There is no strict host-to-host transmission.  Typically the route of infection 
is respiratory, but the organism can be acquired by the alimentary canal and 
also by congenital transmission.  A cutaneous (usually occupational) route is 
known, and ingestion of infected milk can be a route.
<p>
The mechanism of pathogenesis is well detailed.  The bacilli are
ingested by phagocytic defensive cells and they are able to prevent
fusion of the phagosome and lysosome.  Their growth in strands or cords
contributes to their pathogenicity.  The bacteria secrete no toxins
or tissue-destroying enzymes.  They elicit a cell-mediated hypersensitivity
(CMH) by their tuberculoproteins, and the cell wall wax D may be an
adjuvant.  Tuberculolipids are crude phosphatides that contribute to
formation of the tubercle, with epithelioid cells and connective tissue
proliferation.  The cord factor and sulfolipids inhibit mobility of
phagocytes, and cord factor induces formation of granulomas.  The ability
of bacilli to grow inside macrophages causes macrophages to be targets
of CMI, and this leads to lung tissue necrosis.

<h3><i>Mycobacterium leprae</i></h3>

<h1>The Urogenital Tract As A Microbial Habitat</h1>

<h2>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</h2>
<h2>Chlamydiae</h2>
<h3>Chlamydia trachomatis</h3>

<h2>Treponema pallidum and Syphilis</h2>
<p>
A pathogenic spirochete whose only host is human.  It causes a
chronic generalized infection that starts as a venereal infection
and alternates between an active and quiescent state over years.
<p>
Bacterial morphology shows a flexible spiral whose long axis varies from 5-20 
&mu;m and a diameter of 0.2 &mu;m.  The spirochete is quite motile, both 
translationally and rotationally.  A bilayered cell wall features rotating axial 
filaments;  the surface layer is called the cell membrane or periplast and 
features a mucopolysaccharide capsule. In every respect it is bacterial: 
prokaryotic, cell wall with muramic acid, and flagella making up the axial 
filaments.  Darkfield microscopy of wet mounts can identify the characteristic 
spiral quick movement of the bacteria.  Tissue impressions stained with silver 
can also provide contrast.  Serological identification with reagin tests is the 
most definitive.  The VDRL and RPR tests are reagin flocculation tests.  The 
Wasserman test looks for complement fixation.  The TPHA test uses 
hemagglutination.  A fluorescent antibody test is useful in detecting all stages 
of infection (primary, secondary, late stages).
<p>
Consistent conditions for its culture of <i>Treponema</i> have not been found. 
It is believed to be anaerobic or microaerophilic (1-5% oxygen for optimal 
survival).  It prefers lower temperatures (35&deg;) and has a slow generation 
cycle (33 h).  It resists low to drying heat, heavy metal ions, and antibiotics. 
It can survive up to 48 h at 4&deg;, but indefinitely when frozen.  A 
mucopolysaccharidase it produces may be important to its attachment and 
pathogenesis.
<p>
The habitat is in the lesions and body fluids typical of syphilis. 90% of 
transmitted infections are through sexual intercourse; the rest is congenitally, 
and through extragenital (occupational) contact.  The skin and mucous membrane 
lesions are highly contagious.
<p>
The nature of pathogenesis is not completely understood.  <i>Treponema</i> 
probably attaches to ground substance (mucopolysaccharide) by use of a 
hydrolytic mucopolysaccharidase, proliferating within that space. 
Mucopolysaccharides are most abundant in the dermis, testis, aorta, eye, 
placenta, umbilical cord and in the wall of blood vessels. Syphilis is 
characterized by an endarteritis, necrosis, ulceration, and accumulation of 
mucoid material.  The local lesion (<b>chancre</b>) takes 10-90 days to develop, 
involving swollen lymph nodes (the hard chancre is caused by mucopolysaccharide 
of the bacterium).  10-40 days after lesions develop, the lesion regresses 
during healing. Secondary stage of the disease may involve glomerulonephritis 
caused by immune complex formation.  This takes 2-6 weeks after the primary 
stage.  A tertiary stage of the disease is seen as a granulomatous inflammation 
with gumma formation, probably as a result of cell-mediated allergy. An 
immunosuppressive effect may obtain because of the treponemal 
mucopolysaccharide.  The primary and secondary stages are referred to as 
<q>early syphilis</q> falling within the first 2 years of infection.  <q>Late 
syphilis</q> is disease that persists &ge; 4 years and is not readily 
transmissible.
<p>
Congenital transmission can occur only once the secondary stage of syphilis is 
obtained.  However mothers with a late syphilis condition may not pass it on to 
their fetuses.  The fetus is infected after the 16th week as a result of changes 
in the placenta.  Development can be severely affected in the skeleton, as well 
as epithelial and neural tissues, but no cardiovascular effects.
<p>
Immunity develops that is both humoral and cell-mediated.  Antibody can be 
detected in both serum and CSF. These subside after cure.  A specific 
immobilizing, complement-fixing antibody is directed toward a treponemal 
antigen, and is used in indirect fluorescence detection.  In 25-35% of cases, 
there is a spontaneous cur
<p>
Can be treated with penicillin, and lesser extent with erythromycin and 
tetracycline.  Note that Herxheimer reactions are toxic-allergic reactions to 
its successful treatment.
<p>
Nonvenereal syphilis includes <b>yaws</b> caused by <i>T. pertenne</i> and 
<b>pinta</b> caused by <i>T. carateum</i>.  Yaws is a skin disease (also called 
<i>treponematosis</i> first seen as a small sore that goes into a period of 
quiescence, followed by a massive lesion with granuloma.  After another 
quiescent period, bones become involved. Pinta only discolors the skin without 
involving the bone.
<p>
A primordial treponema attained global distribution.  In the New World, it 
causes endemic syphilis and pinta.  In Africa and Asia it causes syphilis and 
yaws.  In Europe it causes endemic syphilis.

<h1>The Skin As A Microbial Habitat</h1>
<h2>Dermatophilus congolensis</h2>
<h2>Dermatophytes</h2>
<p>
The dermatophytes principally describe the genera <i>Trichophyton, 
Microsporum</i>, and <i>Epidermophyton</i>.  The first two are in the class 
Ascomycotina and the latter in Deuteromycotina.  <i>Trichophyton</i> affects the 
skin, hair and nails and is also called <i>Arthroderma</i>. <i>Microsporum</i> 
affects skin and hair and is also known as <i>Nannizia</i>.
<p>
These organisms for short (3-4 &mu;m) hyphae in culture and in the host (they 
are monomorphic).  Arthroconidia can form in hair.  Identification is based on 
microscopic and colonial morpholgy.   Multicellular macroconidia can appear with 
<i>Microsporum</i> and <i>Epidermophyton</i>. Microcondia are seen with 
<i>Trichophyton</i> and <i>Microsporum</i>. There are other unique structures to 
hyphal forms, such as spiral hyphae in <i>T. mentagrophytes</i>.
<p>
These organisms are aerobic and do not use fermentation (thus a fermentative 
biochemical test is not very useful).  Some dermatophytes have adapted to 
special utilization of urea, amino acids from the urea cycle, lysine, alanine, 
and amino acids rich in sweat.  Other have special enzymes that assist them in 
establishing a niche:  elastase, hydrolytic enzymes to deaminate amino acids, 
and keratinase.  There is a Dermatophyte Test Medium (DTM) containing certain 
protein synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide, gentamicin, chlortetracycline)  and 
which reports when the medium becomes alkaline.  Some tests are done which 
examines special biochemical dependencies, such as thiamine, inositol, growth 
and pigmentation on rice grains (<i>M. canis</i> does, but <i>M. audoini</i> 
does not), the perforation of the hair (<i>T. mentagrophytes</i> does, but <i>T. 
rubrum</i> does not).
<p>
Distribution is worldwide for some spp. (<i>T. rubrum</i>), and with others 
there are geographic limitations.  The dermatophytes may have once originated as 
soil-borne organisms (geophiles) as some species are still found there (<i>M. 
gypseum</i>).  Others are associated primarily with humans (anthropophilic) such 
as <i>T. rubrum</i>.  Others associate with animals (zoophilic), such as <i>M. 
canis</i>.  <i>T. mentagrophytes</i> makes use of multiple host animal species, 
including humans.
<p>
<b>Transmission</b>.  <i>M. canis</i> can spread from cat to man by direct 
contact.  Other spread from indirect contact, such as from the floor or towels 
(<i>T. rubrum</i>, <i>T. mentagrophytes</i>).
<p>
The organisms usually infect the stratum corneum, hair and nails only. The 
lesion is called <q>ringworm</q> or <q>tinea.</q> (note that nail involvement is 
called <i>tinea unguium</i>, hair and scalp involvement as <i>tinea capitis</i>. 
Hyphae and arthroconidia can be found <i>within</i> the hair (endothrix) and 
also outside (ectothrix). Pathogenesis is largely a reaction to the presence of 
the fungus, which may involve allergy, photosensitivity to fungal products, or 
the action of proteolytic enzymes such as keratinases.  The availability of 
Fe<sup>3+</sup> and products of the urea cycle and amino acids on the skin may 
promote the growth of fungi.
<p>
Resistance to infection may come from the presence of sebum or fatty acids.
Infection is most likely on the soles of the feet, and the webs of fingers
and toes which lack sebum.  A delayed type hypersensitivity resulting
from cell-mediated immunity accounts for inflammation.
<p>
Diagnosis involves inspection of a wet mount with 10-20% potassium hydroxide
of samples of skin, hair, and nails (the involved tissues).  A negative
KOH finding does not preclude infection however.  Culture on DTM and on
Sabouraud's agar (pH 5.6) with and without chloramphenicol and cycloheximide
should be performed.  Whatever grows on Sabouraud's can be subcultured
to cornmeal or potato/glucose agar, as this promotes growth of macroconidia
and mycelia.  There is also a tine test that can be used to determine
<i>Tricophyton</i> infections.
<p>
Treatment can vary from simply keeping feet dry, to treating with topical
fungicides (tolnaftate, miconazole, clotrimazole), to the use of systemic
agents such as griseofulvin, ketoconazole, terbinafine (Lamisil).
<p>
Another dermatophyte is the causative agent of <b>pityriasis (tinea) 
versicolor</b>.  This is caused by the lipophilic yeast <i>Malassezia furfur</i> 
(<i>Pityrosporum orbiculare</i>; there is also a <i>P. ovale</i>). Superficial 
spotty lesions are found on the stratum corneum.  KOH or stained preparations 
show short hyphal segments and yeast cells about 4-8&mu;m in size.  These can be 
cultured at 37&deg; in olive oil or in C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>18</sub> fatty 
acids.  This organism is part of the normal flora.

<h1>The Anthropozoonoses</h1>
<p>
Bacteria which fall into this class of diseases have common features. First of 
all they tend to stain gram negative at their poles.  They also feature 
enterics.  They can also stain with Giemsa and Wright (hemaotoxylin-based).

<h2>Yersinia and Pasteurella</h2>
<h2>Brucella</h2>
<h2>Rickettsiae</h2>
<h2>Borellia</h2>
<h2>Leptospira</h2>

<h2>Bacillus anthracis</h2>
<h2>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</h2>
<h2>Listeria monocytogenes</h2>
<h2>Pathogenic Clostridia</h2>

<h2>Sapromycoses</h2>

<h2>Nocardia</h2>
<p>
While <i>Nocardia</i> and <i>Actinomycetes</i> are classed with fungi because 
they form hyphae, they are true prokaryotes (bacteria). These acid-fast forms 
are free-living and can cause systemic and local infections.  <i>Nocardia</i> is 
distinguished from <i>Actinomyces</i>, <i>Streptomyces</i>, and 
<i>Mycobacterium</i> through staining, cell wall components, nutritional 
requirements and other biochemical tests.
<p>
<i>Nocardia</i> is Gram-positive with branching filaments, with a size typical 
of bacteria.  In liquid medium, aerial hyphae can form. Several spp. are acid 
fast.  <i>N. asteroides</i> causes pulmonary disease.  <i>N. brasiliensis</i> 
causes wound granulomatosis. <i>N. caviae</i> causes otitis media in hamsters, 
but will infect humans and cattle too.
<p>
The genus can be aerobically cultured on Sabouraud's either at room temperature 
or 37&deg;.  Colonies appears <q>dry</q> and often pigmented.  Aerial mycelium 
form.  Identification can be established with biochemical tests:  xanthine, 
tyrosine, casein hydrolysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility espeially to 
sulfonamides.
<p>
<i>Nocardia</i> is free-living usually in soil.  Infection can occur from 
inhalation of dust, wound infection, fomites.  Lesions that develop can be 
suppurating, abscessed, and granulomatous.  With pulmonary involvement, lesions, 
fever, and dyspnea can develop.  The respiratory route often look like 
tuberculosis.  Sinus tracts that form can involve organs throughout the body. 
Brain abscess is common. The appearance is distinguished from actinomycosis 
because the latter show a sulfur granule appearence.
<p>
<i>Nocardia</i> can also form a <b>mycetoma</b>, an infectious granuloma 
developing from wound infection, usu. in extremities.
<p>
Epidemiology:  usually from soil-to-man or -animal.  Transmission between hosts 
not seen.  Wide range of hosts, particularly dogs and cattle. Found throughout 
world.  Immune compromised individuals more susceptible.  Diagnosis from sputum 
smears will show acid fast bacteria forming mycelia in rich aerobic media.
<p>
Treated using sulfa drugs and penicillins.  Immunity is both humoral and 
cell-mediated.

<h2>Actinomycetes</h2>
<p>
These Gram-positive, nonmotile bacteria will form mycelia on rich culture medium 
but can be distinguished from <i>Nocardia</i> in that they are <em>not</em> acid 
fast.  <i>Nocardia</i> are distinguished from <i>Mycobacterium</i> in that the 
latter do not form hyphae and mycelia.  <i>Actinomyces</i> also features hyphae 
in which the hyphal end is anaerobic or microencephalic.
<p>
These are not free-living, but part of the normal flora in the oral cavity.
Spread is from human to human by human bites.  These organisms can cause 
aspiration pneumonia sometimes and infect serous membrane structures.
<p>
Pathogenesis involves no exotoxins, but there are toxins present that
cause osteomyelitis (and bone destruction).  <b>Actinomycosis</b>
is classically a chronic granulomatous suppurative disease with abscesses
or masses featuring pyemic sulfur granules, draining masses.  Note that
<i>Actinomyces, Mycobacterium</i> and <i>Nocardia</i> all cause
granulomatous disease.  Cell-mediated
and humoral immunity are factors in recovery and prevention.  Treatment of
disease is by antibiotics (penicillin).
<p>
<i>A. israeli</i> is a major human pathogen isolated from infection site.
<i>A. naeslundi, viscous, endolyticus</i> (associated with periodontal
disease), <i>bovis</i>, and <i>magori</i> are other species.
<p>
Some species have many properties that make them appear like <i>Actinomyces</i>
but are distinguished by various tests.  <i>Arachnia proprionica</i>
for example produces proprionic acid.  Pus samples should be Gram-stained,
with a finding of branching filamentous forms featuring sulfur granules.
These will culture anaerobically on rich media for generic identification,
and species identification can be by gas chromatography and biochemical
testing.


<h2>Francisella tularensis</h2>
<p>
A fastidious gram negative bacterium parasitic in many mammals, some
birds.  Infection in humans is through wound infection, insect bite,
or contaminated drinking water.
<p>
Cells are extremely pleomorphic and show great range in size, from
large globular to filterable (Berkefeld).  Cells have no capsule
or flagella (non-motile).  Nutritional requirements are exacting.
Isolation is usually with cysteine-glucose-hemoglobin or blood agar.
It is a strict aerobe, fermenting some carbohydrates.  It is viable in
cold environments.  Serologically there is cross-reaction with
Brucella.
<p>
Two biotypes.  Type A is nearctic, in northern areas of New World, only in
North America.  Reservoir is rabbits, hares, ticks.  It ferments glycerol,
has citrulline ureidase.  It is the more virulent, and can cause severe
disease and 5% mortality in untreated disease.
<p>
Type B is holarctic, in all northern areas.  It cannot utilize
glycerol, is negative for citrulline ureidase.  It mainly occurs
in rodents and is found in contaminated surface water.  This type
is found worldwide, and less than 10% of cases are in North America.
Disease caused by this type is mild, with &lt;1% mortality in untreated
cases.
<p>
Francisella is a strict parasite, facultatively intracellular.  It
has more animal hosts known than for any other bacterium, with reservoirs
in lagomorphs, rodents, ticks, biting flies, birds.  It is found in
the organs and blood of the host (bacteremia common).  Transmission
is probably most commonly from infection of wound or eye during handling
of infected rabbit carcasses.   Insect bites might also transmit;
if ticks are involved, transovarian passage means that the next generation
of a mammalian host is also infected.
Drinking contaminated water and eating contaminated (rabbit) meat may
also be sources of infection.  Occasionally infection might be carried
airborne by dust or droplets.  Lab workers have become infected by
work with the bacterium (it was a leading cause of infection of lab
workers).
<p>
Pathogenesis is not well understood, although endotoxin might be
involved.  Development of symptoms range from 1-10 d.  A percutaneous
infection causes ulceroglandular involvment, with local inflammation
and ulcerating regional lymph nodes.  An oculoglandular infection
is seen with corneal and conjuctival lesions.  Glandular infection
is seen as lymphadenitis with no local lesions.  Anginal infection
shows as pharyngitis and tonsillitis.  Pulmonary or gastrointestinal
involvement is a typhoidal manifestation of infection.
<p>
Complete recovery can take weeks to months with a subacute to chronic
course.  Immunity develops through cell-mediated processes.  An
attenuated live vaccine administered by one intracutaneous dose
is both effective and safe and useful in endemic areas.  Antibiotics
are generally useful in most situations (streptomycin, gentamicin,
tetracyline, chloramphenicol).
<p>
Francisella is a true zoonosis with no person-to-person transmission.
It is seen mostly in the northern latitudes, in North Africa, Mexico.


<h2>The Mycoplasmas</h2>
<p>
These are the smallest free-living bacteria.  The principal feature
and distinction from other bacteria is that the mycoplasma have no
cell wall.  The class Molicutes (trivial name, mycoplasmas) includes
the genera found in animals <i>Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Acholeplasma</i>,
and <i>Anaeroplasma</i>; in plants <i>Spiroplasma</i>; and the free-living
<i>Thermoplasma</i>.  <i>Mycoplasma</i> and <i>Ureaplasma</i> include
human and animal pathogens.
<p>
The mycoplamsa appear in a range of morphologies, from coccoid to
filamentous, and some bizarre forms.  Within a species, several forms
can appear, while in the rest, one morphology predominates.  Division
is not by budding, but binary fission, and the organism might assume
a particular morphology prior to fission.  The copying of the genome
may also be asynchronous with the division of the cell.
<p>
The cell membrane is a trilaminar assembly composed of glycolipids,
proteins, and cholesterol.  Because these organisms have no cell wall,
their morphology is quite plastic, and they show interesting colonial
growth.  They also resist penicillin, since its function is to prevent
bacterial growth by inhibiting cell wall formation.  However, the organisms
are susceptible to immune serum.  The mycoplasma are also small enough
to pass through sterile filtration systems whose pore diameters are
0.2 &mu;m.
<p>
In addition to the cell membrane, certain organisms (<i>M. mycoides,
M. meleagradis, M. dispar</i>, and the <i>Ureaplasma</i>) appear to
possess polysaccharide capsules.  Their genomes are composed of circular
ds DNA typical of bacteria.  The <i>Mycoplasma</i> and <i>Ureaplasma</i>
have DNA with mass 4.5 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> Da, and the <i>Acholeplasma,
Thermoplasma</i>, and <i>Spiroplasma</i> have weights of
1.0&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Da.
<p>
Some of the mycoplasma (<i>M. pulmonis, M. gallisepticum,</i> and
<i>M. pneumoniae</i>) have special terminal intracytoplasmic structures
that permit them to glide.  <i>Spiroplasma</i> has helical filaments
that permit a rotary motion.  <i>Thermoplasma</i> have a monotrichous
flagellum.
<p>
Some mycoplasmas have acquired abilities to establish disease (be virulent).
<ul>
<li><i>M. neutrolyticum</i> produces a heat-labile protein that is an exotoxin.
<li>Cell-associated toxins are found in several spp. (<i>M. pulmonis,
  M. arthritidis, M. gallisepticum</i>).
<li><i>M. bovis</i> induces eosinophilia with an intracellular toxin.
<li><i>M. mycoides</i> has a galactan capsule that provokes an auto-immune
  disease.
<li>Many spp. (<i>M. pneumoniae</i> including) can produce peroxide.
<li><i>Ureaplasma</i> can convert urea to ammonia.
</ul>
<p>
Most mycoplasmas, particularly the pathogens, have complex and fastidious
nutritional requirements.  They are dependent upon serum, sometimes yeast
products.  In vitro, they grow slowly, with colonies requiring 3-10 days
to develop.  Broth cultures produce only slight turbidity.  Most are
facultative anaerobes or microaerophilic;  only <i>Anaeroplasma</i> is
a strict anaerobe.  Mycoplasmas are fermentative or non-fermentative,
with the latter utilizing arginine.  <i>Ureaplasma</i> make use of urea.
<p>
One of the reasons of serum dependence is that sterols can be found, and
all species require sterol except for <i>Acholeplasma, Thermoplasma</i>,
and some of the <i>Anaeroplasm</i>.
<p>
Species of mycoplasmas can often be identified by colony appearance,
although taxonomy does not rely on this entirely.  One exception is
small and large colonial forms of <i>M. mycoides</i>, markers for
epidemiological studies.  The utilization of either arginine or urea
and the presence of glycolytic activity is helpful in identification.
The principal means of classification is serology:  growth inhibition,
complement fixation, agglutination, agar gel diffusion, fluorescent antibody.
Since cell membrane glycolipids produce these reactions, this is the
basis of taxonomic distinction.

<b>Other notes</b>.
<ul>
<li>Some bacteria that normally possess cell walls
may be deficient in them (<q>L-forms</q>), and these must not
be confused with mycoplasmas.
<li>Certain phage (DNA viruses) have been found in some genera
(<i>Mycoplasma, Acholeplasma, Spiroplasma</i>), but the role in pathogenesis
is not known.
<li>The mycoplasma can acquire antibiotic resistance plasmids, both naturally
and experimentally, but their ability to express resistance is not known.
</ul>
<p>
The habitat for mycoplasmas (except for the free-living) are the mucous
and serous membranes.  Individuals can become asymptomatic carriers
subsequent to recovery from infection, and the reservoir appears to
be upper respiratory and lower genital tracts.
<p>
Some species have been found to infect more than one host (<i>M. canis</i>
can infect both dogs and humans), but the majority show strict
host specificity (<i>M. pneumoniae</i> is a pathogen only to humans).
It is possible that other spp. serve as a carrier to the species infected.
The mycoplasma can be inhaled as droplet nuclei, or trasmitted by
sexual contact, and even vertically (mother to newborn).  The mycoplasma
do not survive outside the host for very  long.  Establishment of
a mycoplasma as the etiologic agent of disease requires some rigor,
since the mere finding of the presence of it is insufficient:  many
non-pathogenic mycoplasma live closely to pathogenic forms.
<p>
After infection, pathogenesis may first be seen by the action of exotoxins
or cell-associated toxins, with cause signs and lesions in the CNS.
Sialic acid receptors on host cell membranes may allow binding of mycoplasma
to cells (attachment structures identified in <i>M. pneumoniae</i> and
<i>M. gallisepticum</i>).  If the mycoplasma can produce peroxide or
ammonia, this may be toxic to the host cell.  In addition of the mycoplasma
is under the control of phage, it may direct the course of virulence.
Mycoplasma infection may be opportunistic, following upon the
stress or weakened state provided by a viral infection.
<p>
Most mycoplasma are part of the normal flora of animals,
although some are strict pathogens (see table below).

The only known mycoplasma pathogen in humans is <i>M. pneumoniae</i>
although several species have been isolated from humans.  The table

<p>
Except for <i>M. pneumoniae</i>, most human mycoplasmas are found in
nonhuman primates.
<p>
Primary atypical pneumonia is caused by <i>M. pneumoniae</i>, the most
important cause of nonbacterial pneumonitis, accounting for 1-2 in 10
pneumonias in humans.  Infection rates are 50-90% worldwide, with
an incidence of 3-30% depending on the population group.  Infections
range from asymptomatic to severe bronchopneumonia.  The higher risk
groups are the late childhood to 20-30 year old groups, especially those
in high density.  A cyclic epidemic occurs every 2-5 years.
<p>
The incubation period is 1-3 weeks long with flu-like symptoms:  weakness,
headache, sore throat, initially unproductive cough.  Eventually the
sputum may produce blood and chest pains, with resolution occurring in 1-4
weeks.  Rarely does death occur.  Other rare complications include ear
infections, CNS disturbance, skin rash, joint involvement.
<p>
<i>Mycoplasma</i> can induce autoimmune disease as their membrane features
antigens that are also found on host cells.  For example, <i>M. mycoides</i>
and bovine lungs have a common galactan polysaccharide.  Antibodies
to the galactan activate complement to destroy the host cell.
<i>Mycoplasma</i> can also cause immunosuppression by an unknown mechanism,
with decreased humoral immunity and anergy to delayed hypersensitivity.
A mitogenic effect has been described for lymphocytes, and is thought to
interfere with T/B cell maturation.
<p>
Once disease passes to recovery, there is a greater resistance to re-infection
in most cases.  Both a humoral and cell-mediated response are seen.
IgA, IgM, and IgG are all involved in humoral immunity.  An anti-attachment
antibody is present.  Moreover a growth inhibiting antibody appears to be
present.  A complement fixing antibody actively promotes destruction of
<i>Mycoplasma</i>.  Macrophages and neutrophils are activated by opsonizing antibodies.
Disease resistance is not necessarily long lasting, and re-infection
with <i>M. pneumoniae</i> can occur.
<p>
Although immunization using vaccines of killed bacteria are available
and effective, it is believed that there is a great deal of sensitization
such that there is a more severe reaction to natural infection.
<p>
A wide variety of antibiotics have been employed in treatment.  Tylosin,
tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, lincomycin-spectinomycin, and
tiamulin.  Demethylchlortetracycline, doxycycline, tetracycline,
oxytetracycline, demeclocycline, and erythromycin have been effective
against <i>M. pneumoniae</i>.  Although the organism is ubiquitous,
it is possible to avoid situations that promote infection, such as
avoiding crowds and close contact.  Vaccination might be helpful in
high density living situations.
