<p>
Between September 1978 and June 1983, I attended lectures at the University of 
California, Davis as an undergraduate student, a double major in Biochemistry 
and Philosophy.

<p>
From September 1986 to sometime in 1988, I attended lectures at Davis as
a graduate (Ph.D.) student in the discipline of Biochemistry and Molecular 
Biology.

<p>
I kept all the lecture notes the kinds of spiral-bound notebooks that students 
in this primitive era kept.  Over the past decade, I eventually got around to 
getting my hands on these notebooks, having kept them and thinking it was for 
posterity.  I put all of the pages in digital form (i.e., used a scanned to 
generate their images).  All the imaged pages were bound as PDF files, and all 
these PDF docs are contained in <a href="../../LectureNotes">this directory</a>.

<p>
I have spent a long time transcribing some&mdash;but not all yet&mdash;of the
lecture notes to web documents (files in HTML format).
<p>
Why?
<p>
Two reasons:
<ol>
<li>Imaged writing, especially handwriting, is not searchable.  Nor is it
often legible.  Transcribing to readable text is good, and the text now
becomes searchable by a keyword.
<li>For my daughter Sequoia, whom I would hope benefit from some of the
notes.    I have learned that much of what I learned as a student at the
university is in fact being taught in Sequoia's <em>high school</em>
classes!
</ol>
<p>
Are the notes correct or truthful?
<p>
These notes were written down by me.  I make no assertion that these are the 
things that the professor actually said in lecture.  In fact the professor of a 
particular lecture might say he never said these things or that the student (me) 
misunderstood what was said in lecture.  I could have dwelled on a minor point 
in the lecture whereas the professor wanted to stress a major point.
<p>
The notes in the natural sciences should be dated, of course. But facts are 
facts, even if they are what little we knew more than a generation ago.
