These definitions are evolving by the day, sometimes by the minute.
Suggestions/contributions are welcome.

<p style="margin-top:2em;">
<dl>
<dt>adult stem cell
 <dd>multipotent stem cells derived from the postnatal animal
<dt>bone marrow fibroblastic cell
 <dd>adherent fibroblastoid cells from marrow that are often
  synonymously referred to as <a href="#msc">mesenchymal stem cells</a>
  or bone marrow stromal cells
<dt>embryonic stem cell (ES cell <i>or</i> ESC)
 <dd>stem cells obtained from embryos
<dt><a name="hsc"></a>hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
 <dd>a cell with the ability to self-renew and has the potential to form
all different types of cells that comprise the blood

<dt>marrow mesenchymal stem cell
 <dd>a mesenchymal stem cell that resides in bone marrow

<dt><a name="hesabbr"></a>hES
 <dd>a common abbreviation for <a href="#hes"><i>human embryonic
stem cell</i></a> (q.v.); see also <a href="#hesc">hESC</a>

<dt><a name="hesc"></a>hESC
 <dd>an abbreviation used for <a href="#hes"><i>human embryonic
stem cell</i></a> (q.v.); see also <a href="#hesabbr">hES</a>

<dt>HSC
 <dd>a common abbreviation for <a href="#hsc"><i>hematopoietic stem cell</i></a> (q.v.)

<dt><a name="hes"></a>human embryonic stem cell (HSC)
 <dd>stem cells derived from human embryos

<dt>MAPC
 <dd>abbreviation for <a href="#mapc">multipotent adult progenitor cell</a>
 (q.v.)

<dt>marrow stromal cells
 <dd>a superset of cells that includes mesenchymal stem cells [Horwitz]

<dt><a name="msc"></a>mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
 <dd>
  <ol>
  <li>a class of adult stem cells that has the ability to self-renew
and give rise to one or more mesenchymal tissues [Horwitz]
  <li>an adherent fibroblastic cell isolated by Percoll density
   centrifugation and expressing antigens reactive with monoclonal antibodies
   SH2 and SH3 [Caplan]; (SH2 is anti-CD105, and SH3 is anti-CD73)
  </ol>
<dt>mesenchymal progenitor cell
 <dd>cells that are committed to a lineage of differentiation toward one
of the mesenchymal tissues:  stroma, bone, cartilage, fat, or skeletal
muscle; there are also not widely accepted claims that they can give
rise to cardiomyocytes and neurons [Horwitz]

<dt>mesoderm
 <dd>the middle of the three primary germ layers of an embryo that
is the source of many bodily tissues and structures
(as bone, muscle, connective tissue, and dermis)
[<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?mesoderm">Merriam-Webster</a>]

<dt>mononuclear cells
 <dd>the cells obtained from the interface at the top of a high density
(Ficoll, Percoll, Lymphoprep, Nycoprep, Nycodenz, and equivalent) phase
and the bottom of the plasma/salt solution phase after centrifugation of
bone marrow samples or the cells obtained from bone marrow isolates and
suspended in an isotonic salt solution;  red blood cells, polymorphonuclear
leukocytes and platelets are present in other phases of the centrifuged
prepartion

<dt>MSC
 <dd>a common abbreviation for <a href="#msc"><i>mesenchymal
stem cell</i></a> (q.v.)

<dt>multipotent
 <dd>able to differentiate into multiple cell/tissue types, but not all
 types of the primary germ layers

<dt><a name="mapc"></a>multipotent adult progenitor cell
 <dd>(<span style="font:normal 85% sans-serif;">abbreviated <b>MAPC</b></span>)
a subset of mesenchymal stem cells depleted of CD45<sup>+</sup>
and glycophorin A<sup>+</sup> cells that is produced in low serum
and serum-free cultures supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF)
and platelet-derived growth factor beta-beta (PDGF-&beta;&beta;);
and capable of differentiating into cartilage, bone, fibroblasts,
adipocytes, and non-mesenchymal tissues such as myoblasts (all muscle
types), endothelium, and many neuroectodermal types (glial, neuronal).
[Verfaillies]


<dt>nonhematopoietic stem cell
 <dd>stem cells in the bone marrow that do not produce cells that
will differentiate into any cell type that forms the blood; usually
synonymous with <a href="#msc">mesenchymal stem cell</a>.


<dt>pluripotent
 <dd>
  <ol>
  <li>having the potential to form cells and tissues that comprise
    the three embryonic germ layers
  <li>not fixed as to developmental potentialities:
    having developmental plasticity
[<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?pluripotent">Merriam-Webster</a>]
  </ol>

<dt>RS cell
 <dd>a designation for a special subset of bone marrow cells which are
  MSCs:  RS-1 cells are small, agranular MSCs;  RS-2 cells are small,
  granular MSCs; larger, somewhat granular MSCs represent a third class
  believed to be more mature and proliferative; as a culture becomes more
  confluent, RS-2 cells disappear and RS-1 cells expand [Prockop]
<dt>stem cells
 <dd>cells capable of self-renewal and which have the potential to
  differentiate into one or more lineages
<dt>STRO-1
 <dd>a monoclonal antibody developed by P. Simmons that identifies an
  immature population of mesenchymal cells [Horwitz]
<dt><a name="stroma"></a>stroma
 <dd>the supporting framework of an animal organ typically
consisting of connective tissue
[<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?stroma">Merriam-Webster</a>]
<dt>stromal cell
 <dd>a cell forming part of the <a href="#stroma">stroma</a>
   of a tissue or organ
<dt>totipotent
 <dd>capable of developing into a complete organism or differentiating
into any of its cells or tissues
[<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?totipotent">Merriam-Webster</a>]
