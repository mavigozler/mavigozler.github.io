Tyrosine hydroxylase, the initial step in norepinephrine biosynthesis
<p class="Para1">
500 mg slices of tissue from whole adrenal and spleen of guinea pig were 
incubated 80 min in 4&nbsp;ml solution containing 0.4 &micro;mol 
<i>p</i>-bromo-<i>m</i>-hydroxybenzoxyamine and 400 &micro;mol KP<sub>i</sub>, 
pH 6.2. <span class="small-caps">l</span>-[<sup>14</sup>C]Tyrosine added to 
200,000 cpm in 20 &micro;M final concentration. <span 
class="small-caps">d-</span>Tyrosine also tested, but total radioactivity was 
850 kcpm.  DOPA product was measured by adding TCA to 5% to tissue, spinning and 
putting the supnt in alumina, 0.2 M sodium acetate, and 0.2 M EDTA, adjusting pH 
to 8.5 with 3&nbsp;<span class="small-caps">n</span>&nbsp;NH<sub>4</sub>OH, 
letting alumina settle, then moving it to column and washing with water to take 
off tyrosine, and eluting with 0.3&nbsp;<span class="small-caps">n</span> acetic 
acid, then counting in Bray's.  Results show that whole adrenal with <span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-Tyr produces 3.52 nmol/g tissue, while 
spleen produces 0.82 nmol/g. With <span class="small-caps">d</span>-Tyr, whole 
adrenal produces only 0.12 nmol/g, and spleen 0.05 nmol/g.  When slices were 
heated 80&deg; for 10 min before the assay, whole adrenal treated with <span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-Tyr produces 0.74 nmol DOPA/g, and spleen produces 
0.34 nmol/g.  With <span class="small-caps">d</span>-Tyr, whole adrenal makes 
0.84 nmol/g and spleen 0.24 nmol/g. The heating was done in answer to previous 
experiments suggesting that some specific system was involved in converting Tyr 
to DOPA without regard to stereochemistry. In fact, these data show that there 
is a enzymatic hydroxylation system that is specific for the naturally occurring 
Tyr, and heating releases a nonspecific oxidizing system.
<p>
The tissue distribution of the enzyme was studied in many animals and tissues, 
particularly in tissues known to express norepinephrine.  In general homogenates 
were prepared with a motor-driven glass homogenizer using 1 g tissue + 3&nbsp;ml 
0.32 M sucrose, and spinning 15,000 g for 20 min.  Equivalents of 500 mg tissue 
from the first experiment were tested.  Results show that wherever 
norepinephrine is found, the tyrosine hydroxylating enzyme is found in 
abundance:  in guinea pig, this is true for both the pellet and supntnt of brain 
stem, as well as whole adrenal, with smaller amts in the cerebrum, even smaller 
in cerebellum, and negligible amts in heart, spleen, and liver.  High amts were 
also measured in the brain stems of rat, rabbit, cow and hog. Bovine adrenal 
medulla was also high, but the cortex was not.
<p>
Subcellular localization was studied by graded centrifugation.  TH was 
associated with particles sedimenting at 15,000 to 20,000 <i>g</i>,  and not 
with particles sedimenting at greater than 20,000 <i>g</i> but less than 105,000 
<i>g</i>, but substantial amts are present in the soluble fraction as well.
<p>
Purification of bovine adrenal medullary TH was attempted by spinning 105,000 
<i>g</i>, adding to the spntnt ammonium sulfate to 40%, and then dialyzing the 
pellet. TH was unstable, and 0.1 M mercaptoethanol appeared to help. Later 
tetrahydrobioptern and Fe<sup>2+</sup> were added to the assay, since they were 
missing and made the TH results appear unstable.
<p>
Additional substances were tested (at 100 &micro;M) to see their effect on the 
activity of TH.  Against a control (nothing added) of 0.05 nmol DOPA (using 2 mg 
purified enzyme for 15 min), tetrahydrofolate was 4.4, and DMPH<sub>4</sub> was 
33.4. Smaller degrees of activity were seen with ascorbic acid and 
Fe<sup>2+</sup>.  Glutathione, folate, and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol were 
without significant effect. Velocity vs. tetrahydropteridine cofactor 
concentration curves reveal DMPH<sub>4</sub> has a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 500 
&micro;M while tetrahydrofolate has a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 1&nbsp;mM. 
Addition of 300 &micro;M Fe<sup>2+</sup> enhanced the effect of 
tetrahydrofolate, reducing its apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>.  The dependence of 
iron was also tested in a product formed vs. iron concentration: the figure 
shows 0.3 &micro;mol/ml produces the maximal effect. <p>The linearity of the 
product vs. time curve was tested at different temperatures.Linearity was 
maintained at 37&deg; for only 15 min.  At 21&deg; it could last for 1 h.  A 
velocity vs. enzyme concentration curve showed a rate linear up to 2 mg of the 
purified protein for the assay configuration used.  Because the enzyme curve was 
not linear at larger amts of protein, this suggested the presence of inhibitory 
substances.  The pH optimum was 6.0 using both an acetate and phosphate buffer; 
activity fell to 50% maximal at 0.5 pH on either side of the optimal pH.
<p>
Substrate specificity experiments indicate that only <span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-Tyr was the substrate for the enzyme.  <span 
class="small-caps">d-</span>Tyr, tyramine, <span class="small-caps">dl</span> 
<i>m</i>-Tyr and <span class="small-caps">l</span>-Trp were either hardly 
hydroxylated or not at all, given the sensitivity of the method.  The 
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for <span class="small-caps">l</span>-Tyr was 10 &micro;M.

Inhibition studies are shown in a table for two enzymes.

The identity of the product formed by the purified adrenal enzyme in the 
presence of an inhibitor of aromatic acid decarboxylase was studied more 
closely.  At pH 8.5 it adsorbed to alumina and was eluted with dilute acetic 
acid.  It could not adsorb to IRC-50 in the Na<sup>+</sup> form but does adsorb 
to Dowex-50-H<sup>+</sup> (elutes with 1 <span class="small-caps">n</span> HCl). 
DOPA similarly behaves with these properties.  Additionally the radiolabeled 
product of the reaction migrated with a DOPA standard with both chromatography 
and electrophoresis on paper.  The product also fluoresces with an excitation 
peak at 365 nm and emission peak at 495 nm. Careful stoichiometric studies also 
showed nearly 1 mol DOPA formed from 1 mol tyrosine.
<p>
Comparative studies were done with tyrosinase to distinguish the hydroxylase 
from tyrosinase.  The brain particle TH has a optimal pH of 6.2, the adrenal 
enzyme 6.0, but tyrosinase is 7.0. All three enzyme utilize <span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-Tyr, but tyrosinase also has <span 
class="small-caps">d</span>-Tyr, tyramine, and particularly DOPA as substrates, 
while TH does nothing with these substances.  The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for 
tyrosine of these enzymes also differs:  600 &micro;M for tyrosinase, but on 10 
&micro;M for TH. Tyrosinase is activated by DOPA, while TH is inhibited by it. 
Tyrosinase is inhibited by thiourea and diethylthiocarbamate while TH is not, 
and TH is inhibited by iron chelator &alpha;,&alpha;'-dipyridyl, while 
tyrosinase is not.  Tyrosinase also results in pigment formation, but nothing 
with TH.

Inhibitors of purified beef adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
A table of 17 compounds is listed as having been tried as inhibitors for TH. 
Nearly all Phe and Tyr analogues were inhibitory to some degree. <span 
class="small-caps">d</span>-amino acid forms as a group are less active than the 
natural form.  Alpha-methyl amino acids are more potent inhibitors than 
unmethylated analogues. Substitution of halogen at the phenyl 3-position proved 
to have a strong inhibitory effect, and the mono- and diiodotyrosines were very 
inhibitory.  The combination of an alpha-methyl group and a 3-halogenated 
substitution proved to have an additive inhibitory effect.  Aromatic amino acids 
(Phe, Trp) are kinetically competitive with Tyr.  <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> values 
for the some of the very inhibitory compounds were calculated: 3-iodo-<span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine (0.39 &micro;M); 3,5-diiodo-<span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine (9.3 &micro;M); alpha-methyl-<span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine (17 &micro;M); 3-iodo-alpha-methyl-<span 
class="small-caps">dl</span>-tyrosine (0.18 &micro;M).
<p>
Although all catechol compounds tested are inhibitors, they are not very strong, 
and the <span class="small-caps">l</span>-isomers are typically more inhibitory 
than the <span class="small-caps">d</span>-forms. 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropylacetamide (H 22/54 from Hassle) was the most potent 
inhibitor of its class.  Lineweaver-Burk plots of this compound showed that it 
was not competitive with Tyr, however these compounds were competitive with 
either tetrahydrofolate or DMPH<sub>4</sub>.  Reversal of inhibition could be 
achieved with either tetrahydrofolate or DMPH<sub>4</sub>. The mechanism is 
unlikely to be because of Fe<sup>2+</sup> binding since 10 &micro;M H 22/54 
worked just as well in 0.1&nbsp;mM Fe<sup>2+</sup>.
<p>
Although alpha-methyl-<span class="small-caps">dl</span>-tyrosine was an 
inhibitor, usage of large amounts of this inhibitor with large amounts of enzyme 
did show it was a substrate, forming alpha-methyl-DOPA (presumably only the 
<span class="small-caps">l</span>-form).  Use of 3-<sup>131</sup>I-tyrosine and 
the labeled 3,5-diiodo allows for determination activity causing release of 
halogen;  the results show insignificant liberation.

Elucidation of the rate-limiting step in norepinephrine
biosynthesis in the perfused guinea pig heart
<p class="Para1">
Hartley guinea pig hearts were rigged for single-pass perfusion and hearts were 
homogenized at the end of the exp. to assess content of various chemical 
compounds.  The use of radioisotopic precursors of Tyr, DOPA, and dopamine allow 
calculation of the rate of synthesis, among other parameters.
<p>
First the rate of perfusion was found to affect the content of
norepinephrine (NE).  Increasing the rate of perfusion from
5&nbsp;ml/min to various points between a maximum of 15&nbsp;ml/min results
is a decrease of NE content of 1.6 and decreasing to 0.7 &micro;g/g
(hearts were perfused 60 min).  Because of this effect, which was
to be minimized as a factor in other variables, perfusion rates
in other experiments was 5-7&nbsp;ml/min.
<p>
Use of 20 &micro;M tyrosine in the perfusion medium showed a
constant rate of NE formation over the incubation period.
Concentration below 8 &micro;M tyrosine do not produce meaningful
NE formation determinations, since endogenous Tyr becomes
significant in diluting the labeled Tyr and can influence
proper determination of results.  The half-maximal rate of NE
synthesis from Tyr is about 20 &micro;M, which is in good agreement
with the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 10 &micro;M for the purified TH.  Presence of labeled
dopamine amounted to about 10% of the total radioactivity in cardiac NE.
<p>
Perfusion with labeled DOPA produced variations in the
rate of labeled NE vs. DOPA dose used, unlike the Tyr dose.
Double reciprocal plots of this figure yielded a straight line
showing <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> ~200 &micro;M, comparable to 400 &micro;M found
for the in vitro reaction.
<p>
Perfusion with labeled dopamine was plotted as NE formation vs.
[dopamine]:  at the lowest dopamine concentration used, NE synthesis
is appreciable, increasing linearly with ever higher dopamine
concentrations.  Since the study did not find saturation,
it was not possible to estimate a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>, which is about
5.8&nbsp;mM for the purified beef adrenal dopamine &beta;-oxidase.
<p>
In other experiments, MAO inhibitors were used to prevent
NE breakdown and were found to increase NE levels to 50-80%.
The rate of tyrosine and dopamine to NE conversion was not
affected by the presence of MAO inhibitors. Also, guinea pigs
were given diets deficient in ascorbic acid to produce scorbutic
hearts;  ascorbic acid is required by dopamine &beta;-oxidase.
Such hearts were found to contain 7 mg% ascorbic acid (may be
lower since the sensitivity of the assay is questionable in this
range) compared to the normal 64 mg%.  Despite reduced tissue levels,
there was no effect on NE synthesis, no matter what labeled precursor
was used in the perfusion medium.

The regulation of norepinephrine synthesis in sympathetic nerves:
Effect of nerve stimulation, cocaine, and catecholamine-releasing agents
<p class="Para1">
Hypogastric nerve-vas deferens from guinea pig was prepared and
maintained in a physiological medium and electrically stimulated, with
responses measured on a smoked paper kymograph.  Results show an increase
in norepinephrine and dopamine levels measured.  Formation of NE from
tyrosine was not enhanced by addition of 30 &micro;g/ml pheniprazine,
an MAO inhibitor;  instead NE production was reduced.  10 &micro;g/ml
tyramine also inhibited NE synthesis significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).
NE synthesis was increased 45% in the presence of tyramine during nerve
stimulation, somewhat (insignificantly) less than in the control group.
The effects of tyramine are complex in that it is both a
catecholamine-releasing agent and it is a competitive inhibitor
of MAO and dopamine &beta;-hydroxylase.  It also inhibits tyrosine
hydroxylation but apparently indirectly, i.e. not through TH since
it is a poor inhibitor of purified TH.
<p>
Guinea pigs were injected i.p. with 1 mg/kg reserpine 2 hr
before killing with the result that net formation of NE from
Tyr was markedly reduced and all newly formed amine found in
the medium.  Nerve stimulation increased NE synthetic rate 5-fold
however, exceeding that of controls.  The action of reserpine is
also complex since it blocks uptake of dopamine into storage vesicles
where dopamine &beta;-hydroxylase is present.
<p>
The presence of 10 &micro;g/ml cocaine did not impair NE synthesis,
but may have increased it, although not significantly.  Nerve
stimulation doubled NE synthesis over controls.
<p>
To explain the phenomena observed, one must take into account
synthesis, storage, release, and catabolism as factors involved in drug
action.  The concentration of free intraneuronal NE may be the one
regulating factor involved in controlling NE synthesis.  Stimulation via
depolarization of the nerve terminal leads to the egress of
free NE and a fall in intraneuronal concentration.  Cocaine prevents
the reuptake of both spontaneously released NE and NE released by
nerve stimulation:  the drop in intraneuronal free NE leads
to increased synthesis.  Pheniprazine, and to a lesser extent,
tyramine, induce a release of NE from storage vesicles and preserve
the increased intraneuronal free NE by their MAO inhibition:
this would not stimulate NE synthesis and would antagonize it
even more with nerve stimulation.  Reserpine prevents NE reuptake
into storage vesicles but does not act as an MAO inhibitor nor cause
an active release of NE from storage vesicles: the intraneuronal
free NE would fall a great deal during vesicle release seen in
nerve stimulation.  If it is true that free NE controls the
synthetic rate, artificial increases in extracellular NE should
lead to reduced NE synthesis.  We preincubated neurons with
<sup>3</sup>H-Tyr and then measured the presence of <sup>3</sup>H-dopamine
and <sup>3</sup>H-norepinephrine in the presence and absence of
1 &micro;g/ml NE, with and without nerve stimulation.  In the cases
where NE was present with and without nerve stimulation, the
production of these two catecholamines was lower than that of
the unstimulated control.

A kinetic study of bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Several Lineweaver-Burk plots are done to measure the various
substrates and cofactor performance with bovine adrenal TH.
First, the velocity is plotted against varying oxygen concentrations

Using this equation, we find a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for DMPH<sub>4</sub> and 
tyrosine to be 500 and 100 &micro;M, resp. This equation can be rearranged to 
express the reciprocal of the apparent Michaelis constant as a linear function 
of the reciprocal of the cofactor concentration, i.e., a plot of 
1/K<sub>B</sub>' vs. 1/[DMPH<sub>4</sub>] should be a straight line, and it is.
<p>
Plots of 1/<i>v</i> vs. [DOPA] (a Dixon plot) were done with different 
concentrations of DMPH<sub>4</sub>.  As DMPH<sub>4</sub> was increased, TH 
inhibition was markedly reduced.  A plot of 1/<i>v</i> vs 1/[Tyr] is also 
presented, by itself and with two different DOPA concentrations. The DOPA 
inhibition appears to be competitive with respect to changing [Tyr].  A 
1/<i>v</i> vs. 1/[DMPH<sub>4</sub>] plot was also done, with varying [Tyr]:  at 
high [DMPH<sub>4</sub>] but low [Tyr], the plot shows nonlinearity which is only 
corrected with higher [Tyr].
<p>
Fumaric acid is a product of tyrosine catabolism and known to activate dopamine 
&beta;-hydroxylase.  It is conceivable that such chemical changes could affect 
NE biosynthesis.  However, there was no observed effect on TH kinetics with 
Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup>, Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>, and 
fumaric acid at 10<sup>-2</sup> or 10<sup>&minus;1</sup> M.  ATP, ADP and 
acetylcholine likewise had not affect at 10 or 1000 &micro;M.
<p>
TH was incubated at 50&deg; and 55&deg; and its specific activity assessed over 
time of incubation.  When 5&nbsp;mM tyrosine or phenylalanine (also known to be a 
substrate) was included, there was a significantly decreased decline in the 
activity, indicating that these amino acids protected the enzyme.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>.  The kinetic data reveals that the substrates bind to TH in 
an obligatory sequential order rather than randomly. The steady state equation 
for an obligatory sequential mechanism with a quaternary complex predicts that 
if the concentration of the second substrate adding to the enzyme is saturating, 
a series of parallel lines as observed with TH is obtained in 1/<i>v</i> vs 
1/[tyrosine] plots;since oxygen.  A further consequence is that DOPA in the 
presence of saturating oxygen would be an uncompetitive inhibitor of either 
tyrosine or DMPH<sub>4</sub>.  The Dixon plot and 1/<i>v</i> vs 1/tyrosine plot 
show that DOPA inhibition is noncompetitive with tyrosine and competitive with 
DMPH<sub>4</sub>.
<p>
In determining the kinetic mechanism, oxygen can be eliminated since it is 
essentially saturating under assay conditions. Its effect is similar to that of 
the concentration of protons in a transaminase reaction.  The transaminase 
reaction sequence can be symbolized as:

The production of meta-tritiotyrosine from <i>p</i>-tritiophenylalanine
by phenylalanine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
This lab has shown that tyrosine with substantial amounts of
deuterium is the product of a bacterial phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)
when the substrate is para-deuterophenylalanine.  That is, the
para-substituent moves to another part of the molecule rather
than be separated from it.  Para-tritiophenylalanine was prepared
by treating <i>p</i>-chlorophenylalanine with <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O
in the presence of Pd/CaCO<sub>3</sub> catalyst in alcoholic KOH.
(This method works in the preparation of <i>p</i>-deuterophenylalanine
from <i>p</i>-bromophenylalanine as well.)  The
[p-<sup>3</sup>H]phenylalanine was purified using paper
chromatography with isopropanol:NH<sub>3</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O
(8:1:1) solvent, which particularly removes contaminating traces of
tyrosine.  A purified activated PAH from Pseudomonas or one from rat
(an ammonium sulfate fraction) were used.  Conversions were 120 min
at 30&deg; in air using 600 &micro;M 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropteridine,
100&nbsp;mM Tris, pH 7.3, and 4&nbsp;mM carrier
<span class="small-caps">l</span>-Phe.  Reactions were
stopped by immersion in boiling water for 2 min.  Following
centrifugation supernatants were developed on paper by chromatography
using solvent above.  Tyrosine was eluted from the paper and then
counted, and total Tyr determined by nitrosonaphthol methd.
40% of Phe is converted to Tyr, and the specific radioactivity
of Tyr was about 70% of the substrate specific radioactivity
with both enzymes.
<p>
The product radiotyrosine was also incubated with purified
adrenal TH , and equal amts of radiolabel were found in DOPA
and in water.  This was also found using [3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]tyrosine.
If the meta-location of tyrosine is radiolabeled, one expects equal
amts of label in DOPA and in the water.  The indication is that
hydroxylation of Phe means that the para-substituent of Phe moves
to meta-positions in Tyr product.
<p>
Tyrosine from the PAH reactions was iodinated by N-iodosuccinimide
using the Oswald reaction, in which iodination occurs on
meta-positions of phenols like Tyr (an 80% yield is usually
obtained).  Reaction mixtures are acidified and passed over Dowex-50.
Tritium released by iodination is estimated by counting water passing
through the column.  Results show most radioacitivity is released
by the iodination reaction.  As a control, [3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]tyrosine
behaves during iodination in the same manner.
<p>
Based on this data, a mechanism is proposed by which hydroxylation
of phenylalanine occurs:
<p class="center">
<img src="./THLitDrawings/Phe-hydroxylation-mech.gif"
 alt="Phenylalanine hydroxylation mechanism">
<p>
This mechanism accounts for why half of any isotope of hydrogen
would remain on the substrate molecule in the product, and why
half would become part of the solvent.  A slight isotopic mass
effect would be expected, especially for hydrogen isotopes.

Evaluation of the Biochemical Effects Produced <i>in Vivo</i> by Inhibitors
of the Three Enzymes Involved in Norepinephrine Biosynthesis
<p class="Para1">
Hartley guinea pigs (230-260 g) fasted the night before to limit tyrosine.
Animals were givem drugs IP and radiolabled tyrosine was injected IV.
<p>
Tyrosine is known to rapidly equilibrate with the pool in tissues when
injected, maximal labeling of catecholamines occurring in 2 h.  The rate
of labeling should be dependent upon the endogenous tyrosine.  Inhibitors
to the three enzymes in the pathway were injected into animals 30 min before
injection of radiotyrsoine and the animals sacrificed at 90 min after
the tyrosine.  Inhibitor of TH injected were &alpha;-methyltyrosine (100
mg/kg) and &alpha;-methylphenylalanine (200 mg/kg).  Inhibitors of
DOPA decarboxylase were
&alpha;-methyl-<span class="small-caps">dl</span>-dopahydrazine
(&alpha;-MDH) and 3-hydroxy-4-bromobenzyloxyamine (NSD-1055) (200 mg/kg).
Dopamine &beta;-oxidase is inhibited by NSD-1055, benzyloxyamine (BOA)
(200 mg/kg), and antabuse (400 mg/kg).  Only the TH inhibitors actually
lowered the norepinephrine and dopamine content of the brain; there was
no effect on total levels of NE in heart or spleen, or epinephrine in the
adrenal gland.
<p>
Distinct from measuring total levels, differences in radioactivity between
treated and the control were measured (as a percent reduction) when
[U-<sup>14</sup>C]tyrosine was injected as a precursor.
&alpha;-methylTyr had shut down the radiolabeling of
catecholamines in all tissues (&gt;90% reduction in labeling),
and &alpha;-methylPhe reduced radiolabeling by just over half
(55-869% reduction).  Being both a DOPA decarboxylase and
dopamine &beta;-oxidase inhibitor, NSD-1055 caused very significant (70-80%)
reduction in NorEpi of heart and spleen, DA of brain, and Epi of adrenal,
but no effect at all in brain NorEpi.
<p>
[<sup>3</sup>H]DOPA was injected as a radiolabel precuror instead, and the
effect of the inhibitors measured.  Because labeled DOPA is used, one
expects no effect of inhibition from TH inhibitors.  There was, in fact,
a major increase in radiolabel incorporation in the catecholamines of tissues
when TH is inhibited:  this is because the radiolabeled DOPA becomes a
significant fraction of total DOPA since no new DOPA is synthesized, and
the exogenous DOPA is the radioactive source.  The use of inhibitors of
DDC and DBH  clearly had an effect to reduce radiolabel incorporation.
NSD-1055 had a large effect.  BOA, which did not have any effect on
reducing with radiotyrosine, did reduce label significantly in all but
adrenal Epi.
<p>
The specific radioactivity of tyrosine and DOPA were evaluated to see
if there were any dilutional changes.  For tyrosine values ranged from
140,000-180,000 cpm/&micro;mol in hearts and 200,000-240,000 cpm/&micro;mol in
brains.  With &alpha;-methylTyr inhibition, specific radioactivity was
not measurable because of fluorescence interference.  Tyr specific
activity was slightly higher in hearts and brains of &alpha;-MDH-treated
animals.
<p>
&alpha;-MethylTyr can inhibit TH and deplete the tissues of catecholamines.
However it can be metabolized to &alpha;-methyldopa, and this can deplete
tissues by a different mechanism involving conversion to false transmitter
&alpha;-methylnorepinephrine.  Animals dosed with inhibitor were sacrificed
at various time intervals and the amount of tyrosine and &alpha;-methylTyr
evaluated.  Minimal levels of catecholamines as a percent of normal were
reached in 8-16 h, and climbed back to normal about 36 h.  Calculations
were made based on what was known for the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and
<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> for tyrosine substrate and the inhibitor for both
brain and heart tissues, and these correlated very well with the measured
levels, as shown by plots of %catecholamine synthesis in vivo vs time for
both tissues.
<p>
Animals were given [<sup>3</sup>H]&alpha;-methyltyrosine and then sacrificed
at intervals from 0 to 48 h.  Tissues were isolated and
&alpha;-methylnorepinephrine added as nonradioactive carrier for
tracking this amine by paper chromatography.  The time of the rise and
fall of &alpha;-methylnorepinephrine and of &alpha;-methylTyr, as well as
the stoichiometry of these substances, did not match the changes seen in
catecholamines.  Thus, &alpha;-methyldopa and -methylnorepinephrine do
not factor in catecholamine changes.

Enzymatic conversion of 5-tritiotryptophan to 4-tritio-5-hydroxytryptophan
<p class="Para1">
[5-<sup>3</sup>H]Tryptophan was prepared as a substrate for
kinetic studies on its hydroxylation to produce 5-hydroxytryptophan
(5HTP).  This could be done by using
5-bromo-<span class="small-caps">dl</span>-tryptophan and
reducing it with tritium gas, then purifying using a Beckman-Spinco
Model 120 amino acid analyzer (0.95 x 52 cm PA-28 column eluting
with 0.2 M citrate pH 4.2).
<p>
It was expected that release of tritium to water would match
hydroxylation.  However enzyme from neoplastic mast cells showed
that tryptophan hydroxylation measured by a colorimetric procedure
was 4-20 times greater than release of tritium.
<p>
In determining the position of tritium in the indole ring,
several techniques were used.  The tritiated Trp was brominated
with 2-3 equivalents of N-bromosuccinimide in acetate, pH 5.0.
Hydrogen at the 2 and 5 positions are displaced, and there is
an 87% loss of label in the product.  Work elsewhere shows that
[5-<sup>3</sup>H]Trp conversion to actinomycin by <i>Streptomyces
antibioticus</i> results in 80-90% of radioactivity being located
in the 4 or 5 positions.  Deuterated Trp prepared in the identical
manner was assayed by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and at least 90% of
<sup>2</sup>H was found at the 5 position.
<p>
[4-<sup>3</sup>H]-5-Hydroxy-<span style="font-style:oblique;">dl</span>-tryptophan
was prepared by dissolving 4.4 mg (20 &micro;mol) of
5-hydroxy-<span style="font-style:oblique;">dl</span>-tryptophan
in 0.3&nbsp;ml of 30 mCi <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.2&nbsp;ml DMF
with 20 &micro;L triethylamine, then heating the solution for 3 h in
a sealed tube under nitrogen at 65&deg;.  The reaction was diluted
and lyophilized, and the product further prepared by paper
electrophoresis in pyridine adjusted to pH 6.5 with acetic acid;
the zone was extracted with water and lyophilized.  Tryptophan
hydroxylase was prepared from mouse neoplastic mast cells suspended
in equal volume 50&nbsp;mM TrisHCl, pH 6.8 with 10&nbsp;mM mercaptoethanol
and 0.25&nbsp;mM ferrous ammonium sulfate, which were passed through
French press and the homogenate centrifuged at 100,000 g for 60 min,
with the 60% ammonium sulfate fraction of the supernatant used.
To isolate [5-<sup>3</sup>H]hydroxytryptophan,
1.5&nbsp;ml 10% ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and 1.5&nbsp;ml 1
<span class="small-caps">n</span> NaOH were added to
5&nbsp;ml reaction mixture and the precipitate removed by spinning.
Supernatant is adjusted to pH 3.5 with acetic acid and passed
through Dowex-50 with pH 3.2.  Resin is washed, and amino acids
eluted with 0.35 M citrate, pH 5.2.  Eluate is lyophilized and
inorganic salts removed with ethanol-acetone-water (1:10:1) at 0&deg;.
After evaporation amino acids are separated on 0.9 x 25 cm PA-35 column
mounted on Beckman-Spinco 120C amino acid analyzer using a 0.35 M citrate,
pH 5.2 eluent.  5-Hydroxyindoles and Trp can be measured fluorometrically.
<p>
Three experiments with mast cell enzyme and [5-<sup>3</sup>H]Trp
were done.  5HTP was measured colorimetrically and showed 150,
120, and 140 &micro;mol.  However, the yield of <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O
was only 8, 11, and 33 &micro;mol, resp., from those experiments, meaning
only 5-20% of tritium was released.  Separation of product from
substrate by ion-exchange chromatography indicated most of radioactivity
was with the 5HTP product, and that without enzyme and cofactors,
it was with unconverted substrate.  Hence, tritium is not being
released during hydroxylation.  Treatment of 5HTP with 10% TCA
for 4 h at RT shows most of radioactivity has been lost from 5HTP,
and tritium was found in high levels in water.
<p>
It has been demonstrated that the hydrogen in the 4-position of 5HTP
is labile and exchanges in acidic solution with the medium.  5HTP
formed from enzymatic hydroxylation of [5-<sup>3</sup>H]Trp and
[4-<sup>3</sup>H]5HTP prepared synthetically were compared
kinetically for the extent of reaction producing released
tritium under a variety of conditions.  At 60 min in 10% TCA,
both released 100% of tritium.  In 0.1 N sulfuric acid for 10 h,
the synthetic cmpd released 83%, the enzymatic 78%.  In KCl-HCl
at pH 1.2 for 10 h, both released 72%.  For 4 h at pH 2.5 to 9.0,
both released &lt; 10%. At 0.8 N ammonium hydroxide for 60 min,
both released 66% of label.  And in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide,
the synthetic released 68% while the enzymatic released 60%.
Hence, the enzymatic product is likely to be identical to the
synthetic product.  A mechanism for the retention of tritium to
the product is given below.
<p class="center">
   <img src="./THLitDrawings/tryptophan-NIH-shift.gif"

<p>
A hydroxide cation adds to the 5 position in I to make II.  If there is not a 
concerted action which combines a substituent shift to 4 with simultaneous loss 
of its substituent such that II goes to IV, then the intermediate at III is 
likely.  From III there is either a stereospecific removal of hydrogen or there 
is a very signficant isotope effect.

Hydroxylation-induced migrations of tritium in several substrates
of liver aryl hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
5-Tritiosalicylic acid (127 kcpm/&micro;mol) was incubated with rabbit
liver microsomes and hydroxylated.  The gentisic acid product showed
a specific radioactivity of 5630 cpm/&micro;mol, indicating 4.4% of
label wasretained.  <i>N</i>-acetyl-[3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]tyramine
(11,800 dpm/&micro;mol) was hydroxylated to <i>N</i>-acetyldopamine,
then <i>O</i>-methylated to <i>N</i>-acetyl-3-<i>O</i>-methyldopamine
in the presence of microsomes and
[<sup>14</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>]-<i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine
(4000 dpm/&micro;mol).  The product methyl-dopamine had specific
tritium of 5200 dpm/&micro;mol and a specific carbon-14 of 4000
dpm/&micro;mol.  Hence the methylation was not done by any other
methylating agent other than S-adenosylmethionine, but half
the tritium was lost.
<p>
Retention of label of label during hydroxylation is pH-dependent.
Rat and rabbit liver microsomes yielded the same results in
experiments conducted at pH 7.0 or 8.0.  The retention was
always greater at the lower pH.
<p>
Tritiated aniline and acetanilide were also compared for
retention.  With aniline, only 12% of label is retained
during hydroxylation, but with the acetanilide, half of the label
is retained.
<p>
The ring hydroxylation of amphetamine by liver microsomes
has not been reported, although Axelrod reported that a liver
microsome enzyme oxidatively deaminates amphetamine to form
phenylacetone.  [4-<sup>3</sup>H]Amphetamine (3.95 Mcpm/&micro;mol)
was incubated either with rabbit or rat liver microsomes, but only
trace amts of a p-hydroxyamphetamine were found:  0.002% at pH 7 in
phosphate with rat liver.  Multiple incubations were pooled and the
specific activity found was 2.86 Mcpm/&micro;mol, about 80% retention.
Much large amts of another product nonhydroxylated were obtained,
which had the chromatographic characteristics of
[4-<sup>3</sup>H]phenylacetone.  When administered to rats in vivo
however, 4-hydroxyamphetamine was the major metabolite, with a
specific tritium of 3.6 Mcpm/&micro;mol, meaning 91% retention.
The radioactivity accounted for 30% of the total administered.
<p>
These studies demonstrate a novel mechanism in electrophilic
aromatic substitution, featuring a ring substituent migration now
called the &quot;NIH shift.&quot;  Such shifts occur only in the
environment of the enzyme, if they occur at all.  The ability
of the cationic intermediate to stabilize the charge via resonance
and the availability of nonbonded electron pairs will dictate
whether migration/shift is favored, or whether the final product
requires loss of label without shift.

Hydroxylation-induced migration: the NIH shift. Recent experiments
reveal an unexpected and general result of enzymatic hydroxylation
of aromatic compounds
<p class="Para1">
It has been shown that enzymatic oxidation of 3,4-dimethylphenol
forms 4,5-dimethylcatechol in which oxygen comes directly from O<sub>2</sub>
and not H<sub>2</sub>O, which contrasted with current theory suggesting
oxygen had no role.  In classical organic chemistry, addition of
a cationic substituent to an aromatic ring involves
electrophilic substitution of the substituent at the same position.
In the enzymatic system, the substituent hydrogen atom appears
to be shifted to an adjacent carbon on the ring, a shift called
the &quot;NIH shift.&quot;
<p>
[4-<sup>2</sup>H]-<span class="small-caps">dl</span>-Phenylalanine
was prepared from 4-bromo-<span class="small-caps">dl</span>-Phe
by reductive deuteration.  Deuterated product was degraded
to benzoic acid, and the position of <sup>2</sup>H at the
4-position confirmed by NMR, showing an A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> pattern
in the spectrum.  A mass spectrum of
[4-<sup>2</sup>H]-<span class="small-caps">dl</span>-Phe
also confirmed a single deuterium atom per molecule.  The deteurated
Phe was used as substrate for bacterial phenylalanine hydroxylase,
and the tyrosine product isolated.  60-70% of <sup>2</sup>H was
found in the Tyr product.  Studies with tritiated Phe showed similar
results.The tritiated Tyr was purified and then used as a substrate
to tyrosine hydroxylase:  about half the tritium was found in the
water, and half in the product DOPA.  When tritiated Tyr was treated
with N-iodosuccinimide, which exhaustively iodinates the ring para to
the hydroxyl group, all of the tritium was removed from the ring and
found in the solvent.  Hence the hydrogen isotopes at the 4-position
<i>shift</i> to the 3-position rather than be substituted.
<p>
When [3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]Phe is subjected to PAH, a tyrosine product
shows the same specific radioactivity as the substrate, meaning
there is no loss of tritium from the ring.  4-Chlorophenylalanine
is also hydroxylated by PAH, but forms <i>three</i> different
products.  85% (Most) is 3-chlorotyrosine (3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylalanine),
indicating a shift of the chlorine atom to the 3-position.
10% is just tyrosine, in which an expected electrophilic
aromatic substitution actually occurs, with loss of the Cl atom.
Less than 5% is 4-chloro-3-hydroxyphenylalanine, in which
hydroxylation occurs, but at the 3-position, while the 4-position
chlorine is not substituted at all (there is probably an
intermediate cation, but the shift is the hydroxyl rather than the
chlorine atom).  Note that studies with 4-fluoroPhe show total
conversion to tyrosine, with total substitution of the F atom;
with 4-bromoPhe, however, three products are similarly formed
as when the halogen is chlorine.
<p>
With hydroxylation of tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase,
at least 85% of the tritium is retained but in the 4-position when
the substrate is [5-<sup>3</sup>H]Trp.  Note it is to the 4- and
not to the para 6-position!  When [4-<sup>3</sup>H]Trp is
the substrate instead, there is also no loss of tritium.
The shift from the 5-position almost certainly occurs, but
a signficant isotope effect determines with hydrogen isotope
leaves the 4-position.
<p>
Acetanilide labeled with deuterium or tritium at 4-position and
used as a substrate for rabbit liver microsomal aryl hydroxylase
produces an acetanilide hydroxylated at 4-position and
with the label shifted to 3-position in 15% of product
for <sup>2</sup>H-labeled and 45% for <sup>3</sup>H-labeled.
The amount of label lost to the medium was heavily dependent
on the pH of the reaction, with retention higher when the pH
was lower.  For example, retention of tritium was 67% at
pH 6.2 and 37% at pH 9.0.  This was true whether the oxygenase
was from rat or rabbit liver microsomes.  The shift was also
dependent directly upon enzyme action:  unconverted substrate
retained its label at the 4-position, indicating no shift
resulting from nonenzymatic side effects.  Moreover,
the substrate retained its original specific radioactivity.
Use of 3,5-labeled acetanilide confirmed results
with 3,5-labeled Phe:  hydroxylation at 4-position results
in no loss of label at either 3- or 5-position.
<p>
Other substrates were tried with the liver aryl oxygenase,
which has a broad substrate specificity.  [4-<sup>3</sup>H]amphetamine
retains in its hydroxylated product 90% of label.  On the
other hand, [5-<sup>3</sup>H]salicylic acid conversion to
gentisic acid and N-acetyl-[3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]tyramine
to its hydroxylated product retains little to no tritium.
Living rats were administered [4-<sup>3</sup>H]amphetamine
and the [4-<sup>3</sup>H]acetanilide, and the hydroxylated
glucuronides were recovered, which possessed 90% and 38%, resp.,
of the substrate's original specific radioactivity.
<b>With TH, [3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]tyrosine is converted DOPA
that has half the specific radioactivity, meaning that one
tritium molecule has been lost.</b> When [4-<sup>3</sup>H]tyrosine
is used, all the DOPA retains the label.
<p>
The action of enzymatic hydroxylation is not limited to hydrogen
atom shifts.  Whole alkyl side chains are observed to shift,
such as the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid
to homogentisic acid by its oxidase.
<p>
Nonenzymatic EAS with labeled aromatic ring substituents never
involves the shifting seen in the enzymatic hydroxylation.
Bromination, nitration, diazonium coupling, and Friedel-Crafts
akylation and acylation all show the label being lost.
Other conditions can cause a shift however.  At elevated
temperatures, aluminum halide-mediated reaction can cause
shift of halogens: chlorine and bromine migrate, but fluorine
does not.  4-substituted phenols subjected to oxidation by
Caro's reagent (a source of HO<sup>+</sup> cations) or
with Pb(OOCCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> can produce
hydroquinones substituted at the 2-position:  here electrophilic
agents contain an unshared electron pair which is
available to stabilize the charge formed in the
transition state.  Oxidation of prehnitene (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene)
with trifluoroperacetic acid (a source of HO<sup>+</sup> cations) in
presence of BF<sub>3</sub> results in methyl group shift:
<p class="center">
  <img src="./THLitDrawings/prehnitene-oxy-mech.gif"
   alt="prehnitene oxidation mechanism">

<p>The methyl shift is to either position para to the
carbon-oxygen bond in the ring, although one expects a more favorable
production of II over I due to steric effects and oxygen
electronegativity.Various other oxidation systems, including
the Hamilton (JACS 88: 5266, 1966) system of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
and catalytic amts of catechol and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, or the Fenton with
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with EDTA and Fe<sup>2+</sup> (Breslow &amp;
Lukens, JBC 235: 292, 1960) or Udenfriend (JBC 208: 741, 1954) with
ascorbic acid, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and O<sub>2</sub>, show that
hydroxylation without retention (shift) occurs.
<p>
In a concerted substitution of neighboring hydrogen with label shift,
the enzyme is a necessary participant, providing the environment
for the NIH shift via an enzyme side chain that provides a basic
and possibly anionic group that abstracts the hydrogen on the
adjacent carbon on the ring (see left-side figure below).
Experiments with [3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]Phe, [4-<sup>3</sup>H]Trp,
and [3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]acetanilide argue against this mechanism
however, since label at this position would necessarily be
abstracted, and this is not observed.
<p class="center">
  <img src="./THLitDrawings/enzymatic-NIH-shift.gif"
   alt="enzyme-mediate NIH shift">
<p>
With a cyclohexadienyl cation intermediate, the tritium
(label) is at the 3-position, whether the tritium shifts there from the
4-position or is there originally.  Hence retention of tritium during
re-aromatization depends on the strength of the carbon-tritium bond
relative to a carbon-hydrogen bond.
<p>
Retention vs. loss of label largely depends on how the cationic
charge can be stabilized, and whether migration serves that
ability.  For 5-tritiosalicylic acid, a para-quinoid intermediate is
favored because the 2-hydroxyl group can tautomerize to a keto form:
the tritium would not migrate since an intermediate with good
resonance/conjugation would be disrupted.  Ultimately tritium
loss would be favored.  With 4-tritioacetanilide, the para-nitrogen
provides a nonbonded base pair for resonance of the intermediate, but
suffiicient electron density is sufficient to stabilize the cationic charge
ortho to hydroxylation, and so migration-with-retention is favored
about half the time.
<p>
With 4-tritioPhe or 4-tritioamphetamine, there is no oxygen or
nitrogen to contribute a nonbonded pair in resonance stabilization
and which might hinder migration.  The cationic charge is better
stabilized by migration when alkyl side chains form other
substituents to the ring, as with these substances.  This is why
tritium is retained as a result of the migration.
<p>
Why do nonenzymatic reactions differ with respect to products
and the proportions in which they occur.  A good example is
what happens with hydroxylation of 4-chlorophenylalanine.
The enzyme may alter the kinetics by which one intermediate
is formed over another, even before the hydroxyl cation attack.
In a nonenzymatic environment, atoms are left to themselves
to behave according to their electronegativity and their ability
to contribute nonbonded valence electron pairs to provide energy
minima.  Enzymes provide atoms with electronegativities and
nonbonded pairs which temporarily become part of the molecule
and the reaction.  The reaction scheme shows that hydroxylation
of 4-chloroPhe can form at least 4 different products, with one
essentially identical to the substrate (although the intermediate
was hydroxylated).  The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds along one
path (or perhaps all possible products), while the catalyzed
kinetically favors/promotes another.

Intramolecular migrations of aryl substituents during enzymatic hydroxylation
<p class="Para1">
The NIH shift of para-substituents to adjacent positions has
been shown for both enzymatic and nonenzymatic hydroxylations.
This shift occurs for any hydrogen isotope, the halogens chlorine
and bromine (but not fluorine), and for methyl substituents through
the action of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).  PAH from either
Pseudomonas or mammalian liver can hydroxylate 4-methylPhe to
two major products: 3-methyltyrosine, where the alkyl shift is
evident, and 4-hydroxymethylphenylalanine, in which the alkyl
substituent is directly hydroxylated.  There are also
other examples of alkyl hydroxylation by aryl oxygenases.
Migrations do not occur with chlorine or fluorine in
4-haloacetanilides treated with rabbit microsomes.  Migrations
have been reported in chloro and bromo forms of 4-haloacetanilides
in benzpyrene-treated rat microsomes.  When alkyl substituents are
halogenated (4-trifluoromethylPhe), migration of alkyl group does
not occur.
<p>
Studies with [4-<sup>2</sup>H]chlorobenzene show several
products.One product is [2-<sup>2</sup>H]-4-chlorophenol
in which 54% of D is retained and the shift occurs.  Another
is N-acetylmethionine (from S-adenosylmethionine methylation)
in which only 2% of D is retained, and no shift is likely.
A 4-chlorocyclohexadiene-<i>trans</i>-1,2-diol will lead to
aromatization with no migration and loss of label to form 4-chlorocatechol,
which can be methylated to 4-chloro-2-methoxyphenol, still missing label.
However, if the cyclohexadienediol is treated with 1
<span class="small-caps">n</span> HCl at 100&deg;, the
hydroxyl can be induced to leave, and a migration of the D label to the
2-position occurs 23% of the time.

Studies on tyrosine hydroxylase from bovine adrenal medulla
<p class="Para1">
A small amount of medulla was homogenized and centrifuged at
ultraspeeds in sucrose.  90% of the activity was recovered in
the particulate portion of the centrifuged homogenate.  Attempts
at solubilizing the particulate activity with acetone powdering
were not successful although no activity was lost with a variety
of extraction methods, such as use of butanol, sonic oscillation,
repeated freezing and thawing, detergents, lipase, or DNase.
Trypsin treatment of the acetone powder or particulate material
did liberate the enzyme, although it requires an optimal concentration
of trypsin since too much cause inactivation (3.7 &micro;g trypsin
to 1 mg particulate protein is optimal).
<p>
Purification of the enzyme was done as follows:  glands were
harvested and stored frozen at -70&deg;, which could be done
for several months easily.  Glands were homogenized in a VirTis
blender in 0.25 M sucrose and filtered through cheesecloth.
The homogenate was spinned at ultra high speeds and the particulate
recovered.  The particulate is washed with 0.1 M phosphate, pH 6.5
and re-centrifuged at ultra high speed.  The second particulate was
solubilized in 0.2 M phosphate, pH 6.5 and this was subjected to
trypsin treatment.  After termination with trypsin inhibitor and
overnight storage at -70&deg;, the digest was centrifuged and the
supernatant collected.  Fractionation with ammonium sulfate between
25% and 45%, followed by resuspension in 20&nbsp;mM phosphate
buffer, dialysis in same, and then another ultra high speed spin
completes the preparation.
<p>
Characterization of the enzyme included looking at the
presence of reducing agents, in which 2-mercaptoethanol
had already been shown to be necessary.  Ascorbic acid was 25
times more effective in the same amount than mercaptoethanol,
but at very great concentrations it inhibits the TH.  Also
ascorbic acid contributed significantly to a high background.
Use of ascorbic acid did not eliminate the need for pteridine
cofactor or FeSO<sub>4</sub> (used in these reactions).
Use of NADPH and pteridine reductase as shown to substitute
for mercaptoethanol and for iron.  This particular use was
inhibited by the iron chelator &alpha;,&alpha;&acute;-dipyridyl.

<p>Other metal salts (MgSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>,
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, CdSO<sub>4</sub>,
(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Cr, CuSO<sub>4</sub>,
NiSO<sub>4</sub>, BaCl<sub>2</sub>, (CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Co,
or (CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Pb) were tried in equimolar amounts
and gave no activation.  15 &micro;M FeSO<sub>4</sub> was sufficient
to cause half-maximal activation (max. at 500 &micro;M). Including
Fe<sup>3+</sup> salt in the assay did not affect the measurement
of TH activity, although preincubation of the enzyme with this
salt did cause inactivation, whether Fe<sup>2+</sup> was also
present or not.  Incubation with Fe<sup>2+</sup> not only prevented
inactivation in the acetate buffer, but resulted in a higher
activity.
<p>
Sulfhydryl reagents could be used to see the dependence of
Fe<sup>2+</sup> binding to sulfhydryl amino acids.  Mercaptoethanol
is replaced by ascorbic acid for the purpose of assay.
With HgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid),
and <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide there is almost complete inhibition.
Addition of Fe<sup>2+</sup> did not prevent the action of these
reagents.  Other inhibitors of TH were tested:  as previously
reported, tyrosine analogues (3-iodo-<span class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine, alpha-methyltyrosine)
were competitive with tyrosine and the catechols and their analogues
(norepinephrine, epinephrine, alpha-propyldihydroxylphenylacetamide)
were competitive with the pteridine cofactor.

Isotope studies on the mechanism of action of adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Tyrosine hydroxylase not only catalyzes mono-oxidation of
tyrosine at the 3-position to form DOPA.  It also can oxidized
Phe at the 4-position to make tyrosine itself.  It has been
demonstrated that enzymatic hydroxylations are accompanied by
&quot;NIH shifts&quot; where 4-substituents migrate to adjacent
positions on the ring.  The action of TH on a Tyr substrate may
not in fact be directed to the 3-position, but instead to the
4-position (as with Phe as substrate), in which the 4-OH group
already present migrates to 3-OH as part of the cationic intermediate.
<p>
RESULTS.  Phe was treated with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)
in the presence of <sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.
The Tyr product contained a 59.0 atom-percent excess of the
oxygen-18 isotope in the phenolic oxygen.  Leakage from the
flask occurred during the incubation, and the <sup>18</sup>O
content could only be estimated to have a mean value of 80
atom-percent excess, and the amount in Tyr is significantly
lower.  Oxygen was unlikely to come from water since other
work with H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O shows no incorporated
isotope.  At any rate, it is not necessary to explain this
dilutional effect to support the main hypothesis of the work.
<p>
Incorporation of <sup>18</sup>O into DOPA from the action
of TH is seen to be lower than expected on the basis of atom
oxygen-18 excess in the precursors.  Unreacted Tyr was purified
after incubation and found to contain the original 59 atom-percent
excess.  The DOPA was enzymatically methylated at the 3-position
and decarboxylated to produced 3-methoxytyramine.  This was then
subjected to periodate oxidation to methanol and dopachrome.
The methanol could then be subjected to mass spectrometry.
The data on oxygen-18 atom-percent excess indicates that the
oxygen at the 3-position comes strictly from the O<sub>2</sub>
during the reaction, and that none comes from the 4-OH group.
Hence there is no NIH shift.

Isolation and characterization of a tyrosine hydroxylase cofactor
from bovine adrenal medulla
<p class="Para1">
TH was prepared from bovine adrenal medulla by the method of
Nagatsu et al.  The assay system was adjusted since the
concentrations of DMPH<sub>4</sub>, while saturating, were far above the
physiological range reported.  A NADPH-sheep liver dihydropteridine
reductase system is used to regenerate the reduced cofactor necessary
for the reaction.  Various amounts of reductase were incubated with
two different levels of DMPH<sub>4</sub> cofactor over a 2 h period.
With reductase added, DOPA formation increases 100% in 30 min and
350% in 60 min.
<p>
Bovine glands were obtained and extracted in a blender in 4 vols water,
and an equal volume of boiling water added to the homogenate,
allowing the mixture to remain &gt;90&deg; for 5 min.  Some homogenates
were brought to 3% TCA, and TCA was routinely used when it was discovered
that the amount of cofactor present was not affected by TCA addition.
Denatured material is centrifuged and the remaining steps carried out
in the dark (or subdued light) at 3-5&deg;.  The pH of the yellow
supntnt. was adjusted to 5.0 with 1 N sulfuric acid and loaded on to a
4 &times; 20 cm Florisil (60/100) column.  The column was rinsed with
3% acetic acid (1 L), then water (1.5-2 L).  Pterins were eluted with
20% acetone at a low flow rate.  A fluorescence spectrum consistent
with 6-alkyl-substituted pterins was observed in the eluate.
<p>
The eluate was applied to a 2 x 10 cm Dowex 50-X8 (H<sup>+</sup>)
column, which was rinsed with 250&nbsp;ml water, 250&nbsp;ml of
0.05 N HCl, 250&nbsp;ml water, then finally 0.05 M ammonium hydroxide.
The ammonium hydroxide fractions were further prepared with descending
paper chromatography (on Whatman No. 3MM) and analyzed by same
(Whatman No. 1).  Initial studies showed revealed the presence of
4-6 spots on chromatograms, all exhibiting a blue fluorescence
(450 nm).  After catalytic hydrogenation, 4-6 other bands showed
no cofactor activity.  These spots were all the cofactor in various
oxidation states.

Allosteric activation of hypothalamic tyrosine hydroxylase by
ions and sulfated mucopolysaccharides
<p class="Para1">
Canine brains were obtained within 20 min of sacrifice of the animals
and the hypothalamus and thalamus dissected free.  Tissues were
homogenized in ice-cold 2 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7) and extracts
spun 35,000 <i>g</i> for 20 min.  Solid ammonium sulfate was added
to 144 mg/ml to the supernatant (25% satn), and the pellet obtained
after stirring 30 min using the same spin conditions.  The supernatant
was brought to 45% saturation (125 mg salt added per ml), stirred 30 min,
then spun in the same way.  The pellet was resuspended 90% saturated
(3.6 M) ammonium sulfate and stored at 4&deg;.  (Storable for at least
one month under these conditions.)  When needed portions were taken
and dissolved in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and dialyzed
against 100 volumes prior to use.
<p>
With ammonium sulfate fraction there were apparent increases in the
total activity of TH.  Dialysis eliminated this apparent activation.
Replacing the standard Tris-acetate (110 mM) buffer salt with 5 mM
histidine reduced TH activity by 50%, which was reversed by adding
either His or Tris-acetate to 110 mM.  Hence the activation was
dependent upon ionic strength.   Addition of KCl, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl,
and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> all showed activation
effects as well, with ammonium sulfate showing the greatest.  Also
showing some degree of activation with ionic strength increases were
NaCl, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.
A pattern indicating that sulfate salts generally showed the greatest
degree of activation was found.
<p>
Mucopolysaccharides were tested as well.  Hyalouronic acid showed
no effect of activation, and the effect of chondroitin sulfate was
only slight (25%).  But the greatest dramatic effect on activation was
with heparin (3-fold, with very low concentrations).  Half-maximal
activation was seen with 5.8 &micro;g heparin/ml, and the apparent
<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> is 0.35 &micro;M (assumes 16,000 MW).  The Hill
plot slope gave an <i>n</i><sub>H</sub> of 1.9.
<p>
Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to characterize activiation, with
varying tyrosine concentrations using the DMPH<sub>4</sub> cofactor.
The apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine was not changed in
either ammonium sulfate (0.353 M) or heparin (28.6 mg/ml), while
both effectors increased the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.  Ammonium sulfate
had no effect on the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for DMPH<sub>4</sub>, but
the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the cofactor in heparin fell from 770 &micro;M
to 105 &micro;M.  Neither of these substances affected the requirement
for FeSO<sub>4</sub>.

Rat brain tyrosine hydroxylase.  Activation by limited tryptic proteolysis
<p class="Para1">
Rat striatal TH was prepared as a soluble protein from extracts
of tissue, and then treated with trypsin similar to the conditions used by
Mussachio et al (1971).  Unlike the results of Petrack et al. (1968),
TH activity or apparent MW was not affected by trypsin level or length
of incubation.  TH activity was measured vs. trypsin concentration
(30 min incubation) and vs. time (150 &micro;g trypsin/mg protein) and
the figures indicated that a trypsin concentration of 200 &micro;g/ml
(1 mg/ml sample protein) and a time of 30 min both gave maximal
activation.  However the activity fell rapidly with higher
concentrations of trypsin and longer incubation times.A 2-3-fold
activation was observed in general in both the protease dose and time
courses.  Increasing or decreasing the ratio of trypsin to protein
cause a decrease or increase, resp., in the time required to achieve
maximal activation.
<p>
MW determinations using sucrose density gradients with a standard
of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (MW 151,000; <i>s</i><sub>20,w</sub> = 7.6 S)
as a reference.  Native TH sedimented to <i>s</i><sub>20,w</sub> = 9.2 S.
Using the relationship of
(s<sub>1</sub>/s<sub>2</sub>)=(MW<sub>1</sub>/MW<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2/3</sup>,
a molecular weight of 200,000 &plusmn; 8,000 is calculated from a mean
of three determinations.  Trypsin treatment resulted in a decrease in
sedimentation to 3.7 S and a reduction in MW of 49,600 &plusmn; 400,
or one-fourth of the native enzyme.  The effect of time of trypsin
treatment on the changes in activity of the 3.7 S species was
measured as well.  With the amount of trypsin being 15% by weight
of the weight of TH, maximal activation of the 3.7 S species occurred
within 30 min.
<p>
TH activity was also measured against the use of mucopolysaccharide
heparin.  Of the control native TH, heparin is observed to activate
the enzyme almost 3-fold.  On the other hand, trypsin-treated TH in
the presence of heparin is observed to be inhibited markedly.
A control incubation with chondroitin sulfate shows no changes
in activity either way.  Heparin inhibition shows no signs of
cooperativity in the trypsin-treated TH and has a Hill slope of 1.15.
Sucrose density gradient separation of the 9.2 S species also showed
it to be activated by heparin whereas the 3.7 S species was inhibited
by the mucopolysaccharide.
<p>
Incubation of TH in the presence of 0.5&nbsp;mM tyrosine and
1.1&nbsp;mM DMPH<sub>4</sub> during the trypsin time course
showed that the phenomenon diminished in its extent, namely
that an alteration of <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for one or both
compounds was occurring.  To assess these effects, TH treated
with trypsin had a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine which was
5-fold less than the native TH (10 &micro;M compared to 50 &micro;M).
In the native enzyme, heparin increases the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
of the enzyme without affecting the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine.
After pretreatment with trypsin, heparin acts as a competitive
inhibitor for tyrosine (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 19 &micro;g/ml).  The
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for DMPH<sub>4</sub> for the native enzyme was
found to be 760 &micro;M.  Addition of 40 &micro;g/ml resulted in
a 10-fold decrease in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the cofactor while at the
same time increasing apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> by 2-fold.
Trypsin treatment of TH reduced the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the
cofactor to 100 &micro;M.  In the presence of heparin, the proteolyzed
TH shows no change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the cofactor, but the
apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is markedly reduced.  Increasing the
[Tyr] to 500 &micro;M sufficient to saturate the enzyme produced
no change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the cofactor, but did decrease
the inhibitory effect of heparin on the proteolyzed enzyme.
The supersaturating [Tyr] has no effect on heparin-mediated <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
activation of the native enzyme.
<p>

kinetic data.]

Soluble, membrane-bound and detergent-solubilized rat striatal
tyrosine hydroxylase:  pH-dependent cofactor binding
<p class="Para1">
The sulfated mucopolysaccharide heparin was previously shown to
activate striatal TH by causing a 10-fold decrease in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for its cofactor and a 2-fold increase in apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.
The Hill coefficient was near 2.0 and the
<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;&micro;g/ml for
the dissociation constant (previously shown).  The pH dependence
of the heparin-striatal TH interaction is measured for soluble
and Triton-X100-solubilized enzyme.
<p>
In Table 1, data shown was for tyrosine=100 &micro;M,
DMPH<sub>4</sub> = 200 &micro;M and the <i>K</i><sub>0.5</sub> and
<i>n</i><sub>H</sub> Hill coefficient are determined using
at least 15 heparin concentrations from 2.8 to 150 &micro;g/ml.
And both <i>K</i> and <i>n</i> factors were determined at five
different pHs (5.42, 5.67, 5.87, 6.10 and 6.39).  At all pH,
Hill coefficient &gt;1 and half-maximal effect is seen at
10 &micro;g/ml.Double reciprocal plots in which the tyrosine and
DMPH<sub>4</sub> concentrations were varied were done:  heparin
did not affect the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine (55.6 &micro;M)
but does reduce the apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.
The plot also shows that heparin decreases the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for DMPH<sub>4</sub> (from 290 &micro;M to 130 &micro;M) and the apparent
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.
<p>
Double reciprocal plots of velocity against DMPH<sub>4</sub> at
nonsaturating concentrations of heparin are nonlinear.  By
increasing DMPH<sub>4</sub> to 1.0&nbsp;mM (higher concentrations
are inhibitory), the effects of heparin on the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for
DMPH<sub>4</sub> are minimized, and a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> and
Hill slope for heparin can be approximated for the inhibitory
interaction.
<p>
The kinetic properties as a function of pH are also presented,
with <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine varied
while DMPH<sub>4</sub> is held constant at 1.0&nbsp;mM and heparin
is constant at 70 &micro;g/ml.  While the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine
did not really vary (~56 &micro;M) over the entire pH range tested
(5.4 to 6.6), the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> did vary.  Optimal activity at pH 5.87
in the absence of heparin was observed, while in the presence of heparin,
optimal activity was at 6.10 (showing 35% activation as well).
<p>
When the DMPH<sub>4</sub> concentration was varied at the different pHs,
the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> remained as constant (at 100 &micro;M) in the presence
of heparin as it did for tyrosine.  But unlike tyrosine variation,
in absence of heparin, lowering the pH markedly alters the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for DMPH<sub>4</sub>.
<p>
TH was also solubilized in 0.1% TX-100 with little effect on its
activity.  With other parameters constant, increases in the
concentration of TX-100 reduced the activity associated with a
fraction.  No activity changes in the particulate fraction were
dependent upon pH as with the soluble fraction.  Routine
solubilization of TH was done with 0.075% TX-100.
<p>
All kinetic properties of the soluble and TX-100 solubilized
TH were compared with respect to heparin activation, and they
were all similar in response.  The membrane-bound TH has a broad
pH optimum, with <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine independent of pH and
with a value of 8 &micro;M (which is quite low and the discrepancy
cannot be ascertained).  Solubilization with TX-100 results in a
3-fold <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> increase while the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> is
increased to 60 &micro;M.No change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for DMPH<sub>4</sub>
is observed over the pH range, unlike for the soluble and
TX-100-solubilized enzyme.  And the pH optimum is broad for
the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> value as well, with heparin having no effect.
<p>
Sucrose density gradients were run to see if the TX-solubilized
enzyme differs in any way with the normally soluble enzyme.
The soluble enzyme was a single species of activity with a
MW of 193,000, similar to that previously reported, while the
TX-100-solubilized enzyme sediments to 197,000, both within
each other&acute;s ranges of error.Changing the pH of the
sucrose gradient (from 5.2 to 6.8) also had no effect on its
sedimentation.

Effect of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate on <sup>14</sup>C-dopamine
biosynthesis in rat brain striatal slices
<p class="Para1">
Sprague-Dawley rats are decapitated, the brains rapidly removed
to cold oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit medium (<i>Hoppe-Seyler
Z. Physiol. Chem.</i> <b>210</b>: 33-36,
1932).Striatum slices were prepared using a slicer and method previously
described.
<p>
Four concentrations of Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP (1, 10, 50, and 500 &micro;M)
tested.  The lower two had no effect on tyrosine uptake which the
higher concentrations did slightly.  The effect on dopamine content
was dramatic and dose-dependent.  Note that neither 0.5&nbsp;mM cAMP
or butyric acid had no effect on dopamine synthesis.
<p>
Tyrosine concentration was altered from 1 to 20 &micro;M while
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP was added (Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP concentration
not given).  There is an increase enhancement of dopamine
synthesis by 130 to 150%.  Tyrosine concentrations above
20 &micro;M start to show a diminution in the percent enhancement.
No <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> change for tyrosine is observed, with the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
at 10 &micro;M for both the Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP-treated and the controls.
The <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is however increased with respect to the tyrosine data.
<p>
With a 10 &micro;M tyrosine concentration, dopamine synthesis
was linear for at least 60 min. Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP in the
data also sustains synthesis, with immediate apparent
enhancement at the first time point (10 min), and being
maximal at 20 min.
<p>
The effect of Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP may be to alter the specific
levels of tyrosine or dopamine (shown as a change in specific
radioactivity) in the cells.  Endogenous tyrosine and dopamine
levels were therefore assessed both before and after Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP
treatment.  No significant differences were found.
<p>
The inhibitor of TH, &alpha;-methyl-p-tyrosine, was used to
examine whether Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP was exerting its effect at
the level of TH.  Dopamine synthesis was indeed curtailed with
addition of inhibitor.  Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP addition did enhance
even inhibitor-pre-treated striatal slices, but did not abolish the
inhibition.Dopamine was also investigated as an inhibitor:  it also
reduced dopamine synthesis, but Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP treated
slices showed an enhancement of activity as well.
<p>
In other experiments, striata were preincubated in Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP.
After 15 min, slices were removed to normal medium with labeled tyrosine.
Results show an increased dopamine content of 80%.  This is reduced
somewhat from the experiments in which slices are preincubated and
then continuously incubated with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP.
<p>
Various putative dopamine receptor blockers were analyzed
as well to see how Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP affected their function.
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP was added to striata from animals which had
been administered drug 1 hour prior to sacrifice.  The
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP + haloperidol (a presumed receptor blocker)
enhanced dopamine synthesis to the same level as Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP
alone (160%);haloperidol alone enhanced dopamine synthesis too (57%).
Apomorphine (a presumed dopamine receptor stimulator) actually reduces
synthesis alone, but in combination with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP,
synthesis is enhanced (70%).Dopamine receptor blockade or
activation has little effect on Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP.
<p>
The effect of high K<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium
on Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP-enhanced dopamine synthesis was similarly
assessed.  (A 40&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup> was used here.)  Results
show that both high K<sup>+</sup> or Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP
alone have an identical effect, in combination they enhance
each other by almost 2-fold.  Interestingly, dopamine synthesis
is enhanced in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, almost as much as in
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP-treated slices.  In combination, they enhance
each other slightly.

Tyrosine hydroxylase:  activation by nerve stimulation
<p class="Para1">
The vas deferentia of were dissected from male Hartley guinea pigs (300-400 g) 
killed by cervical dislocation, frozen on dry ice and stored at &minus;70&deg;. 
Electrical stimulation was done at 20 Hz for 10 sec every 30 sec up to a 30 min 
period, and contralateral vas deferens was used as unstimulated control.  Tissue 
response was recorded on a Grass Polygraph using Grass FT-103 Force-Displacement 
Transducer.  For TH assay, tissues were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer and 
centrifuged 104,000 &times; <i>g</i> for 90 min @ 4&deg;.
<p>
Increases in TH activity in vitro were seen in electrically stimulated vas 
deferens compared to unstimulated controls.  These increases were similar to 
calcium-dependent potassium depolarization treatments (incubation is a 
Krebs-Henseleit medium containing KCl).  Partial inhibition of the potassium 
treatment could be obtained with EGTA present.
<p>
The effect of calcium was seen with as little as 0.5 &micro;M ion, with 
significant activation still seen.  Maximal effect was seen with 6.0 &micro;M 
CaCl<sub>2</sub> (substrates were 50 &micro;M tyrosine and 100 &micro;M

Effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate on the kinetic properties and
molecular weight of rat striatal tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Striata were obtained from 200-250 g male CFE rats and
homogenized in pH 7 phosphate buffer, centrifuged, and ammonium
sulfate-precipitated according to previous method.
In the presence or absence of 50 &micro;g/ml heparin, SDS was varied in
a range from 0-0.025% and TH activity measured in subsaturating
conditions for tyrosine and DMPH<sub>4</sub> cofactor (time of
assay not indicated);  the cofactor concentration was low to
maximize effects of heparin.  Two plots (+/- heparin) of pmol/min
product vs. [%SDS] were made.  Without heparin, SDS has the effect of
activating TH at concentrations of 0.006-0.008%.
With heparin, activation is already maximal, and SDS adds
nothing.  As SDS increased beyond 0.01%, activity is
half-maximal, and nearly lost with 0.02% SDS.  Same results
are seen when 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> is the cofactor, and when
the detergent is 0.1% Triton X-100.   SDS denaturation effects are
irreversible:  enzyme was pre-treated at 0&deg; with SDS then diluted
20-fold to lower the SDS, but was inactive;  additional dialysis did
not help.
<p>
Double recriprocal plots were performed with 0.01% SDS
present.  The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for cofactor went from 1.6&nbsp;mM to
0.18&nbsp;mM and the apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> increased 2-fold.
The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine (55 &micro;M) did not really change.
<p>
Sucrose density gradient centrifugation with alcohol
dehydrogenase standard showed that 0.01% SDS-treated
TH revealed a molecular weight of 200,000, although repeated
analyses were done and determinations ranged from 175,000 to
230,000 (gradients were run in presence and absence of 0.01%).

Regulation of catecholamine synthesis in the rat brain <i>in vitro</i>
by cyclic AMP
<p class="Para1">
Crude synaptosome fractions were prepared from rat brain
striatal homogenates.  The synaptosomes were preincubated
in the presence or absence of various cyclic AMP analogues
(8-Br-cAMP, Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP, BtcAMP, 8-Me-thiocAMP, cAMP,
Bt<sub>2</sub>cGMP) at 1&nbsp;mM and in Na butyrate (2&nbsp;mM)
and then 1-<sup>14</sup>C-<span class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine is added and evolution of
<sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> is monitored.  The natural pteridine
is added to the mixture as well.  Evolution of CO<sub>2</sub>
was linear for at least 20 min and varied directly with amount
of tissue added.  The assay system could be inhibited with
3-iodotyrosine and dopamine in low concentrations, and was
specific for the <span class="small-caps">l</span>-isomer.  Use of the BtcAMP and Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP,
poor substrates for phosphodiesterase, produced activation while cAMP
produced a small inhibition (true with even 1&nbsp;mM theophylline
present).  8-Br-cAMP and the 8-methylthio-cAMP also
produced activation.  The cAMP moiety was clearly the factor
involved in the butyryl cAMPs since Na butyrate alone had no
stimulatory effect, and Bt<sub>2</sub>cGMP produced a slight
inhibition.  The effect of cAMP was at the TH step since rate of
<sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> formation using
carboxy-<sup>14</sup>C-<span class="small-caps">dl</span>-DOPA
(0.1&nbsp;mM) was not altered with or without cAMP analogues.
Activation of TH starts with about 50 &micro;M and is maximal by
1&nbsp;mM.  The P<sub>2</sub> synaptosomal fractions from other
brain regions was assessed, with those of cerebral cortex comparable
to the striatal tissue, and the brainstem synaptosomes showing
greater activation.
<p>
Tyrosine uptake into the synaptosomes was measured using
Millipore filters and was shown not to be effected by Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP
(even up to 5&nbsp;mM).  Moreover, synaptosomes preincubated with
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP and then washed showed continued TH activation,
even though the analogue was not present in the medium.
<p>
Double reciprocal plots of velocity vs. tyrosine concentration
using soluble TH preparations from rat striatum indicate that the
apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine is reduced in the presence of
10 &micro;M cAMP (there were no changes in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>).
Dixon kinetic analysis indicates a 7-fold increase in the
<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> for dopamine.  We also record a 7-8-fold decrease
in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for DMPH<sub>4</sub>.  We suggest a mechanism
of allosteric activation of TH during neuronal depolarization
caused possibly by direct interaction of cAMP with the enzyme
to alter its affinity for its substrates and the dopamine inhibitor.
We do not rule out the possibility that cAMP-dependent activation
of a phosphorylating kinase is involved.

Properties of tyrosine hydroxylase in peripheral nerves
<p class="Para1">
For peripheral nerve examples, sciatic nerve from rabbit and the mandibular 
nerve from bovine were used.  Tissues were processed in 6 vol 0.32 M sucrose 
with Ultra-Turrax homogenizer to obtain, after a pre-spin at 800 &times; 
<i>g</i> for 10 min, a fraction called the <q>homogenate.</q>  Homogenate 
was then centrifuged at 30,000 &times; <i>g</i> for 30 min, and after recovering 
the fraction called <q>supernatant,</q> the pellet (a crude mitochondrial 
fraction) was resuspended in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, centrifuged 
again 30,000 <i>g</i> for 30 min, and its pellet resuspended in phosphate 
buffer. This fraction is the <q>pellet.</q>
<p>
TH activity was found largely (80%) in the soluble fraction of extracts of 
rabbit sciatic nerve or bovine mandibular nerve, the balance in the crude 
mitochondrial fraction (pellet).  Activity was linear up to 2 mg protein in the 
homogenate.  There was a 5-fold greater activity of TH in sciatic vs. mandibular 
nerve.  The 25-35% ammonium sulfate fraction contained the most, and dialysis 
against 20 mM phosphate, pH 7.5, overnight was without activity loss.
<p>
Mandibular nerve pellet was subjected to 0.1 &micro;g trypsin per mg protein
at 4&deg; for 15 h, and soybean trypsin inhibitor added ih 2 mol excess
to terminate.  After spinning at 100,000 &times; <i>g</i> for 60 min,
the supernatant was again fractionated with ammonium sulfate, with
the highest activity in the 35-45% saturation.  The yield was only 6%
however, indicating a severe effect of the protease.
<p>
TH from a 25-35% saturated ammonium sulfate cut of mandibular nerve extract (the 
soluble portion) was characterized for substrates and inhibition. Pterin 
cofactors were absolutely required.  DMPH<sub>4</sub> generally gave lower 
activity (61%) than 6MPH<sub>4</sub>, and the natural BH<sub>4</sub> cofactor 
gave the highest (123% of 6MPH<sub>4</sub>). Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated the 
following <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values:  at 100 &micro;M tyrosine, 20 &micro;M 
for BH<sub>4</sub>, 50 &micro;M for 6MPH<sub>4</sub>, and 360 &micro;M for 
DMPH<sub>4</sub>;  at 1 mM 6MPH<sub>4</sub>, 54 &micro;M for tyrosine.
<p>
In the absence of Fe<sup>2+</sup> there was a low but significant activity
(14% of control), which could be inhibited by &alpha;,&alpha;&acute;-dipyridyl
(aaD).  1 mM aaD inhibited activity by 50% with 1 mM Fe<sup>2+</sup>
present.  Catalase addition did not affect this.  Catalase alone without
Fe<sup>2+</sup> stimulates, but the greater effect is with Fe<sup>2+</sup>.
<p>
The pH optimum was found to be 5.9 in Tris-acetate or sodium acetate), and 6.5 
in Tris-HCl or KP<sub>i</sub>. <span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-&alpha;-Methyl-<i>p</i>-tyrosine at 50 &micro;M 
inhibited activity by 60% with 40 &micro;M Tyr.  Dopamine was the most effective 
inhibitor of all catecholamines tested, much greater than for the product <span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-DOPA itself.  <span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-5-Hydroxytryptophan was also a potent inhibitor, as 
effective as dopamine (70% inhibition at 400 &micro;M);  <span 
class="small-caps">d</span>-5-hydroxytryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptamine had no 
effect at the same concentration.  The LB plots shows that with BH<sub>4</sub> 
greater than 90 &micro;M, inhibition by <span 
class="small-caps">l</span>-5-Hydroxytryptophan is partially competitive with 
BH<sub>4</sub>, but when BH<sub>4</sub> is lower than 90 &micro;M, inhibition is 
uncompetitive;  this inhibition is fully competitive with tyrosine.  Hence the 
nature of this inhibition may be distinct by which catecholamines inhibit.
<p>
Heparin has been shown to activate rat brain TH and lysolecithin to activate
rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase.  Between 12-60 &micro;g/ml heparin,
there was no activation of the bovine nerve TH when BH<sub>4</sub>
was the pterin cofactor, and there was an inhibition when 6MPH<sub>4</sub>
was the cofactor.  With DMPH<sub>4</sub> as cofactor, lysolecithin activated
TH, but had no effect with 6MPH<sub>4</sub> or BH<sub>4</sub> as cofactor.

Activation by cyclic 3&acute;:5&acute;-adenosine monophosphate of tyrosine

<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  Membrane-permeable derivatives of cyclic
AMP (cAMP) produced concentration-dependent increases in activity of tyrosine
hydroxylase (<span class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine,
tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.16.2) in
membrane-limited nerve endings (synaptosomes) prepared from three regions of
rat brain. Increased hydroxylation occurred even after preincubation and
removal of dibutyryl cyclic AMP. In all brain regions, the hydroxylation of
phenylalanine and tyrosine was increased, but dibutyryl cAMP had little effect
on activity of tryptophan hydroxylase, no effect on aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase,
on uptake of tyrosine or phenylalanine, uptake or efflux of dopamine, or
distribution of hydroxylase between cytoplasmic and particulate components of
the synaptosomes. Dibutyryl cAMP decreased inhibition of catecholamine
synthesis in synaptosomes by dopamine and apomorphine. In a soluble preparation
of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase, activity was increased by addition of lower
concentrations of cAMP or dibutyryl cAMP than with unbroken nerve endings, when
subsaturating concentrations of tyrosine and cofactor were employed, while
butyrate, chloride, 5'-AMP, ADP, ATP, and cyclic GMP had no activating effect.
Increased activity of soluble tyrosine hydroxylase was reflected in increased
affinity (<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) for substrate and cofactor and decreased affinity
(<i>K</i><sub>i</sub>) for inhibitory end-product (dopamine), suggesting
a change in the physical-chemical state of the enzyme or an activator
molecule. Cyclic AMP may activate tyrosine hydroxylase during periods
of increased neuronal activity.

Circadian rhythm of tyrosine hydroxylase induction by short-term
cold stress: modulatory action of glucocorticoids in newborn and adult rats
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  The trans-synaptic induction of tyrosine
hydroxylase [tyrosine 3-monooxygenase; EC 1.14.16.2, <span class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine,
tetrahydropteridine: oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating)] in adrenal
medulla and sympathetic ganglia by short-term (1-2 hr) cold stress (4 degrees)
exhibits a circadian rhythm which seems to be causally related to the diurnal
changes in adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis. In induction is maximal during the
morning hours, when plasma corticoid concentrations (reflecting corticoid
synthesis in the adrenal cortex) are minimal. In contrast, initiation of
tyrosine hydroxylase induction in sympathetic ganglia is only possible in the
afternoon. These observations suggest that tyrosine hydroxylase inducibility in
the adrenal medulla is optimal during periods of low corticoid synthesis (the
adrenal medulla is exposed to excessively high corticoid concentrations
directly originating from the adjacent cortex), whereas in sympathetic ganglia
an induction is only possible during the period of high plasma corticoid
concentrations. This assumption is supported by the observation that in the
first postnatal weeks, when the pituitary--adrenocortical system is not yet operating
and plasma corticoid concentrations are low, initiation of tyrosine hydroxylase
induction in the adrenal medulla is possible at any time of the day, whereas in
sympathetic ganglia it is not possible at all. However, after administration of
glycocorticoids initiation of tyrosine hydroxylase induction by short-term cold
stress is also possible in newborn animals and in adults during the morning
hours. The importance of glucocorticoids as modulators for the initiation of
trans-synaptic tyrosine hydroxylase induction can also be deduced from the
observation that in sympathetic ganglia kept in organ cultures and induction of
the hydroxylase by cholinomimetics is only possible when glycocorticoids are
added to the culture medium.

Evidence for involvement of protein kinase in the activation by

<p>
1 &micro;M cAMP is added to high speed supernatants of rat
hippocampal extracts and results in a 3-fold increase in
TH activity.  EDTA prevents this activation if added prior
to or simultaneously with cAMP, but there is no effect if
added 10 min after.  A time course reveals a 5 min lag period,
with activation then being rapid and maximal by 10 min.
Dose courses show that 0.5 &micro;M given half-maximal activation,
while 1 &micro;M gives maximal activation.
<p>
1 &micro;M cGMP addition caused both an inhibition of TH and of
the cAMP-mediated activation of TH.  It is not known why.AMP,
cCMP, cUMP at 1, 10, and 100 &micro;M to these extracts had no
effect on TH activity.
<p>
Since EDTA had inhibited cAMP, other inhibitors of cAMP-mediated processes were 
tried, including adenosine, ADP, and protein kinase modulator (inhibitor). 
Extracts were incubated 10 min in the presence of absence of cAMP and the 
various inhibitors at two concentrations (0.1 and 1&nbsp;mM), then gel filtered 
through Sephadex G-25 to remove cAMP, ATP, metal ions.  The cAMP addition alone 
activated TH (it remains active even after gel filtration). Adenosine, ADP, and 
the protein kinase modulator all significantly inhibited this cAMP-mediated 
activation without affecting TH activity itself.
<p>
TH was gel filtered on G-25 and then incubated with cAMP and an exogenous 
protein kinase purified from bovine brain. An absolute requirement for the 
presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP was indicatd.(ATP was found to cause 
maximal activation at 2 &micro;M.)ATP which had been substituted by the 
&beta;-&gamma;-methylene analog (the terminal phosphate is now not available) 
could not allow cAMP-mediated activation.
<p>
Synergism by cAMP and the protein kinase was examined at 6 min incubation (a 
time which is submaximal and allows observation of synergism).  The sum of 
cAMP+protein kinase combination was greater than that for cAMP or protein kinase 
alone.  The protein kinase modulator was an effective inhibitor of this 
reaction.  If either ATP or Mg were omitted, the combination effect of 
activation was not found.

Mechanisms of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase
induction in organ cultures of rat sympathetic ganglia by potassium
depolarization and cholinomimetics
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  It was the aim of the present study to
elucidate the mechanisms involved in specific tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and
dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) induction by potassium depolarization and
cholinomimetics in rat superior cervical ganglia kept in organ culture.
The effect of high (54&nbsp;mM) potassium concentration on intact ganglia
seems to result in a dual action:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>a specific induction of TH and DBH via release of acetylcholine
from preganglionic cholinergic nerve terminals.
<li>a non-specific effect on terminal adrenergic neurons resulting in a general 
increase of protein synthesis as indicated by the increase in DOPA decarboxylase 
(DDC) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities.
</ol>
<p>
In decentralized superior cervical ganglia potassium depolarization failed to 
produce the specific TH and DBH induction although a small increase in DDC 
activity persisted.  Carbamylcholine, acetylcholine and nicotine at 
concentrations of 10<sup>-4</sup> M elicited a selective induction of TH and DBH 
both in intact and decentralized ganglia via nicotinic receptor stimulation. 
Bethanechol, predominantly stimulating muscarinic receptors had no significant 
effect on TH activity. A 4 h pulse of 10<sup>-4</sup> M carbamylcholine produced 
optimal induction of DBH and TH 24 h and 48 h later respectively. Longer 
exposure to carbamylcholine resulted in a significantly smaller rise in TH 
activity.

Lack of correlation between changes in cyclic nucleotides and

<b>Abstract</b>:  Pretreatment of rats with dexamethasone (2.5
mumol/kg, a dose which blocks the release of ACTH from the pituitary gland)
abolished the reserpine mediated increase in cAMP and the increase in the
cAMP/cGMP ratio in the adrenal medulla.  In contrast, the reserpine-mediated
induction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) remained unchanged.  Hypophysectomy

Stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by cyclic AMP in
synpatosomes and in soluble striatal enzyme preparations
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dB-cAMP) elicits a
concentration-dependent stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the
striatal and mesolimbic synaptosomes. The per cent of stimulation is
significantly higher in the mesolimbic synaptosomes than in the striatal
synaptosomes. dB-cAMP and depolarizing agents (ouabain or veratridine) have an
additive effect on synaptosomal tyrosine hydroxylase activity, indicating that
they stimulate tyrosine hydroxylase activity by different mechanisms. cAMP does
not stimulate soluble striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity unless it is added
in combination with ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, compounds required for the
activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The cAMP elicited per cent
stimulation of soluble tyrosine hydroxylase activity is dependent upon the
concentration of added protein kinase and upon the pH of the reaction. dB-cAMP
has the same effect on the kinetic state of tyrosine hydroxylase in
synaptosomes as cAMP on the soluble tyrosine hydroxylase. The nucleotide does
not alter the apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine, reduces the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for the pteridine cofactor and increases the <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> for dopamine. Thus,
cAMP increases the affinity of tyrosine hydroxylase for the pteridine cofactor
and concomitantly decreases the affinity for the end-product inhibition.
<p>
Striata and the mesolimbic areas (olfactory tubercle and nucleus
accumbens) from male S-D rats are prepared as homogenates in a sucrose
solution.  A teflon-glass homogenizer with appropriate clearance is
used and after special differential speed centrifugations, the
P<sub>2</sub> fraction is obtained as crude synaptosomes.
A series of 3 doses (50, 500, and 1000 &micro;M)
of Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP is incubated and the effect on measured
TH activity is observed in each tissue class.  The 1&nbsp;mM dose
is maximal;  Although the absolute synaptosomal TH specific activity
in the mesolimbic system is lower than in the striata, the %
increase in activity with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP is much higher.
1&nbsp;mM cAMP nor 1&nbsp;mM butyric acid alone had any effect,
showing that the activation was not result of some non-specific effect.

Establishment of a clonal line of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma
cells which respond to nerve growth factor
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  A single cell clonal line which responds
reversibly to nerve growth factor (NGF) has been established from a
transplantable rat adrenal pheochromocytoma. This line, designated
PC12, has a homogeneous and near-diploid chromosome number of 40.
By 1 week's exposure to NGF, PC12 cells cease to multiply and begin
to extend branching varicose processes similar to those produced by
sympathetic neurons in primary cell culture. By several weeks of
exposure to NGF, the PC12 processes reach 500-1000 mm in length.
Removal of NGF is followed by degeneration of processes within 24 hr
and by resumption of cell multiplication within 72 hr. PC12 cells
grown with or without NGF contain dense core chromaffin-like granules
up to 350 nm in diameter. The NGF-treated cells also contain small
vesicles which accumulate in process varicosities and endings.
PC12 cells synthesize and store the catecholamine neurotransmitters
dopamine and norepinephrine. The levels (per mg of protein) of
catecholamines and of the their synthetic enzymes in PC12 cells are
comparable to or higher than those found in rat adrenals. NGF-treatment of
PC12 cells results in no change in the levels of catecholamines or of their
synthetic enzymes when expressed on a per cell basis, but does result
in a 4- to 6-fold decrease in levels when expressed on a per mg of
protein basis.   PC12 cells do not synthesize epinephrine and cannot
be induced to do so by treatment with dexamethasone. The PC12 cell
line should be a useful model system for neurobiological and
neurochemical studies.

Stimulation of rat striatal tyrosine hydroxylase by phospholipids
and adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  Rat striatal tyrosine hydroxylase is
stimulated in vitro by various phospholipids. This stimulation
was produced by a 3- to 4-fold increase in affinity for pteridine
cofactor. No change in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine was observed,
The sedimentation pattern of tyrosine hydroxylase on linear sucrose
gradients showed no indication of enzyme dissociation in the
presence of lysolecithin at maximal stimulatory concentration.
Crude striatal tyrosine hydroxylase is also activated by a
combination of ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, EGTA and cAMP. After
removing these agents by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, the
activated form of the enzyme can be further stimulated by lysolecithin.
These results suggest a possible role for phospholipids in the regulation

Activation of tyrosine hydroxylase by polyanions and salts:
an electrostatic effect
<p class="Para1">
Bovine caudate TH was partially purified and then treated with
several polyanions, each at 4 different concentrations, to examine effect on
activity.  Of the various compounds tested, NaCl, heparin,
phosphatidylserine, polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl sulfuric acid,
and both <span class="small-caps">d</span>- and <span class="small-caps">l</span>-forms of polyglutamic acid produced a 1.8-5.1-fold
activation.BSA was also tested and had no effect.  Dipalmitoyl-
and egg yolk lecithin were found to have no effect.  Chondroitin
sulfate only had an effect when incubated with 0.02 MES-NaOH
buffer, where heparin also produces a 10-fold activation.
Smaller anions (di- and trivalent ions such as sulfate, phosphate,
fumarate, succinate, and citrate) were ineffective at activating
at much higher concentrations than those where polyanions were activating.
Pairwise addition of polyanions produced no additive activation effect,
suggesting the same site of action.  While salt alone is activating, in
combination with polyanions, it actually inhibits the enzyme:
In the presence of 1 mg/ml heparin, enzyme activity is inhibited 50%
when NaCl is increased from 0.1 to 0.25 M.   At a lower ionic strength
(25&nbsp;mM), the 1 mg/ml heparin-induced activation was 8-fold but
this activation was only transitory.  With other univalent electrolytes
(LiCl, KCl, NaCl, NaBr, NaOAc, all 0.5 M), activation is observed
in all, as it was with divalent ions as well.  The special effect
of low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in activating TH is not observed
as reported by Roth and coworkers.
<p>
The finding that polymeric anions of high negative charge
density activate TH shows the phenomenon is one which is
purely electrostatic and not one of specific chemical interaction.
This is shown by the effect of a high ionic strength causing
inhibition of the heparin activation response, which is explained
by a masking of the negative surface charge density that would
occur in such a salty solution.  Kuczenski found interaction with
the mucopolysaccharide heparin but not with chondroitin sulfate,
believing activation was therefore specific for heparin;  he failed
to consider that heparin has 3 neg. charges per disaccharide
unit, chondroitin sulfate, 2, and hyaluronic acid, 1.
Note that CS does activate TH but when the ionic strength is
reduced as opposed to conditions used by Kuczenski.
<p>
Comparison of assay systems regenerating reduced cofactor
were done in the view that tetrahydropterins are not stable in the assay
mixture.  Their rate of auto-oxidation is much faster than the
catalytic cycle of TH.  When polyanions were added to each of
the two assay systems, there was no difference in the observed
activation effect, indicating that a chemical reducing system
is just as productive as the pteridine reductase-NADPH system.
<p>
TH added to heparin immobilized on agarose (heparin-Sepharose) was found to be 
activated just as much as the use of soluble heparin.  Addition of heparin 
decreased binding of TH to the heparin-agarose.  Use of ethanolamine-substituted 
Sepharose did not produce the same activation effect.
<p>
The reversibility of polyanion and salt activation was tested by preincubating 
TH in the presence of high salt (1.0 M NaCl) and heparin.  It was found that 
loss of activation took 10 to 20 min to occur after removal of NaCl.   With 
heparin, reversal took a little longer.

Long-term regulatory mechanisms for tyrosine hydroxylase in
sympathetic ganglia and carotid body
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:   The delayed activation of TH elicited by hypoxia
in carotid body indirectly suggests that
the release of dopamine is part of the responses elicited by hypoxia. The TH
activation appears to be independent from nicotinic receptor stimulation and
can be abolished by dopaminergic receptor stimulation. Dexamethasone also
increases the activity of TH. Since both hypoxia and dexamethasone fail to
change the kinetic constants, the long-term increase of TH could be viewed as
an expression of new synthesis of enzyme molecules. This assumption is
supported by the evidence presented on the prompt kinetic change in PDE, which
according to the model proposed by Uzunov et al. (42) expresses the
participation of a prompt and sustained response of the second messenger in
postsynaptic cells. It remains to be ascertained whether the change in the
catalytic activity of PDE which metabolizes the second messenger can be
suppressed by dopamine-receptor blockers. Immediate changes of PDE coupled with
the delayed increase in TH activity may contribute to a better understanding of
the neuronal mechanisms controlling the chemoreceptor function. It is hoped
that the continuation of these studies will help to define the function of type
I cells in the carotid body.

Studies on phenylalanine and tyrosine hydroxylation by rat brain
tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Velocity vs. substrate curves were plotted for the reactions of Phe &rarr;
Tyr and Tyr &rarr;  DOPA by the rat brain TH enzyme against changes
in the cofactor concentration,
2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyltetrahydropteridine (DMPH<sub>4</sub>).
These plots indicate that the conversion to
DOPA is much faster than for Tyr formation. When tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH<sub>4</sub>) was used instead as a cofactor, the rate of Phe &rarr; Tyr
and Tyr &rarr; DOPA conversion by rat brain TH were quite comparable.
The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for BH<sub>4</sub> (200 &micro;M for Phe and
250 &micro;M for Tyr) was 2% of the value for DMPH<sub>4</sub> with Tyr as a
substrate. It has been shown by Shiman and Kaufman that
the bovine adrenal TH has <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for BH<sub>4</sub> which is
lower than that for DMPH<sub>4</sub>.
<p>
Substrate inhibition study shows that Phe concentration
does not affect the Phe &rarr; Tyr conversion as Tyr does
affect the Tyr &rarr; DOPA conversion.  There does appear
to be an inhibition of DOPA formation dependent upon
Phe concentration, but that is probably because
an excess of Phe competes with the presence of Tyr at the substrate binding
site.  Time course of product formation for the Phe &rarr; Tyr,
Tyr &rarr; DOPA, and Phe &rarr; DOPA conversion was monitored
and while the first two were linear, the last was parabolic, or linear with
respect to the square of the time of incubation, which would be expected from
consideration of rate equations accounting for changes in the rate of Tyr
production which then becomes a substrate in the rate equation for DOPA
production.Using [<sup>3</sup>H]Phe and [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr, the
ratio of <sup>3</sup>H/<sup>14</sup>C in DOPA and
in tyrosine was assessed to see if Tyr was rapidly converted to DOPA upon its
formation while it was present in the substrate binding site.
A ratio of(<sup>3</sup>H/<sup>14</sup>C DOPA)/(<sup>3</sup>H/<sup>14</sup>C
Tyr) which is &gt; 0.5 would be expected to indicate DOPA is formed
from Phe by a pathway not involving free Tyr as an intermediate.
If the ratio &lt; 0.5, free Tyr is an obligatory intermediate,
and the results show the ratio is &lt; 0.5 and so free Tyr is
apparently necessary.
<p>
Rat striatal P<sub>2</sub> fraction is high in TH activity.
In the presence of the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1034,
DOPA formation is linear with respect to time and tissue
concentration and inhibited by Phe and low concentrations of 3-iodotyrosine.

Activation of adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase by ATP and other nucleotides
<p class="Para1">
Various nucleotides (adenosine, AMP, ADP, ATP, GTP, UTP, and
CTP) were tested for effect on TH activity in supernatants of bovine adrenal
medulla.  All of the triphosphonucleotides increased activity 15-20-fold
over controls.  ADP and AMP also increased activity, but only 6- and 3-fold,
resp.  Adenosine was without effect.  The concentration dependence of
ATP on activation was also assessed.  Half-maximal activation occurs
at about 3-4&nbsp;mM ATP while maximal activation is seen at 8&nbsp;mM.
Dose responses for GTP, UTP, and CTP were similar.
<p>
Double reciprocal plots of velocity vs DMPH<sub>4</sub> concentration
with ATP absent and present at 4&nbsp;mM. The plot shows that ATP
incubation lowered the apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the cofactor
by 5-fold and had no effect on <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.  Double reciprocal
plots of vel. vs. tyrosine conc. with DMPH<sub>4</sub> saturating
(1 mM) shows <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> unaltered.
We indicate that inorganic phosphate is not liberated in
the use of ATP to activate TH.  Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>
effect at 1&nbsp;mM was assessed on this ATP activation process and
found to have no effect.  Moreover, use of 1&nbsp;mM EGTA in the
supernatant also had no effect.  Hence the ATP is specifically
interacting with TH rather than by a specific enzyme reaction
involving TH ultimately.

Selective induction of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine
beta-hydroxylase by nerve growth factor: comparison between adrenal medulla and
sympathetic ganglia of adult and newborn rats
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  Administration of NGF to newborn and adult
rats elicits a selective increase in TH and DBH both in sympathetic ganglia and
adrenal medulla. This effect does not depend on intact preganglionic
cholinergic fibers. The augmented enzyme activity results from enhanced enzyme
synthesis since it can be abolished by cycloheximide and NGF has been shown to
enhance the incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine into DBH molecules. The
responsiveness of the adrenal medulla to NGF is also supported by light and
electron microscopic autoradiograms which show that intravenously injected
125I-NGF is accumulated with high selectivity in adrenal chromaffin as compared
to adjacent adrenal cortical cells. In spite of the many similarities between
the response of the adrenergic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells to NGF,
there are also two distinct differences. (a) In newborn rats the ratio between
the TH increase effected by a single and 10 subsequent daily injections of NGF
is 1:2 in the adrenal medulla and 1:7 in the superior cervical ganglia. (b) If
adrenal medullae are transferred to organ culture after intravenous injection
of NGF, maximal TH response is initiated 60-90 min after NGF administration. In
superior cervical ganglia only a half-maximal response is initiated at that
time. After a stationary phase a second increase starts after about 6 h to
reach the maximum after 12 h. The biphasic time course of the initiation of TH
induction by NGF in sympathetic ganglia is in agreement with the time course of
<sup>125</sup>I-NGF accumulation after intravenous injection27 reflecting the
moiety of NGF reaching the cell bodies of the adrenergic neurons directly by
the blood stream (initial accumulation) and by retrograde axonal transport
(second phase).

Effects of stereochemical structures of tetrahydrobiopterin on tyrosine
hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  1. Four stereochemical isomers of tetrahydrobiopterin,
i.e.,
6-<span class="small-caps">l</span>-erythro-,
6-<span class="small-caps">d</span>-erythro-,
6-<span class="small-caps">l</span>-threo-, or
6-<span class="small-caps">d</span>-threo-1,2-dihydroxypropyltetrahydropterin,
have been synthesized and used as cofactors for tyrosine
hydroxylase (EC 1.14.18.) purified from the soluble fraction
of bovine adrenal medulla. The <span class="small-caps">l</span>-erythro- (the putative
natural cofactor) and <span class="small-caps">d</span>-threo isomers showed a striking
similarity in their cofactor activities for tyrosine hydroxylase;
the remaining two isomeric tetrahydrobiopterins, <span class="small-caps">d</span>-erythro and
<span class="small-caps">l</span>-threo isomers, also had very similar cofactor characteristics.
2. The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values of the <span class="small-caps">l</span>-erythro and
<span class="small-caps">d</span>-threo isomers as cofactor were found to be dependent on their
concentrations.  When their concentrations were below 100 nM,
the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values of the <span class="small-caps">l</span>-erythro
and <span class="small-caps">d</span>-threo isomers were fairly low (about 20 nM).
However, the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values were markedly higher
(about 150 nM) at concentrations above 100 nM. The
same kinetic behavior was also observed with the tetrahydrobiopterin
prepared from a natural source (bullfrog). In contrast,
the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value of the <span class="small-caps">l</span>-threo or <span class="small-caps">d</span>-erythro
isomer was found to be independent of the concentration and remained
constant throughout the concentration examined.
3. The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values of tyrosine did not show much
difference (from 20 nM to 30 nM) with respect to the
structure of the four isomeric cofactors. At high concentrations tyrosine
inhibited the enzymatic reaction with any one of the four tetrahydrobiopterin
cofactors. 4. Oxygen at high concentrations was also inhibitory with any one of
the four stereochemical isomers as cofactor. Approximate <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values
for oxygen with the tetrahydrobiopterins as cofactor were 1-5%. 5. In contrast
to the four isomers of tetrahydrobiopterin, when 6-methyltetrahydropterin or
6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin was used as cofactor tyrosine or oxygen did not
inhibit the enzymatic reaction at high concentrations, and the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
values toward the pterin cofactor, tyrosine, and oxygen were significantly
higher than the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values with the tetrahydrobiopterins as cofactor.

Bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase: purification and properties
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  Bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase has been
obtained in a form that is 85 to 90% pure.  Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and density gradient
centrifugation studies have established that the subunit molecular weight of
the chymotrypsin-solubilized enzyme is 34,000.  The presence of iron
in the purified enzyme (0.50 to 0.75 mol of
iron/mol of enzyme) has been established.  Crude particulate
tyrosine hydroxylase can be activated by the
phospholipid,
phosphatidyl-<span class="small-caps">l</span>-serine,
or by exposure to enzymatic phosphorylating conditions.
Both forms of activation lower the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
of the enzyme for its 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine cofactor.
By contrast, tyrosine hydroxylase that has
been solubilized by chymotrypsin cannot be activated by either of these
methods.

Tyrosine hydroxylase. Activation by protein phosphorylation
and end product inhibition
<p class="Para1">
Sprague-Dawley rats are decapitated and the striatum, hypothalamus,
and adrenal glands removed.  Tissues were frozen on dry ice and
stored in liquid nitrogen.  Extracts are prepared in various
buffers.  Sephadex G-25 gel filtration appears to lower the K<sub>m</sub>
of TH for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>.  The length of the column used appears
to have a greater effect (it was previously reported that hippocampal
TH showed no <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> reduction) since it probably causes
better separation between dopamine and TH.  A small Dowex 50 column
was used to examine the effect of cation-exchange chromatography:
extracts spiked with <sup>14</sup>C-dopamine to examine separation
showed 93% removal with this filtration method (TH does not actually
bind to the column).  Sucrose density gradients were run on extracts
and gel and ion-exchange filtered material to demonstrate that the
columns had no effect on TH molecular weight (such as causing
aggregation).
<p>
Phosphorylating conditions were established (ATP, Mg, cAMP, NaF--to
inhibit ATPase, and EGTA and theophylline--to inhibit PDEase) in
crude extracts.The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>
is shown to be reduced in all 3 tissues investigated.
With phosphorylation of gel- and ion-exchange-filtered TH
(both processes which already reduce the K<sub>m</sub>
for the cofactor), phosphorylating conditions reduce the K<sub>m</sub>
even more, but not by much.  Interestingly the phosphorylating conditions
of the crude extract and the chromatographic filtering processes
reduce the K<sub>m</sub> to nearly the same large effect.
<p>
Dopamine is a potent inhibitor of TH. Its <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>
was determined in crude extracts, gel- and ion-exchange-filtered,
and phosphorylated TH for the striatal tissue.  Dixon plots show
that gel filtration had no effect on the K<sub>i</sub> for dopamine,
while ion-exchange filtration had a small effect.  Phosphorylation
increased the K<sub>i</sub> 3-fold. Physiological concentrations
of dopamine (5 &micro;M) added to crude extracts, gel filtered, and
 phosphorylated extracts show that addition of dopamine added to
extracts increased the K<sub>m</sub> 2-fold, after gel filtration the
added dopamine restored the K<sub>m</sub> which had been reduced,
and that with phosphorylation the enzyme was not responsive to
dopamine addition.

Glucocorticoid induction of tyrosine hydroxylase in a continuous

<b>Abstract</b>:  We have established a continous cell line
(G1) in which the tyrosine hydroxylase specific activity is increased as much
as 50-100-fold in response to dexamethasone.  This response is
specific for the glucocorticoid class of steroid
hormones; it is elicited by dexamethasone, corticosterone, and triamcinolone,
but not by estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, or deoxycorticosterone

likely to be due to the increased synthesis of
new enzyme protein rather than an activation of existing protein molecules,
inasmuch as this increase is completely blocked by cycloheximide.

Ontogenic appearance and disappearance of tyrosine hydroxylase
and catecholamines in rat embryo
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:   The ontogenetic pattern of noradrenergic
differentiation in rat embryonic autonomic neuroblasts was
defined in vivo.  Noradrenergic specialization was examined
by documenting the immunohistochemical appearance of tyrosine
hydroxylase [Tyr-OH; tyrosine 3-monooxygenase;
<span class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine,-tetrahydropteridine:oxygen
oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.16.2] and the development of
histofluorescence due to catecholamine (CA).  Tyr-OH and CA were
undetectable in the dorsal neural crest or the ventrally migrating
crest cells and first appeared at 12.5 days of gestation
(36--37 somite stage) in sympathoblasts that had formed
sympathetic ganglion primordia.  Fluorescence intensity and
the number of fluorescent cells increased progressively thereafter.
In addition, Tyr-OH and CA transiently appeared in scattered presumptive
neuroblasts in the gut.  The enzyme and transmitter were first
detectable at 11.5 days of gestation and thereafter decreased
progressively so that, by 14.5 days, only rare cells were
encountered.  There was remarkable synchrony in the appearance and
disappearance of Tyr-OH and CA. These observations suggest that a
number of noradrenergic transmitter mechanisms develop simultaneously
in the differentiating neuroblast.  The relevance of these results to the
elucidation of developmental regulatory mechanisms is discussed.

2-hydroxylated in neuronal tissues to form a catechol compound.  2-hydroxylated 
estrogens are potent inhibitors of COMT, responsible for inactivating NE and 
dopamine. The influence of estrogen is more than as transnuclear hormones 
directly modifying gene expression.
<p>
TH has been shown to be inhibited by catecholamines, with the important 
functional group being the catechol function. <i>O</i>-methylation of the 
catechol abolishes the inhibition of TH whereas deamination by monoamine 
oxidases has no effect.
<p>
Bovine caudate TH was purified and used in activity assays in the presence of 
<i>R</i>-norepinephrine or 2-hydroxyestradiol. Inhibition could be achieved with 
both compounds in a dose-dependent manner.  Estradiol itself and R-metanephrine 
(the <i>O</i>-methylated norepinephrine) had no inhibitory effect.  Other 
catechol estrogens (2-hydroxyestriol) had the same effect.  With the catechol 
inhibitors held constant at 50 &micro;M, the cofactor 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> was varied 
and double reciprocal plots indicate that the pterin competed with the 
catechols.  50% inhibition is observed with 20 &micro;M of both catechols (R-NE and 
2-OHestradiol).

Direct phosphorylation of brain tyrosine hydroxylase by cyclic
AMP-dependent protein kinase:  mechanism of enzyme activation
<p class="Para1">
TH from rat caudate nuclei (530 in number, 33.9 g) was purified
in 6 steps to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5045 nmol
DOPA/20 min/mg (200 &micro;g, 4.4% yield), the last step being TH
purified in native polyacrylamide tube gels.  The steps in order
were 80% AmSO<sub>4</sub> precipitation of high speed supernatants;
25-50% AmSO<sub>4</sub> fractionation of the resulting pellet;
phenyl-Sepharose chromatography in which a 20% AmSO<sub>4</sub> wash,
then 5%, then 5&nbsp;mM buffer alone (TH elutes here), then water was
used; DEAE-cellulose with elution with sequential with 70, 120, then
200&nbsp;mM NaCl, with 50% of the loaded TH activity eluting with the
120&nbsp;mM step; 50-200&nbsp;mM NaCl gradient elution of TH from a
second DEAE-cellulose column with overall yield of 23% and
3200 nmol DOPA/20 min/mg (1.7 mg).
<p>
Native gel electrophoresis with 7.5% polyacrylamide tube
gels was then performed.  TH which had been treated in the
presence of [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP with purified rat heart
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A) was also run on these
gels as well.  A single band is present in 0.1% amido black-stained gels,
which when eluted, runs still as a single band on a second gel.
On SDS-polyacrylamide tube gels, this band separates into three
subunits of apparent MW of 52,000, 62,000, and 68,000.
TH purified from human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE-2 was
run on gels to see if TH possessed similar subunits, but only a
band of 62,000 was observed.
<p>
PK-A was purified because commercially available product
from Sigma incubated with <sup>32</sup>P-ATP alone produced
several bands on gels, with one band migrating similar
to the TH protein.  The results of gel separation show
correlation between the peak of phosphorylation and presence
of catalytic activity in the same gel slice.  On the SDS gels,
of the three bands at 52, 62, and 68 kDa, only the 62,000 band
showed the peak of radioactive phosphate, indicating it to be
the subunit phosphorylated by PK-A.  When no cAMP was added to the
phosphorylation reaction, there was no phosphorylation.
<p>
Gel-purified TH was incubated with PK-A, cAMP, ATP, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>
for 5 min and TH activity was observed to increase &gt;2-fold.
Without cAMP, this activation was not seen. A kinetic analysis
in which ATP was either absent or present during incubation of
TH with PK-A revealed a change in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> without a
change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> (for MePH<sub>4</sub>, 440 &micro;M and
for tyrosine, 125 &micro;M) for either cofactor or substrate.
It is noted that previous reports using impure preparations
show a change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the pteridine cofactor rather
than a change in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.

Nerve growth factor mediating induction of tyrosine hydroxylase
in rat superior cervical ganglia <i>in vitro</i>
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  Exposure of rat sympathetic ganglia to 3
microgram/ml of 2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF) resulted in
a 100% increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity within 48 h.
Pulselabeling of proteins with [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine, followed
by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to tyrosine hydorxylase and
isolation of the precipitated enzyme by gel electrophoresis,
demonstrated that the increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity
was due to enhanced de novo synthesis. The incorporation of
[<sup>3</sup>H]leucine into tyrosine hydroxylase was increased
by 150% compared to a 17% increase in total protein synthesis,
which was not statistically significant. The fact that the half-life
of pulse-labeled tyrosine hydroxylase was the same for NGF-treated
and control organ cultures of superior cervical ganglia excludes
the possibility that enhanced tyrosine hydroxylase labeling
by NGF is due to decreased degradation.  We conclude that,
without modulatory factors which play a role in vivo, NGF can
enhance the synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase in sympathetic
ganglia in vitro, provided organ culture conditions which
permit optimal survival of adrenergic neurons are selected.

Brain striatal tyrosine hydroxylase:  activation of the enzyme
by cyclic AMP-independent phosphorylation
<p class="Para1">
It was previously shown that cAMP could activate TH [<span
class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine,
tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating);
EC 1.14.16.2] in vitro in a reaction involving cAMP-dependent
protein kinase [ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37].
Activation by the protein kinase directly was a problem according
to some reports, but was found possible in earlier reports by us.
It is known that neuronal firing activates TH, possibly involving
cAMP-coupled signal pathways, but not exclusively, since reserpine
and haloperidol also activate TH without changing cAMP levels.
<p>
A cAMP-independent protein kinase (M kinase) was purified
from rat brain according to an earlier procedure (see Takai et al.,
<i>JBC</i> <b>252</b>: 7603, 1977).  To be maximally active,
limited proteolysis and 75&nbsp;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> were required
during initial stages of purification.  Purified enzyme (through
IEF and Amicon filtration) did not require trypsin-activation and
only 5&nbsp;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> was needed.  SDS gel analysis of
the pure protein reveals a 64 kDa band in agreement with the
weight previously estimated with analytical gel filtration.
When the protein is treated with trypsin, other bands present
in the G-100 step disappear on SDS gels, but the fraction is
highly active, with the 64 kDa subunit predominating:  this may be a
catalytic subunit to which inhibitory components bind either through strong
noncovalent interactions or S-S bonding.  Alone 2-mercaptoethanol
and Mg<sup>2+</sup> can activate the subunit as well.
<p>
IEF gels of the M kinase to which cAMP was added showed that
the M kinase ran to a pI of 5.5, which differs from PK-A in which its
catalytic subunit is found at 7.4 and 8.4.  Kinase A can be removed
in this way.  Comparison of activity with PK-A and PK-M using
&beta;-endorphin, &beta;-lipoprotein, and other peptides shows
that PK-M has a 30-fold greater activity to these first
two peptides than does PK-A, as previously reported.
<p>
<b>TH purification</b>.  1 kg bovine striatum was extracted
and centrifuged @ 30,000 g.  The supernatant was applied to a
DEAE-Sephadex A50 column and eluted with a linear salt gradient,
the pool of which was dialyzed and loaded on to a hydroxylapatite
column, which itself was eluted with a linear gradient of
phosphate buffer.  CM-Sephadex C50 was then used and eluted
with linear gradient of phosphate.  Active fractions were vacuum
dialyzed and centrifuged on 9-34% (w/v) glycerol gradients.
The enzyme obtained therefrom was 130-fold purified (1-4% yield).
Acid-urea gels demonstrated 90-100% purity.
<p>
<b>Phosphorylation and activation of TH</b>.  TH was then
incubated with PK-M in the presence of labeled ATP and
Mg<sup>2+</sup>.  When the reaction was done, it was loaded on
to SDS gels and autoradiographed.  PK-A catalytic subunit prepared
as well from bovine striatum was also used to treat TH.  The
result shows phosphorylation of TH.  Stoichiometry determined
with TCA-precipitated material was found to be 0.7-0.9 mol P/mol
enzyme for PK-A.  PK-A also showed nonstoichiometric
autophosphorylation of 0.2 mol P/mol subunit.
<p>
Double reciprocal plots of velocity and tetrahydrobiopterin
indicate a change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for BH<sub>4</sub> but no
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> change.  The control <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 1000 &micro;M
is higher than reported previously.  BH<sub>4</sub> concentration
was verified by UV absorption in 0.1 N HCl at 265 nm with extinction
coefficient of 16000 M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
The high <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> in the control may be due to its
dephosphorylated state.  The data shows overall that kinase
M is a cAMP-independent protein kinase capable of phosphorylating
and activating TH in vitro.  This kinase may be Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated
however, since micromolar concentrations of calcium affect kinase M
activity (according to Nishizuka and co-workers).  [Kinase M was
later called protein kinase C, or the calcium- and
phospholipid-dependent protein kinase.]

In vitro phosphorylation of bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase
by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein
<p class="Para1">
TH is partially purified from 143 g bovine adrenal medulla which
was centrifuged 105,000 g for 1 h, passed over an affinity column of
3-iodo-<span class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine-substituted Sepharose 4B (generated by mixing 1.5 g
3-iodo-<span class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine with 100&nbsp;ml Sepharose 4B activated with 15 g CNBr
at pH 11), and eluted from that column with pH 10 Tris after a 0.6 M KCl
wash.  Active fractions are passed over a heparin-Sepharose 4B (made
from activated 4B), which was washed with 0.1 M KCl and then eluted
with a 0.1 to 0.5 M KCl gradient.  A 0-40% AmSO<sub>4</sub> cut
is taken and can be stored or desalted on BioGel P-10 before
applying to phosphocellulose.  This column was eluted stepwise
with 0.5 M KCl in buffer.  It should be noted that after
heparin-Sepharose 4B, the enzyme specific activity is
52.5 nmol DOPA/min/mg with 30% yield (50 mg total protein).
After phosphocellulose, specific activity is 146 nmol DOPA/min/mg with

<p>
Commercial cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A) was used in
studies of the activation and phosphorylation of the purified TH.
Activation was shown to be approximately 3-fold and 310 pmol P was
incorporated in 48 &micro;g protein after 10 min.  Activation and
phosphorylation required the protein kinase, cAMP, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.
EDTA inhibited the reaction.  To ensure that phosphorylation
was into TH, 6-26% sucrose density gradient centrifugation of
activated TH in the presence of labeled ATP revealed that
phosphorylation was coincident in the gradient with the
presence of active TH.  Disc tube 6.3% polyacrylamide gels containing
0.23 M sucrose were run with the activated TH preparation, and
the presence of activity and labeled phosphate were once again
correlated.
<p>
Isoelectric focusing gels using 4% polyacrylamide with 0.23 M sucrose
and 2% ampholine (pH 5 to 8) according to Wrigley (1971, see
<i>Meth. Enzymol.</i>) were also run and the gel slices show
correlation of phosphate labeling and activity at a protein
with pI 6.6.  Activation of the enzyme was 4-fold.  SDS gels
were run according to the method of Weber and Osborn (<i>JBC</i>
<b>244</b>: 4406, 1969) and the gel was sliced and each slice counted.
A radioactive peak corresponding to a protein with MW 60,000 was
identified.

The role of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate in the
regulation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity
<p class="Para1">
The use of 56&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup> to activate TH in pheochromocytoma
cells has been shown by us previously.This depends upon the presence
of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as it is blocked by diphenylhydantion, which
inhibits the stimulus-coupled uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into cells.
Both cholera toxin (1 &micro;g/ml) and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP,
1&nbsp;mM) are also shown to activate TH 2-fold, just as does high
K<sup>+</sup>, all after 10 min incubation.  This activation does
not depend upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>, nor does diphenylhydantoin inhibit the
activation.  Maximal effect of the toxin was however obtainable with
just 100 ng/ml, and partial activation at 10 ng/ml.  A
0.1&nbsp;mM Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP did not induce TH activation.
<p>
A time course of TH activation and cholera toxin (1 &micro;g/ml)
was performed in which cAMP content levels were measured.
There is a lag of about 10 min before both cAMP content and
TH activity rise.  Maximal cAMP levels (at ~500 pmol cAMP/mg
protein) were reached by 20 min, half-maximal at 15 min and
were 6-fold higher than control levels.  TH activation reached
maximal at 30 min, half-maximal at 20 min, and was 2.5-fold
higher than control activity.
<p>
Double reciprocal plots (1/[S]=1/DMPH<sub>4</sub> cofactor) of
56&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup>-activated TH had indicated an increase
in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>, and no change in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values
for either cofactor or tyrosine.  Control cells have a TH
enzyme with <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> 26 &micro;M for tyrosine and 140-200 &micro;M
for cofactor (DMPH<sub>4</sub>).  Both the cholera toxin and
56&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup> showed changes in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
but no change in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for either tyrosine or
DMPH<sub>4</sub> cofactor.  (Double reciprocal plots were
also done for the BH<sub>4</sub>cofactor, but they were not linear.
Numata(Sudo) et al have reported that bovine adrenal medulla TH
shows two apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values for BH<sub>4.</sub>.)
<p>
Catecholamine biosynthesis was also measured, since it is
reasonable to expect that where TH activation occurs, CA synthesis is
enhanced.  Cells were incubated in labeled tyrosine and both dopamine
and norepinephrine were measured after treatment with
56&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup> (already previously shown to stimulate
CA synthesis in these cells), Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP, and cholera toxin.
The accumulation of NorEpi was greater than dopamine under the
conditions.  The toxin and Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP treatments had no effect on
uptake of tyrosine into cells nor on intracellular pools of tyrosine.
K<sup>+</sup> stimulation does reduce the specific radioactivity of
<sup>14</sup>C-tyrosine is about half that of control cells,
indicating mobilization of tyrosine or enhanced synthesis of it.
<p>
Catecholamine secretion was also studied.  Neither cholera toxin
nor Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP were found to stimulate secretion from
cells, and they differ from K<sup>+</sup> in this regard.  Since
all three enhance TH activation, it was important to see if
K<sup>+</sup> worked through increases in cAMP levels.  The
time course of 56&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup>-induced TH activation
was much different than the cAMP activation, without a detectable
lag period, with full activation in 3-5 min.  But more importantly,
cAMP content level is not shown to increase.
<p>
Already high levels of cAMP in controls may however make
cAMP changes difficult to detect. Cells were therefore
preincubated with [<sup>3</sup>H]adenine and then treated
with either cholera toxin or high K<sup>+</sup>.  Whereas
the toxin raised the [<sup>3</sup>H]cAMP level after 30 min,
high K<sup>+</sup> did not. (Cells had been incubated in these
experiments with 0.1&nbsp;mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine,
a phosphodiesterase inhibitor.  Results were similar anyway
in the absence of this compound.)  The same was true of a 10 min
incubation period.

Striatal tyrosine hydroxylase:  comparison of the activation
produced by depolarization and dibutyryl cAMP
<p class="Para1">
Preliminary work has shown that maximal TH activation is
achieved with 60&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup> and 5&nbsp;mM dibutyryl cAMP
(dB-cAMP).  Depolarization was therefore done with K<sup>+</sup>.
Since dB-cAMP is expensive however, only 1&nbsp;mM dB-cAMP was used in
the studies unless another concentration is indicated.
<p>
Striatal slices were incubated in either 60&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup>
or 1&nbsp;mM dB-cAMP over a time course.  In either case, activity
increases were maximal after 15 min, 2-fold in the case of
K<sup>+</sup> and 2.3 fold in the case of dB-cAMP.  TH activity
remained constant in controls.
<p>
In another experiment to check for combined treatment, K<sup>+</sup>
had raised TH activity 90% after 15 min while 10&nbsp;mM dB-cAMP
had increased activity 250%.Simultaneous incubation resulted
in a 480% increase (more than additive), suggesting the mechanisms of
activation are distinct.
<p>
Calcium dependence on K-induced depolarization was verified by
measuring activation in the absence of Ca in the media (KRP, which
normally has 1.3&nbsp;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>).  The activity after
15 min treatment was slightly but not significantly elevated
over controls (30-40%), and not as much as with K treatment with Ca
present (120%).  The presence of Ca was required only for K
depolarization, not dB-cAMP activated-increases.  Addition of
EGTA to Ca-free medium resulted in significant increases in TH
activity.  Simultaneous addition of EGTA and K<sup>+</sup> to
Ca-free medium resulted in no significant activity increases however.
<p>
The deactivation of TH in striatal slices subsequent to their
stimulation by K or by dB-cAMP was followed over a time course.
The K<sup>+</sup>-treated tissue followed a deactivation course
required at least 20 min in normal medium before TH activity fell
to control levels.  The deactivation of TH in dB-cAMP treated
tissue was more rapid, falling to basal levels after 10 min,
a rate of inactivation 1.5 times faster than for K.  TH was
also assayed for pH dependence of the stimulated enzymes, with
50&nbsp;mM MES used to assess the range 5.5 to 7.0 and 50 mM MOPS
used to assess the range between 6.8 and 8.0.  For either untreated
tissue or for K<sup>+</sup>-treated tissue, the pH optimum was
defined by a sharp peak at 6.0.  With dB-cAMP, the profile was
more complex, with a broader peak maximal at 7.5.In another
study using a single buffer, Tris-acetate, a narrower pH range
was examined (6.0 to 7.2), with the changes found to be less dramatic.
The same general trend was seen, with potassium-activated TH optimal
at 6.0 and dB-cAMP optimal between 7.0-7.4.  The maximal percentage
activation by potassium was seen in the range between 6.8-7.4,
while for dB-cAMP it was between 7.0 and 7.4.
<p>
The effect on dopamine concentration during the course of treatments
was assessed to see if these agents altered TH activity through
dopamine.  Slices were incubated in medium prior to homogenization
and TH activity analysis, and dopamine was determined to be
0.33 &micro;M.60&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup> treatment appears to reduce
the dopamine content by 29% (to 0.22 &micro;M), with a 100% increase
in TH activity under these conditions.  Slices incubated in
20&nbsp;mM K<sup>+</sup> or in dB-cAMP showed no significant
changes in endogenous dopamine, despite respective increases in TH
activation of 100% and 120%, resp., under these conditions.
Hence changes in endogenous dopamine are unlikely to account
for the TH activity changes observed during the treatments.

TH in cytosol was incubated with Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP over

a progressive increase 3.6-fold over the initial activity is seen

in the presence and absence of 5 &micro;M cAMP, 5 &micro;M cGMP,
100 &micro;M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2&nbsp;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> showed many
phosphoproteins but some specific differences with 5 &micro;M cAMP
or 2&nbsp;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.  Antiserum to purified bovine
medulla TH was used to immunoprecipitate TH from cytosol proteins.
Only in the presence of cAMP was a labeled protein at 60,000 Da
observed.  Study of the phosphorylation of the band and activation
of TH activity demonstrates a correlation, evidence that
phosphorylation of the 60 kDa band and TH activation are one in the same.
<p>
<b>Deactivation and Reactivation of TH</b>.  The endogenous
cAMP-dependent protein kinase present in the cytosol was used
to phosphorylate TH.  This activated TH was then deactivated
at 30&deg; after gel filtration to remove ATP and cAMP used
to effect the initial activation.  TH activity decreased 60%
after 5 min, reaching basal after 30 min in the presence of
5&nbsp;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>.  If Mg<sup>2+</sup> was omitted,
deactivation was blocked and was reversed by addition of
Mn<sup>2+</sup>.  Deactivation was inhibited by 20&nbsp;mM phosphate
and 5&nbsp;mM NaF, suggesting a phosphoprotein phosphatase involved
in the deactivation.  Deactivation of TH was completely reversed
by ATP and cAMP addition to a state of original activation.
<p>
<b>Dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation of TH</b>.
To ensure that deactivation is due to dephosphorylation,
phosphate release from activated enzyme was analyzed by
immunoprecipitation followed by SDS gel analysis.
Bovine medulla cytosol incubated in the presence of cAMP and
labeled ATP produced a single peak of radioactivity on the gel
located at the 60 kDa position.  PhosphoTH was gel filtered on
BioGel P-10 to remove ATP and cAMP, incubated for 30 min at 30&deg;,
and the radioactivity disappeared in the SDS gel.  This process
was inhibited by omission of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or by
addition of phosphate and NaF.  The enzyme could then be again
phosphorylated and activated as before.

The effects of phosphatidylinositol on tyrosine
hydroxylase: stimulation and inactivation
<p class="Para1">
Adult rabbit adrenals were used as sources of purified TH.
Note the procedure required 200 adrenals to get 50 g tissue,
homogenized in a Polytron for 20 s in Tris, sucrose, DTT.
High speed spin followed by filtering through glass wool.
The material is purified on heparin-Sepharose and eluted
with increasing KCl gradient.  After dialysis, on to
DEAE-cellulose which is eluted stepwise with AmSO<sub>4</sub>.
TH was then AmSO<sub>4</sub>-fractionated (consistently
coming out in the 20-35% saturation range).  Specific
activity is about 100 times the original extract.
<p>
Four naturally occurring phospholipids (phosphatidylserine
PS, phosphatidylinositol PI, phosphatidylcholine PC, and
phosphatidylethanolamine PE) and glycerophosphoinositol (GPI)
are added to the purified TH and TH activity vs. PL dose added
is plotted.  Both PI and PS showed dose-dependent activation,
while the others were flat.  The PI showed activation at
a lower dose than did PS.  Both PI and PS are anionic,
while the others have no net negative charge.  GPI is a
deacylated form of PI and shows no activating ability.
Katz et al (1976) had shown that high salt had a TH-activating
effect that was reversible.  Polyanionic activation with heparin
was also found, but reversible deactivation was slower.
Preliminary work shows that PI also shows a reversibility.
<p>
TH was prepared in two forms, free and enzyme adsorbed to
DEAE-cellulose.  Control and two different concentations of
PI were added and activity measured.  Another set, in which
DEAE-cellulose-adsorbed TH was centrifuged, the supernatant
removed, and buffer added, was measured for activity as well.
These data showed that about two-thirds of TH activity could be
recovered as adsorbed to DEAE and activatable by PI addition.
(No TH activity was found in the supernatants.)  In another set of
samples, the TH prep was combined with DEAE-cellulose,
sufficient PI added to fully stimulate enzyme, the mixture
centrifuged, supernatants removed, and PI added a second time
prior to evaluation.  A critical finding is that when enzyme
is first exposed to DEAE-cellulose, then to PI, activation by
prior exposure to PI does not occur.  Adsorbed enzyme was clearly
shown to be stimulated with subsequent PI addition.
PI added initially did not bind to the DEAE since supernatants
containing PI added to TH stimulated activation.
<p>
When PI and TH are incubated for a time above 0&deg;, TH rapidly
loses activity.  This inactivation appears to be
concentration-dependent, just as the activation.  Maximal
inactivation is when PI is 50 &micro;M, the same concentration
of PI producing maximal activation.  Any inactivation due to
the assay is not shown, since the assay was linear for 20 min.
A temperature dependence was also shown for PI-treated TH.
Control TH loses 60% of activity after 10 min at 45&deg;.
Addition of PI <i>after</i> that pre-incubation and just
before TH activity assay still produces a 4.5-fold activation of TH.
PI inactivation is dependent upon the duration of pre-incubation
with complete inactivation occurring with a 5 min preincubation
at 30&deg;.  The pH dependence was also assessed, in which PI
inactivation was greater at pH between 6.0 and 6.5, while none
occurred above pH 7.6.  In the absence of PI, no pH effect on
control enzyme was seen whether enzyme was kept at 0&deg; or
preincubated at 30&deg; for 5 min.  The effect of buffers
were analyzed:  PI-induced inactivation of TH occurred in predictable
time-dependent fashion in either Na acetate or Tris/HCl, but not at
all in KP<sub>i</sub> buffers.  KP<sub>i</sub> addtion to the
Tris/HCl buffer prevented inactivation.
<p>
Kinetic parameters related to both activation and inactivation
of TH by PI also examined.  A decrease in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> from 330 to 130 &micro;M is the observed effect.
Preincubation of TH with PI also reduced the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
by more than 90%.  There was no change at all in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for tyrosine in either the activation or inactivation study.
<p>
Other phospholipids have no effect on TH.  Mixing experiments
using different combinations of the PLs did not affect
PI-induced activation or inactivation.  PS alone can stimulate TH
activity, but PS-preincubation did not affect PI-induced inactivation.
<p>
It is possible that PI works directly on TH to inactivate
it, or acts directly to stimulate another factor which in
turn inactivates TH, or combines with a metabolite to act
in unison to deactivate TH.  TH was mixed with PI under
conditions which produce inactivation, the mixture was
boiled and cooled, then added to fresh TH.  Stimulation
of TH activity was found, and so the PI+TH pretreatment
does not produce a heat-stable-transferable inactivating factor.
The same PI+TH pretreatment mixture was extracted with organic
solvents, dried, and resuspended material added to fresh TH,
again with no inactivation.
<p>
A test of an inactivating, PI-activated protease capable of digesting
TH was tested, since limit tryptic digestions of TH lead to eventual
inactivation.Both PMSF (from 0.1 to 1&nbsp;mM) and soybean trypsin
inhibitor (from 100 to 500 &micro;g) were added over a concentration
range, but neither inhibited PI-induced inactivation.
<p>
A freely dissociable inactivating factor of enzymatic or
nonenzymatic origin would show different kinetics when
fresh TH is added to PI for the first time or to a mixture
of PI+TH already inactivated.  The inactivating factor would have already
been produced in the latter case and should rapidly inactivate fresh TH
compared to TH exposed to PI for the first time.  The results
show no rate difference in inactivation, so there is no secondary
agent responsible.
<p>
If TH activation of PI is reversible, is TH inactivation
by PI reversible?One approach is to partially inactivate
TH using PI, then attempt a re-activation with higher concentrations
(up to 4 times higher was used) of PI and PS:  results show no
re-activation.  A second approach is to remove PI from TH after
the inactivation, but no method is known which can do this
without causing a loss of TH activity.
<p>
In another approach, phosphorylating conditions have been
shown to cause TH activation (ATP, cAMP, and partially purified
protein kinase are added).Partially purified TH stimulate with
PI or exposed to phosphorylating conditions both produced the same
activation response.When PI is added to TH previously exposed to
control phosphorylating conditions, there is a TH activation.  No
such additional activation is seen when TH is preincubated under
enzymatic phosphorylating conditions.  TH which had been
inactivated by PI prior to enzymatic phosphorylating conditions
could also not be re-activated.  Hence the evidence is strong
but not wholly proven that PI-induced inactivation is irreversible.
<p>
PI-induced inactivation was tested during each step
following purification.After the 2nd (DEAE-cellulose) and 3rd
(AmSO<sub>4</sub> fractionation) steps, PI had no difficulty in
inactivating the enzyme.  The more purified TH became, the more
quickly PI seemed to inactivate it.  The TH extract resisted inactivation
somewhat.  But TH eluted from the 1st step (heparin-Sepharose)
resisted inactivation by PI altogether.  Later mixing seemed to show
that the protective factor was in a fraction of DEAE cellulose.
This protective factor was stable to strong acids and bases, and
not destroyed by ashing.  It is now shown that micromolar
concentrations of divalent cations can block PI-induced activation.
In order of potency they are:  Mn<sup>2+</sup> &gt; Ca<sup>2+</sup> &gt;
Sr<sup>2+</sup> &gt; Mg<sup>2+</sup> &gt; Ba<sup>2+</sup>.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) in the rat CNS: absence of specific
retrograde axonal transport and tyrosine hydroxylase induction in locus
coeruleus and substantia nigra
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:  Selective, highly efficient uptake of [<sup>125</sup>I]NGF
by nerve terminals followed by retrograde axonal transport, and
specific induction of tyrosine hydroxylase by NGF are well known
phenomena in peripheral adrenergic neurons of adult rats.  In the
present study these parameters were used in order to detect
possible interactions of NGF with central catecholaminergic neurons.
No selective retrograde transport of [<sup>125</sup>I]NGF could be
detected by light microscopic autoradiography from the
caudate nucleus to the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra
or from the hippocampus to the noradrenergic nerve cells of the locus
coeruleus.  Biochemically, no change in tyrosine hydroxylase activity
could be observed for up to 3 days after injection of
either NGF, anti-NGF antibodies, or control proteins close to
the nerve cell bodies in the substantia nigra or the locus coeruleus.
These data suggest a fundamental difference between central and
peripheral adrenergic neurons with regard to their responsiveness of NGF.

<h2>Autonomic Nervous System Control</h2>
<p>
The involuntary nervous system is divided into a <b>sympathetic</b>
and <b>parasympathetic</b> control, which are generally antagonistic
to each other where they innervate and control common organs.
Below is a description of the organ/tissue which are controlled
by these two parts, and the effect which their activation has
on the organ or tissue.

<h2>Receptor Physiology</h2>
<p>
Receptors for neurotransmitters are generally of two types:
<b>cholinergic</b> and <b>adrenergic</b>.

<h3>Cholinergic system</h3>
<p>
Cholinergic receptors are probably the most abundant in terms of where they are 
found in the CNS and PNS.  Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter of choice in 
the preganglionic neurons of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems 
and in the postganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic system.  Cholinergic 
receptors must therefore be located on the postsynaptic membranes to elicit 
continued nerve transmission.
<p>
Cholinergic receptors are subdivided into two types: <b>nicotinic</b> and 
<b>muscarinic</b>.  Acetylcholine is the physiological agonist which can occupy 
both receptors under certain conditions.  The <i>nicotinic</i> receptor is of a 
single class, and is found in striated (skeletal) muscle innervations, autonomic 
ganglia, and the central nervous system (see table). <b><i>Nicotine</i></b> is 
the specific agonist for stimulating this receptor class, afterward blocking 
further stimulation of this receptor.  The antagonists are typically 
<b>d<i>-tubocurarine</i></b>, which blocks the nicotinic cholinergic receptors 
in the skeletal muscle and autonomic ganglia, and <b><i>hexamethonium</i></b>, 
which principally blocks the receptors in the autonomic ganglia. The 
<i>muscarinic</i> receptor is characterized by two receptor classes, 
M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub>, which also have different affinities for 
different drugs.  Both receptors are activated by <b><i>muscarine</i></b> and 
the antagonist of choice for these receptors is <b><i>atropine</i></b>. The 
M<sub>1</sub> receptor is found primarily in the autonomic ganglia and CNS, 
while the M<sub>2</sub> receptor is found at the terminal arborizations in the 
end organ and in the CNS (see table).

<h3>Adrenergic system</h3>
<p>
The adrenergic system uses the catecholamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, 
norepinephrine, epinephrine) at its nerve terminals. These transmitters are 
secreted from nerve terminals in neurons of the CNS and from many but not all of 
the postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic PNS.
<p>
Receptors for these neurotransmitters also come in two classes: <b>&alpha;</b> 
and <b>&beta;</b>.  These receptor classes are further subdivided into 
particular classes showing different affinities for the different catecholamines 
and drugs which bind them.  The table below illustrates all of these variables.

Tyrosine hydroxylase: a substrate of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
TH from rat pheochromocytoma was purified from extracts
which had been centrifuged at 100,000 g. Supernatants were subjected to
30-42% AmSO<sub>4</sub> precipitation, DEAE-cellulose, 0-44%
AmSO<sub>4</sub>, hydroxylapatite, 0-50% AmSO<sub>4</sub>, and then 5-20%
sucrose gradients.
<p>
TH was assayed at subsaturating cofactor concentrations under
conditions optimal for protein phosphorylation. Activated enzyme showed a
decreased <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the cofactor 6-methyltetrahydropteridine (from
480 &micro;M to 120 &micro;M) with no change in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for
tyrosine (74 &micro;M) or <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>. Crude TH could be activated
in the same manner
under the same phosphorylating conditions. Crude and purified TH exhibited
linearity on double reciprocal plots with tyrosine as the varied substrate
in the absence of ATP, cAMP, and protein kinase. When cofactor was varied,
there was a deviation from linearity however. This nonlinearity with
respect to cofactor was changed when TH was phosphorylated however.
<p>
Purified preparations of PK-A catalytic subunit was incubated with
purified TH and the activation was absolutely dependent upon
Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ATP, and catalytic subunit concentrations. Activation was
proportional to the amount of subunit present up to 3 &micro;g under the
conditions of this assay.
<p>
Activation of TH was correlated to <sup>32</sup>P incorporation into
TCA-precipitable protein when preincubation of TH was done in varying
amounts of C subunit, labeled ATP, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. After 15 min
incubation at 30&deg;, phosphate incorporation continues but TH activity falls
to basal levels, in contrast to a linear increase before the 15 min time
period. Without C subunit, no P incorporation is observed. Use of
alpha-labeled P in ATP instead of gamma-labeled P produces the same
result. Stoichiometric measurement indicates 0.7 mol P/mol 60,000
M<sub>r</sub> subunit of TH. 10 min or less incubation times show specific
phosphorylation to TH. If allowed to proceed to 20 min at 30&deg;,
phosphorylation of a 40 kDa band becomes evident, which may be the
phosphorylation of the C subunit observed after it suffers thermal
denaturation. The reason for loss of TH activity after 15 min of
phosphorylation is unclear, since the control TH demonstrated no such
deactivation: phosphorylation may create an instability in the enzyme.
<p>
TH was compared to histone H1 as a substrate for PK-A. The rate of TH
phosphorylation was found to be 2 to 2.5 times that of the rate of histone
H1 phosphorylation.

and their constituent peptides
<p class="Para1">
Heparin effects are minimized by such agents as lysyl
residues on the antithrombin protein surface. Poly-L-lysyltyrosine and
poly-L-lysylphenylalanine were incubated in the presence of heparin, and
TH activation was decreased with increasing polymer concentration. When
the lysine:aromatic amino acid ratio was increased within the polymer
structure, the inhibition of activation was more pronounced. Increasing
the heparin concentration at fixed polymer concentration overcame this
observed inhibition. When the copolymers were used without heparin, they
were able to inhibit TH activity even further. The Lys-Tyr copolymer was
more effective than the Lys-Phe at inhibiting TH.
<p>
Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS), another glycosaminoglycan, were
compared for their effects. HS has 2.5 times the anionic charge density
but was unable to activate TH. Several preparations of HS were used,
including one that closely resembled heparin with respect to charge
density and conformation. Sulfated-keratan sulfate is metachromatic and
has conformational similarity to heparin and HS, and it failed to
activate.
<p>
The IC<sub>50</sub> for poly-Lys-Tyr is about 460 &micro;M. At 350 &micro;M
poly-Lys-Tyr, inhibition is 35% and is reversed with heparin addition.
Five-fold more heparin (from 460 &micro;M to 2.35 mM) is necessary to

inhibition curve indicates a half-maximal activation heparin concentration
of 6 mM (it would require further study to accurately determine a
<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> from higher degrees of inhibition).  This is
13 times greater than the control and 2.5 times the concentration determined
from 35% inhibition.  This contrasts with the result that heparin
overcame poly-Lys-Tyr inhibition at three times the IC<sub>50</sub>,
with an apparent <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> three times that in the absence
of poly-Lys-Tyr.
<p>
A plot of the percent activity against the Lys-Tyr/heparin charge ratio
for constant heparin concentration was done for two heparin concentrations.
The qualitative change in IC<sub>50</sub> of Lys-Tyr at 2.4 and 6.3
mM heparin charge was 550 and 640 &micro;M Lys-Tyr, resp., compared to
460 &micro;M in the absence of heparin.  A negative homotropic effect
of Lys-Tyr is contrasted with Lys-Phe or Lys alone, which had little
effect on TH activity.  Lys-Phe also did not inhibit the ability of
heparin to activate TH.
<p>
TH activity was measured as a function of BH<sub>4</sub> concentration
in the presence of 0.8 mM Lys-Tyr.  A 4-fold increase in BH<sub>4</sub>
cannot overcome inhibition by Lys-Tyr.  This was seen a marked decrease
in apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> with any significant change in the
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for BH<sub>4</sub>; tyrosine is 50 &micro;M.  The
apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine is 15 &micro;M in the absence of
Lys-Tyr.  With Lys-Tyr at its IC<sub>50</sub>, the tyrosine <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
is 125 &micro;M.
<p>
Different fractions of heparin were prepared on Sephadex G-200 and
checked for their ability to activate TH.  Fraction 14-16 consisted
of 5% of the somewhat high MW fraction and gave the highest activation
of TH.  The bulk (loading) and fraction 24-27 (representing 40% of the
total) gave relative lower activation.
<p>
Since Lys-Tyr was an effective inhibitor of TH, its potential as a ligand
in affinity chromatography purification of TH was investigated.
Lys-Tyr was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose, and striatal extracts
were passed over the column and eluted by stepwise chromatography.
A 7-fold improvement was observed in purity.  Affinity-purified TH
on heparin and Lys-Tyr columns were compared kinetically, and there
were no differences in the ability of BH<sub>4</sub> to overcome
Lys-Tyr inhibition, nor in the apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of
BH<sub>4</sub>.

Feedback inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase from five
regions of rat brain by 2-hydroxyestradiol and dihydroxyphenylalanine
<p class="Para1">
Each previously reported example of product feedback
inhibition indicates that there is a competition of the catechol for the
pterin cofactor. In these assays several pterin cofactors which work with
TH were used at their in vitro <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>, since the level of
endogenous pterin represents a more physiological approach. The following
are approximate <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for pterins: tetrahydrobiopterin,
75 &micro;M; 6-methyltetrahydropterin, 200 &micro;M; 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin,
500 &micro;M.
<p>
TH was isolated from the preoptic region of the rat brain and assayed
using DMPH<sub>4</sub> and the concentration of two catechol inhibitors
were varied, DOPA and 2-hydroxyestradiol. 50% inhibition was produced at
~50 &micro;M 2-hydroxyestradiol and ~125 &micro;M DOPA. Basal TH activity was
measured in five regions (amygdala, preoptic region, hypothalamus,
striatum, and hippocampus) of the brain with the 3 different pterins: the
highest activities were in the preoptic region and the striatum.
<p>
The apparent K<sub>i</sub> for both inhibitors was plotted by category
against the five regions of the brain with the 3 different pterins
compared. In 9 of the 10 studies, the extent of inhibition is least
pronounced in the presence of synthetic cofactor, DMPH<sub>4</sub>. With
DOPA as the inhibitor, the most potent effect was with the natural
cofactor, BH<sub>4</sub>. With the catechol estrogen, the K<sub>i</sub>
was lowest with 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>. In contrast, when the synthetic
DMPH<sub>4</sub> was used, 5-10 times as much inhibitor was necessary to
bring about 50% inhibition.

Interaction of tyrosine hydroxylase with tubulin
<p class="Para1">
Bovine adrenal medulla was extracted and tubulin prepared
from it. SDS gels showed an alpha-beta doublet on the stained gel and EM
showed intact microtubules (MTs). Assays of TH activity showed 5-10%
associated with the low speed pellet while 90-95% was in the supernatant,
demonstrating TH's affinity for MTs. This was true for pig brain as well.
Cycling of polymerization-depolymerization essentially reduced total TH
activity after the first cycle, with 6% of the starting value present and
associated with the MTs. TH activity nonspecifically bound to MTs would be
expected to be lower than measured, so it is possible that TH binds MTs in
vivo quite specifically.
<p>
A constant level of TH activity was incubated with varying tubulin
concentrations about to undergo a fourth cycle of polymerization. After
polymerization and centrifugation, it is shown that increasing tubulin
concentration results in a decreased supernatant TH activity, which was
found to increase in the pellet. A saturation curve was found and shown to
indicate a <i>K</i><sub>D</sub>=15 &micro;M of the tubulin for
the TH complex. Double reciprocal plots of the curve shows an
extrapolation of 100% binding of TH to the pellet. An equilibrium between
dimeric tubulin and polymeric microtubules suggests that TH associates
more tightly with MTs than with tubulin. To see if net electric charge
caused association with the protein, catalase (with a pI = 5.8) was added
(TH pI = 6.0) and found not to associate with pelleted proteins. TH
activity was measured in pellets after incubation at 35&deg; (which causes
polymerization) followed by cooling to 5&deg; (which causes depolymerization).
Only 20% of TH activity could be found with the cooled aggregates whereas
70-80% of the activity could be found with the 35&deg; aggregates. Controls
without tubulin in either the cooled or heated mixtures showed TH activity
to always be in the supernatant. The turbidity measurements also showed
very good reversibility of polymerization in the presence of TH. EM
verified the presence of MTs at 35&deg;, and only small aggregates after
cooling.
<p>
Proteolyzed TH was then added to a fourth cycle of polymerization, but
did not bind to the MTs like the native form. To investigate this
phenomenon, TH was added to a 4th cycle of polymerization in the presence
of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or poly-L-lysine. A report has shown that cations or
polycations can substitute for MAP and induce tubulin polymerization. The
results show that while Mg<sup>2+</sup> did not interfere with
association, increased Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased TH inactivation. In the
absence of tubulin, poly-L-lysine caused TH to precipitate (only 6.5% was
in soluble form). With tubulin addition to the remaining activity,
sedimentation of a smaller % of TH activity was obtained compared to that
obtained in the absence of poly-L-lysine, which can be interpreted as a
competition between TH and polylysine for association with MT.
<p>
TH has been found to associate with heparin- or
dextran-sulfate-substituted Sepharose 6B and is eluted by salts. It does
not bind to dextran Sepharose 6B. Proteolyzed enzyme does not associate
with any column. These facts and the data above suggest a strong cationic
site away from the active site of TH which can bind electrostatically to
tubulin, known to have very acidic residues in the C-terminal portion (for
the porcine brain alpha tubulin).
<p>
Additional experiments are reported to assess the role of TH as a
substitute for MAP in the initiation of MT polymerization. In the presence
of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, TH does cannot cause repolymerization after a cold
treatment. With MAP and TH present, the possibility that TH affects
elongation was considered possible: while TH did not affect rate of
assembly, the extent of turbidity variation was greater with TH present.
EM demonstrated MTs and aggregates in this case.

Involvement of calmodulin in the
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of rat brainstem tyrosine
3-monooxygenase
<p class="Para1">
TH was purified from rat brainstem and in Ca<sup>2+</sup>
or cAMP with MgATP present, TH activation was observed. When activity vs.
pH was measured, maximum activation with Ca<sup>2+</sup> was observed at
pH 6.2, with a sharp profile about this optimum. With cAMP however, a
broad maximum from pH 6.2 to 6.9 was observed. Combined incubation of
Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP showed an additivity to the activity observed;
all this suggests that the mechanisms by which each mediator works is
distinct. Simon and Roth have previously shown the depolarization and
incubation with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP of rat striatal slices shows a
similarly additive activation. Rat adrenal gland TH showed no effect from
Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment, although cAMP in presence of MgATP did.
<p>
In previous work in this laboratory, rat brainstem cytosolic Trp
hydroxylase activation has been shown to be controlled by an endogenous
CaM-dependent protein kinase. We now show that TH may be controlled by CaM
as well, in which the reaction required MgATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. There
was no activation if any of the components (CaM, Mg, Ca, or ATP) were not
included. Activation was time- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, with 10
&micro;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> required for maximal activation (using an apparent
binding constant for CaEGTA of 8 x 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>). This
CaM-dependent phosphorylation caused a decrease in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for
6-MPH<sub>4</sub> from 500 to 180 &micro;M, while there was no
change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine. Previous work has suggested that
brain TH is regulated by both PK-A and CaM-mediated systems while adrenal
TH is modulated only by PK-A.

Compensatory increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in
rat brain after intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The neurotoxin
6-hydroxydopamine produced a permanent loss of endogenous norepinephrine
and of 3H-labeled norepinephrine uptake sites in the hippocampus within 5
days. These losses were initially accompanied by parallel decreases in
tyrosine hydroxylase activity and synaptosomal norepinephrine synthesis.
Within 21 days, however, hippocampal tyrosine hydroxylase activity and
norepinephrine synthesis rate increased three- to fivefold. These data
suggest a novel form of plasticity in brain-damaged animals characterized
by an increase in the capacity for transmitter biosynthesis in residual

Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase regulates catecholamine
synthesis in pheochromocytoma cells
<p class="Para1">
Pheochromocytoma cells were prepared in suspensions and
incubated in NaCl (118), KCl (4.7), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5),
MgSO<sub>4</sub> (1.2), pargyline (0.01), glucose (10) and HEPES-NaOH, pH
7.4 (25), all values in mM, for 30 min at 37&deg;. Cells incubated under these
control conditions in the presence of brocresine produce DOPA at 100
pmol/min/mg protein. Treatment with 56 mM K<sup>+</sup> or cholera toxin
causes a 2- to 3-fold increase in DOPA prodn rate. <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> in the
extracts of these cells is about 1000 pmol/min/mg protein.
<p>
To distinguish between an increase in tyrosine content vs. change in TH
activation as the cause of DOPA rate increase, measurements of tyrosine
show 2.1 nmol/mg protein under control conditions, which is ~190 &micro;M if
one considers that there is 11 &micro;l intracellular water/mg protein and
tyrosine is distributed uniformly throughout this water. This is much
greater than the apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of TH in vitro. It is unlikely
that DOPA formation would therefore change due to increases in tyrosine
content. With 56 mM K<sup>+</sup> treatment, the tyrosine content falls to
about one-half the control (1.1 nmol/mg), while cholera toxin treatment
gives a value of 1.5 nmol/mg. Brocresine does not appear to have an effect
on the tyrosine content. In the absence of brocresine, however, the cells
accumulate very little DOPA, being rapidly converted to catecholamines.
<p>
Since TH is inhibited by its substrate, the effect that K<sup>+</sup>
or cholera toxin might have on lowering tyrosine content could improve
activity by relieving substrate inhibition. In this case extracellular
[Tyr] was varied to examine its effect: increasing extracellular [Tyr]
provoked a correlated increase in cell tyrosine content. 20 to 50 &micro;M
extracellular tyrosine caused a 0.5 to 2.5 nmol/mg content and maximal
rates of DOPA production. Cells with &gt;100 &micro;M tyrosine have an
intracellular content &gt;3 nmol/mg and there DOPA decreases slightly. The
decrease in intracellular tyrosine at this point is not likely to have a
significant effect on DOPA production, so the effect of the agents must
occur as something other than relief of substrate inhibition.
<p>
Effects of K<sup>+</sup> and cholera toxin on tyrosine uptake examined
as well. At 100 &micro;M, uptake is about 3.6 nmol/min/mg, which is 10 times
higher than the DOPA production rate: hence this step is not
rate-limiting. While cholera toxin had no effect on tyrosine uptake, 56 mM
K<sup>+</sup> treatment reduced it 30%, but this decrease may be the
result of lowered Na<sup>+</sup>, since tyrosine uptake is reduced by
&gt;50% in Na<sup>+</sup>-free media. This also supports the earlier
observation that the K<sup>+</sup>-treated cells had less tyrosine content
because of decreased uptake than the cholera toxin-treated cells.

Nerve growth factor mediates phosphorylation of specific proteins
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells were cultured in DME + 10% horse serum + 10%
FCS in 12% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Cells were labeled with
<sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> and various cell fractions isolated, then
analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Any specific bands on the gel containing label were
normalized to the total isotope in a lane when using densitometry; their
susceptibility to pronase and resistance to RNase and DNase digestion
indicated their protein nature.
<p>
Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml of low MW form of NGF (&beta;-NGF)
and the pattern of phosphorylation observed over 10
experiments. Major changes in band pattern noticed in each experiment are
considered significant for that band. In the non-nuclear fraction, three
proteins labeled A to C were consistently found to be major
phosphorylation products significantly increased in phosphorylation.
Proteins A and B had apparent MW of 60 and 31 kDa, resp. NGF-treated Band
A was 2.8-fold greater in phosphorylation than control, while the lower MW
band B was 9.1-fold greater. Four nuclear proteins D to G were readily
identified as consistently phosphorylated. Band D had an apparent MW of 30
kDa, while bands C, E, F, and G all had MWs somewhere between 10 and 20
kDa. Bands D and F incorporated 4.7 and 2.7-fold more phosphate, resp.,
over controls. Band G phosphorylation was reduced with NGF treatment.
<p>
Changes in phosphorylation can come about as a result of increased
phosphorylation of existing protein, or by an increased synthesis of
proteins which have a normal phosphorylation state. To eliminate one of
these possibilities, the cells are treated with 50 &micro;g/ml cycloheximide
and 30 &micro;g/ml puromycin for 30 min, then labeled with
<sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> for another 75 min in the presence or absence
of NGF. Controls are NGF-treated and labeled cells but without the protein
synthesis inhibitors. Under such conditions, the inhibitors had no effect
on increased phosphorylation with or without NGF. When synthesis
inhibitors were added for 3 h rather than 30 min, overall phosphorylation
in the absence of NGF was reduced by 60%, but NGF treatment produced a
greater degree of phosphorylation than under uninhibited circumstances.
<p>
The enhancement by NGF of phosphorylation was dependent upon an NGF
concentration in the physiological range (according to a dose course
done). A biphasic tendency was somewhat apparent, but varied as to when
the inflection point (plateau) was reached; this biphasic tendency is the
rapid stimulation at very low concentrations of NGF, followed by a slower
stimulation toward the maximal at concentrations (&gt;5-10 ng/ml) slightly
above these lower doses. The degree of stimulation over a time course
depends initially upon the length of time that cells are treated with NGF,
and the stimulation then becomes invariant with time for several days.
Non-nuclear proteins examined (bands A-C) reached 50% of their
phosphorylation maximum by 3 min, with maximal phosphorylation in 15 min.
Nuclear proteins (bands D-F) lagged at least 5 min in their 50% maximal
point, and maximal phosphorylation was reached at 30 min. Cells grown in
NGF for 3 days then <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>-labeled show a persistent
stimulated phosphorylation. The data indicate that NGF induces a new
steady state level of phosphorylation of a specific subset of cellular
proteins, a level achieved more rapidly for non-nuclear than nuclear
proteins maintained for days in the presence of NGF.
<p>
Phosphorylated proteins were fractionated into soluble and particulate
fractions. Protein B was found in the particulate, protein C entirely
soluble, and protein A distributed into both the soluble and particulate
(some was also found in the nuclear fraction). Band B was also collected
in the polysome fraction of centrifuged layers of 2.5 M sucrose. When
ribosomes were purified and dissociated, and the subunits resolved on
10-25% sucrose gradients, the protein B is found in the 40S subunit; its
MW and exclusive presence in the 40S subunit reveal it to be the S6
protein.
<p>
Dexamethasone increased production of band A (a 60 kDa) and these data
suggest band A is tyrosine hydroxylase. Immunoprecipitation using anti-TH
then resolved on SDS-PAGE shows this to be true. Hence, NGF enhances
phosphorylation of TH.
<p>
As for the nuclear proteins, the fact that the NGF-enhanced
phosphorylation of these proteins was of proteins that were the major
proteins present according to Coomassie staining suggests that these
proteins are histones. Using a differential salt extraction routine for
histones (Butler et al., <i>Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol</i>. <b>18</b>: 209,
1968), the histone proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
<sup>32</sup>P-labeled bands D, F, and G, co-migrated with
histone standards and fractionated according to procedure. Histones have a
characteristic migration on these types of gels (Weintraub et al.,
<i>Cell</i> <b>6</b>: 85, 1975), and based on that,bands D, F, and G have
been assigned as histones H1A, H3, and H2A, resp. The histone-like
protein IP25 was not phosphorylated in response to
NGF, even after 3 days of treatment. Both band D and IP25 were selectively
extracted with 5% PCA, a characteristic of histone H1A and IP25.
<p>
Band E was extractable in 0.35 M NaCl, a feature of the non-histone
high mobility group (HMG) proteins. HMG has been found not only in
chromatin, but also in cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. These proteins have a
solubility in acid and rapid mobility during gel electrophoresis. An S150
fraction (cytoplasm) and nuclear extract (with 5 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>, pH
7.4 and either no salt for nucleoplasm and 0.35 M salt for nonhistone
chromosomal fraction) were treated with 2% TCA and the precipitins
analyzed. Proteins not precipitated with 2% TCA were then treated with 20%
TCA. This fraction was SDS-PAGE-analyzed and the proteins HMG 1, 2, 14,
and 17 were found. Bands C and E were thus found to correspond to HMG 17,
meaning it is the only HMG phosphorylated in response to NGF.
<p>
Does NGF work by activation of the cAMP-mediated phosphorylation
system? Dibutyryl cAMP (Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP) was added to P-labeled PC12
cells and the phosphorylation pattern assessed. This pattern is
indistinguishable from the pattern of NGF-treated cells. All proteins
phosphorylated by NGF are also phosphorylated with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP
addition to 1 mM, and no new bands are phosphorylated by
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP presence. 1 &micro;g/ml cholera toxin (CT) also elevated
cAMP, and its pattern of phosphorylation was also indistinguishable from
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP and NGF. Quantitation of phosphate incorporation in
selected bands reveal the increase is similar with all 3 treatments.
Phosphorylation with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP was dose-dependent and saturable
(at 1 mM), and the same is true for CT. Addition of cAMP (1 mM) produced
no response, consistent with a finding that the underivatized cAMP does
not readily enter cells and is nonetheless quickly degraded by PDE.
Addition of cAMP + theophylline (a PDE inhibitor) did however produce an
effect 90% of the NGF response, with a pattern identical to other such
treatments.
<p>
Other hormones (EGF and insulin) have also been found to enhance
protein phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins, doing so by a
mechanism distinct from cAMP. EGF was added to P-labeled PC12 cells and
there was also increased phosphorylation in Bands A (TH), B (S6), and D
(histone H1) on SDS-PAGE gels. Bands F and G (both histones) did not
change appreciably, and other proteins were not affect as well. The EGF
action is dose-dependent and saturable at physiological concentrations
(maximal response at 4 ng/ml).
<p>
Insulin addition stimulated band B, D, and F. Band G phosphorylation
was reduced. The amount of P incorporated was similar to other effectors.
Insulin stimulation of TH phosphorylation was insignificant. Band C and E
phosphorylation was little, similar to EGF response. Phosphorylation was
dose-dependent and saturable (at 3 &micro;U/ml).
<p>
The NGF-induced phosphorylations were distinct from the EGF- and
insulin-stimulated phosphorylations, practically identical with
cAMP-mediated responses. If cAMP is the way in which NGF works, saturable
concentrations should not elicit additive effects, and other mechanisms
(like EGF- and insulin-induced) should be additive. Since S6 is
phosphorylated by all treatments, it is used as a reference. It is noted
that all growth factor treatments (insulin, EGF, and NGF) were additive to
each other with respect to S6 phosphorylation. Additivity was also found
with EGF, insulin, and CT. The NGF + CT combination was not additive. NGF
+ Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP was also not additive.

The long-term regulation of ganglionic tyrosine hydroxylase by
preganglionic nerve activity
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The role of neural activity
in the long-term regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase in peripheral
adrenergic neurons had been studied by electrically stimulating the
preganglionic nerves innervating the superior cervical ganglion. Tyrosine
hydroxylase activity was elevated maximally 3 days after stimulation. The
magnitude of the increase varied from 25 to 120% depending on the
frequency and duration of the stimulation. Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase
activity was also increased after preganglionic nerve stimulation, but
there was no change in dopa decarboxylase activity or in the ganglion
protein content. The increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity is
paralleled by a comparable increase in the amount of immunoreactive
tyrosine hydroxylase in the ganglia. This increase in enzyme activity
could be prevented by pretreating animals with the ganglion-blocking drugs
hexamethonium or chlorisondamine but was unaffected by administration of
atropine or dihydroergotamine. Antidromic stimulation did not mimic the
effects of orthodromic stimulation indicating that an increase in the
firing rate of the neurons was not a sufficient condition for the
long-term elevation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. These studies
demonstrate that periods of increased synaptic stimulation can alter the
protein composition of sympathetic neurons, increasing the specific
activity of the key enzyme involved in their transmitter biosynthesis.

Increased ganglionic tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase
activities following preganglionic nerve stimulation: role of nicotine
receptors
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The activity of the enzyme
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) can be increased in the rat superior cervical
ganglion by stimulating the preganglionic cervical sympathetic trunk.
Since nicotinic, muscarinic and alpha adrenergic receptors have been
implicated in ganglionic transmission, the role of each of these receptors
in the trans-synaptic regulation of TH activity has been studied.
Chlorisondamine, administered at a dose which completely blocks ganglion
transmission, blocked the increase in TH activity. Atropine and
dihydroergotamine, injected at doses which block peripheral muscarinic and
alpha adrenergic receptors, respectively, did not significantly affect the
increase in enzyme activity. Thus, of these three receptor systems, only
nicotinic receptors seem to play a major role in the increase in TH
activity produced by preganglionic nerve stimulation. Simultaneous
measurements of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase and
dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activities indicate that both TH and
dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activities increase after stimulation of the
cervical sympathetic trunk, although dopa decarboxylase activity is
unchanged. The time courses of the increase in TH and
dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activities were similar, both reaching maximum
values 3 days after the end of a 90-min period of nerve stimulation.

Effects of synaptic and antidromic stimulation on
tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the rat superior cervical ganglion
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: 1. The effects of orthodromic
and antidromic stimulation of the rat superior cervical ganglion on the
specific activity of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase have been studied. 2.
Orthodromic stimulation of the ganglion via the sympathetic trunk produced
an increase in the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase when measured 3 days
later while causing no change in the protein content of the ganglion. This
increase in the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase was blocked by
administration of the nicotinic antagonist, hexamethonium. 3. Antidromic
stimulation of the superior cervical ganglion by stimulating the internal
carotid nerve, the external carotid nerve or both nerves simultaneously
produced no change in the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase. 4.
Parallel increases in tyrosine hydroxylase activity and protein content
per ganglion were seen when the internal carotid nerve was stimulated but
similar changes were seen in "sham-stimulated" animals. These
"non-specific" changes were apparently produced by the trauma involved in
the extensive dissection necessary to position electrodes on this nerve
trunk. 5. We conclude that an increase frequency of firing in
post-ganglionic neurones is not a sufficient stimulus to elevate the
specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase. Rather some other aspect of
nicotinic receptor stimulation seems to be required.

Inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase, a Fe(II)-stimulated
monooxygenase, by bleomycin
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase was
shown to be inhibited in vitro by bleomycin. At a concentration of
10<sup>-4</sup> M, copper-free BLM-A2 inhibited tyrosine hydroxylase
activity by 50%, and all other bleomycins investigated including
copper-bound BLM-A2 showed similar degrees of inhibition of tyrosine
hydroxylase. The kinetic data have shown that the inhibition by BLM-A2 is
competitive with a tetrahydropterin cofactor (6-methyl-tetrahydropterin)
and uncompetitive with tyrosine. The inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase by
bleomycin was not reversed by Fe(II) or superoxide dismutase. These
results suggest that the inhibition may be neither due to the chelating
action of bleomycin with ferrous ion nor due to the production of
superoxide and hydroxyl radicals by the formation of an oxygen-labile
Fe(II)-bleomycin complex.

Preganglionic nerve stimulation increases the amount of
tyrosine hydroxylase in the rat superior cervical ganglion
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Seventy-two hours after a 90
min period of electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk,
tyrosine hydroxylase activity was twice as high in homogenates of
stimulated ganglia than in homogenates of contralateral control ganglia.
When aliquots of the homogenates of the two groups of ganglia were mixed,
the tyrosine hydroxylase activity was additive. Immunoprecipitation
studies using an antibody prepared against purified tyrosine hydroxylase
demonstrated that the doubling in enzyme activity is accompanied by a
doubling in the amount of immunoprecipitable material. Thus the increase
in tyrosine hydroxylase activity can be totally accounted for by an
increase in the amount of tyrosine hydroxylase in the ganglion.

Amphetamine-haloperidol interactions on striatal and
mesolimbic tyrosine hydroxylase activity and dopamine metabolism
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Rat striatal and mesolimbic
dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic
acid levels and the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TOH) were determined
as a function of dose of amphetamine (AMPH) or haloperidol (HAL). AMPH
increases DA levels with an ED<sub>50</sub> of 0.6 mg/kg and decreases
DOPAC and homovanillic acid levels with an ED50 of 1.5 mg/kg, suggesting
two sites of action for the drug. HAL increases DOPAC and homovanillic
acid levels and activates TOH all with an ED50 near 0.05 mg/kg and maximal
activation at 0.2 mg/kg. AMPH administered subsequent to 0.2 mg/kg of HAL
has no effect on mesolimbic TOH activity or DA metabolism. In contrast
AMPH after HAL still increases striatal DA levels and, in addition,
partially reverses the HAL-induced increases in both DOPAC levels and TOH
activity, all with an ED50 near 0.6 mg/kg. The maximal reversal by AMPH is
near 25% of the HAL-induced increases with doses of AMPH to 10 mg/kg. The
ED50 for AMPH reversal and the extent of reversal are independent of HAL
dose. The equivalent reversal by AMPH of HAL-induced increases in striatal
TOH activity and DOPAC levels suggest a neuronally mediated phenomenon
involving a noncompetitive interaction between the two drugs on the
nigrostriatal pathway. The data are discussed in terms of sites of action
for AMPH in both the striatum and the substantia nigra.

The participation of cyclic nucleotides and protein kinase in the
regulation of norepinephrine synthesis and release during nerve stimulation
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Considerable evidence has
accumulated in recent years to suggest that cyclic AMP-dependent protein
kinase is responsible for the activation of tyrosine hydroxylase following
nerve stimulation. Since stimulation of the central nervous system either
by electrical impulses or by exposure of intact brain tissue to
depolarizing concentrations of potassium is associated with an activation
of adenylate cyclase and an increase in cyclic AMP, it is possible that
the normal physiological mechanism by which catecholamine synthesis is
enhanced during nerve stimulation involves modification of the enzyme by
protein kinase. It has been demonstrated that, in the presence of cyclic
AMP, ATP, Mg++ and protein kinase, purified preparations of tyrosine
hydroxylase are directly phosphorylated. Since cyclic nucleotides also
have been implicated in the process of neurally mediated transmitter
release, it is conceivable that activation of adenylate cyclase
presynaptically is a common mechanism by which both catecholamine
synthesis and norepinephrine release are enhanced during nerve
stimulation. Although agonists and antagonists of many putative
presynaptic receptors have been found to modulate norepinephrine release
during nerve stimulation, no convincing evidence has yet been obtained to
suggest that alteration of presynaptic adenylate cyclase activity
consequent to nerve stimulation is mediated by a presynaptic action of one
or more of these neuromodulators. It is possible that direct
depolarization of the nerve terminal in some manner results in activation
of presynaptic adenylate cyclase, perhaps by a mechanism involving
calcium.

The role of sodium influx mediated by nicotinic receptors as an
initial event trans-synaptic induction of tyrosine hydroxylase in
adrenergic neurons
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract:</b> 1. Isolated superior cervical
ganglia of the rat were incubated for 2-30 min (37 degrees C) in Krebs'
solution or tissue culture medium (BGJb) containing <sup>22</sup>Na and
then washed for 30 min in ice-cold <sup>22</sup>Na-free Krebs' solution
(to clear extracellular space). The radioactivity remaining in the ganglia
was taken as a measure of <sup>22</sup>Na influx into the intracellular
compartment of the ganglion. 2. Addition of cholinomimetics (100 &micro;M
nicotine or 100 &micro;M carbachol) to the incubation led to an increase in
<sup>22</sup>Na influx. This increase reached maximal values after 10 min
of incubation; it was more pronounced after incubation in Krebs' solution
than in BGJb medium. 3. While chlorisondamine (3 &micro;M) or dopamine (100
&micro;M) greatly reduced the carbachol-induced <sup>22</sup>Na influx,
tetrodotoxin (2 &micro;M) did not have any effect. 4. In ganglia obtained
from animals treated with 6-hydroxydopamine in the early postnatal phase
(resulting in an extensive destruction of peripheral sympathetic neurons)
neither carbachol (100 &micro;M) nor nicotine (100 &micro;M) produced an
increase in <sup>22</sup>Na influx demonstrating that the intraneuronal
compartment is responsible for this enhanced influx. 5. The effects of
dopamine, chlorisondamine and tetrodotoxin on the carbachol-induced
<sup>22</sup>Na uptake into superior cervical ganglia are similar to their
effects on carbachol-mediated induction of tyrosine hydroxylase in
superior cervical ganglia kept in tissue culture (Thoenen and Otten
1977b). It is concluded that the induction of tyrosine hydroxylase via
nicotinic receptors is closely linked to the enhanced sodium influx into
the adrenergic neurons mediated by the same receptors.

In vitro translation of mRNA from rat pheochromocytoma
tumors. Characterization of tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Purified tumor TH runs as a 62,000 MW major band on SDS
polyacrylamide gels. A faint band of 60 kDa is also present. Rabbit
anti-rat TH was prepared and characterized on Ouchterlony double diffusion
plates: a single precipitin arc is present at all dilutions of antiserum
used. This is also observed when 100,000 g supernatant of pheochromocytoma
tumor was used instead of the purified TH. Direct immunoprecipitation of
TH, either with purified material or ultra-high speed supernatants of
extracts, was visualized on SDS gels and the major 62 kDa and minor 60 kDa
components were present.
<p>
Pheochromocytoma total RNA was isolated from DNA and tRNA by several
steps which included a final 2 M LiCl. Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA was
isolated by passing twice over an oligo(dT)-cellulose column. The purified
RNA is placed in a reticulocyte lysate and the translation products
revealed on an autoradiograph of an SDS gel. Immunoprecipitates in the
presence of 2 &micro;g pure TH are also analyzed. The major radioactive
component comigrates at 62,000 with the cold carrier TH, with an
exceedingly faint band at 60,000. A control experiment using nonspecific
antiserum or after formation of a heterologous complex between rat albumin
and rabbit anti-rat albumin antiserum indicates only a trace of
radiolabeled 62,000 component due to nonspecific adsorption on the carrier
TH. Gel slicing revealed that most of the radioactivity was in the region
where the 62,000 band would migrate. The ratio of radioactivity found in
the 62,000 band of the immunoprecipitated compared to the total

presumably reflects the population of its mRNA in the total RNA.

Activation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase in pheochromocytoma cells by adenosine
<p>
(See bottom of document for illustrations on adenosine metabolism.)
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Adenosine increases the
activity of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase in intact pheochromocytoma cells. The
effect of adenosine is not dependent upon extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>,
and is not accompanied by an increase in catecholamine secretion from the
cells. Adenosine deaminase decreases the basal activity of tyrosine
3-monooxygenase, and almost completely abolishes the activation of this
enzyme by adenosine. In cells treated with adenosine deaminase,
2-chloroadenosine causes a 2- to 5-fold increase in tyrosine
3-monooxygenase activity. 2-Chloroadenosine produces half-maximal
activation at a concentration of 0.1 &micro;M, and maximal activation at 10
&micro;M. Incubation of cells with 2-chloroadenosine produces a stable
activation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, as measured in vitro. Finally,
3-chloroadenosine increases the content of cAMP in pheochromocytoma cells,
and increases the incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H into cAMP in cells that
have been preincubated with [<sup>3</sup>H]adenine. This rise in cAMP
presumably mediates the activation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase by
2-chloroadenosine. Adenosine appears to be an endogenous regulator of
tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity in pheochromocytoma cells.

A new activator protein that activates tryptophan
5-monooxygenase and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase in the presence of
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase:
purification and characterization
<p class="Para1">
As reported recently by us, tryptophan 5-monooxygenase
(TrpOHase) from rat brain extracts is activated by incubation with
Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and the activating activity was
resolved by 55% AmSO<sub>4</sub> precipitation, in which the precipitate
contains CaM-dependent protein kinase and the supernatant contains CaM.
Chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B resolved the activating elements into
two fractions (I and II), which were both required for activation of
TrpOHase. Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ATP, and CaM were also required. Since there
were strong suggestions that CaM kinase was involved, attempts to prove
this used purified CaM kinase to compare the activity of fraction I and
II. The CaM kinase was shown to activate TrpOHase to the same extent as
fraction I in the presence of fraction II. Addition of both the CaM kinase
and fraction I did not activate any more than either of the two alone,
suggesting that the activating component in fraction I may be identical
with the CaM kinase. These results indicate that the required element in
fraction II was not CaM kinase, but is a protein since it is nondialyzable
and heat-labile.
<p>
The fraction II activator was then purified as follows. Rat cerebral
cortices are extracted and centrifuged at high speed, after which the
supernatant is 55% saturated with AmSO<sub>4</sub>. The precipitate was
dissolved and dialyzed against a buffer containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> before
being applied to a CaM-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated in dialyzing
buffer. The column was eluted with the same buffer and the unbound
activating protein collected and pooled. The pH of the pool is adjusted to
5.6 with 1 N acetic acid, and the precipitate is removed by
centrifugation. After another adjustment to pH 4.2 with acetic acid, the
centrifugal pellet is collected and resuspended in the dialysis buffer.
This suspension is 35% saturated with AmSO<sub>4</sub> and the resulting
centrifugal supernatant is again brought to 70% saturation with
AmSO<sub>4</sub>. The pellet from this work is dissolved in phosphate
buffer containing 0.1 M AmSO<sub>4</sub>. The mixture is now passed
through a Sephadex G-150 column, and the activator-containing fractions
are pooled and made 0.2 M with respect to AmSO<sub>4</sub> using 1 M
AmSO<sub>4</sub>. The material is now purified over a phenyl-Sepharose
CL-4B column, in which the protein is eluted with a low ionic strength
phosphate buffer (15 mM). The final step through DE-52 involved a prior
wash in 40 mM NaP<sub>i</sub> containing 0.1 M NaCl followed by elution
with 0.2 M NaCl. Purified material is stored frozen at -20&deg;. 140-fold
purified activator protein is obtained with 24% yield. Homogeneity is
shown on both native and SDS gels, and the protein elutes as a single peak
off a G-150 column.
<p>
MW determinations using sedimentation equilibrium (plotted as the
logarithm of the equilibrium protein concentration against the square of
the radial distance from the rotor center) indicate a MW of 70,000. A
partial specific volume of 0.73 cm<sup>3</sup>/g is estimated from amino
acid analysis data showing mole percent. From gel filtration analysis, a
MW of 70,000 and a Stokes radius of 3.6 nm is shown. The diffusion
coefficient, <i>D</i><sub>20,<i>w</i></sub>, was
calculated to be 6.0 x 10<sup>-7</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> from
the Stokes radius measurement. At a protein concentration of 0.35 mg/ml,
the sedimentation coefficient, <i>s</i><sub>20,<i>w</i></sub>, was measured to be 4.3 S.
The frictional ratio, <i>f</i>/<i>f</i><sub>0</sub>, was calculated to be
1.32. SDS gels showed a single band with apparent MW of 35 kDa, indicating
that the native protein exists as a dimer of identical subunits. Treatment
with cross-linkers followed by SDS gel electrophoresis then indicated
stained bands with MW of 63 and 35 kDa, resp.
<p>
TrpOHase activation by the purified protein was completely dependent
upon the presence of CaM and CaM kinase, dramatically shown in the plot of
enzyme activity vs. activator protein concentration. 1 &micro;g/ml protein
was required for half-maximal activation of TrpOHase. This activation
required Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP as well.
<p>
Previous studies in this lab demonstrated that TH is regulated by PK-A
and CaM kinase in brain, but only by PK-A in adrenal medulla. When TH was
incubated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ATP, CaM, CaM kinase, purified activator
protein, it was activated 2-fold. Omission of any of these elements
eliminated the activation. In the presence of NaF, the activator protein
was just as active, indicating that this protein did not appear to be a
phosphatase inhibitor. 1.5 &micro;g/ml of the protein was sufficient for
half-maximal activation.
<p>
Subcellular localization of the protein shows it to be soluble,
although the amount of activity in the microsomal fraction was
significantly higher than that of LDH, a marker for soluble enzymes.
Tissue distribution studies show this protein is found in a variety of
tissues, the lowest amount being in the liver, but the highest specific
activity is in the brain.

Inactivation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase by acetone precipitation

in restoring activity, iron ion appeared to be specifically required in
the restoration of the enzyme activity. Dithiothreitol could be partially
replaced in the restoration step by glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanol or

In a paper published elsewhere (JBC) we showed that TH

Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM, ATP, and an "activator" protein. However, the
<b>phosphorylation</b> of TH by this kinase required the kinase, calcium,

with either kinase or activator or both or none, and then at time zero,
nothing or kinase or activator protein was added (see table).

The time-of-addition assays suggest that

involving this effector signal pathway has been observed for tryptophan

inhibitory with (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactor.

Tyrosine hydroxylase: studies on the phosphorylation of a
purified preparation of the brain enzyme by cyclic AMP-dependent protein
kinase
<p class="Para1">
Bovine corpus striatal TH was purified extensively to
133-fold purity and a yield of 0.7% (total 74 &micro;g protein from 1 kg
tissue) in four purification steps. The yield is considered atypically
low, with a 1-4% yield typically expected. 30% loss per month of enzyme
stored at 4&deg; shows a reasonable stability. As the final step in the
purification, CM-Sephadex-purified enzyme was loaded on to a sucrose
gradient (5-20%) and a sedimentation coefficient
(<i>s</i><sub>20,<i>w</i></sub>) of 8.3 S was determined, a value of
MW 180,000 based on comparison to known standards. A smaller
activity peak at 4 S
(~45-50,000) was similarly observed and appears to be a dissociation of TH
subunits (see Raese et al 1977). Sedimentation on 9-34% glycerol gradients
was indistinguishable.
<p>
Acetic acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to assess
purity; TH was radioactively methylated using
[<sup>14</sup>C]formaldehyde, and the procedure is carried out in a manner
to limit enzyme activity losses. Ferguson plots of various gels were done
using standards and the minimum MW was found to be 60,000.  Scanning
of stained gels (at 550 nm) showed that TH was 90% pure.  SDS-phosphate
gels (Weber &amp; Osborn) were similar to the acid-urea results.
<p>
Kinetic analysis reveals that enzyme incubated in MgATP with the
catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was activated
by a mechanism involving a increase in affinity of the enzyme for
the pterin cofactor not accompanied by any change in Vmax.  This
is in contrast with the results of Joh et al.
<p>
CM-Sephadex-purified TH was incubated with [&gamma;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP
and the protein kinase and then dialyzed to remove the ATP.  It was
then centrifuged in a 9-34% glycerol gradient to remove a large
proportion of protein contaminant after the CM-Sephadex step as well
as from protein kinase and labeled ATP.  The figure of cpm and
enzyme activity vs. fraction number indicates that the radioactivity
is associated with activity, corresponding to the 9S protein.
<p>
After a highly purified preparation (5000 pmol DOPA/min/mg protein)
with total protein 1.9 &micro;g was incubated 60 min at 30&deg; with
100 U (0.6 &micro;g) protein kinase (purified up to a Sephadex G-100 step),
this was diluted with a dissocation solution and run on gels.  Gels
were stained and one photographed, and the other slice and counted for
cpm.  Two bands, a large slower moving one, and a small faster moving
band were seen, both with radiolabel correlated to their amount.
A reaction was run with the kinase alone (no TH substrate) and
only the smaller faster moving band was seen;  hence the smaller band
is the autophosphorylating kinase.  Incorporation was evaluated
assuming a 60,000 MW, and was found to be 0.7-0.9 mol P/mol protein.
A different TH prep gave a value of 0.7 mol P/mol protein.

Tetrahydrobiopterin increases in adrenal medulla and
cortex: a factor in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tetrahydrobiopterin, the
cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase and other monooxygenases, is present in
tissues at apparent concentrations much less than those necessary to
saturate the corresponding enzymes. Reserpine treatment or insulin-induced
hypoglycemia in rats produces a statistically significant increase in the
tetrahydrobiopterin content of both the adrenal medulla and the cortex.
Adrenal denervation and hypophysectomy selectively block the increases in
cofactor level in medulla and cortex, respectively, while cycloheximide
prevents the increase in both tissues. Reserpine did not increase cofactor
levels in liver, kidney, or corpus striatum but decreased that of the
pineal gland. These results suggest that tetrahydrobiopterin is under
neural control in the medulla and hormonal control in the cortex and that
increases in cofactor may result from induction of enzyme(s) in the
biosynthetic pathway. These results demonstrate regulation of tissue
tetrahydrobiopterin and are consistent with the suggestion that cofactor
levels participate in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the
adrenal medulla and may have a function, as yet undetermined, in the
adrenal cortex.

Bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase: comparative study of
the native and proteolyzed enzyme, and their interaction with anions
<p class="Para1">
Previous reports indicated that heparin and salts such as
NaCl could serve as TH activators. Partially purified TH treated
polyanions demonstrated a 4-fold activity increase when assayed in 0.1 M
Tris-maleate, pH 6.4, The amount of DOPA formed during the assay was
obtained with saturating cofactor and was found to be pH-dependent.
Heparin, NaCl, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and dextran sulfate were
effective in activating TH, whereas unsulfated dextran was without effect.
Different anionic buffer salts (KP<sub>i</sub>, Tris-acetate, ACES) at 0.1
M did not stimulate TH, while MOPS inhibited by 40% without shifting the
optimal pH. MES buffer however particularly stimulated TH and produced a
shift in the optimum as did heparin and dextran sulfate. There was no
additive effect by inclusion of both heparin and MES in the assay.
Activation by these agents was concentration-dependent. Saturation curve
analysis obtained a half-maximal value used to calculate the approximate
K<sub>D</sub> of 200 mM for NaCl, 30 mM for MES, 4 &micro;M for heparin, and
5 &micro;M for dextran sulfate. Similar values for the K<sub>D</sub> were
obtained for double reciprocal plots and Klotz representations. Activity
values were assessed at pH 5.8 and 6.4 in either the Tris-maleate or MES
buffer system: the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine was 90 &micro;M and never
changed at either pH or in the presence or absence of activator. Only the
apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> was observed to change. However the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for DMPH<sub>4</sub> decreased from 110 &micro;M to 60 &micro;M when MES at pH
6.4 was used instead of Tris-maleate at pH 5.8.
<p>
Affinity chromatography of TH with heparin- or dextran-Sepharose 6B
indicated that native TH adsorbs to this matrix. Elution of 70% of the
protein occurred with a 0.5 M NaCl was from different gel batches, but
elution at 0.26 M NaCl was shown with a linear gradient. No TH bound to
Sepharose 6B without ligand.
<p>
TH was trypsinized and passed over Sephadex G-100. Assay of the
proteolyzed TH showed no shift in the pH optimum in the presence of
polyanions. In MES and Tris-maleate the activity was the same, but
slightly stimulated in phosphate and inhibited by heparin. Trypsin-treated
TH did not bind to any of the polyanion-Sepharose gels.
<p>
Certain physical parameters of native and proteolyzed TH were compared.
For the native TH, a sedimentation coefficient (S<sub>20,w</sub>) was
calculated to be 9.6 (Martin &amp; Ames, 1961) in the homogenate and in
the 20-30% AmSO�<sub>4</sub> fraction as well. A Stokes radius of 70 � was
estimated from gel filtration analysis. A molecular weight can be
estimated from the following equation:

<table class="eqn">
<tr>
 <td rowspan="2">
  <i>M</i> = 6&pi;&nu;
 <td><i>aN</i><sub>0</sub>S<sub>20,<i>w</i></sub>
<tr>
 <td style="border-top:1px solid black;">1 &minus; &omega;&rho;
</table>
<p>
where &nu; = viscosity of water at 20&deg;, <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> = Avogadro's 
number, <i>a</i> = Stoke's radius, &rho; = density of water at 20&deg;, and &pi; 
= partial specific volume (0.725 ml/g). This yields an <i>M</i> of 276,000 and a 
frictional ratio, <i>f</i>/<i>f</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.63. The molecular parameters 
for the proteolyzed TH were determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation and by 
gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, G-200, and Sepharose 6B. These values show a 
sedimentation coefficient of 3.3, a Stokes radius of 25 &Aring;, and a est. MW 
of 34,000. The <i>f</i>/<i>f</i><sub>0</sub> was 1.17 (compare Musacchio et 
<i>al.</i>, 1971). Isoelectric points of 4.9 for the proteolyzed and 6.0 for the 
native enzyme were observed.

Effect of carbachol and 56 mm-potassium chloride on the
cyclic AMP-mediated induction of tyrosine hydroxylase in neuroblastoma
cells in culture
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
activity is increased two- to threefold in neuroblastoma cell line NBP2
maintained in culture for 48 h in the presence of either the inhibitor of
cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE),
4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (RO 20-1724), or the
activator of adenylate cyclase, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Cyclic AMP levels
are elevated 70-80% and 30-40% throughout the 48-h treatment with RO
20-1724 and PGE1, respectively. Carbachol does not affect either basal TH
activity or cyclic AMP levels in the cells. However, the cholinergic
agonist delays the induction of TH elicited by either RO 20-1724 or PGE1.
This delay is prevented by atropine. The elevation in cyclic AMP levels
elicited by either RO 20-1724 or PGE1 is blocked for 1 h or 15 min,
respectively, after treatment with carbachol. Cyclic AMP levels then begin
to rise until they reach those levels observed in the presence of RO
20-1724 or PGE1 alone by 12 h or 1 h of treatment, respectively. Time
course studies demonstrate that this transient inhibition of the elevation
of cyclic AMP is associated with a 48-h delay in the induction of TH
elicited by either RO 20-1724 or PGE1. In contrast, the induction elicited
by 8-bromo cyclic AMP is unaffected by carbachol. A depolarizing
concentration (56 mM) of KCl produces a 24-h delay in the induction of TH
elicited by RO 20-1724, without affecting the concomitant elevation of
cyclic AMP produced by the PDE inhibitor. Furthermore, 56 mM-KCl inhibits
the induction of TH elicited by 8-bromo cyclic AMP. It thus appears that
carbachol delays the induction of TH by transiently inhibiting the
elevation of cyclic AMP, whereas potassium depolarization delays the
induction of TH by inhibiting a process with a site of action that is
distal to the elevation of cyclic AMP.

Thermal denaturation of native striatal tyrosine
hydroxylase: increased thermolability of the phosphorylated form of the
enzyme
<p class="Para1">
First the time course of PK-A activation was determined
using striatal cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit and MgATP
at 30&deg;. A short preincubation period (2.5 to 5 min) resulted in 3-fold
activation of TH. However, with prolonged incubation periods, activity
falls off (within 20 min). Without PK-A addition at 30&deg;, there is a
similar decline of basal TH activity after 30 min (only about half).
<p>
TH was incubated with PK-A and MgATP for 5 min at 30&deg; then at 50&deg; for
varying periods of time. A plot of ln(TH activity) vs. time of incubation
at 50&deg; shows straight line decline in which the half-life of thermal
stability is 15 &plusmn; 3 min for native TH and 5 &plusmn; 2 min for the phosphorylated
enzyme, although the phosphorylated enzyme curve is biphasic at one point,
apparently because there is a large population of unphosphorylated TH
mixed with the phosphorylated TH. Note that the TH used in these studies
was purified 50-100-fold but was not pure insofar as SDS gel analysis.
<p>
In another experiments virtually homogeneous TH preparation (as judged
by SDS gels) was incubated with cardiac muscle PK-A with a very high
specific activity. The thermal denaturation study of this thoroughly
phoshorylated TH showed virtually the same half-life thermal stability but
was not biphasic but rather monophasic, indicating that the TH present was
nearly to completely phosphorylated.
<p>
SDS gels were run on the material incubated at 50&deg; to make sure that
the inactivation of TH was not because of some protease as a contaminant
which was activated under phosphorylating conditions. Densitometric
scanning of stained gels showed that profiles were the same for
phosphorylated and unphosphorylated TH.
<p>
TH is a tetramer in solution, and an argument can be made that
phosphorylation of one subunit of the tetramer can activate while
phosphorylation of all deactivates. However, PK-A lost its activity after
3 to 5 min at 50&deg;, making improbable the possibility that TH loses its
activity by extensive phosphorylation. Furthermore partial inhibition of
PK-A activity with EDTA did not shift the rate of loss of activity in the
thermal stability test.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>. Nagatsu et <i>al.</i> (1971) reported
that trypsin-treated TH lost activity at a rate somewhat less that what we
report for the phosphorylated enzyme. Both processes increase the thermal
instability of TH. What is interesting as well is the finding by Kuczenski
(1973) that limited trypsin treatment activates TH and that TH so treated
cannot be phosphorylated (Hoeldtke and Kaufman, 1977).

Immunocytochemical localization of tyrosine hydroxylase
in rat adrenal medulla by the peroxidase labeled antibody method: effects
of enzyme activation on ultrastructural distribution of the enzyme
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: A monospecific antibody
against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), purified from a transplantable rat
pheochromocytoma, was produced in rabbits. Immunohistochemical techniques
were employed in order to determine if a relationship exists between the
subcellular distribution of TH and the level of activation of the enzyme
in the rat adrenal medulla. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity in adrenals
removed from non-stressed rats following pentobarbital anesthesia was
found to be 12.9 +/- 1.0 nmol DOPA formed x mg protein-1. The use of ether
anesthesia (17.9 +/- 2.0 nmol DOPA formed x mg protein-1), and the
administration of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) followed by decapitation
(35.9 +/- 2.0 nmol DOPA formed x mg protein-1) was associated with an
acute activation of adrenal TH. The subcellular distribution of TH within
the cytosol of chromaffin cells from animals subjected to anesthesia or
ECS, as determined by immunocytochemical techniques, was similar. In all
treatment groups chromaffin cells were found which had TH associated with
some chromaffin granules. The percentage of chromaffin granules which
appeared to contain TH was lower in animals subjected to ECS plus
decapitation as compared with anesthetized animals. These observations
suggest that the activation of adrenal medullary TH is not associated with
a shift in the subcellular distribution of the enzyme from the cytosol to
membranous structures.

The receptor-mediated activation of tyrosine hydroxylase
in the superior cervical ganglion of the rat
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The addition of carbachol to
superior cervical ganglia causes a rapid increase in tyrosine
hydroxylation in situ. The increase occurs in ganglia from both newborn
and adult animals, and in ganglia from animals pretreated with reserpine.
The increase is not due to increased transport of the substrate. The
increase is dependent upon the presence of calcium, and is additive to the
stimulation produced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The stimulation seems
specific for tyrosine hydroxylation; dopamine beta-hydroxylation is not
increased. Preincubation experiments suggest that the carbachol-induced
stimulation is due to a change in the availability of, or the affinity of
the enzyme for, reduced pterin cofactor. The stimulation is inhibited by
atropine and also by low concentrations of phenoxybenzamine or
haloperidol, which suggests that it is caused by an action of carbachol on
the interneurons in the ganglia.

Electroconvulsive shock increases tyrosine hydroxylase
activity in the brain and adrenal gland of the rat
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: A single application of
electroconvulsive shock produced a rapid but short-lasting increase in
tyrosine hydroxylase activity above control values in the rat adrenal
medulla and striatum. After repeated electroconvulsive shock treatment
(once per day for 7 days), tyrosine hydroxylase activity increased
significantly in the locus ceruleus, nucleus of the tractus solitarius,
hippocampus, cerebellum, and frontal cortex and remained elevated for 4 to
8 days. Adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase activity increased 1 day after the
termination of repeated electroconvulsive shock treatments and remained
elevated for at least 24 days, possibly reflecting the establishment of a
new and higher steady-state level of catecholamine biosynthesis in the
adrenal. These findings suggest that the persistent changes in tyrosine
hydroxylase activity produced by repeated electroconvulsive shock may be a
factor contributing to the long-lasting antidepressant effects of this
treatment.

Tyrosine hydroxylase from bovine striatum: catalytic
properties of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the
purified enzyme [kinase = PK-A]
<p class="Para1">
TH was purified from bovine corpus striata according to
Edelman et <i>al.</i> (1981) but very conservative pooling of
fractions was done to quickly purify the enzyme. An SDS gel of
Coomassie-stained proteins is shown to demonstrate purification over
DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, then CM-Sephadex (with three pools of
various fractions). One pool of the CM-Sephadex fractions has &lt;33% of
total TH activity but is practically homogeneous, while the other two
pools contain most of the activity but many other bands are present.
Glycerol gradient centrifugation produced no additional purification. The
SDS gel of the homogeneous pool shows two bands at 60,000 and 62,000. This
has been observed with TH purified from pheochromocytoma as well. Purified
TH is shown to be unstable when dilute when it was recovered from the
density gradient step. TH was observed to break down from 61,000 to 50,000
MW with a 90-95% loss in activity. TH of low purity is stable at 4&deg; in 20%
glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.2 mM DTT. Estimation of protein was by Lowry
method and by Warburg and Christian (A<sub>280</sub>/A<sub>260</sub>), and
both were in good agreement.
<p>
TH activity was tested in a variety of buffers (0.25 M cacodylate,
citrate, MES) although all show optimum of 6.0. Activity in the MES buffer
was 5-10 times higher than the other buffers. Use of Na phosphate as a
buffer gave TH activity comparable to MES but the pH optimum was shifted
down to 5.5. Kinetic constant determinations were made using varying
concentrations of BH<sub>4</sub> in presence of 12 or 48 &micro;M Tyr at pH
6.0. In some cases glycerol gradient-purified TH was treated with 1-3
&micro;g of heart protein kinase (PK-A) and then the TH assayed under the
same conditions. Comparison of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated
enzyme by analysis of the double reciprocal plots shows a distinct
decrease in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for BH<sub>4</sub> with little to no change in
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> in the phosphorylated enzyme ([Tyr] was kept constant at
60 &micro;M while BH<sub>4</sub> was varied). Substitution of BH<sub>4</sub>
cofactor with 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> showed pretty much the same results
insofar as <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for phosphorylated vs. nonphos., but the
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is only an apparent one because Tyr at 60 &micro;M for this
unnatural cofactor is not saturating.
<p>
Variation of the [Tyr] with cofactor kept constant at either 1.0 mM
BH<sub>4</sub> or 1.5 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> produced double reciprocal
plots with K<sub>m</sub>s for the phospho- and nonphosphoTH that appeared
to be different but were not statistically. [Tyr] below <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> were
tested but values were unreliable as the tyrosine was consumed rapidly. No
substrate inhibition is observed at higher [Tyr]. Although the
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine using 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> was not shown
to vary between phospho and nonphosphoTH, a small statistical difference
in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> was shown.
<p>
Dopamine inhibition was assessed by varying [dopamine] and checking its
effect on Dixon plots (1/v against [I]). Using nonphosphorylated TH at two
different [BH<sub>4</sub>] of 0.1 and 1.0 mM, inhibition by dopamine is
competitive with the cofactor. Intersection of the plotted lines shows a
K<sub>i</sub>=28 &plusmn; 4 &micro;M at pH 6.0.
<p>
A mathematical analysis (see Segel, 1975) also shows:
<table class="eqn">

</table>
<p>
When I= -<i>K</i><sub>i</sub>, then 1/<i>V</i> = 1/<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.
One needs to know both the maximal velocity of the reaction and the
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the competitive substrate. If one knows the slope
then the K<sub>i</sub> can be determined. The K<sub>i</sub> was then
determined for the nonphospho and phosphoTH forms using 200 &micro;M
BH<sub>4</sub>. The phospho form had a K<sub>i</sub> = 57 &micro;M at pH 6.0.
<p>
A double reciprocal plot in which activity of the phospho vs.
nonphosphoTH was checked against varying BH<sub>4</sub> cofactor,
but at pH 7.0 ([Tyr]=60 &micro;M), both the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
(increased 2-fold) and the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
(also increased 4-fold) when TH is phosphorylated. Variation of [Tyr]
showed that Tyr at high concentrations had a pronounced inhibitory effect
for both the phospho and nonphosphoTH (substrate inhibition has been
observed elsewhere). Lineweaver-Burk analysis at the lower [Tyr] shows no
significant change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for Tyr between phospho and
nonphosphoTH, but the apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> did increase 3-4 fold for
phosphoTH, as it did in which BH<sub>4</sub> was varied.
Dixon plots for dopamine inhibition at pH 7.0 testing phospho and
nonphosphoTH at two BH<sub>4</sub> concentrations (0.1 and 1.0 mM) and 60
&micro;M Tyr show that the K<sub>i</sub>= 6 &plusmn; 2 &micro;M for the nonphospho form
and 45 &plusmn; 7 &micro;M for the phospho, both at pH 7.0. Relative to the
nonphospho form, the K<sub>i</sub> is markedly increased for the phospho
form. Inhibition by dopamine is competitive at both pH 6.0 and 7.0.
<p>
The effect of NaCl was assessed: at pH 6.0, phosphoTH activity was
unaffected (no additive effect), but the nonphosphoTH was significantly
activated by as little as 0.25 M NaCl and was higher at 1.0 M (the maximum
concentration tested). At pH 7.0, the nonphosphoTH form was not affected
by NaCl at any concentration; adversely, activity of phosphoTH fell with
increasing NaCl.
<p>
The effect of heparin: 2 mg/ml heparin induced a 2-fold activation at
pH 6.0. There was no (additive) effect seen with the phosphoTH treated to
heparin. At pH 7.0, similar results as had occurred with NaCl could be
seen with heparin: nonphosphoTH was unaffected by heparin, but phosphoTH
activity fell.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>. In general converging lines for a variety of
reactants at a variety of concentrations suggest a ternary or quaternary
transition state complex. These experiments do not distinguish the order
of binding. Kaufman (1975) has shown that the partially pure bovine
caudate TH has a 4-fold greater affinity for BH<sub>4</sub> than for
6-MPH<sub>4</sub>, although no difference is seen in striatum. We point
also to changes in apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> when two substrates are
considered. If one of the substrates is in excess, then true
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> can be found with varying the other substrate and plotting
the line. However, with a change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> by phosphorylation of
one form of the enzyme, the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> must be re-calculated
to see if it conforms with whether the substrate kept constant is truly in
excess.

Activating antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Crude immunoglobulin
fractions from a sheep, immunized with rat pheochromocytoma tyrosine
hydroxylase, increased the catalytic activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in
vitro up to 20-fold. Kinetic analysis of the activation revealed both a
decrease in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>(app) for pterin cofactor and an increase in
<i>V</i><sub>max(app)</sub>. No change <i>K</i><sub>m(app)</sub>
for tyrosine was observed. Activation was maximal at the
minimum antibody/enzyme ratio required to remove tyrosine hydroxylase
activity from solution with protein A immunoadsorbent. Chromatography of
the crude immunoglobulins on either DEAE-Sephacel or protein A-Sepharose
separated two immunoglobulin fractions. In both cases, the activating
influence and the anti-tyrosine hydroxylase activity bound to the matrices
and were eluted together. As supported by data from a solid phase
radioimmunoassay using rabbit anti-bovine IgG1, this chromatographic data
was consistent with the activating activity and the anti-tyrosine
hydroxylase activity both being sheep IgG1 immunoglobulins. Preadsorption
of the active immunoglobulin fraction from DEAE-Sephacel chromatography
(with protein A immunoadsorbent precoated with rabbit anti-sheep IgG)
eliminated the activating influence. Moreover, after incubation with the
active fraction, tyrosine hydroxylase was bound to protein A-Sepharose and
the activity recovered was severalfold higher than the initial activity.
These data clearly demonstrate the involvement of antibody in the
activation of the enzyme and suggest that the anti-tyrosine hydroxylase
activity and the activating activity may derive from one and the same set
of interactions.

Mechanisms of tyrosine hydroxylase activation by phosphorylation
<p class="Para1">
Bovine adrenal TH is prepared on Sepharose 6B and stored
until use. The enzyme is assayed in 0.1 M MES, pH 6.4 routinely.
Phosphorylating conditions are achieved by incubation for 20 min at 30&deg;
with pH 7.0 50 mM phosphate buffer, 16 mM NaF, 5 mM theophylline, 2 mM
creatine phosphate, 1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 10 &micro;M cAMP, 5 mM
MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 &micro;g/ml commercial beef heart protein kinase, 400
&micro;M ATP.
<p>
Phosphorylation is shown to shift the pH optimum of TH activity from
5.8 to 6.4, a change also observed for the addition of polyanions, also
known to activate TH. Activity was increased at this shifted optimum as
well. This activation was true for both saturating and subsaturating
conditions of DMPH<sub>4</sub>. Native enzyme incubated for various
periods of time in phosphorylating conditions indicate that TH in the
Tris-maleate assay buffer increased with time and reached a plateau value
approx. equal to activity of the nonincubated enzyme assay in MES buffer.
TH measured in MES buffer was the same for incubated or nonincubated
enzyme, indicating that MES has the same effect as phosphorylation.
Tryptic proteolysis was not additive to activation in the presence of MES
or with enzyme incubated under phosphorylating conditions, indicating that
all 3 processes act at a common site.
<p>
The activation of TH under phosphorylating conditions was not merely
caused by the anions present nor by proteolysis. The phosphorylated
product was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and
proteolysis would have caused a shift in the active protein to go from 9.6
to 3.3 S. The 9.6 S peak was 1.7 times more active in MES than
Tris-maleate, which suggests a partial dephosphorylation occurring during
centrifugation.
<p>
We suggest that phosphorylation results in modification of the charge
affecting the cationic regulatory site and this suppresses its
electrostatic effect on the active site as does the anions. The pH shift
is about 0.6 pH units, corresponding to an electrostatic potential change
of 37 mV. In aqueous solutions with a dielectric constant of 80, this
potential would be generated by two positive charges 10 � away from the
active site. This calculation shows the number of unit charges carried by
the positive regulatory site might not be high and could by neutralized by
phosphorylation.

Studies on the regulatory mechanism of the tyrosine
hydroxylase system in adrenal slices by using high-performance liquid
chromatography with electrochemical detection
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: A new method was developed to
study the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) system in rat adrenal slices by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical
detection (ED). TH activity was measured by determining DOPA, formed in
adrenal slices containing all of the components of the TH system in the
presence of an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase
(NSD-1055), using a new and highly sensitive HPLC-ED method. The
properties of the TH system in the slices were also examined. High K+ (52
mM) stimulated the formation of DOPA in the slices; this stimulation was
not observed in Ca2+-free medium. Furthermore, the addition of
ethyleneglycol bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) to
a Ca2+-free medium not only abolished the stimulation by high K+ but also
significantly inhibited the conversion of L-tyrosine to DOPA. This
suggests that intracellular Ca2+ may regulate TH activity in the adrenal
medulla. The enzyme in homogenates of normal adrenal slices had two
different <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values for the tetrahydropterin cofactor. Alteration of
enzyme kinetics using homogenates of adrenal slices that had been treated
in various ways suggests that changes in the proportions of the two forms
of TH produced by intracellular Ca2+ may regulate the activity of this
enzyme in the adrenal medulla.

Identification of cDNA clones coding for rat tyrosine hydroxylase antigen
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Five recombinant DNA plasmids
have been constructed that contain structural gene sequences for rat
tyrosine hydroxylase [TyrOHase; tyrosine 3-monooxygenase; L-tyrosine,
tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating), EC
1.14.16.2]. Rat pheochromocytoma PC 12 cell line, which contains
relatively high levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes, was used to
purify RNA. TyrOHase cDNA clones were identified by screening 350 cDNA
clones constructed from partially purified TyrOHase mRNA. A rapid and
powerful screening of the recombinant clones by differential colony
hybridization was possible because TyrOHase is a tissue-specific protein.
The final selection relied on the ability of cDNA inserts to hybridize
specifically to TyrOHase mRNA as judged by cell-free translation and
immunoprecipitation. Blot hybridization analysis of polyadenylylated RNA
from PC 12 cells indicated a major mRNA species of 1.9 kilobases. A
species of the same size was identified from a human pheochromocytoma
tumor, indicating a crossreactivity between rat TyrOHase cDNA and human
TyrOHase mRNA.

Phosphorylation and activation of tyrosine hydroxylase mediate the
cAMP-induced increase in catecholamine biosynthesis in adrenal chromaffin cells
<p class="Para1">
Preliminary experiments in which chromaffin cells treated
with 8-bromo-cAMP at physiological pH (pH 7.2-7.4) produced inconsistent
results when measuring catecholamine synthesis led to studies showing that
pH 5.2-5.3 was optimal; so all in situ studies were done in MES-buffered
saline. The effect of 1 mM cAMP analogue on DOPA synthesis was immediate,
maintaining linearity for 16 min, and its effect was calcium-independent.
The effect of 1 mM cAMP and dibutyryl-cAMP were virtually the same as
well. Even subsequent to washing away the 8-bromo-cAMP, the biosynthetic
rate persisted. At normal cell temperatures it eventually dropped off
after 20 min, but at colder temperature, the synthetic rate continued.
<p>
To make sure that the effect of cAMP was not to merely increase
biosynthesis by increasing tyrosine content in a subsaturated catalytic
process, exogenous tyrosine at different concentrations was present during
treatment. The rate was changed despite the substrate concentration,
demonstrating that cAMP effects were directly on the protein.
[1-<sup>14</sup>C]DOPA was used instead of labeled tyrosine to see if cAMP
might activate DOPA decarboxylation: there was no influence or rate
change.
<p>
When labeled DOPA was varied however, the specific radioactivity of the
catecholamines increased in a short period of time, whereas there was
little or no change with the use of labeled tyrosine: this is further
evidence of the rate-limiting nature of TH. The use of 3-iodotyrosine
added to the [1-<sup>14</sup>C]DOPA followed by 8-Br-cAMP had little
effect in increasing the total specific radioactivity when compared to
untreated controls.
<p>
To examine substrate availability, pterin cofactor concentration
dependence was measured using 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin
(DMPH<sub>4</sub>). 1 mM DMPH<sub>4</sub> increased biosynthesis 4-fold,
suggesting less than saturating levels of this factor. However, added
cofactor does not override the increase induced by 8-Br-cAMP. The end
product epinephrine was tested from 1 &micro;M to 3 mM and it had no
influence on treated or control catecholamine synthesis, indicating the
effect of the cAMP analogue is independent of cofactor or substrate
availability nor dependent upon product inhibition.
<p>
<b>In vitro kinetic parameters</b>. Cells were treated with 8-Br-cAMP
and then lysed. TH activity was measured along with catecholamine
biosynthesis and both were found to increase correlatively. A decrease in
apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> was found for the
cofactor, <span class="small-caps">dl</span>-6-methyltetrahydropterin
(6MPH<sub>4</sub>), while the apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> increased for both
tyrosine and 6MPH<sub>4</sub>. The kinetic parameter
changes did not reflect changes in TH subcellular location (soluble to
particulate) because the changes occurred there also. In vitro addition of
cAMP (in presence of MgATP) also made the very same changes in
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> as the in situ results.
<p>
TH was immunoprecipitated with sheep anti-TH to determine
<sup>32</sup>P incorporation. A 60 kDa band which is confirmed as TH
showed was increased in its phosphorylation when supernatants from
hypotonically extracted cells were treated with cAMP in the presence of
[&gamma;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, immunoprecipitated and run
on SDS gels. This incorporation, along with changes in TH activity, was
dose-dependent. Cells which were incubated with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>
for 3 min, treated with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP for 2 min, were either stopped with
sonication in 0.1% SDS or in 0.1% Triton X-100. In the case of SDS,
phosphorylation content increased 3- to 5-fold, while only a 1.4- to
1.5-fold increase was seen with TX-100.

Phosphorylation and activation of tyrosine hydroxylase
mediate the acetylcholine-induced increase in catecholamine biosynthesis
in adrenal chromaffin cells
<p class="Para1">
Acetylcholine and nicotinic cholinergics as well as depolarizing
substances such as KCl and veratridine induce secretion of catecholamines
from chromaffin cells in a calcium-dependent manner.  Catecholamine
biosynthesis is also increased.  The biosynthetic rate is found to
increase in a dose-dependent manner with respect to both ACh and KCl.
The table below shows the means and S.E. of four experiments with

<p>
Other calcium-dependent dose responses were seen with carbamyl choline in the 
1-100 &micro;M range, veratridine in 5-75 &micro;M, and A23187 in 2-10 &micro;M. 
When 50 mM choline chloride or 100 mM sucrose were used to replace 50 mM NaCl, 
no effect was seen.
<p>
The effect of tyrosine accumulation was examined with different concentrations 
of tyrosine present.  In general the various stimulating agents did not affect 
the accumulation of tyrosine.  Hence increased catecholamine synthesis does not 
result from changes in substrate availability (concentration).  A 100 &micro;M 
tyrosine concentration increases biosynthesis only 115% compared to 10 &micro;M. 
Catecholamine synthesis is 252% greater with acetylcholine stimuation 
(calcium-dependent) with 10 &micro;M tyrosine and 220% greater with 100 &micro;M 
tyrosine.
<p>
To examine if the rate of catecholamine synthesis also or is solely the
effect of DOPA decarboxylase activation, [L-<sup>14</sup>C]DOPA was
added exogenously.  7- and 14-fold higher synthesis was found than
with L-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]tyrosine at 10 and 50 &micro;M, resp.  With
acetylcholine added nothing to the increase in dopamine production from
DOPA, and so it is clear that these agents work by increasing tyrosine
hydroxylation.
<p>
The dose dependence of both pterin cofactor and catecholamine products
were evaluated.  When 1 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> was present increased
rate of biosynthesis by 150%.  But addition of acetylcholine added
nothing to the rate:  250% vs. 240% in the presence or absence of
added 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>.  This indicates that the pterin is present
in subsaturating amounts, but that acetylcholine does not work through
by affecting pterin availability.  Exogenous catecholamines inhibited
catecholamine increases, but in contrast to a report by Meligeni et al.
(1982), a higher concentration (3 mM) was required to observe any
inhibition (by about half).  There was no catecholamine inhibition
of basal state catecholamine synthesis, but only of acetylcholine-stimulated
synthesis.
<p>
Cells harvested in the absence of calcium showed increases in catecholamine
biosynthesis when calcium was added.  Calcium deprivation under certain
conditions can depolarize chromaffin cells.  Magnesium, manganese, and
D600 can inhibit voltage-sensitive calcium channels associated with
stimulus-secretion coupling.  With 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> or 1 mM
MnCl<sub>2</sub> present, catecholamine biosynthesis rate was not affected
basally or by addition of calcium.  Both of these did however reduce
40-50% the rate of acetylcholine-activated cells.  D-600 reduces the
rate under all conditions.  This data shows that calcium addition
does not work through the typical stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism.
Cells were harvested in HBSS with and without calcium (1.5 mM), and
with and without acetylcholine (100 &micro;M).  Addition of the acetylcholine
in HBSS with no calcium did not affect rate, but addition of calcium
did significantly increase rate by 30%.  With acetylcholine added
to HBSS in calcium the rate increases by 95%.  EGTA addition neither
decreases the basal rate, and it inhibits ACh-induced stimulation,
although the rate remains the same as the basal rate (no enhanced
inhbition).  Addition of calcium to cells washed in HBSS with calcium
does not enhance rate.
<p>
Chromaffin cells were treated with ACh and sonicated.  Cell extracts
were then gel-purified.  TH activity was increased dramatically in
post-column fractions compared to pre-column fractions, indicating
the removal of an inhibitory substance.  Characterization of kinetic
parameters for tyrosine and cofactor were not possible because of the
very transient nature of TH activation by ACh.
<p>
Amy and Kirshner recently reported phosphorylation of a subunit of
<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> ~ 60,000.  Cells were pre-incubated with
<sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>-containing medium then treated with ACh
prior to sonicating in SDS.  TH was immunoprecipitated then run
on SDS-PAGE.  Phosphate incorporation was quantitated by autorad
analysis.  ACh clearly induced increases in phosphate of TH subunit.
These were inhibited by presence of EGTA and manganese.

Multiple site phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase:
differential regulation in situ by 8-bromo-cAMP and acetylcholine
<p class="Para1">
An SDS gel of immunoprecipitates of cultured adrenal
chromaffin cell extracts showing incorporation of
<sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> into TH reveals that TH migrates slightly ahead
of catalase (M<sub>r</sub>=60,000), and is phosphorylated with the same
kinetics whether cells are exposed to pH 6.0 or 7.4. The 60 kDa band from
gels not immunoprecipitated and the TH band from immunoprecipitates were
excised, trypsinized, and developed by 2D separation (chromatography in
the 1st dimension, electrophoresis in the 2nd.) Two peptides are observed,
C and E, which indicates that one had more <b>c</b>hromatographic mobility
and the other more <b>e</b>lectrophoretic mobility, resp. The 60 kDa band
in unimmunoprecipitated extracts appeared to be entirely TH because (1)
the C/E ratio of <sup>32</sup>P was the same for the 60 kDa band and
immunoppt'd TH, (2) only two spots were observed when the tryptic digests
of both the unknown 60 kDa band and immunoppt'd TH were mixed for 2D plate
analysis, and (3) immunoprecipitation with anti-TH quantitatively removed
the appearance of the 60 kDa band on SDS gels. The ratio of radioactivity
in the peptides was about 2:1 for C:E.
<p>
Chromaffin cells respond to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent acetylcholine
stimulation by secreting catecholamines and increasing their rate of
biosynthesis, and by phosphorylating and activating TH (which goes hand in
hand). Exogenous cAMP or its analogs, however, does not promote release
nor biosynthetic processes at physiological pH, but will under slightly
more acidic conditions.

Secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide acutely
increase tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity in the rat superior cervical
ganglion
<p class="Para1">
Superior cervical ganglia contain adrenergic neurons
which are catecholamine producers. The popular belief is that
acetylcholine mediates all necessary effects in sympathetic (adrenergic)
neuronal response, but now it appears that neuropeptides may exert an
effect separate from cholinergic stimulation.
<p>
Ganglia incubated for 30 min in 10 &micro;M secretin exerts a 3-fold
increase in DOPA synthesis. The related peptid VIP (also at 10 &micro;M)
exerts an even larger effect (4-fold). Other peptides (angiotensin II,
bombesin, bradykinin, cholecystokinin octapeptide, glucagon, insulin,
luteinizing hormone-releasing factor,
[d-Ala<sup>2</sup>,Met<sup>5</sup>]enkephalinamide, motilin, neurotensin,
somatostatin, and substance P were without effect at the same
concentration.
<p>
Dose-response curves for both secretin and VIP shows that secretin can
elicit statistically significant DOPA synthesis at even 1 nM, maximal at
100 nM. At doses above 100 nM, VIP elicits its effects, which were maximal
at 10 &micro;M. Trasylol and bacitracin are peptidase inhibitors which are
effective at inhibiting the degradation of a number of neuropeptides which
include secretin, but coincubation of these inhibitors with the
neuropeptides did not potentiate the responses of VIP or secretin at
submaximal doses of these peptides.
<p>
VIP is clearly less potent than secretin, but its overall maximal
stimulation is twice that of secretin. Secretin and VIP were therefore
co-incubated at doses designed to produce maximal response to examine for
additivity (60 min, then brocresine for 15 min). The increase in DOPA
synthesis by VIP+secretin was greater than secretin alone, but not greater
than VIP alone.
<p>
To eliminate the possibility that VIP or secretin exert their effects
on preganglionic nerve tissues present in the ganglia, which might then
stimulate the adrenergic postsynaptic elements, preganglionic nerve trunks
were severed to allow degeneration of the preganglionic nerve elements 4
days prior to ganglia treatments. The DOPA increases in decentralized
ganglia were indistinguishable from DOPA increases in sham-operated rats,
indicating no effect of preganglionic elements in the process. Intact
ganglia incubated with 3 mM hexamethanonium + 6 &micro;M atropine affected
neither VIP or secretin-induced DOPA synthesis increases.
<p>
Reversibility of the effects of VIP and secretin (at 5 &micro;M and 0.1
&micro;M for 15 min, enough to see a response) DOPA synthesis increases was
examined. After a while, medium containing VIP and secretin was replaced
with medium without these peptides and the rat of DOPA synthesis shown to
fall to baseline levels within 60 min (in the case of VIP). Secretin had
already fallen to control values after 45 min (the only point measured).

Purification and some properties of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase from rat adrenal
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase was
purified to homogeneity, as judged by sodium dodecyl
sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, from rat adrenal. The specific
activity of the final preparation was approximately 1,600 nmol min-1 mg
protein-1, which was much higher than the highest yet reported. The enzyme
was markedly stabilized in the presence of glycerol, Tween 80 and EDTA. As
judged by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 34, sodium dodecyl
sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and cross-linking studies, the
enzyme appeared to be composed of four identical subunits, each possessing
a molecular weight of 59,000. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was
estimated to be 6.7 in the presence of 8 M urea and 6.6 in its absence.
Amino acid analysis of the enzyme revealed a fairly high content of serine
residues in this protein. Purification of the enzyme caused changes in the
kinetic properties of the enzyme. The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for
2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine decreased from 220
&micro;M to 58 &micro;M. The pH profile for the enzyme activity became more
broad and the pH optimum was changed from an acid pH to a neutral pH.
Although polyanions, such as heparin and dextran sulfate, markedly
stimulated the activity of crude enzyme by increasing the V, they were
much less effective in the activation of purified enzyme. A marked
stimulation of the enzyme activity by phospholipids, such as
phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and
phosphatidylethanolamine, were not observed in both pure and crude
preparations even at low concentrations of the pterin cofactor.

Both nicotinic and muscarinic agonists acutely increase
tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity in the rat superior cervical ganglion
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The activity of tyrosine
3-monooxygenase in rat superior cervical ganglia in vitro was measured by
monitoring their rate of dopa production. Cholinergic agonists produce a
rapid and reversible increase in dopa synthesis in the ganglia. Carbachol
(0.1 mM) causes a 5- to 6-fold increase in dopa synthesis. The action of
carbachol is largely inhibited by the nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium
(3 mM) and is completely blocked by a combination of hexamethonium and the
muscarinic antagonist atropine (6 &micro;M). Dimethylphenylpiperazinium (1
mM), a specific nicotinic agonist, produces a 4-fold increase in dopa
synthesis. The action of dimethylphenylpiperazinium is blocked by
hexamethonium but not by atropine. Bethanechol (1 mM), a muscarinic
agonist, causes a 2-fold increase in dopa synthesis. The action of
bethanechol is inhibited by atropine but not by hexamethonium. It is
concluded that tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity in rat superior cervical
ganglia can be increased by both nicotinic and muscarinic stimulation,
that nicotinic stimulation can produce a greater increase than can
muscarinic stimulation and that carbachol increases enzyme activity by a
combination of both pathways. These cholinergic mechanisms for the acute
regulation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase may be activated in vivo by
acetylcholine released from preganglionic neurons and thus may play a role
in the physiological regulation of catecholamine synthesis in sympathetic
ganglia.

Purification and characterization of the brain
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (kinase II), which is involved in the
activation of tryptophan 5-monooxygenase
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase (kinase II) [Yamauchi, T. and Fujisawa, H. (1980) FEBS Lett. 116,
141-144], which is involved in the activation of tryptophan
5-monooxygenase, was purified 720-fold with a 36% yield from rat cerebral
cortex using ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on
Sepharose CL-4B, calmodulin-Sepharose 4B and phosphocellulose. The
purified enzyme showed one major protein band corresponding in mobility to
a molecular weight of 55000 and a faint band upon sodium dodecyl
sulfate/polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, whereas it gave a single
protein band upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without sodium
dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weight and the sedimentation coefficient of
the kinase were determined to be 540000 by sedimentation equilibrium and
16.5 S by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The kinase required
absolutely calmodulin and Ca2+ for its activity and the apparent Ka values
for calmodulin and Ca2+ were 10 nM and 1.6 &micro;M respectively. The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
values for ATP and Mg2+ were calculated to be 0.06 mM and 1 mM,
respectively. The concentration of tryptophan 5-monooxygenase required to
produce half-maximal effects on its activation by the kinase was estimated
to be as low as 0.3 nM, on the basis of the finding that the molecular
weight and the specific activity of tryptophan 5-monooxygenase were 245000
and 374 nmol min-1 mg protein-1 respectively [Nakata, H. and Fujisawa, H.
(1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 122, 41-47]. The kinase phosphorylated casein,
smooth muscle myosin light chain as well as some endogenous proteins of
brain cytosol. The enzyme did not phosphorylate significantly histone,
protamine, and phosphorylase b. Some other properties of the kinase were
examined.

3',5'-Cyclic adenosine monophosphate- and
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent endogenous protein
phosphorylation activity in membranes of the bovine chromaffin secretory
vesicles: identification of two phosphorylated components as tyrosine
hydroxylase and protein kinase regulatory subunit type II
<p class="Para1">
Chromaffin cell secretory vesicle membranes were isolated
and run on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Coomassie Blue-stained gels
indicated many protein bands in the 14-200 kDa range. Isolated secretory
vesicle ghosts which had been treated to 5 &micro;M cAMP, 100 &micro;M
Ca<sup>2+</sup> plus 20 &micro;g/ml calmodulin, or 1 mM EGTA in the presence
of [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (5 mM) and theophylline (to inhibit PDE) were
similarly run on gels after phosphorylating conditions were complete, and
autoradiographs scanned with a densitometer. Up to 15 labeled band could
be distinguished on gels, but 7 of them consistently at 29.8, 56, 60, 69,
82, 142, and 250 kDa. Phosphorylation reactions which had been stopped
with 10% TCA + boiling water for 3 min, 0.5 M NaOH in the cold for 5 min,
or lipid extraction with ether:ethanol (1:1) did not affect the
phosphorylation pattern, while treatment with 0.5 M NaOH + boiling for 3
min, as well as 10 &micro;g pronase for 30 min at 37&deg; did remove label from
all proteins.
<p>
The band at 60 kDa received the greatest incorporation of label in our
studies. Use of cGMP had no effect on stimulating phosphorylation, even at
10 times &gt; concentrations in which cAMP worked. The 8 mM M<sup>2+</sup>
used in the experiments was substituted with 1 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP
was not present in the reaction: all but the 56 kDa band failed to be
labeled. Addition of cAMP back to the reaction then inhibited labeling of
the 56 kDa band as well.
<p>
Antiserum to TH was incubated with Triton X-100 solubilized membranes
which had been treated with cAMP and labeled ATP. The precipitated
material was centrifuged on an Airfuge and the pellet solubilized for
analysis on SDS gels. The 60 kDa band is observed on autoradiographs in
the pellet in which antiserum is added or in the supernatant where
antiserum was not added.
<p>
Phosphorylation reactions conducted with vesicle membranes using cAMP
as before. cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunits I (RI) and II
(RII) had been purified from rabbit muscle and bovine heart, resp., and
had been labeled with 8-azido-<sup>32</sup>P-cAMP using a photoaffinity
reaction described by Haley (<i>Biochemistry</i> <b>14</b>: 3852, 1975) in order to be used as standards for comparing
the labeled proteins from membrane proteins. Antibodies to the RI and RII
subunits had been prepared in guinea pigs and rabbits, resp., and were
used to immunoprecipitate the standards and the TX-100-extracted membrane
proteins after phosphorylation. Autoradiographs of gels in which the
standard and phosphomembrane proteins were treated with anti-RII and
adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose showed the presence of RII of two types
(RII-1 and RII-2) in the membranes. The RI standard and RII standard mixed
with anti-RI and anti-RII in one tube showed excellent bands at 49 and 54
kDa, the MWs for RI and RII, resp., with no splitting of the RII seen in
the RII-1 and RII-2 microheterogeneity. There was no RI detectable at all.
<p>
The Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin treatments also increased
phosphorylation into the 29.8 kDa band. The dose dependence of CaM was
assessed in the range of 10-40 &micro;g/ml with Ca<sup>2+</sup> varied. In
general an increase in phosphorylation of the 29.8 kDa protein was seen
dramatically at pCa 4.0, somewhat less at pCa 5.0, and minimal at pCa 5.5.
The amount of phosphorylation at pCa 4.0 with [CaM]=7 &micro;g/ml was the
same as that at pCa 5.5 and [CaM]=17.5 &micro;g/ml.
<p>
Note: in the discussion, it is stated that the 69 kDa band did not
alter its phosphorylation in response to either cAMP or the
Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM treatments. This suggests a phosphorylation system
independent of the effectors used in this study.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>. Conclusions: (1) TH and a cAMP-dependent protein
kinase are present in chromaffin vesicles along with the cytosolic forms
of the enzyme. (2) Our vesicles are not contaminated with cytosolic
components since vesicles are of high purity, TH has been shown to be in
chromaffin granules by subcellular fractionation techniques and
immunocytochemistry, and the association of the R subunit of PK-A with
chromaffin granule membranes is now demonstrated as a result of the
immunoprecipitation experiments with detergent-solubilized material. (3)
Type I PK-A is not present in vesicle membranes. (4) An interesting
membrane protein of 30 kDa is phosphorylated in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM
system, and a protein of this MW has been reported elsewhere to be
phosphorylated by the same treatment.

Effects of phospholipases on the kinetic properties of
rat striatal membrane-bound tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Rat striatal tyrosine hydroxylase can be isolated in both a 
soluble and a synaptic membrane-bound form. The membrane-bound enzyme, which 
exhibits lower Kms for both tyrosine (7 &micro;M) and reduced pterin cofactor 
(110 &micro;M) relative to the soluble enzyme (47 &micro;M and 940 &micro;M, 
respectively), can be released from the membrane fraction with mild detergent, 
and concomitantly its kinetic properties revert to those of the soluble enzyme. 
Treatment of membrane-bound tyrosine hydroxylase with C. perfringens 
phospholipase C increased the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of the enzyme for tyrosine to 
27 &micro;M and the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> by 60% without changing the 
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for cofactor. In contrast, treatment of membrane-bound 
tyrosine hydroxylase with V. russelli phospholipase A2 increased the 
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine to 48 &micro;M, increased the 
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>, and increased the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for cofactor to 
560 &micro;M. The enzyme remained bound to the membrane fraction following both 
phospholipase treatments. Addition of phospholipids to treated enzyme could 
partially reverse the effects of phospholipase A2 treatment, but not the effects 
of phospholipase C treatment. The kinetic properties of phospholipase-treated, 
detergent-solubilized tyrosine hydroxylase were identical to those of the 
control solubilized enzyme. Tyrosine hydroxylase appears to interact with 
synaptic membrane components to produce at least two separately determined 
consequences for the kinetic properties of the enzyme.

Determination of some molecular parameters of tyrosine

<b>Abstract</b>: The molecular parameters of
tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2) from rat adrenal, rat striatum, and
human pheochromocytoma were determined by combined gel filtration and
sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The enzyme from rat adrenal has a
calculated molecular weight of 228,000, a Stokes radius of 60.9 A, a

tissue has a calculated molecular weight of 255,000, a Stokes radius of
68.2 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 9.08S, and a frictional ratio of

Studies on tyrosine hydroxylase system in rat brain
slices using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical
detection
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: A new method for the
measurement of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; EC 1.14.16.2) activity in brain
slices was developed by using high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) with electrochemical detection (ED). To estimate TH activity in
brain slices containing all of the components of the enzyme system,
tetrahydrobiopterin, dihydropteridine reductase, and TH itself, slices
were incubated with NSD-1055, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid
decarboxylase, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) formed from
endogenous tyrosine was measured using HPLC-ED. Hydroxylation of
endogenous tyrosine to DOPA in striatal slices was linear up to 90 min at
37 degrees C, and increased by incubation with 20 mM K+ to depolarize the
nerve cells. Furthermore, the formation of DOPA could be detected in all
parts of brain regions examined, and the activity in this slice system was
nearly parallel to the maximal velocity of the homogenate from the slices
as enzyme in the presence of saturating concentrations of tyrosine and
6-methyltetrahydropterin as cofactor. This assay system should be useful
to study the regulatory mechanisms of TH in relatively intact tissue
preparations.

Tyrosine hydroxylase inactivation following cAMP-dependent phosphorylation activation
<p class="Para1">
Inactivation of TH following phosphorylation inactivation
can be explained by loss of PK-A activity and subsequent dephosphorylation
of TH. Rat striatal homogenates were prepared after cAMP activation and TH
and PK-A activity and cAMP concentration followed over time. An endogenous
PK-A activity is present and declines with a loss of cAMP caused by
conversion to 5'-AMP by an endogenous phosphodiesterase. When cAMP is
added exogenously after both PK-A and TH activity, as well as cAMP to
basal levels, a temporary MgATP-dependent activation is observed, reaching
50% of the original value (although the PK-A activation is nearly that of
the original). The decline in TH activity then correlates to loss of cAMP
content and PK-A activity. All preincubation mixtures contained 500 &micro;M
theophylline to inhibit PDE, although cAMP levels still decline although
slowly. The reactivation phenomenon can also be observed by addition of
PK-A C subunit alone. Nearly full reactivation of TH occurs with excess
purified PK-A C subunit or use of greater amounts of cAMP.

Tyrosine hydroxylase activation in depolarized
dopaminergic terminals: involvement of calcium-dependent phosphorylation
<p class="Para1">
Striata from adult male Charles River rats were sliced
and incubated 10 min at 37&deg; in 5 ml of Krebs-Henseleit medium containing
EGTA instead of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Some other striata were treated with 2 mM
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP or 0.1 mM forskolin. Depolarization was achieved with 1
ml addition of 3 M KCl and 0.2 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> after 5 min incubation.
Experiments were stopped by filtering samples through nylon mesh (0.06 mm
pore size). Tissues on the nylon mesh were rapidly frozen in dry ice,
homogenized within an hour in 20 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.0, 2 mM
mercaptoethanol, 10 mM NaF, and 20 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>(the last two to
inhibit phosphatases). (Studies used to measure pH dependency involved use
of 10 mM HEPES at pH 6.0 rather than Tris-acetate.) The 40000 <i>g</i> supernatant was obtained and TH activity assessed with 10
&micro;M tyrosine and 250 &micro;M 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>. The addition of
K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (60 mM and 4.0 &micro;M in the final
solution, resp.) doubled the activity of TH extracted from striatal
slices. The addition of K<sup>+</sup> alone or of Na<sup>+</sup> plus
Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not activate TH. In the presence of Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP
or forskolin, activity was also increased, but neither agent required
Ca<sup>2+</sup> for the activation. The kinetic analyses of the
K<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated TH showed that a marked increase
in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> was observed rather than any change in the
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine or 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>. With the
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP- and forskolin-activated TH, activation resulted from a
change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> in the pterin cofactor. Only one pH
optimum in the control or depolarized slices is observed (pH 6.0), but the
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP- and forskolin-treated slices showed two pH
optima (pH 6.0 and 7.1).
<p>
Coincubation of forskolin with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP did not demonstrate
significant activation with either agent used alone, suggesting they work
through an identical mechanism to activate TH. However, additional
activation was observed when K<sup>+</sup>-depolarized slices were treated
with optimal concentrations of Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP or forskolin, suggesting
that depolarization did not work through increasing cAMP levels.
<p>
The direct effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on TH was assessed over a 20-500
&micro;M range, and there was no change in conditions which activated Trp
hydroxylase via a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neutral protease.
Ca<sup>2+</sup> tested in this range in the presence of 5 mM
MgCl<sub>2</sub> present in the assay medium also had no effect. However,
addition of 0.5 mM ATP plus 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> with the 20-500 &micro;M
range did increase TH activity which could be blocked with trifluoperazine
(IC<sub>50</sub>=60 &micro;M), suggesting that CaM was involved. With a 2-5
&micro;g addition of exogenous CaM, the inhibitory effect of trifluoperazine
could be overcome. Soluble proteins isolated from supernatants incubated
in [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulated
phosphorylation in conditions producing TH activation. The kinetic data
show activation of TH in the ATP-Mg-Ca mixture is associated with an
increase in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> with no change in enzyme affinities for the
substrates.
<p>
Note also that TH activated by either cAMP-dependent phosphorylation or
by Mg-Ca-ATP was subsequently filtered through Sephadex G-25 to remove
phosphorylating mixtures, then treated with the other of either
cAMP-dependent phosphorylation or Mg-Ca-ATP. This treatment resulted in
activation as well, indicating that the two processes of TH activation
were distinct.

increased dopa synthesis in both control and stimulated ganglia. This
effect of physostigmine was completely blocked by hexamethonium and
atropine. Dopa synthesis was also significantly increased when ganglia
were incubated in a medium containing an elevated concentration of K+ (55
mM). This stimulatory effect of high K+ was totally dependent on the
presence of Ca2+ in the medium, was decreased by 60% by prior
decentralization of the ganglion, and was unaffected by hexamethonium and
atropine. The data demonstrate that tyrosine hydroxylase activity is
rapidly increased after preganglionic nerve stimulation and suggest that
this increase is mediated in part by acetylcholine and in part by a second
(noncholinergic) transmitter. The effects of an elevated K+ concentration
may be mediated both by the release of a noncholinergic transmitter from
the preganglionic nerve terminals and by direct depolarization of the
ganglionic neurons.

Tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the brain and adrenal
gland of rats following chronic administration of ethanol
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The effects of chronic
administration and ethanol withdrawal on the activity of tyrosine
hydroxylase were examined in the adrenal gland and six brain regions,
including the frontal cortex, hippocampus, locus coeruleus, striatum,
substantia nigra, and hypothalamus. Ethanol was administered to rats by
oral intubation every 8 hr for 48 hr in amounts based upon their state of
intoxication. One hr after the last intubation, tyrosine hydroxylase
activity was not significantly different from control values in either the
adrenal gland or brain. Forty hr following the last ethanol intubation,
tyrosine hydroxylase activity was significantly increased above control
values in both the adrenal gland and locus coeruleus. Tyrosine hydroxylase
activity in the remaining five brain areas was unaffected by ethanol
treatment. Immunotitration studies indicate that the increases in tyrosine
hydroxylase activity found in the adrenal gland and locus coeruleus 40 hr
after ethanol administration were due to an increase in enzyme protein.
These data indicate that high blood ethanol concentrations maintained over
a period of time (48 hr) do not affect adrenal gland or brain tyrosine
hydroxylase activity. However, withdrawal from ethanol following 48 hr of
treatment does produce an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the
adrenal gland and locus coeruleus, similar to that seen following other
stresses.

Evidence for the involvement of a cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase
in the activation of soluble tyrosine hydroxylase from rat striatum
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Activation of rat striatal
tyrosine hydroxylase [TyrOHase; tyrosine monooxygenase; L-tyrosine,
tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.16.2]
by ATP/Mg2+ and endogenous protein kinase can be produced without the
addition of cAMP. This activation is not due to endogenous free catalytic
subunit derived from cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In the presence of
amounts of protein kinase inhibitor sufficient for complete inhibition of
striatal cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the cAMP-mediated activation of
TyrOHase, addition of ATP/Mg2+ results in an enhancement of TyrOHase
activity. Enzyme activation does not occur when the nonhydrolyzable form
of ATP, adenylyl imidodiphosphate, is substituted for ATP. When TyrOHase
is assayed in the presence of ATP/Mg2+ and different concentrations of
either tyrosine or 6-methyltetrahydropterin co-factor, a 2-fold increase
in enzyme <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is demonstrable, with no change in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for either
substrate or cofactor. In contrast, in the presence of cAMP and ATP/Mg2+,
both an increase in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and an enhanced affinity for pterin cofactor are
demonstrable. In the latter circumstance, the 2-fold increase in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> can
be attributed entirely to the action of cAMP-independent protein kinase.
The addition of either EGTA or CaCl2 does not modify the effect seen in
the presence of ATP, suggesting that the effect of ATP/Mg2+ is not
mediated by a Ca2+-dependent protein kinase. These data support the
existence of a cAMP-independent striatal protein kinase that can catalyze
the activation of TyrOHase.

Cell contact-mediated regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase
synthesis in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The specific activity of
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells can be
controlled by changing cell density. Chromaffin cells initially plated at
low density (2-3 X 10(4) cells/cm2), and subsequently replated at a
10-fold higher density showed a sixfold increase in specific TH activity
within 48 h, resulting from enhanced synthesis (increased number of TH
molecules as demonstrated by immunotitration and blockade by
cycloheximide) rather than activation. The density-mediated TH induction
was blocked by inhibitors of both messenger RNA synthesis (alpha-amanitin)
and processing (9-beta-arabinofuranosyladenine), indicating a
transcriptional level of regulation. Medium conditioned by high density
replated cells could not mimic the effect of high density plating itself,
thus direct cell contact, rather than a diffusible factor, is responsible
for the density-mediated TH induction. Since neither acetylcholinesterase
nor lactate dehydrogenase specific activities were increased by high cell
density, it can be concluded that the contact-mediated induction of TH is
rather specific, and not the result of a general process of enzyme
induction.

Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells:  high-yield purification and viability
in suspension culture
<p class="Para1">
Bovine adrenal glands were harvested within 20-30 min of kill.  Most of
fat was trimmed and the gland placed in plastic bag on ice.  At the
laboratory, glands given rinse with 95% EtOH, trimmed carefully of remaining
fat and connective tissue, then sprayed with EtOH again.  A collar
composed of trimmed adreno-lumbar vein was fashioned after trimming away
the adrenal cortex;  a perfusion catheter was inserted and held with surgical
thread.  The catheter was designed very strictly:  polyethylene tubing
is plugged with a glass stop on one end and a series of holes by needle
puncture are made in the last 2.5 cm of the tubing (therefore the catheter
must be inserted at least 2.5 cm).
<p>
Four or 8 glands are processed at one time with Masterflex peristaltic
pump tubing.  The first perfusate is HBA buffer (HBSS with 0.1% BSA, pen/strep)
to facilitate cooling.  Glands are then perfused with recirculation of
fresh HBA for 15 min.  Glands are transferred to another beaker, perfused
w/o recirculation with 200 ml cold HBA which removed RBCs, then perfused
with recirculation with HBB (HBA, but BSA is 1%) containing 70 U/ml
collagenase (Sigma Type I at about 30&deg;.  The volume is about 35 ml/gland.
The collagenase is at least 10-fold lower since higher percentages reduce
cell yield despite the more thorough digestion.  The original HBB-collagenase
was not buffered, but 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, signficantly improves the yield.
<p>
2-2.5 h later at 20 ml/min/gland perfusion rate, the glands are swollen
and easily rended to liquefaction with hemostats.  The rended material
is strained through stainless steel sieve, then an 88 &micro;m nylon mesh
in several serial successions.  These filters are additionally washed
to recover all possible material.  Final volume is 45 ml/gland.
<p>
Filtrate is moved to 40 ml conical centrifuge tube (Pyrex 8142), with
15 ml/tube and spinning is at 50 &times; g for 5 min.  Pellet is
resuspended in 15 ml Hanks' B, and another spin for 3 min performed.
Pellets now suspended in Ham's F-12 with 10% newborn calf serum.
Filtering through 66 &micro;m nylon mesh removes filamentous material
forming when Ham's F-12/serum is added for a second time after a spin.
Attempts were always made to eliminate cloudiness or apparent debris.
After viability determination with trypan blue, cells were resuspended
to 600,000/ml.  Yield are generally 200-400 million cells per medulla.
<p>
Because a substantial number of cells are not chromaffin in this
initial cell fraction, a technique eliminate contaminating types
(fibroblasts) was employed.  Cells were transferred to 32 oz
prescription bottles or to Falcon 3042 flasks (130 cm<sup>2</sup>)
at 20 million cells per flask, 30 ml media.  After 6 h in the incubator
unattached cells were recovered, suspensions pooled and diluted to
200,000/ml and then placed in plastic petri dishes  Viability was
better than 90% (usu. 95%).  Generally 30-60% of the cells in the
initial cell fraction are viable nonadherents.  The greater the
ratio of cells to plating surface area, the better the selection of
nonchromaffin cells.
<p>
Optimal media conditions were tested against a panel of media
(Ham's F-12, Eagle's Basal Medium, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium,
BGJ, McCoy's 5A, and Trowell T8) and of sera (fetal, newborn,
bovine vs. horse, and various vendors).  F-12, McCoy's or Trowell's
in combination with either fetal or newborn gave satisfactory
results, but Ham's F-12 with 10% newborn (heat-inactivated from Gibco)
was the best in terms of a balance of cost, availability, and
overall performance.  Eagle's Basal, BGJ, and any use of horse serum
was less than satisfactory.  At 20,000/ml, medium did not require
replacement during a 2-week period.  6 &micro;g/ml cytosine arabinoside
was used as an anti-mitotic where monolayers were desired.
<p>
Dichromate was used to stain for norepinephrine and epinephrine
(Hillarp &amp; H&ouml;kfelt, 1953).  After removing medium, 0.1 M
sodium chromate-dichromate, pH 6.0, was added and left for 24 h.
Cells were then rinsed with saline then covered with 100% glycerol,
and cells with brown staining counted.  Formaldehyde-induced fluorescence
of the catecholamines was obtained by removing medium from plated
cells and adding 3.7% formaldehyde (10% formalin) in 0.32 M sucrose.
After 1 min, plates were dried for 5 min with a 400 W hair dryer
placed 20 cm away, incubated 3 h @ 80&deg; in a vessel with paraformaldehyde
pellets and atmosphere with 85% sat'd water vapor.  A fluorescence
microscope was then used to visualize fluorescence.
<p>
For electron microscopy cells in suspension were pelleted (40 &times; g, 4 min) 
and suspended in Ham's F-12 with 4% glutaraldehye for 2 h at room temp.  Cells 
again pelleted and incubated in Caulfield's buffer with 4% glutaraldehyde (2 h), 
then in 1% osmium tetroxide in Caulfield's for 2 h, then in 0.5% uranyl acetate 
in 50 mM veronal for 2 h.  Samples were rinsed, dehydrated gradually in ethanol, 
then embedded in Epon/Araldite.
<p>
Respiration in cells was determined by suspending in PBS with 10 mM
<span class="small-caps">d</span>-glucose with
4 million cells in the 3 ml air-saturated space fitted with Clark-type
oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Model 53) at 37&deg;  Measurement
was over a 60 min period.
<p>
Enzymatic activities of TH, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.17.1),
aromatic <span class="small-caps">l</span>-amino acid
decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28), catechol O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.6),
and monoamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.4) were measured according to published
procedures with some modifications.  Catecholamine biosynthesis was
checked by determining <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> with exogenous
<span class="small-caps">l</span>-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]tyrosine.
1 million cells in 100 &micro;l are placed on ice, and 100 &micro;l of
buffer with labeled tyrosine.  These are placed in a 37&deg; shaking
water bath.  After 10 min, 200 &micro;l 10% trichloroacetic acid is added
and the gaseous CO<sub>2</sub> is collected.  Perchloric acid extracts
of cells run over alumina columns were used to assay levels of norepinephrine
and epinephrine.
<p>
Cells in the initial digest ranged in size from 5-30 &micro;m
and there was fibrous and particulate debris.  Filtration and rate
centrifugation eliminated most of the RBCs and noncellular material.
Three cell types were revealed by phase-contrast microscopy:  smooth
phase-bright cells 20-30 &micro;m in diameter; rough or surface-granular,
relatively less phase-bright cells of the same size;  clumps of smaller
cells 8-10 &micro;m in diameter.
<p>
Selective plating techniques show that one population of cells will
adhere to glass, tissue culture plastic, or collagen-coated surfaces
within 2-3 h.  Another population also adhered to collagen surfaces
within 2-3 h, but took 6-12 h on either glass or plastic;  these cells
attached to adherent cells from the first population.
<p>
Not all cells are catecholamine-positive.  Dichromate and FIF show
that only the smooth, slowly adherent cells were catecholamine-positive.
About 70% of cells exhibit FIF and 65% are dichromate-positive.  EM
shows that 60-70% of cells contain granules (chromaffin cells).
14% of cells showed the appearance of cortical cells.
Based on these results, selective plating procedures to enrich the
chromaffin cell fraction would involve plating for about 3 h to remove
strongly adherent nonchromaffin cells.
<p>
Chromaffin cells in monolayer cultures are viable for several weeks,
both on collagen and plastic.  Mitosis inhibitors are absolutely required
however, or the cells are overgrown.  Plastic petri dishes are made
of a grade of plastic not conducive to proliferation of cultured adherent
cells, which seem to require attachment.  Hence purity of chromaffin cells
can be obtained by culturing in non-tissue culture plastic.
<p>
Over time, chromaffin cells will form homogeneous type aggregates (adhere
to each other), and the size of aggregates increases with time in culture.
This is true whether cytosine arabinoside is present (6 &micro;g/ml) or
absent, or whether CaCl<sub>2</sub> is low (0.3 mM) or high (3 mM), or
whether the culture is gyrated or not.  Chromaffin cells from recently
dissociated tissues were not structurally or functionally different from
cells that had been in suspension culturs for 1, 7, or 14 days.
Typical ultrastructural features included chromaffin granules, pseudopodia,
invaginations, and an occasional cilium.  Cell aggregates featured
large extracellular spaces resembling canaliculi.  After 2 weeks some
cells showed dilations of endoplasmic reticulum.  In the non-tissue plastic
petri dishes, 5% of cells were not chromaffin (on the basis of lacking
granules) but did not proliferate despite the absence of mitotic inhibitors.
<p>
Basal oxygen consumption gradually increases during the 2nd week of culture,
but only if cells were stimulated with 55 mM KCl or 100 &micro;M carbachol
in the 1st week.  Protein levels do not really change over the 2 week
study. SDS-PAGE shows that the pattern of expression does not change from
day 1 to day 14.  Three of 4 catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme activities,
namely TH, AADC, and DBH, but not PNMT, held steady over the measured at day 0,
and every other day from day 1 to 13, with the exception of PNMT.
PNMT started to decline at day 5, then plateaued at day 9 to 20%
of its original level.  COMT was present in the initial cell digest,
but was undetectable when it was placed into culture.  Catecholamines
themselves decreased to 70% of their in vivo levels in the cultured cells,
but the decline was largely in epinephrine, consistent with the finding
that PNMT enzymatic activity drops off dramatically in culture.
There was a basal efflux of catecholamines (efflux not stimulated by
cholinergic secretagogue) representing 2-7% of total stores.  ACh
presence in the medium stimulated this efflux naturally, as shown in
the table below.  The effect of ACh was abolished in the presence
of EGTA.

Tyrosine hydroxylase regulation in the central nervous system
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase is
considered to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of
catecholamines in both the central and peripheral nervous system.
Increased or decreased neuronal activity, stress, lesions, drug effects,
endocrinological manipulations and experimental models of hypertension are
associated with alterations in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the
central nervous system. In many of these instances, the changes in the
activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the central nervous system that occur
are localized to discrete catecholaminergic pathways and nuclei in the
brain. The purpose of this review is to summarize and assess this
information and to provide insight into the function of catecholamine
systems in the brain and their interactions with other putative
neurotransmitter systems.

Simultaneous simple purification of tyrosine hydroxylase and

Rat adrenal glands and caudate nuclei (~3 g total) were
homogenized (together?) in 4 vol. of 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.3) containing
0.32 M sucrose using a Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged 100,000 g
for 60 min, and the supernatant applied to an 8 ml DEAE-Sephacel column
equilibrated in 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.3) + 8% sucrose + 1 mM DTT. The column
is washed, and dihydropteridine reductase (DPR) is eluted with 50 mM NaCl,
while TH is eluted with 250 mM NaCl. The pooled eluate is brought to 40%
saturation with AmSO<sub>4</sub>. The precipitate is collected 25000 g for
15 min. The precipitated is resuspended in 20 mM KP<sub>i</sub> buffer at
pH 7.3 containing sucrose and DTT and passed over Bio-Gel A-1.5m (75 x 1
cm). Further purification is done on heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (2 x 1.6 cm),
equilibrated in phosphate buffer containing 0.1 M KCl. The enzyme is
eventually eluted with 0.4 M KCl. DPR purification continues with
incubation of the DEAE-Sephacel active pool with 100 &micro;M

<p>
These procedures for the rat adrenal gland can be done in 3 days.
DEAE-Sephacel completely separates these activities. The rat DPR obtained
here was much more dependent upon NADH than NADPH. DPR at its final stage

electrophoresis.
<p>
TH was 758-fold pure and the yield 21% with a 812 nmol/min/mg protein
activity. TH from rat caudate nuclei was 572-fold pure with a 31% yield
and 489 nmol/min/mg protein spec. act. One band at 60,000 was present in
gels. The preparation was unstable however, losing 50% of the activity
after 5 h at 4&deg; in the presence of 8% sucrose and 1 mM DTT. At -80&deg;,
activity could be stored for 1 month without appreciable loss.

Inactivation of tyrosine hydroxylase by reduced pterins

<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase [E.C.
1.14.16.2] is inactivated by incubation with its reduced pterin cofactors
L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin,
2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin and
2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin. Each of the two

unnatural (6S) form at equimolar concentrations. The pterin analog
6-methyl-5-deazatetrahydropterin, which has no cofactor activity, also
inactivates the enzyme whereas the oxidized pterins 7,8 dihydrobiopterin
and biopterin do not. The inactivation process is both temperature and
time dependent and results in a reduction of the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> for both
tetrahydrobiopterin and tyrosine. Neither tyrosine nor oxygen inactivates

Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA by glucocorticoid
and cyclic AMP in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line: isolation of a cDNA
clone for tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA
<p class="Para1">
Subclones of PC12 cells (PC8b) were isolated which differ
in basal and induced TH mRNA expression according to in vitro translation
(in rabbit reticulocyte system) and immunoprecipitation. The ability of
cells to direct the translation of TH mRNA was assessed in PC8b treated
with either 1 &micro;M dexamethasone or 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP for a 2-day period
either alone or in combination. Results are determined as labeled amino
acid in anti-TH immunoprecipitated 60 kDa subunit normalized to total
radioactive incorporation in all proteins. The data show that
dexamethasone-treated cells were 8-9 times more active in directing TH
protein synthesis than untreated cells. The 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells also
showed increased TH synthesis, but only about 3-fold higher. The combined
dex+8-Br-cAMP treatment appeared to be additive (a total of 1% of all
protein synthetic activity).
<p>
Poly(A<sup>+</sup>)-containing RNA was isolated for construction of a
cDNA library into pBR322 vector. DNA dot-blot hybridization was the method
for screening. cDNA was prepared from
poly(A<sup>+</sup>)-enriched RNA and labeled, being taken from
the following cells: (1) dex+8-Br-cAMP treated PC8b cells, (2) untrated
PC8b cells (which express TH at one-tenth the level), and (3) untreated
PC11b cells which is a subclone and expresses TH at a very low level
(one-tenth of untreated PC8b). Single colonies are grown and applied to
triplicate filters for screening, and colonies showing greater and
consistent (after many hybridizations) hybridizations with treated vs
untreated low TH expressers are selected.
<p>
Selected positives were then grown and their plasmid DNA fixed to
filters; hybridization with poly(A<sup>+</sup>)-RNA extracted from
dex-treated PC8b cells was done. RNA which hybridized was then recovered
for in vitro translation and translation products analyzed by
SDS-PAGE/fluorography. It was not possible to visualize translation
products in total but immunoprecipitation with anti-TH, an RNA was found
to direct the translation of a 60 kDa subunit. The plasmid DNA hybridizing
to this RNA is called pTH.4. Restriction mapping showed the insert was 400
bp in length.
<p>
Other experiments included fractionating poly(A<sup>+</sup>)-containing
RNA on methyl mercury sucrose gradients and then seeing which fractions
directed the in vitro translation of immunoprecipitable TH. This
particular study revealed that TH mRNA co-migrates with 18 S rRNA. Total
RNA from PC8b cells or rat adrenal was fractionated by gel electrophoresis
and put on NC paper. The <i>Pst</i>I-<i>Kpn</i>I
fragment from pTH.4 was nick-translated (for labeling) and used as a probe
of the total RNA of PC8b cells. Results show a single band labeled exactly
at the position where the 18 S marker migrates, indicating that TH mRNA is
~1800-1900 bp long. The RNA from rat adrenal produced the same result.
Moreover, this agrees with results of Lamouroux et al who showed that TH
mRNA from rat and human pheochromocytomas is ~1900 nt long. A protein of
M<sub>r</sub> 60,000 would be approx. 550 amino acids with about 1650
nucleotides. With a poly(A) tail of ~100 nt, it shows that the
untranslated regions are not very big as for some other proteins.
<p>
Northern analysis shows that RNA isolated from PC8b cells treated with
Dex or 8-Br-cAMP or both is quantitatively higher than in RNA from
untreated cells. Hence these inducers affect the level of RNA content,
which was nonetheless indicated during the hybrid-selection process to
isolate TH-containing plasmid nonetheless. Since all bands from treated
and untreated cells have the same size, changes in expression are not
directed by RNA processing to produce mRNA species of different size (this
is considered in view of the limitations of resolving various species by
size on the Northern, which makes differences of 50-100 nt undetectable).
Longer exposures on film reveal larger sized species of 3 to 6 kb in cells
which had been treated which also appear in untreated cells after much
longer exposure. These likely are the precursors of unprocessed message:
the differences in treated and untreated suggest that increased
transcription or increased stability of all stages of TH RNA may be the
means by which these inducers act rather than by message stability alone.
<p>
The expression of TH mRNA was quantitated using RNA dot hyb. Cells
tested had been treated with 8-Br-cAMP, Dex, Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP, sodium
butyrate (a catabolite of Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP which has been reported to
increase TH activity in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line), and forskolin.
The Na butyrate treatment was also seen to increase TH activity in PC8b
cells over the 2-day period, but much less than with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP;
our results comparing combined treatments of butyrate with forskolin
against Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP indicates that Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP may act on TH
by a combination of butyrate action and through cAMP. In any case, the
table of data shows TH activity, TH mRNA level, and in vitro translational
activity of TH mRNA are all elevated with the treatments. The Dex
treatment produced the highest values in all three measures, and was
3-fold higher than the treatment (Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP)
producing the second greatest values. The Dex treatment show a 9-10 fold
increase in TH activity, a &gt;10-fold increase in translational activity,
and an 8-fold increase in mRNA levels.
<p>
Time courses for expression changes were also measured over a 48 h
period of treatment. PC8b cells were treated with forskolin and increases
were rapid and detectable after 4 h. These increases up to 12 h after
which time there is a gradual decline. TH activity determinations
correlated well with the changes in mRNA, showing a close link of protein
to mRNA. In the Dex-treated cells, increases were slower but never
declined and were still increasing at the end of the experiment, where
they appeared to approach their maximal levels for mRNA and TH activity.
Serum-free medium was also tested since it has been reported that many
peptide growth factors (NGF) found in serum influence the action of
glucocorticoids in increasing TH activity. Still the kinetic profiles of
mRNA and TH activity increases in the serum-free medium were similar.
Results shown here discount the previous studies which state that serum
proteins produce a permissive effect of the inducing agents since serum is
not present.

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is not involved in
the <i>in vivo</i> activation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the
adrenal gland after decapitation
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase is
activated in the adrenal gland in vivo after acute stresses, such as
decapitation or electroconvulsive shock. In nonstressed animals that are
anesthetized with pentobarbital prior to surgical removal of the adrenals,
approximately 5-10% of the enzyme molecules are in the activated form,
whereas in stressed animals, approximately 40-50% of the enzyme molecules
are in the activated form. In the present study, we have tested the
hypothesis that the stress-induced activation of the adrenal enzyme in
vivo is due to the phosphorylation of the enzyme by cyclic AMP-dependent
protein kinase. Soluble adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase prepared from either
stressed or nonstressed rats is incubated in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP and
purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase under optimal conditions for
the phosphorylation of the enzyme. Using this assay, we have measured the
number of vacant sites remaining on the enzyme, which are available for in
vitro phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. These
studies suggest that the initial, in vitro rate of phosphorylation of
tyrosine hydroxylase isolated from stressed rats is less than the initial
rate of phosphorylation of the enzyme isolated from nonstressed rats.
However, there is no significant difference in the final level of 32P
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase isolated from either stressed or
nonstressed rats. We conclude that, even though phosphorylation of
tyrosine hydroxylase by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase leads to the
activation of the enzyme under in vitro conditions, this mechanism cannot
account for the activation of the enzyme in vivo in the adrenal gland
following decapitation.

Effect of ethanol on tyrosine hydroxylation in brain
regions of long and short sleep mice
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The effect of ethanol on the
in vivo rate of tyrosine hydroxylation in 6 brain regions was examined in
two lines of mice selectively bred for a differential sensitivity to
ethanol. The mice are designated long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) and
lose their righting reflex for a duration of 100 minutes (LS) and 13
minutes (SS) following an intraperitoneal dose of ethanol of 4.0 g/kg.
DOPA accumulation after NSD-1015 administration was measured in the
absence and presence of ethanol (4.0 g/kg, IP) in the periods 5-35 minutes
and 85-115 minutes after saline or ethanol. There were no differences
between the lines in either basal catecholamine levels or basal tyrosine
hydroxylation rates (as measured by DOPA accumulation) in any brain region
except the cerebellum, where the norepinephrine content in the SS mice is
33% greater and the tyrosine hydroxylation rate is 25% higher than that in
the LS mice. In the presence of ethanol, there was a differential effect
on the in vivo tyrosine hydroxylation rate. In the cerebellum of both LS
and SS mice there was a decreased rate of tyrosine hydroxylation in the
early period after ethanol, but the rate in the cerebellum of SS mice
returned to the control value at 85-115 min. At that time, the rate in LS
mice is still decreased. In the locus ceruleus, hypothalamus and frontal
cortex, ethanol has no effect on the rate of tyrosine hydroxylation in
either LS or SS mice during the early period, but ethanol decreases the
rate during the later period in the LS mice only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

Phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase by calmodulin-dependent
multiprotein kinase
<p class="Para1">
Several ubiquitous and well known protein kinases were
tested for their ability to phosphorylate TH. Since all of these kinases
also phosphorylate glycogen synthase, this substrate was used as a
reference. The results show that casein kinases I and II, glycogen
synthase kinases 3 and 4, and phosphorylase kinase did not phosphorylate
TH at a significant rate (1% or much less than 1% of the rate at which GS
was phosphorylated). In contrast cAMP-dependent protein kinase
phosphorylated TH at 32% and calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase at
18% of the rate GS was phosphorylated (calcium and calmodulin were
required for CaM MPK). TH which had been incubated in the presence of 4
milliunits/ml PK-A or 4 milliunits/ml CaM kinase or both. PK-A
phosphorylated to 0.5 mol P/mol TH subunit and caused a 2-fold activation.
Phosphorylation by CaM kinase reached 0.3 mol P/mol subunit and no
activation was observed. Phosphorylation by combined kinases indicated an
additive incorporation, with activation similar to that produced by PK-A
alone.
<p>
Increasing the kinase concentration did have a changed effect in the
incorporation stoichiometry, with 16 mU/ml (4-fold higher) PK-A producing
a 0.9 mol P/mol subunit modification accompanied by 3-fold activation. 16
mU/ml CaM kinase phosphorylation reached 1.0 mol P/mol subunit, still with
no activation.
<p>
TH phosphorylated by PK-A was digested with trypsin and analyzed by
reversed-phase HPLC. Peptide A eluted at 12.5% acetonitrile. The CaM
MPK-treated TH produced a major radiolabeled phosphopeptide (C) eluting at
2-4% acetonitrile. Two minor peptides eluting at 5.5% and 12.5%
acetonitrile were also present, where the latter peak was peptide A. IEF
gels showed that both peaks migrated to the same pI, effectively proving
their identity. CNBr digestion of TH phosphorylated by either kinase
produced a single phosphopeptide of apparent MW of 37 kDa on SDS gels.
<p>
Rat pheochromocytoma cells were extracted and purified over
phosphocellulose and calmodulin-Sepharose using a procedure used to purify
skeletal muscle CaM MPK. Characterization of the eluate from the
CaM-Sepharose column indicated that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and
calmodulin-dependent kinase activity possessed an identical substrate
specificity with the skeletal muscle enzyme: CaM kinases from both tissues
phosphorylate synapsin I, glycogen synthase, TH, and other proteins at the
same relative rates. The pheochromocytoma CaM kinase preferentially
phosphorylated site C in TH and site 2 of glycogen synthase as expected.
>From 30 g of tumor tissue, 5.5 mU of kinase was isolated (0.18 mU/g
tissue). 1600 mU obtained from 4800 g rabbit skeletal muscle (0.33 mU/g)
shows a comparability between the tumor and the muscle tissue.

Relationship between activation and phosphorylation of
tyrosine hydroxylase by 56 mM K<sup>+</sup> in PC12 cells in culture
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells were prelabeled with 0.125-0.5 mCi/ml
<sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>. Labeled ATP determination was done using the
firefly luciferin-luciferase method with Boehringer-Mannheim's ATP
bioluminescence assay kit using a scintillation counter to measure the
emitted light. Specific radioactivity of ATP was near maximal after 30
min. At the end, cells were treated for 2 min with 56 mM K<sup>+</sup> and
there was no significant changes in ATP specific radioactivity.
<p>
SDS gel analysis of immunoprecipitates of extract supernatants (using
antiserum) reveals a M<sub>r</sub>~60,000 band labeled in the control
cells. Treatment with 56 K<sup>+</sup> resulted in a 3-6-fold stimulation
of phosphorylation. The time course of activation indicated an increase in
TH activity after 30 sec incubation with 56 mM K<sup>+</sup>,
with maximal activation seen in 3 min and still present after 10 min.
An increase in P incorporation was also seen
in potassium-stimulated cells after 30 s, maximal at 3-6-fold after 1 min
and persisting for at least 5 min. Other proteins were similarly
phosphorylated.
<p>
When Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were altered during
K<sup>+</sup> stimulation, basal TH activity was not dramatically changed
with the different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations used. Complete omission
of Ca<sup>2+</sup> did abolish any activation or phosphorylation induced
by potassium depolarization. Higher (5.2 mM) concentrations of
Ca<sup>2+</sup> did result in a maintenance of TH activation in the
K<sup>+</sup>-depolarized cells. Phosphorylation of TH was comparable
whether cells were depolarized in presence of either 2.6 or 5.2 mM
Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The effect of different concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>
were examined and a direct dose-dependent relationship was observed at the
four K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (4.8, 17, 35, 56 mM) used. Activation
was approximately 2-2.5-fold in 0.1 or 1.0 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>
from the 4.8 mM point to the 56 mM point. Phosphorylation was 3-fold
greater at the 56 mM compared to the 4.8 mM point.

Rapid activation of tyrosine hydroxylase in response to
nerve growth factor
<p class="Para1">
Sister PC12 cell cultures were treated with or without 50
ng/ml (1.8 nM) NGF (prepared from mouse submaxillary glands) for 30-60 min
and the extracts of the cells indicated TH activity increased 60 &plusmn; 10%,
the range being 30-140%. This increase was observed in 13 of 15
experiments, with the two negative experiments such that the dispersion of
data was too large to determine whether there was significant change. The
time course of activation was examined and maximal activity was achieved
after 30 min, half-maximal between the 2- and 5-min treatment points.
Activation was noted to be 2-fold: a change from 1000 pmol tritium/min/mg
to 2000. (Although not noted in their paper, the figure shows a falling of
activity at the 60 min time point.) A dose response analysis of activation
shows that 30 ng/ml (~1 nM) NGF is sufficient to produce maximal effect,
with half-maximal effect observed at 10 ng/ml. This concentration falls
within the range known for NGF to promote biological actions on PC12 cells
and for the K<sub>d</sub> of the high-affinity binding NGF receptors on
these cells and sympathetic neurons. Pre-incubation of the NGF solution
for 60 min with an amount of anti-NGF serum (0.5%) sufficient to
neutralize any neurite-promoting activity resulted in inhibition of
NGF-induced TH activation.
<p>
PC12 cells which had been pre-exposed to NGF for 3 weeks and which had
acquired a "neuron-like" phenotype were washed with NGF-free culture
medium and incubated 4 h in this medium. When NGF was then added for 30
min and cell extracts examined for TH activation, a significant increase
in the specific activity of nearly 40% was observed. The TH specific
activity of the cells after 4 h withdrawal did not differ at all from the
TH specific activity in cells treated with NGF during the pre-exposure
period.
<p>
The activation of TH by NGF was investigated for the possibility that
different activity values might be observed at different assay pH. Such
differences in the % increase in activation have been observed with use of
different pH for the assay. Although the specific activity at pH 7.4 was
significantly lower than that when assayed at pH 6.1, the % increase in TH
activity was proportionally the same. Cultures treated with 10 &micro;M
emetine, a protein synthesis inhibitor, for 30 min before and during
exposure to NGF did not cause inhibition of NGF-induced TH activation nor
did it affect TH specific activity in any way; emetine was found to block
94% of leucine incorporation under the conditions employed.
<p>
The kinetic constants of NGF-treated were assessed from double
reciprocal plots of the activity at different concentrations of Tyr
substrate. No change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> could be observed for the
NGF-treated cultures. However, a change in apparent
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> was
observed. Double reciprocal plots of activity vs. cofactor concentration
did show nonlinearity, as observed by Vulliet et <i>al.</i>
(1980), which can be more clearly seen with a Hofstee plot of
<i>v</i><sub>0</sub> vs. <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>/S.  Likewise a
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> change was observed here
(for TH in both states: the nonlinearity such two states for TH)
without a change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the cofactor.

Activation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior
cervical ganglion by nicotinic and muscarinic agonists
<p class="Para1">
Cervical ganglia were removed and desheathed from male
Sprague-Dawley rats. Ganglia were then incubated in standard medium
containing brocresine (at 150 &micro;M to inhibit DOPA decarboxylase) and
then tested with certain compounds (0.1 mM DMPP and 1 mM bethanechol) for
production of DOPA. 5-fold increases in DOPA synthesis were observed with
DMPP while a 2-fold increase was found with bethanechol. The action of
DMPP was dependent upon extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> since no
Ca<sup>2+</sup> (EGTA was not used) produced a 3-fold less response
(although DMPP w/o Ca was double that of the control w/o Ca). Bethanechol
stimulation was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent. In media with 1 mM EGTA,
bethanechol still stimulated DOPA production but the effect was attenuated
a great deal. This shows that nicotinic and muscarinic agonists act by
different mechanisms in regulating TH activity. In combined treatments
with DMPP added to cells in the presence of bethanechol, DOPA production
doubled. Such additivity further supports a process of distinct pathways.
<p>
8-Br-cAMP (1 mM) caused a 2-fold increase in DOPA accumulation, and its
effect is also additive to DMPP and bethanechol. Its actions was also
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent. Other muscarinic agonists such as muscarine,
oxotremorine, and pilocarpine, also stimulated DOPA synthesis; in fact,
muscarine was the most effective.
<p>
Under control conditions, DOPA accumulation in ganglia is linear for 30
min (shown in other studies and here). With muscarine treatment it is
enhanced and also linear for 30 min. With DMPP, which produces a more
pronounced DOPA increase than does muscarine, it is linear only to the 15
min time point (the next was 30). Thus the fading of linearity in the time
course can be used to justify a distinct mechanism. [This conclusion
appears shaky, since accumulation of DOPA in this amount could very well
inhibit TH activity.]
<p>
To correlate DOPA production with presence of a stable activation of
TH, homogenates were prepared and the pH dependence upon activity of the
untreated and the DMPP- or bethanechol-treated ganglia compared: in
controls, maximal activity was found at pH 6.0, falling off sharply at the
higher pH values. At all pH values tested, homogenates of stimulated
ganglia possessed higher relative TH activity, with DMPP producing a 40%
increase and bethanechol 20% at their pH maxima (also the same as the
control pH maximum: pH 6). At higher pH values, the percentage of
increased activity from stimulated ganglia was higher than at the pH
maximum, and since the ganglion intracellular pH is 6.8, this may be quite
significant, even though TH is not at its greatest <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> because
of the higher pH. Although the apparent in vitro TH activity increases as
a percentage seemed less than the increase in DOPA production with these
agents, their relative efficacies for both in vivo and in vitro results
show that DMPP has the greater effect. The effect of 8-Br-cAMP was
comparable to that of bethanechol.
<p>
The effect of DMPP on TH activity could be blocked by 3 mM
hexamethonium while that of bethanechol by 6 &micro;M atropine. The
inhibition is very specific for these agents, as shown in other reports.
Moreover, the earlier fading effect on DOPA production with DMPP
stimulation which was not found with linear DOPA synthesis with
bethanechol was found to be consistent with TH activity results (time
points at 5 and 30 min were taken of the ganglia homogenates).
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence on TH activation was also shown for DMPP, but
not for bethanechol or 8-Br-cAMP, consistent with the DOPA formation assay
results. Kinetic analysis of TH activation show that control cells have an
apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of 18.5 pmol/ganglion/min and an apparent
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> of 230 &micro;M. It is
noteworthy that the TH <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> value was greater for the in vitro
enzyme than the in situ enzyme, suggesting that TH is not utilized
maximally in the cell. The effect of DMPP caused both an increase in the
apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and a decrease in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for cofactor.
Kinetic constant determinations with bethanechol-treated cells were not
made since the increase in activation was not sufficient to distinguish it
reliably from controls.

Muscarine increases tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity and
phospholipid metabolism in the superior cervical ganglion of the rat
<p class="Para1">
Rat ganglia were incubated in
<sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> over a time course in the presence or
absence of 1 &micro;M muscarine. Extracted lipids on TLC plates could be
analyzed for phosphatidic acid (PA), and phosphatidylserine (PS), -choline
(PC), &#8209;ethanolamine (PE), and -inositide (PI), and diphospho- and
triphosphoinositides (DPI and TPI). Note that PS and PC could not be
separated on the TLC system used. After 10 min, all phospholipids with the
exception of PE show labeling. With muscarine present, labeling is
increased in PA and PI, and this is detectable after 2 min where it is not
if muscarine is absent. PA is more heavily labeled in muscarine treated
ganglia at time point 2 and 5 min, whereas PI becomes the more heavily
labeled at 10 min. These results are consistent with the knowledge that PA
is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of PI. Of interest is that
muscarine presence stimulated phosphate incorporation into DPI and TPI
over their controls in the 2 and 10 min time points but not the 5 min time
point. There was, however, no observed consistency of muscarine on these
PI phosphates. Since labeling of the PLs was not uniformly increased in
each species with muscarine present, muscarine can be said not to increase
merely the uptake of <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> or alter
the specific radioactivity of ATP. When ganglia are preincubated 60 min
with labeled phosphate, washed, then treated with muscarine (or not) for
10 min, muscarine is found to increase labeling of PI.
<p>
The muscarine dose dependence of PI labeling and DOPA synthesis were
both assessed and PI labeling was found to reach a maximum at 100 &micro;M
muscarine which was 15-fold greater than controls. DOPA synthesis reached
at most a 2-fold maximum at the same muscarine concentration [only 0, 10
and 100 &micro;M was tested]. The extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of
muscarine on TH activation has been previously shown not to exist: in the
absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, muscarine induced a 3- and
8-fold increase in PA and PI labeling, resp. When 1 mM EGTA is added,
muscarine-promoted PA labeling is attenuated, but has no effect on PI
labeling.
<p>
Bethanechol is another muscarinic agonist which was found less potent
than muscarine in producing increases in DOPA synthesis (Horwitz and
Perlman, 1984). Dose response curves using bethanechol show that
half-maximal PI labeling requires &gt;10 &micro;M. 100 to 1000 &micro;M
bethanechol causes a 3- to 4-fold increase in PI labeling, but this is
about 50% of that produced by 100 &micro;M muscarine.
<p>
Berridge has previously shown that Li<sup>+</sup> inhibits the enzyme
<i>myo</i>-inositol-1-phosphatase. 10 mM Li<sup>+</sup> does
not affect the control rate of PI labeling or DOPA synthesis in ganglia.
With muscarine present, PI labeling shows a 10-fold increase, but only a
2.3-fold increase with Li<sup>+</sup> present. Stimulation
of DOPA synthesis by muscarine was also blocked with Li<sup>+</sup>.
<p>
Phospholipase C from <i>B. cereus</i> was prepared and 7.5
U/ml enzyme was incubated with ganglia. A 9-fold increase in DOPA
synthesis was observed in one particular experiment, with a 7- to 10-fold
range of increase in other experiments. Phospholipase C from another
source (<i>C. welchii</i>) had the same effect, showing that it was
not something else in <i>B. cereus</i> causing the
response. (Note PLase-C would hydrolyze PI in mammalian tissues.) When
phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (cleaving the ester off the 2 position of
glycerol) was used, there was a negligible effect on DOPA synthesis. Since
PLase-A<sub>2</sub> is the enzyme which releases arachidonic acid for
formation of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, 100 &micro;M arachidonic acid
was also tried and the effect was the same. Deoxycholate at 1 mM and
digitonin (0.1 mM) were also used since they have been shown to increase
phospholipid labeling: they both increased DOPA synthesis 3-fold at these
concentrations. Use of 6 &micro;M atropine (a muscarinic antagonist)
completely blocked muscarine-induced DOPA synthesis increases but had no
effect on PLase-C-induced increases and only a small (35%) effect on
deoxycholate-induced increases, indicating that these agents operate on
distinct mechanisms.
<p>
TH activity was measured as well in PLase-C-treated ganglia to see if
the DOPA synthesis was correlated to TH activation. The specific activity
(in pmol DOPA/min/ganglion) was more than doubled in the assayed extracts.
<p>
As for PL phosphate labeling, both PLase-C and deoxycholate stimulated
PL labeling like muscarine. PLase-C increased labeling in both PI and PA,
whereas deoxycholate increased labeling of PA but not PI. It was
previously shown that DMPP, veratridine, and ionomycin all increased DOPA
synthesis by a mechanism dependent upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>, presumably
intracellularly and extracellularly: these agents also increased PL
labeling as well, but not as much (up to 3-fold) as muscarine. 8-Br-cAMP
has also been shown to increase DOPA synthesis, but it had no effect on PL
labeling in this study.
<p>
Muscarine has been reported to increase cGMP content and release of
dopamine from fluorescent cells in the ganglion. To see if muscarine was
acting to increase PL labeling through these substances, 8-Br-cAMP and
dopamine were incubated with ganglion, but neither affected PL labeling.
Phentolamine is a dopaminergic antagonist for superior cervical ganglion,
but it did not inhibit the action of muscarine. Muscarine does not affect
PL labeling increases through cGMP or dopamine.

The activity of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase is usually suppressed by
an endogenous factor in brain
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity of the crude extract from rat 
striatum had a sharp pH optimum at pH 5.6 and showed almost no activity at pH 7 
and higher. When the crude extract was adjusted to pH 5.2, the resulting 
precipitate showed high activity in the pH range of 6 to 7.5. Incubation of the 
acid-precipitated fraction with the acid-soluble fraction resulted in a 
remarkable decrease in the enzyme activity, as assayed at a neutral pH. These 
findings suggest that there is an endogenous factor inhibiting the activity of 
tyrosine 3-monooxygenase in rat brain.

Assignment of the human tyrosine hydroxylase gene to chromosome 11
<p class="Para1">
Mouse-human hybrid cell lines have been developed and are
ideal for chromosome mapping. These were used to follow segregation of the
human TH DNA. It was previously reported that a 1.9 kb mRNA species from
human pheochromocytoma hybridizes with a rat TH cDNA probe; the size is
identical with rat adrenal mRNA. Human cDNA was therefore obtained by low
stringency hybridization with rat probe of library. Seven hybrid cell
lines which have been karyotyped and contain select human chromosomes were
used as sources for DNA in Southern blotting reaction with human probe.
Initial screening shows that the TH probe reacted with cell lines which
had in common the presence of chromosomes 10 and 11. An additional panel
of three other cell lines which are known by karyotyping to contain much
fewer human chromosomes. The probe more or less reacted with all three
lines: only one of the lines contained chromosome 10 while all three had
chromosome 11. Presence of chromosome 11 in cells is confirmed by assay of
human lactate dehydrogenase A, its gene known to be present in the short
arm of 11. In situ hybridization using labeled total human genomic DNA as
probe indicated the absence of any critical human chromosome in the
material. Even though the X chromosome was present in all 3 lines of the
second panel, it was absent in hybrids for which TH DNA was supposed to be
positive. The gene is therefore on chromosome 11.

Tyrosine hydroxylase in "leaky" adrenal medullary cells:  evidence for
in situ phosphorylation by separate Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cyclic
AMP-dependent systems
<p class="Para1">
Bovine adrenal medulla cells were isolated from whole
medulla by protease digestion of thin slices of medulla and then rendered
"leaky" by treatment with ten pulses of high voltage electric fields (2000
V cm<sup>-1</sup>) of 200 &micro;s duration. Cells were then incubated for 5
min at room temp with 1 mM Mg[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP + 0.5 mM EGTA, then
incubated with 10 mM EGTA + either 10 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 10 &micro;M
Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or 10 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 20 &micro;M cAMP.
(Note that EGTA acts as a buffer-chelator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to produce
different concentrations of free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the buffering action
dependent upon the pH of the solution.) Phosphorylation reactions are
terminated with 12% TCA and sample run on 9% SDS gels, in which subsequent
autorads are scanned with a densitometer. At least 10 bands are found in
the low calcium reaction, and several of the bands are common with the
high calcium or low calcium + cAMP. A band at 59,000 is one of the major
bands in all reactions, with 3-fold differences between the high and low
calcium (measured by densitometry ratios) and 2.8-fold difference between
cAMP and low calcium. 20 &micro;M cGMP was tried but produced no effect.
<p>
Intact cells preincubated with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> but not
stimulated with any secretagogue showed the same phosphorylation pattern
as "leaky" cells stimulated with low calcium. Treatment of the intact
cells with 500 &micro;M acetylcholine or 10 &micro;M nicotine had the effect of
increasing phosphorylation into the 59 kDa band. Cells which had been
preincubated with labeled ATP instead of P<sub>i</sub> showed no such
effect. That the bands are proteins is shown by treatment of
TCA-precipitable material with 0.25 mg/ml <i>Streptomyces
griseus</i> protease prior to gel analysis, in which no band is seen. To
rule out the possibility that the 59 kDa band is a adrenal cortical cell
protein, cortexes were excised instead from glands, made "leaky", and
incubated with ATP in low and high calcium, and the reactions loaded onto
gels with total protein amounts equal to medullary proteins: the cortical
reaction showed virtually no 59 kDa protein.
<p>
Leaky cells were treated as before in low, high, and low calcium + cAMP
and then solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100. The detergent lysates were
treated with anti-TH serum or control serum, and Protein A-Sepharose, then
run on adsorbed proteins run on gels which were Coomassie-stained and
autorad. Stained gels, besides showing heavy and light chains of the IgG,
reveal a 59 kDa band in the anti-TH and no such band in the control.
Autorads show labeling of the band dependent upon presence of the high
calcium or low calcium + cAMP, although weak phosphorylation is seen in
the low calcium sample as well. A second treatment with anti-TH serum
eventually removes all the radioactivity from the lysate. Calcium dose
dependence upon phosphorylation was shown to be half-maximal at 1-2 &micro;M
but is 80-90% inhibited at 500 &micro;M, which is not due to calcium-induced
proteolysis since the protein band staining is unchanged. Catecholamine
release measurements correlate with the calcium dose studies. cAMP dose
dependence shows phosphorylation is half-maximal at 0.3-0.4 &micro;M. The
endogenous cAMP levels were rigorously determined to be 0.05 &micro;M or less
in leaky cells treated with and without high calcium (10 &micro;M free
Ca<sup>2+</sup> = 10 mM Ca-EGTA), although 2.5 mM MgATP
presence brought cAMP up to 0.1 &micro;M. 500 &micro;M acetylcholine also had
little effect on cAMP levels. Catecholamine release assays with the cAMP
treatment, unlike Ca<sup>2+</sup>, shows it has no effect. High calcium
and cAMP do however have an additive effect on phosphorylation of TH.
<p>
Time course studies on phosphorylation of TH and catecholamine release
within leaky cells shows that phosphorylation in TH is rapidly increased
in cells treated with 10 &micro;M calcium (in 5 min) compared to the
1000-fold less calcium, after which increases in phosphate parallel each
other. Catecholamine release is stimulated to 2.5-fold greater in high
than to low calcium, complete after 10 min. However, the Ca-EGTA buffer
system rather than the interaction of Ca and protein may be the
rate-limiting factor in these reactions.
<p>
The [ATP] dependence was also assessed: phosphorylation of all protein
bands in extracts is reduced when ATP is 0.1 mM, with the exception of a
66 kDa band reduced to 55% of its phosphate content than when ATP is 3 mM.
Ca-stimulated phosphorylation of TH and catecholamine release are
half-maximal at 0.5 and 0.29 mM ATP, resp. cAMP-stimulated TH
phosphorylation is half-maximal at 0.3 mM ATP. Sensitivity of the
Ca-induced pathway to trifluoperazine (TFP) by incubating leaky cells with
labeled ATP and EGTA as usual, but with 50 &micro;M TFP added as well, and
then starting the reaction with Ca-EGTA. After 10 min, catecholamine
release and TH phosphorylation were found to be 86% and 7% inhibited,
resp. 100 &micro;M TFP inhibited TH phosphorylation induced by cAMP 25% but
did not affect TH phosphorylation induced by calcium. Ca-induced
transmitter release in 100 &micro;M TFP was inhibited 75% however.
<p>
Phosphopeptide maps of immunoprecipitated TH from leaky cell extracts
treated variously were generated using 15% SDS gel analysis of material
digested with 5 &micro;g/ml <i>S. griseus</i> protease (60 min,
22&deg;). Three phosphopeptides (a, b, c) were found in the
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-treated cells where peptides a and b are the
major bands (by densitometric analysis of autorads). Peptide b intensity
is stronger than a in the cAMP + high calcium-treated cells. The
cAMP-treated cells on the other hand produce strong intensities in
peptides b and c, but peptide a is nonexistent.
<p>
Leaky cells were exposed to the phosphorylating conditions and then
frozen and thawed to lyse them. TH activity was assayed with 0.8 mM
6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin (DMPH<sub>4</sub>), 0.11 mM catecholamines,
and either Tris-maleate or MES buffer salt. Preincubation of cells with
ATP in low calcium was not significantly different on TH activity compared
to cells not preincubated with ATP. In high (5 &micro;M) calcium + ATP,
activity is increased 60% (effect apparently not due to Ca<sup>2+</sup>
since 5 mM EGTA addition to this does not alter results). With 20 &micro;M
cAMP, only a 26% activation is observed. Along with 5 &micro;M
Ca<sup>2+</sup>, TH activation is about the same as 5 &micro;M
Ca<sup>2+</sup> alone (no additivity is observed perhaps because the cAMP
effect is dwarfed by that of calcium). The effect of buffer salts is also
demonstrated: use of the anionic MES produced a significant difference in
activity than with the Tris-maleate salt. Indeed, MES without
phosphorylating conditions was higher than any of the Tris-buffered assays
with or without phosphorylating conditions.

Adenosine-dependent activation of tyrosine hydroxylase is
defective in adenosine kinase-deficient PC12 cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>:
(R)-N6-Phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) stimulates dopa production 3- to
5-fold in PC12 cells, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>)
of 50 nM. This increase can be explained by a stable activation of
tyrosine hydroxylase [TyrOHase; L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine:oxygen
oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.16.2] when it is phosphorylated
by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The activation of TyrOHase is mediated
by the adenosine-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase (EC<sub>50</sub> = 600
nM). PIA (10 &micro;M) is as effective as cholera toxin or dibutyryl cAMP in
activating TyrOHase in wild-type cells. Adenosine kinase-deficient mutants
of PC12 were found to be resistant to PIA-dependent activation of TyrOHase
(EC<sub>50</sub> = 100-1000 nM). This phenomenon was explored in detail in one
adenosine kinase-deficient mutant and was shown to occur because the
mutant was resistant to the adenosine-dependent activation of adenylate
cyclase. In this mutant, TyrOHase was activated 14-fold by cholera toxin,
suggesting that activated TyrOHase is about 14 times as active as
unactivated TyrOHase. These studies with kinase-deficient PC12 cells
provide genetic evidence that adenosine-dependent activation of TyrOHase
is mediated by acute increases in cAMP. When the adenosine receptor found
on PC12 cells is expressed in vivo, it might function as either a
presynaptic (i.e., localized on the nerve terminal) or a postsynaptic
(i.e., localized on the cell body or dendrite) receptor that regulates
rates of transmitter synthesis in response to cell activity.

Subcellular site of biosynthesis of the catecholamine

<p class="Para1">
Medullae were dissected and used to prepare free and
membrane-bound polysomes using a method adapted from the procedure used
for rat liver by Ramsey and Steele (see <i>Biochemistry</i> <b>15</b>:
1704-12, 1976; <i>Biochem. J.</i> <b>168</b>: 1-8, 1977; <i>Anal. Biochem</i>.
<b>92</b>: 305-313, 1979). Basically
medullary extracts are ultrafractionated in a SW 27.1 rotor for 2 min at
740 g then 12 min at 131,000 g. This S1 supernatant is a source of free
polysomes. Pellet is resuspended, membranes solubilized in Triton X-100,
and nuclei are pelleted out. Membranes are now solubilized in
deoxycholate, then spun at 25,000 g in an HB 4 rotor. A final purification
of free and membrane polysomes is done using discontinuous sucrose
gradient. RNA in polysomes is removed using guanidinium chloride by a
modified procedure originally given by Cox (<i>Meth. Enzymol</i> <b>12B</b>:
120, 1968) as changed by Sabban et <i>al.</i>
(<i>J Cell Biol</i> <b>91</b>: 637, 1981).
<p>
Ability of both the free and bound polysomes to conduct protein
synthesis was examined using increasing amounts of poly(A) mRNA in a
system employing <sup>35</sup>S-Met a precipitating any nascent protein
with TCA. The temperature was 25&deg;. The bound polysomes were less than half
as efficient as the free polysomes at the maximum reached in the mRNA dose
curve. SDS-PAGE was done of the translation products yielded from both the
free and the bound polysomes, with both fractions supporting the synthesis
of high MW products as well as low MW proteins.
<p>
Specific protein analysis was achieved by taking equal amounts of
radioactivity incorporated into protein taken from translations of mRNA
obtained from free or membrane bound polysomes, followed by
immunoprecipitation with antibodies to TH, PNMT (phenylethanolamine
N-methyltransferase), and DBH (dopamine &beta;-hydroxylase).
Both the anti-TH and the anti-PNMT
precipitated products from the <i>free</i> polysomal mRNA
moving at M<sub>r</sub>=61,000 and M<sub>r</sub>=32,000, resp. The

Acute stimulation of ganglionic tyrosine hydroxylase activity
by secretin, VIP and PHI
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: We have examined the ability
of a number of neuropeptides to increase tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
activity in the superior cervical ganglion in vitro. Secretin and
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) both increased TH activity, whereas
angiotensin II, bombesin, bradykinin, cholecystokinin octapeptide,
insulin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, [D-Ala2,
Met5]enkephalinamide, motilin, neurotensin, somatostatin, and substance P

not altered by prior decentralization of the ganglia, by addition of
hexamethonium (3 mM) and atropine (6 &micro;M), or by lowering the
concentration of calcium in the medium to 0.1 mM. Addition of carbachol (3
&micro;M) potentiated the effects of both secretin and VIP on TH activity.
Several gastrointestinal peptides with structural similarities to secretin
and VIP were examined for their ability to increase TH activity. Glucagon,
gastric inhibitory peptide and human pancreatic tumor growth
hormone-releasing factor produced no effect at a concentration of 10
&micro;M, while PHI increased enzyme activity.

<b>Abstract</b>: Incubation of rat superior
cervical ganglia with dimethylphenylpiperazinium (30 &micro;M) for 30 min
resulted in a two-fold increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity. This
effect was completely inhibited by substance P (30 &micro;M) but not by
substance P-free acid, kassinin or physalaemin. Neither of these four

Thus substance P, acting at a site which has a different pharmacology than
previously characterized substance P receptors, selectively inhibits
nicotinic stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. These data raise
the possibility that substance P may modulate the nicotinic regulation of
catecholamine synthesis in sympathetic ganglia in vivo.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglion
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: We studied the
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglion
of the rat. Ganglia were preincubated with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>
and were then incubated in non-radioactive medium containing a variety
of agents that are known to activate tyrosine hydroxylase in this tissue.
Tyrosine hydroxylase was isolated from homogenates of the ganglia by
immunoprecipitation followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
<sup>32</sup>P-labelled tyrosine hydroxylase
was visualized by radioautography, and the incorporation of 32P into the
enzyme was quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiograms. Veratridine
produced a concentration-dependent increase in the incorporation of 32P
into tyrosine hydroxylase, with 50 &micro;M veratridine producing a 5-fold
increase in 32P incorporation. The nicotinic agonist,
dimethylphenylpiperazinium (100 &micro;M), caused a 7-fold increase in the
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. The effect of
dimethylphenylpiperazinium was maximal within 1 min and decreased upon
continued exposure of the ganglia to this agent. The actions of
dimethylphenylpiperazinium and of veratridine were dependent on
extracellular Ca2+. Muscarine, 8-Br-cAMP, forskolin, vasoactive intestinal
peptide, isoproterenol, deoxycholate and phospholipase C also stimulated
the incorporation of 32P into tyrosine hydroxylase. These data support the

Electrical stimulation increases phosphorylation of
tyrosine hydroxylase in superior cervical ganglion of rat
<p class="Para1">
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased and maintained in
our facility for a week before use. Rats were killed by cervical
dislocation and the SCG removed and desheathed in oxygenated superfusion
medium. Ganglia were incubated in pairs for 90 min in this medium to which
<sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> was added. TH is found to be
labeled under control conditions, with amount of label constant for 20 min
(TH is obtained by immunoprecipitation of ganglia extracts and analyzing
on SDS-PAGE/autoradiography using densitometry). With electrical
stimulation the incorporated phosphate increased, more than 3-fold when
stimulation was for 30 s at 20 Hz, continuing to increase with 5 min of
stimulation at this frequency. After 5 min phosphorylation was 5-fold.
This stimulation was frequency-dependent: at 10 Hz stimulation for 5 min
produced the same result as for 20 Hz, but stimulation at 2 and 5 Hz
produced less incorporation. In a low Ca<sup>2+</sup>/high
Mg<sup>2+</sup> medium, no action potentials were recorded in
the postganglionic nerve and TH phosphorylation was not increased.
<p>
Increases in phosphorylation were also found to be reversible. Ganglia
stimulated for 5 min at 20 Hz and then left 30 min showed phosphate levels
in TH that had returned to control levels. Antidromic stimulation (20 Hz,
5 min) increased phosphorylation 4.4-fold. The incorporation of phosphate
caused by electrical stimulation was not into acid-precipitable material.
<p>
Hexamethonium is a nicotinic antagonist and used here (3 mM) could
partially block (~50%) TH phosphorylation caused by the electrical
stimulation. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and had no effect on TH
phosphorylation at the concentration (3 &micro;M) used in these experiments.
Combined atropine and hexamethonium still resulted in a 2-fold TH
phosphorylation increase from preganglionic stimulation.
<p>
The phosphoproteins were then separated using 2D-PAGE, and ~40
phosphoproteins were visualized. Comparison with unstimulated controls
shows several proteins in addition to TH having a greater phosphorylation.
The apparent MW and pI values of these proteins are 67,000 (5.1), 59,000
(5.7), 21,000 (5.6), 21,000 (5.8), 19,000 (5.0), and 19,000 (5.1).

Calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein
kinase C) phosphorylates and activates tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
<b>Phosphorylation and activation of TH by PK-C</b>. In
the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, TH is phosphorylated by PK-C in a
PtdSer/diolein-dependent manner. A maximum stoichiometry of 0.5 mol P/mol
62,000/60,000 Da doublet is observed. Compared to histone H1, an excellent
substrate for PK-C, TH is about half as effective a substrate. To study
activation, the standard two-step assay (1st step: phosphorylation; 2nd
step: activity assay determination) was performed. PK-C caused increased
TH phosphorylation with time, becoming maximal at 20-30 min. Additional
PK-C added at 40 min caused increased phosphorylation, showing that the
first plateau was due to kinase inactivation. Basal TH phosphorylation
amounted to 20-25% of that seen with PK-C and was not affected by calcium,
phospholipid, calmodulin, or Walsh inhibitor (a PK-A inhibitor).
<p>
TH activity also increased with phosphorylation up to 15 min, after
which there was a sharp decline. Addition of a second aliquot of PK-C at
40 min did not restore activity. This increase then decrease in activation
with increasing time of phosphorylation was reported earlier for cAMP
kinase. Control TH did not exhibit this phenomenon.
<p>
<b>Effect of TH phosphorylation on its affinity for
6-methyltetrahydropterin and tyrosine</b>. The concentration of 6-MTHP was
varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mM and TH activity was measured in the presence or
absence of PK-C in the two-step assay. In the absence of PK-C, the
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for 6-MTHP was 450 &micro;M while in the presence of enzyme,
the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> dropped to 110 &micro;M. No change in
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> could be seen. The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine
(varied from 10 to 100 &micro;M) was not changed by phosphorylation. However,
a 30% increase in apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> could be observed, although
this increase could be attributed to increased affinity for 6-MTHP, which
was subsaturating in this assay.
<p>
<b>Effect of TH phosphorylation on its susceptibility to dopamine
inhibition</b>. Dopamine was varied from 2 to 80 &micro;M in a two-step PK-C
activation assay (1st: 13 min; 2nd: 6 min). Two different 6-MTHP
concentrations were tested (0.1 and 1.0 mM). Dixon plots (1/v vs.
[inhibitor]) indicated linearity except for the data of 0.1 mM 6-MTHP with
kinase present. K<sub>i</sub> for dopamine was 4.2 &micro;M in the absence of
PK-C. On the basis of data obtained with higher dopamine concentrations,
the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> was 47.5 &micro;M in the presence of PK-C. When the lower
dopamine concentrations from the lower 6-MTHP data is considered, the
K<sub>i</sub> is 4.7 &micro;M, but this is probably due to the presence of
dephospho TH in the PK-C treated preparation.
<p>
<b>Comparison of phosphopeptide maps of PK-C- and PK-A catalytic
subunit-treated TH</b>. TH treated with PK-C or PK-A catalytic subunit was
subjected to chymotrypsin/trypsin digestion and separated on 2 D cellulose
plates. The pattern in each case was identical indicating that the two
kinases phosphorylated the same site on TH. Phosphoamino acid analysis
indicated that only serine was phosphorylated.

Effect of dexamethasone on biopterin levels and tyrosine
hydroxylase activity in PC-12 cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Culture of PC-12 cells in 1
&micro;M dexamethasone for 24, 48 or 72 hr did not alter significantly PC-12
cell total biopterin levels, although tyrosine hydroxylase activity in
extracts of cell homogenates was increased 2- to 3-fold. Increasing the
concentration of dexamethasone to 10 &micro;M did not change biopterin levels
or result in further increases in tyrosine hydroxylase activity measured
after 72 hr. Culture of cells in dexamethasone markedly decreased the
ratio of biopterin concentration to tyrosine hydroxylase activity. The
molar ratio of tyrosine hydroxylase subunits to biopterin in control cells
can be estimated to be approximately one. Therefore, following induction
of the enzyme by dexamethasone, there appears to be an excess of enzyme
molecules relative to cofactor molecules in these cells.

Detection of inactive or less active forms of tyrosine
hydroxylase in human adrenals by a sandwich enzyme immunoassay
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: A sensitive sandwich enzyme
immunoassay for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) from bovine and human adrenals
has been developed. Anti-TH antibody was prepared from bovine adrenal TH.
The assay system consisted of an antibody F(ab')2 immobilized on
polystyrene beads as a solid phase and of beta-D-galactosidase-conjugated
antibody. This method was highly sensitive and specific for the assay of
TH. Human adrenal TH level was determined by similar sensitivity as bovine
adrenal TH, suggesting the presence of common antigenic sites between
human and bovine adrenal enzymes. The presence of inactive or less active
forms of TH in human adrenals was revealed by purification of the enzyme
and monitoring with this enzyme immunoassay as well as with enzyme

Reduced tyrosine hydroxylase activity in nigrostriatal system of

Characterization of the sites phosphorylated on tyrosine
hydroxylase by Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phospholipid-dependent
protein kinase, calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase and cyclic
AMP-dependent protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
It was previously reported that TH purified from rat
pheochromocytoma could be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase
and calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase. This report now shows that
pheochromocytoma TH is phosphorylated by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and
phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PK-C) purified from rat brain or
sheep brain sources. In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and
phosphatidylserine, phosphorylation was increased 14-fold over controls,
with a 0.7 mol P/mol stoichiometry in the subunit. Using two different TH
preparations, initial phosphorylation rates at 0.5 mg/ml TH were 95-100%
of those for 0.2 mg/ml histone H1, one of the best PK-C substrates.
<p>
TH incubated with each of the three kinases in the presence of labeled
ATP and the phosphoprotein was digested with trypsin and analyzed on
reversed-phase HPLC. Chromatograms of PK-A- and PK-C-treated TH produced a
common phosphopeptide (A) which came off at 50 min (~21-22% acetonitrile)
into the program. The CaM kinase chromatogram produced both peptide A and
a peptide C (32 min; 14% acetonitrile), but peptide C is the apparent
primary site of phosphorylation for this kinase, since it truly
predominates relative to A at lower kinase concentrations. When TH was
phosphorylated by the three kinases individually or in combination,
digested with trypsin, and peptide A isolated on HPLC, subsequent
thin-layer polyacrylamide IEF always produced a single peptide of pI~4.
Various phosphorylated forms of a single protein species should be
resolved in this two-dimensional separation, so it is apparent the kinases
phosphorylate the same amino acid in the peptide. Edman degradation into
the third cycle of peptide A produced a "burst" of radioactivity no matter
which of the three kinases were used.
<p>
IEF of HPLC peptide C indicated that it was more acidic than A (pI~3).
Edman degradation of this peptide also produced a burst of radioactivity
on the third cycle. Partial acid hydrolysis followed by thin-layer
electrophoresis at pH 1.9 reveal that the only phosphoamino acids present
are serine.

Tyrosine hydroxylase activity and catecholamine
biosynthesis in the adrenal medulla of rats during stress
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Chronic hypotension and
hypoglycemia are known to increase the capacity for catecholamine
biosynthesis in the rat adrenal medulla by increasing the maximal velocity
of the rate-limiting enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The present report
indicates that the gradual increase in maximal TH activity is preceded by
a more rapid increase in the affinity of TH for its pterin cofactor. These
short-term alterations in adrenal TH activity are related to the severity
of the stress, associated with parallel changes in catecholamine
biosynthesis, and prevented by prior adrenal denervation. In contrast,
cold exposure, which leads to comparable long-term increases in adrenal TH
activity, does so without causing a prior activation of TH. However,
adrenal TH is activated by acute cold exposure if the sympathetic nerves,
that normally are stimulated during cold, are destroyed previously by
6-hydroxydopamine treatment. These and other observations suggest that
alterations in adrenal TH activity vary according to the type and duration
of physiological stress, and may be mediated by temporally distinct
processes.

Low-Na<sup>+</sup> medium increases the activity and the
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical
ganglion of the rat
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Incubation of the rat
superior cervical ganglion in Na+-free or low-Na+ medium increased the
rate of synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the ganglion
fourfold and caused a concomitant stable activation of tyrosine
hydroxylase. DOPA synthesis was half-maximal in medium containing about 20
mM Na+. Low-Na+ medium also increased the incorporation of 32Pi into
tyrosine hydroxylase; the dependence of tyrosine hydroxylase
phosphorylation on the Na+ concentration resembled that of DOPA synthesis.
The stimulatory effects of low-Na+ medium on DOPA production and on
tyrosine hydroxylase activity in vitro were dependent on extra-cellular
Ca2+. The stimulation of DOPA synthesis in low-Na+ medium was inhibited by
methoxyverapamil, an inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake, and was partially blocked
by tetrodotoxin, but it was not affected by the cholinergic antagonists
hexamethonium and atropine. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, stimulated
DOPA synthesis to about the same extent as low-Na+ medium and also
increased the incorporation of 32Pi into tyrosine hydroxylase. 8-Bromo
cyclic AMP (1 mM) also stimulated DOPA production in the ganglion, and
this stimulation was more than additive with that produced by low-Na+
medium. These data support the hypothesis that low-Na+ medium stimulates
DOPA synthesis by raising intracellular Ca2+, which then promotes the
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase.

A new mechanism for regulation of tyrosine
3-monooxygenase by end product and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
Striatal TH is abundant within these tissues, but crude
extracts have almost no activity at the physiological pH. TH can be
precipitated at an acidic pH and separated from its acid-soluble proteins.
What is interesting is that the acid-precipitated TH has a very high
activity at the neutral pH. Incubated with the acid-soluble fraction, it
loses its activity. (See Okuno &amp; Fujisawa, <i>BBRC</i> <b>124</b>: 223-228, 1984 for this entire work.) This endogenous
deactivating factor is dialyzable.
<p>
Crude extracts from rat striata were adjusted to pH 5.0 and the
resulting precipitate washed in acidic buffer to remove the endogenous
factor. The prep is passed through DEAE-cellulose to separate it from DOPA
decarboxylase. The acid-precipitated fraction shows high TH activity
between pH 5.8 and 7.4. Incubated with 1 &micro;M dopamine for 20 min at 30&deg;,
the TH activity at the pH 7.0 end drops significantly, a result of
importance since the rat brain pH has been found to be 7.0, which could
clearly affect TH activity. Time-dependent decreases could be shown with
as low as 10 nM dopamine.
<p>
Immunotitration shows that assay TH subunit concentration is 12.8 nM,
which shows that the 10 nM dopamine is stoichiometric. Other
catecholamines (NorEpi, Epi) were also capable of suppressing enzyme
activity. 3,4-dihydroxylphenylglycol, a metabolite of NorEpi, was also
effective. Although DOPA appeared to suppress activity somewhat, this is
unlikely since DOPA decarboxylase may have been contaminating and may have
produced some dopamine which was truly responsible for the inhibition.
<p>
It is well known that TH becomes many-fold activated at neutral pH when
phosphorylated by cAMP-mediated processes. If TH is suppressed completely
by an excess of dopamine and then treated with cAMP-dependent protein
kinase, a marked activation is observed. The acid-precipitated fraction
could also be activated by the kinase. The pH profiles of TH activity of
crude extract and acid-precipitated enzyme, now incubated with dopamine,
then treated with PK-A, appear indistinguishable from acid-precipitated
enzyme which was removed from dopamine, with a broad maximum from pH 6 to
7. A suggestion is put forward that TH is attenuated as a dopamine-bound
enzyme, then activated by signal transduction pathways causing its
activation.

Nerve growth factor and other agents mediate
phosphorylation and activation of tyrosine hydroxylase: a convergence of
multiple kinase activities
<p class="Para1">
Previously cAMP was shown to mediate the phosphorylation
of TH in cultured chromaffin cells (Melgeni et <i>al.</i>,
1982) and in PC12 cells (Halegoua &amp; Patrick, 1980). When PC12 cells
were treated with 1 mM Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP, a 2-4-fold stimulation in
labeled phosphate incorporation could be observed in a 60 kDa band in SDS
polyacrylamide gels. This band has been shown to contain TH as shown by
immunoprecipitation previously. After excision of the band, followed by
tryptic digestion and 2 D peptide mapping, four distinct phosphopeptides
(T1-T4) were evident on the autoradiogram. Comparison of the autorad of
control treatments to Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP treatments indicates that T1 and
T3 increase their phosphate contents, with T1 much greater than T3, while
T2 and T4 remain significantly unchanged. Similar results were observed
with 1 &micro;g/ml cholera toxin, which is known to raise cAMP levels. It is
noted that the relative ratios of the four labeled spots do not vary with
a group of cell cultures from a single passage labeled on the same day,
but there is variability among controls from cells of different passages
on different days. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the T1 and T3 peptides
from the Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP- or cholera toxin-treated cells indicated
phosphoSer.
<p>
The results observed here are contrasted with the results shown for TH
phosphorylation in response to 8-Br-cAMP in cultured adrenal chromaffin
cells. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping shows two phosphopeptides of which
only one has its phosphorylation increased by 8-Br-cAMP. There is a
possibility that the greater number of peptides with increased
phosphorylation is because of another 60,000 Da protein present, although
immunoprecipitation by anti-TH accounted for 92% of the radioactivity at
the 60 kDa region. PC12 cells prelabeled with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>
were treated with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP, lysed, immunoprecipitated, and 2-D
PAGE done on the immunoprecipitate. 3 spots on an autoradiogram in the pI
range of 6.1-6.3 were distinguishable at the 60 kDa region. When instead
the 60 kDa protein was removed from and SDS gel and then made to undergo
2-D PAGE, the same pattern was observed in an autoradiogram. These spots
were removed and trypsin-treated and the resulting peptides analyzed by
2-D TLE/C: T1-T4 were again the observed labeled peptides, and all spots
analyzed on HPLC appeared as one peak (indicating a single species).
<p>
A comparison was made with the earlier chromaffin cell study by
phosphopeptide mapping with the current system and the system in the
study, the difference in the methods being that the 1st dimension
electrophoresis is in a buffer of pH 8.9 in our system and pH 1.4 in the
earlier study. When the latter system is used, only two spots
corresponding to peptide C and E in the nomenclature of the Haycock et <i>al.</i> study appear, whereas with our system, four (T1-T4)
peptides appear. Spot E corresponds to T1, according to a method which
cuts out T1 of one system and found to run to spot E on the other and vice
versa: labeling of the peptide is increased by Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP
treatment. Spot C corresponds to all three peptides, T2-T4, as these
peptides cut out individually all migrate to spot C and vice-versa.
<p>
40 mM KCl treatment of PC12 cells resulted in the enhanced
phosphorylation of TH. This was shown to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent as
removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and addition of EGTA abolished the effect of
K<sup>+</sup>. The tryptic phosphopeptide pattern was different from the
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP treated TH with a 3.6-fold increase in T2 and a
1.5-fold increase in T3 and no change in T1 or T4 in the
K<sup>+</sup>-depolarized material. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the T2
and T3 from depolarized cells shows they contain only phosphoSer.
<p>
With NGF (50 ng/ml) treatment of prelabeled cells, subsequent tryptic
phosphopeptide mapping shows specific increased label in T1 and T3,
similar to the response seen with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP (1 mM) and cholera
toxin (1 &micro;g/ml), but the quantitative assessment showed that T3
(maximal 15.7-fold over controls) was labeled more relative to T1 (maximal
4.4-fold over controls) with NGF (<i>n</i>=10), whereas the opposite
was true for the other treatments (<i>n</i>=6). The
ranges were broad, however, with 1.8 to 4.4-fold for T1 and 3.5 to
15.7-fold for T3. The phosphorylated amino acids are serines.
<p>
PC12 cells were also EGF-stimulated (10 ng/ml) and the tryptic peptide
map reveals a different pattern, with T4 and T3 enhanced 4.3- and 4-fold
in phosphorylation in spots quantitated by scintillation counting or
quantitative densitometry, resp.
<p>
Since increase phosphoinositide turnover is observed with PC12 and
other cells by these agents, elevated DAG may activate PK-C which may be
involved in phosphorylation. Haycock et <i>al.</i> have
suggested that PK-C may be the mechanism by which TH is phosphorylated in
acetylcholine-treated chromaffin cells. When labeled PC12 cells were
treated with 140 ng/ml PMA, TH was rapidly phosphorylated and T3 was the
peptide shown alone to be phosphorylated. A 2.3-fold increase is the
result.
<p>
Of interest is the finding that T3 is the peptide common to all agents
as showing enhanced phosphorylation. T3 was sized on Sephadex G-25 in 1 N
acetic acid and detection by autoradiography of dried fractions indicates
an approximate 4000-4500 molecular weight, about 40 amino acids long. T3
further subjected to <i>Staph</i> V8 protease digestion at pH
7.8 demonstrated a new position on TLE/C, but still only a single spot,
possibly indicating the peptide contains no double-labeled amino acids.
Additional digestion of the V8-digested peptide spot with thermolysin
showed appearance of a spot at yet another position. This position was
found for triply-digested T3 no matter what treatment.
<p>
Activity assays for TH from the treated PC12 cells were assessed: cells
are incubated in brocresine (to inhibit DOPA decarboxylase) and pargyline
(to inhibit MAOs) and DOPA formation is assessed on HPLC with
electrochemical detection within 30 min of treatment. For NGF, EGF,
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP, K<sup>+</sup> depolarization, PMA, and insulin, a 2-
to 5-fold activation of TH activity was observed in all treatments with
the exception of insulin, which is used as a control here.

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase
in PC12 cells
<p class="Para1">
Cytosolic proteins from extracts of PC12 cells labeled
with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> and treated with elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>
were analyzed by SDS gels; the elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was
done achieved by opening voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>
channels, accomplished with high K<sup>+</sup> or by nicotinic cholinergic
agonists. Among the numerous phosphoproteins is a major one at
M<sub>r</sub> 60,000. Use of 100 &micro;M acetylcholine stimulated
phosphorylation into this band 33%. Prior EGTA or nitrendipine
(Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker) treatment blocked the
acetylcholine-induced phosphorylation. Other proteins besides the
M<sub>r</sub> 60,000 demonstrated a phosphorylation increase as well.
<p>
Polyclonal Ab to rat pheo TH was used with cytosolic extracts of
labeled PC12 cells and most of the protein in the 60 kDa region was
selectively found (data is not shown). When the 60 kDa band from SDS gels
of whole cytosolic proteins was excised, along with the 60 kDa band from
immunoprecipitated gel, and both digested partially using Cleveland
mapping of peptides, the pattern was nearly identical, with the difference
being in the <sup>32</sup>P found at the dye front. Partial
digestion with chymotrypsin for the 60 kDa bands from both gels. The 60
kDa band was further analyzed by 2 D mapping using SDS/IEF gels.
Prelabeled cells were incubated under control and
K<sup>+</sup>-depolarizing conditions. After preparation of the gels,
proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with
anti-TH. Three major isoelectric forms, corresponding to TH with 0, 1, and
2 phosphates are present. In control cells, most of the TH is the
monophosphorylated form, whereas with K<sup>+</sup>-depolarization, many
more species appear with a shift toward largely mono- and diphosphorylated
forms. A number of other proteins are observed to either increase or
decrease their net phosphate content with depolarization.
<p>
Activation of TH by K<sup>+</sup>-depolarization is found to be 86 &plusmn; 19%, 
and this appears to depend upon extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The activation of 
TH is not directly due to interaction of TH with Ca<sup>2+</sup> or calmodulin, 
since the increase in activity occurs despite the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or 
EGTA, so TH is phosphorylated and activated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx acting 
indirectly. Other agonists acting on prelabeled cells were tested but all seemed 
work through nicotinic cholinergic channels, since <i>d</i>-tubocurarine blocked 
the effect and neither methacholine (a muscarinic agonist) or phenylephrine (an 
&alpha;-adrenergic agonist) was effective. 10 &micro;M A23187 could also mimic 
the effect of either chemical or electrical depolarization. 50 &micro;M 
chloroadenosine (said to act by increasing cAMP levels and thus activate PK-A) 
had less of an effect than did cholinergic agonists.
<p>
Dose response and time course curves were done for analyzing the effect
of carbachol action on PC12 cell TH phosphorylation. Cells were first
stimulated with 100 &micro;M carbachol for 1, 4, 6, 12, and 24 min. Cytosolic
proteins were separated by SDS PAGE and incorporation of label into the 60
kDa band was assessed. Within the 1st min there is a change in
phosphorylation, increasing linearly over the next 5 min. After the 6th
min, a decrease is observed, and by 24 min, TH phosphorylation is returned
to basal levels. Dose response was assessed using a 4 min period for
incubation with carbachol concentrations ranging from 1 to 500 &micro;M.
Half-maximal stimulation occurs at 30 &micro;M while 100 &micro;M produced
maximal phosphorylation. Measurements of activity showed similar
sensitivity to carbachol, but at concentrations &gt;100 &micro;M,
phosphorylation reached 74% of maximal, this decrease probably the result
of desensitization of cholinergic receptor. A similar decrease in
stimulation-induced release of NorEpi is seen when agonist is above a
certain maximal value.
<p>
Dependence of carbachol action, known to act at both muscarinic and
nicotinic receptors, on extracellular calcium was examined. Both carbachol
and acetylcholine (at 100 &micro;M) were added and found to produce the same
stimulation of TH phosphorylation. When EGTA is present,
carbachol/ACh-mediated increase in TH phosphorylation is not only
inhibited, but also <sup>32</sup>P incorporation is reduced below basal
levels. The EGTA effect is apparent within 1 min.
<p>
Nitrendipine inhibition of carbachol-induced phosphorylation was also
assessed. Using 0.1, 1, and 100 nM nitrendipine, a successive reduction in
the stimulation of phosphorylation is shown, demonstrating its
concentration dependence. The concentration of nitrendipine required to
inhibit depolarization-induced <sup>45</sup>Ca uptake by 50% (5.5 nM)
closely approximates the necessary concentration (1 nM) to reduce
phosphorylation by 50%.
<p>
<i>d</i>-Tubocurarine appears to have a slight ability of
its own to induce TH phosphorylation, but subsequent carbachol addition
could not enhance phosphorylation greater than that of
<i>d</i>-tubocurarine alone. While it is a known partial agonist of the
neuromuscular junction, it inhibits carbachol-induced phosphoyrlation by
&gt;60%. 10 &micro;M A23187 has the same effect as carbachol (with
Ca<sup>2+</sup> present). <i>d</i>-Tubocurarine had no ability
to inhibit the action of A23187. This clearly shows that the carbachol
action appears to be through nicotinic receptors. Moreover, kinase
activation merely depends upon increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>
occurring as a result of cell depolarization and channel opening.
<p>
Cells were stimulated with various agents (10 &micro;M A23187 for 12 min,
50 &micro;M 2-chloroadenosine for 11 min, 100 &micro;M carbachol for 5 min, 400
&micro;M methacholine for 5 min) and the cAMP levels measured. Only
2-chloroadenosine was effective in eliciting cAMP while the others
remained at control levels. Hence, TH phosphorylation can occur absent a
result of cAMP level increase.
<p>
Rat brain Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent protein kinase has been shown
to phosphorylate TH in vitro. PC12 cell cultures were grown in the
presence or absence of NGF. Extracts were passed over a CaM-Sepharose
column and detection of activity using a MAP-2 substrate was done. A MAP-2
kinase activity was found to be retained on the column when loaded with
Ca<sup>2+</sup>, eluting when EGTA was washed through. The kinase was
present whether NGF was present or not, although the NGF-treated cells had
80-100% more activity. An absolute requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CaM
was shown; inhibition by fluphenazine was also shown, consistent with the
properties of this kinase. To ensure that this was the Ca/CaM kinase,
phosphorylated MAP-2 was subjected to partial proteolysis using <i>S. aureus</i> V8 protease and analyzed on gels according to
Cleveland et al. The MAP-2 phosphorylated by the purified Ca/CaM kinase
from either rat brain or PC12 cells was shown to produce the same
phosphopeptide pattern.
<p>
A property of the Ca/CaM kinase is its ability to autophosphorylate its
51 and 60 kDa subunits. The kinase purified from PC12 cells also
demonstrated an ability to autophosphorylate polypeptides having
M<sub>r</sub> 47,000 and 60,000. These putative subunits were compared to
authentic rat brain using the partial proteolysis procedure. One thing it
revealed was that there appears to be considerable homology between the
rat brain kinase and the PC12 cell kinase.

catecholaminergic systems in the adrenal glands of mice selectively bred
for differences in sensitivity to ethanol, the long-sleep (LS) and
short-sleep (SS) mice, have been examined. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
activity and catecholamine levels were measured in the adrenal glands at
various times after a single injection of ethanol (4.0 g/kg i.p.). Basal
levels of TH activity, epinephrine and norepinephrine are significantly
higher in the adrenal glands of LS mice by 87, 20, and 26%, respectively.
Ten minutes after ethanol administration, LS mouse adrenal gland TH
activity is decreased by 33% whereas SS mouse adrenal gland TH activity is
increased by 68%. At 25 and 125 min after ethanol, SS mouse adrenal gland
TH activity is no longer increased, but the decrease in TH activity
persists in adrenals of LS mice. The corresponding adrenal gland
catecholamine levels are unchanged in the LS and SS mice at all times
measured except at 125 min in LS mice when both epinephrine (24%) and
norepinephrine (31%) are decreased. The increase in SS adrenal gland TH
activity at 10 min after ethanol administration is associated with an
increase in the affinity of the enzyme for the pterin cofactor (decreased
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>). Conversely, the decrease in TH activity at 10 min after ethanol in LS
mice is associated with an increase in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the pterin cofactor. The
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is unchanged by ethanol treatment in either line. Prior
administration of chlorisondamine (15 mg/kg i.p.) has no effect on either
the ethanol-induced changes in adrenal gland TH activity at 10 min or the
sleep time of LS mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the sympathoadrenal
system under basal and stressful conditions: effect of 6-hydroxydopamine
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Subtotal destruction of
central noradrenergic neurons with the neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine, is
known to increase tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity within surviving
nerve terminals. The present report demonstrates a similar, dose-related
elevation of TH activity in the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves
after systemic 6-hydroxydopamine treatment. Two temporally distinct
processes were observed in the sympathetic nerves: a rapid activation of
TH, present during the first few days after the lesion, and a more gradual
increase in maximal TH activity, most probably due to enzyme induction. In
this regard, the stimulatory effect on catecholamine biosynthesis of
cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation was attenuated substantially within
cardiac sympathetic nerves 3 days after the lesion, but by 3 weeks the
efficacy of cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation was restored completely.
Similarly, the normal activation of cardiac TH activity elicited by
insulin-induced hypoglycemia and cold stress was absent soon after
6-hydroxydopamine treatment, but returned 3 weeks later. These latter
findings suggest that the adaptations within the sympathoadrenal system
after subtotal sympathectomy can preclude further adaptations to stress.

In situ phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in chromaffin cells:
localization to soluble components
<p class="Para1">
Cultured bovine chromaffin cells (prelabeled in
<sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>) and whole bovine medulla were extracted in
various buffers and airfuged (100,000) for 5 min. The supernatant S1 is
saved. The pellet is sonicated in the same buffer and re-centrifuged to
produce S2 and pellet P, which itself is re-sonicated but in 0.2% Triton
X-100. The fractions are analyzed on SDS gels which are stained and
autorad. A prominent phosphoprotein at M<sub>r</sub>=60,000 is seen in the
S1 fraction, which has been shown to be TH by immunoprecipitation.
Previous work (Haycock et <i>al.</i>, 1982) using
phosphopeptide mapping techniques on the excised 60 kDa band shows that
the 60 kDa species is solely TH in fact. Phosphoamino acid analysis shows
that Serine is the only amino acid phosphorylated in the TH.
<p>
When ACh had been used to stimulate chromaffin cells in the previous
work by us, we showed phosphorylation and activation of TH, but the
soluble or particulate fractions were not examined. In unstimulated cells,
the majority of phospholabeled TH could be found as soluble. With ACh
stimulation, most of the phosphorylation is found in the S1 fraction. ACh
was shown to increase phosphate into TH 3-5-fold. Longer exposure to ACh
revealed that the remaining <sup>32</sup>P was associated with S2 and none
in the pellet.
<p>
Chromaffin cell homogenates were subjected to different chemicals known
to alter phosphorylating conditions. SDS gels and autorad analysis of
extracts exposed to 5 &micro;M 8-Br-cAMP and 200 &micro;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>
(1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in the presence of 1
mM EGTA) after they were separated into their respective S1, S2 and P
fractions. The results indicate that both increased phosphorylation in the
total homogenate, and that phosphoTH mostly segregated into S1, with only
a small amount appearing in either S2 or P (long exposures were usually
required to visualize this). When phosphorylating treatments were done
before subcellular fractionation, virtually identical results were
observed in that &lt;20% of the phosphoTH was present in S2 or P.
<p>
TH from whole medulla under various homogenizing conditions has been
reported to be 10-80% soluble. In our methods used, we find 50-60% of TH
activity from fresh adrenal medulla to be associated with the 100,000 g
pellet whether or not isotonic sucrose (0.25 M) or 1 mM EGTA was present
in the medium. 90% of the activity isolated from chromaffin cells was
soluble however, and this did not matter if sucrose or EGTA was or both
were present as well. Sonication alone was not responsible for cell TH
solubility.

Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation in
PC12 pheochromocytoma cells by elevated K<sup>+</sup> and nerve
growth factor: evidence for different mechanisms of action
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells were prelabeled 1-2 hr and then for the next
30 min with nothing (controls), 50 ng/mL NGF (~2 nM), 40-60 mM
K<sup>+</sup>, or permeant cAMP derivatives (1 mM dibu-cAMP or 8-Br-cAMP).
After washing to remove label, cells were dissolved in SDS sample buffer,
boiled, separated on gels and then autorad. NGF and potassium treatment
were seen to elevate phosphorylation of M<sub>r</sub> 60,000 band, which
also occurred with cAMP derivatives.
<p>
Prelabeled cells were treated as before with potassium and NGF, the
cells harvested and boiled, and aliquots of TCA-precipitated protein taken
in which the total radioactivity was equal. The aliquots were
immunoprecipitated with anti-TH serum, and the pellet run on gels and then
autorad. With potassium &gt;10 mM, phosphorylation is increased, and the
increase was concentration dependent, maximal by 40-80 mM. Scanning
densitometry indicates maximal incorporation of 4- to 6-fold that of
controls. NGF stimulated cells shows increases at 3 ng/ml, reaching
maximum 3- to 5-fold increases between 10-30 ng/ml (0.3-1 nM).
<p>
1 h-prelabeled cells were incubated in either 60 mM K<sup>+</sup> or 50
ng/ml NGF and a time course of phosphorylation developed. Gels were run
and autorad, and selected bands at 60 kDa bands cut out, the gel dissolved
and then counted. With K<sup>+</sup> stimulation, a biphasic increase in
phosphorylation is observed: a rapid 5-fold max increase followed by a
second slower increase at 10 min. NGF on the other hand causes very little
phosphorylation after the first several min. After 4 min, phosphorylation
is increase 80%, reaching a maximum 4- to 5-fold increase in 8 min. The
NGF data is in good agreement with the data of Halegoua and Patrick.
Activation of TH was studied via a time course as well using K<sup>+</sup>
stimulation: activation was typically 70% greater than control levels
within 30 sec. of treatment. Previous work with NGF activation indicates
activity increases of 60% in 10 min and is half-maximal in 2-3 min.
<p>
The effects of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in PC12 cells preincubated
with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> and then treated with K<sup>+</sup> or NGF
in the presence of EGTA show that TH phosphorylation was not increased
with K<sup>+</sup> but did increase with NGF, showing the latter's
independence from Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In cells labeled with
<sup>35</sup>S-Met for 3 d and <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> for 1 hr before
treatment (in the continuous presence of labeled phosphate) with
K<sup>+</sup> or NGF for 30 min in the presence of either EGTA or 2.6 mM
Ca<sup>2+</sup>. TH was immunoprecipitated, run on SDS gels, then
the band removed and counted. The <sup>32</sup>P/<sup>35</sup>S ratio of
immunoprecipitated TH was only altered slightly in the absence of
extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> alone. NGF elevated the ratio 2.5-fold and
this was altered only marginally by the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. With
K<sup>+</sup>, the ratio was 3.2-fold, and this was
substantially reduced when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was not present
or removed.
<p>
Trifluoperazine (100 &micro;M) is known to inhibit CaM and/or
Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase and is shown to
reduce phosphate incorporation into control cultures 37%, completely
blocking the K<sup>+</sup> effect, and reducing NGF-induced
phosphorylation 33%. W-5 and W-7 have closely related structures, but only
W-7 is known to interfere with the action of calmodulin: with both
compounds used in only control cells (100 &micro;M), there were only slight
effects on basal levels of incorporation of phosphate and only marginal
effects on NGF-induced phosphorylation. But with K<sup>+</sup> treatment,
W-5 reduced phosphorylation by 15% while W-7 reduced it by ~62%.
<p>
The site of phosphorylation in the K<sup>+</sup>- and NGF-induced TH
was determined by isolating the SDS gel band from immunoprecipitated TH,
digesting with <i>S. aureus</i> V8 protease and then running
on SDS gels for one dimensional peptide mapping (as in the method of
Cleveland et <i>al.</i>, 1977). Several peptides emerged in
the range from 7800 to 12,300. From 30 s and beyond, K<sup>+</sup>
treatment increased <sup>32</sup>P label into 3 distinct bands, and after
30 min, the same three bands are affected but the one with the
intermediate mobility contains relatively more label. With NGF, another
distinctive pattern is seen, with the most if not all of the label
occurring in the intermediate band alone.

Regulation of the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic
monophosphate and the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the rat superior
cervical ganglion by three neuropeptides of the secretin family
<p class="Para1">
Some notes on method. Rat ganglia are incubated in a
medium supplemented with tyrosine and EDTA. They are treated 30 min with
agent and 150 &micro;M brocresine (inhibits DOPA to dopamine conversion). In
some experiments, ganglia are incubated with neuropeptide 60 min then
brocresine added for another 15 min. Also in some experiments, the Earle's
balanced salt solution (with 1.8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 0.8 mM
Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is adjusted to 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 2.5 mM
Mg<sup>2+</sup>. DOPA contents are used as a measure of TH activity.
<p>
RESULTS. Noncholinergic neurotransmitters which may be responsible for
TH activation in ganglia are first identified as putative agents. Dopamine
(1 and 10 &micro;M), norepinephrine (1 and 10 &micro;M), isoproterenol (1 and 10
&micro;M, including 10 &micro;M w/o 10 &micro;M desmethylimipramine), serotonin (10
&micro;M), histamine (10 &micro;M), adenosine (0.5 mM), chloroadenosine (0.1
mM), ATP (0.1 mM), and prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub> (30 nM) were all tried
for 30 min and had no significant effect on TH activation in ganglia under
the conditions used. Previous work indicated that secretin and VIP have an
effect, so other members of the family were tried. 10 &micro;M PHI was found
to double the activity. Other peptides of the secretin family tried were
human pancreatic tumor growth hormone-releasing factor (hpGRF), glucagon,
and gastric inhibitory peptide, and they were without effect. Three other
peptides unrelated to secretin (neuropeptide Y, avian pancreatic peptide,
and [Arg<sup>8</sup>]vasopressin similarly were without effect.
<p>
Dose response curves were done for PHI (and compared to previously
published secretin and VIP response curves) in which DOPA synthesis and
cAMP levels were measured. PHI is at least 3 orders of magnitude less
potent than secretin, 1 order less than VIP. The true EC<sub>50</sub> and
dose producing maximal responses were undetermined since the highest
concentration used was 30 &micro;M. The cAMP levels were found to have all be
increased with secretin, VIP, and PHI; the other members of the family
(hpGRF, glucagon, and gast. inhib. peptide) had no influence on cAMP.
Although the EC<sub>50</sub> dose to produce changes in cAMP and
to enhance DOPA synthesis for secretin is much smaller than VIP (meaning
secretin is more potent), a greater maximal response is ultimately
obtained with VIP for both DOPA synthesis and cAMP increases. Plots of
DOPA synthesis (pmol DOPA/ganglion/15 min) vs intracellular cAMP level
(pmol cAMP/ganglion) in which the results of PHI, secretin, and VIP are
included can be fit to the Hill equation using a nonlinear least-squares
method. A hyperbolic curve is plotted to describe the data, and the Hill
coefficient is calculated to by 1.1. The half-maximal cAMP concentration
is 3.7 pmol cAMP/ganglion. The DOPA synthesis maximal value is 103 pmol
DOPA/ganglion/15 min.
<p>
Other peptides known not to affect TH activation were nonetheless
tested for their ability to alter cAMP concentrations. Angiotensin II,
bradykinin, cholecystokinin octapeptide, motilin, neurotensin, and
substance P were not found (at 10 &micro;M) to be able to alter cAMP.
Theophylline was added to secretin- and VIP-treated ganglia (at 10 &micro;M),
and cAMP levels were higher than treatment without theophylline
preincubation.
<p>
Previous reports showed that 0.5 mM 8-Br-cAMP induced small increases
in activity. A log dose response curve is now done and a maximal 4-fold
increase in DOPA synthesis is shown. Other purine nucleotides
(8-Br-adenosine, 8-Br-AMP, and 8-Br-cGMP) have no effect at 10 &micro;M.
[Mitch's note: the maximal and half-maximal could not be accurately
estimated since at 50 mM 8-Br-cAMP, maximal response was just beginning to
appear. Half-maximal may be about 5-10 mM under these conditions.] A log
dose curve was also done for forskolin, in which minimal changes in DOPA
synthesis occur at 1 &micro;M. The EC<sub>50</sub> is 3 &micro;M
forskolin, and the maximal response is 2.5-fold at 10 &micro;M.
Phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 27-1724 potentiates the effects of
forskolin.
<p>
It was also determined that 8-Br-cAMP exerted its effects directly on
ganglion cells. Prior to use of ganglion, rats had their preganglionic
sympathetic nerve trunk severed to allow for degeneration of preganglionic
end terminal contacts. The 8-Br-cAMP treatments had the same results,
showing that cAMP does not act on preganglionic elements which then affect
the ganglia.
<p>
Since nicotinic action can increase TH activity, the effect of
nicotinic stimulation of ganglia on cAMP level changes was examined. DMPP
at 100 &micro;M (found to produce maximal response in previous report)
increased TH activation 5-fold, but had no effect on cAMP. In another
experiment calcium was reduced (replaced by Mg) and the effect of the
nicotinic agonist on TH activity was reduced 76% while the effect of
secretin and VIP was not altered very significantly.

Long-term regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in
the superior cervical ganglion in organ culture: effects of nerve
stimulation and dexamethasone
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The rat superior cervical
ganglion was stimulated in vitro via its preganglionic trunk and then
maintained in organ culture for 2-3 days. Following nerve stimulation, the
specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) increased with a lag period
of at least 12 h, and this increased enzyme activity was maintained
throughout the culture period. The magnitude of the increase in TH
activity depended on the frequency and duration of preganglionic nerve
stimulation. This transsynaptic increase in enzyme activity could be
completely blocked by the nicotinic antagonist, hexamethonium. The
synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, at concentrations above 1 nM,
increased TH activity in unstimulated ganglia with a lag period of at
least 24 h. The increase in enzyme activity produced by dexamethasone was
not affected by nicotinic antagonists or by prior decentralization of the
superior cervical ganglion, in contrast to the findings of previous
workers. These data indicate that dexamethasone can stimulate ganglionic
TH activity in the absence of cholinergic stimulation. In addition,
experiments combining dexamethasone with nerve stimulation demonstrate
that the steroid can potentiate the effects on TH activity of brief
periods of nerve stimulation.

Characteristics of tyrosine hydroxylase activation by
K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization and/or forskolin in
rat striatal slices
<p class="Para1">
0.3 mm thick slices (about 90 mg) of striata were taken from
250-300 g adult male rats using McIlwain tissue chopper and
suspended in 5 ml Krebs-Henseleit (128 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl,
1.3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>,
15.8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM glucose) which had
been saturated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere and with final pH 7.3.
Treatments were then done (when K<sup>+</sup> was elevated, Na<sup>+</sup>
was reduced).
<p>
K<sup>+</sup> elevated to 60 mM elevated TH activity in slices to
28% above control medium after 5 min, reaching a maximal activation
of 70-90% above after 10-20 min.  A dose response was then measured
using a 15 min optimized incubation time, and it was clear that
nmol <sup>3</sup>H-DOPA/mg protein in 15 min was maximal at 45-60 mM
K<sup>+</sup>.
<p>
A dose response was also tested for veratridine (from 5-50 &micro;M
over 4 points), and 10 &micro;M veratridine elevated TH activity by
42%, a response less than with K<sup>+</sup>.  As the latter opens
sodium channels sensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX), veratridine
treatment in presence of 10 &micro;M TTX resulted in TH activation
of only +12%.  The calcium antagonist gallopamil (D-600, Knoll AG)
abolished veratridine-caused activation to that seen with TTX;
KCl activation was negligible.  When EGTA at 0.5 mM was used
in Ca-free medium, TH activation was effectively abolished with
both KCl and veratridine.
<p>
Slices were incubated over dose-response curve to calmodulin
antagonist W7&mdash;<i>N</i>-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthanlenesulfonamide.
while stimulated with [K<sup>+</sup>] of 60 mM; control values
([K<sup>+</sup>] = 4.8 mM) all fell within the same narrow range
at different concentrations of W7, indicating that W7 did not itself
exert an effect on TH activation.  The curve shows that maximal
inhibition (to control levels) of K<sup>+</sup> stimulation
was achieved with 50 &micro;M W7.  Note that phenothiazines such
as trifluoperazine were not tried
because they block presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors and can themselves
exert a modulatory influence on TH activity, unlike W7.
<p>
Rats were treated with reserpine to reduce stores of dopamine
and to cause dopamine release (this drug has two effects).
Slices were treated with benztropine to block re-uptake of dopamine
and enhance the releasing effect of elevated K<sup>+</sup>.
While it was clear that reserpine had depleted DA levels compared
to controls, and had induced a significant (117%) increase in TH
activity, there was no difference in enzyme activation caused by
depolarization compared to controls.  Benztropine did not change
the level of increase in TH activity after slices were treated with
elevated K<sup>+</sup>.

The table below shows the additive effect on TH activity of agents
known to influence cyclic AMP levels:

<p>
The results show that forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP were not additive
with each other, consistent with the fact that forskolin directly
activates catalytic subunit of adenyl cyclase.  Because forskolin
and dibutyryl cAMP both added to the activation of TH in depolarized
cells, it is clear that K<sup>+</sup> works by a different mechanism
than cAMP.  2-chloroadenosine is an agonist to adenosine receptors which
couple to adenyl cyclase, and in nondepolarized cells induced a 9% increase
in activation, but a 75% increase in depolarized cells.
<p>
TH enzyme was characterized after extraction from striatal slices treated
with nothing or potassium.  There was no change in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for the 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> pterin cofactor but the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
was found to increase.  The double reciprocal plot was biphasic for
both control and depolarized TH, with a high affinity component between
0.125-0.5 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> and a low affinity component at 0.5-1.5 mM
cofactor, but the changes were in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> for both.
The biphasic character disappeared with forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP
treatment; the change was the loss in the low affinity component.
The forskolin treatment did not alter the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> however.
Forskolin and db-cAMP instead increased the apparent affinity of pterin
for the enzyme (decreased <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>).  Forskolin treatment
of depolarized striatal slices produced a TH with a slightly higher
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> than the value obtained by summing the changes
in K<sup>+</sup> or forskolin alone.
<p>
When the substrate tyrosine was varied, there was only a change in
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> found associated with forskolin or db-cAMP
treatment of depolarized cells.  The apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for tyrosine held steady in the range 25-35 &micro;M.
<p>
Optimum pH for the slices was found to be 5.8.  From there, pH increases
result in ever lower activity, with a plateau (lower) of steady activity
between pH 6.5 and 7.2.  This curve pattern was the same for TH from
depolarized slices, but all activities were elevated 55-90% in these
slices, depending upon pH.  TH from slices treated with forskolin
or db-cAMP had their pH optimum shifted to 7.0-7.2;  a plateau of
pH activity was now found at the former optimum, being higher than
the lowest activity measured, and with the lower activity measured
at the pH values above 8.  TH from <i>depolarized</i> slices also
treated with forskolin showed the highest relative activities at
all pH values compared to control and other treatments, and the pH
optimum was still 7.0-7.2, and the range 5.5-7.0 was a discrete shoulder
rather than plateau.
<p>
Heparin activation was also found as previously reported by many researchers.
Significant (+30-40%) activation was seen with 0.1 mM heparin added to
extracts of control and depolarized striatal slices.  A slight
activation (+6%) was seen with forskolin-treated slices.  But virtually
no (-1%) activation was seen with forskolin-treated depolarized slices.
<p>
Histone phosphorylation was measured in striatal slices, with or without
inclusion of exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase (Ca/CaMK) from rat brain or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A)
from bovine heart.  Generally the phosphorylation of histones
from endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent kinase was quite low
compared to Ca/CaMK addition.  The endogenous kinase appears to be
rapidly inactivated.  Ca/CaM-dependent kinase activity remained constant
no matter how the striatal slice was treated.
<p>
TH activation was also measured against exogenous kinase additions.
No activation was seen when a <q>phosphorylating reaction mixture</q>
was added.  Addition of bovine heart PK-A doubled TH activity in
control striatal slices;  activation was increased by 45% in rat
brain Ca/CaMK-treated control slices.   Additional activation in
depolarized slices was found only with PK-A incubation.  Ca-dependent
phosphorylation had an effect only with forskolin-treated slices.
Neither exogenous Ca/CaMK nor PK-A could further activate TH obtained
from forskolin-treated depolarized slices.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>.  A procedure for preparing
Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase from rat brain is
described;  substrate to monitor purification is calf thymus histone.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide increases tyrosine
hydroxylase activity in normal and neoplastic rat chromaffin cell cultures
<p class="Para1">
Preganglionic nerves leading into the adrenal medulla
contain nerve fibers which have been found to be peptidergic. Both rats
and humans have fibers which produce VIP-like peptides (immunochemically
similar). Ip et al have reported increases in TH with VIP treatment of rat
SCG in vivo.
<p>
Chromaffin cells were isolated from 14 wk old male rats by killing
animals with dry ice vapor, removing glands aseptically, dissection of the
medullae, then collagenase followed by collagenase + trypsin digestion.
Cells were pooled from 4 animals and plated to collagen-coated 16 mm
microwells. TH activity was determined in cells cultured 4 days; cell
number estimated from fluorescent cells on 2-3% of the surface area which
had been treated with glyoxylic acid (checks CA storage). PC12 cells were
also plated to collagen at 10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> cells per 16 mm
well. Some cells were treated with 2.5 S mouse salivary NGF for 14 d
before assay.
<p>
TH activity was assessed by following changes in DOPA levels in cells
treated for 30-60 min with 100 &micro;M <span class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine
in 10 &micro;M brocresine (DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor) and with or without
VIP. HPLC was used to measure DOPA. cAMP levels were also measured by
preincubating cells 30 min with adenosine deaminase and then incubating
for 5 min in the deaminase + Ro 20-1724 (0.7 mM, a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor) with VIP present or not; Gilman's method was used to measure
cAMP.
<p>
VIP was shown to induce a 2-3-fold increase in DOPA production in
normal chromaffin cells and in PC12 cells. A log dose course shows 1 &micro;M
VIP produces maximal production in PC12 cells; detectable increases were
seen at 0.1 &micro;M just the same. Only a 1 mM VIP dose was tested in
chromaffin cells, and found to induce a 3-fold increase. PC12 cells whcih
had been conditioned in NGF as indicated above were treated with 10 &micro;M
VIP. It was seen that DOPA production in general is reduced by NGF
treatment of PC12 cells. With VIP treatment, the percentage increase in
DOPA production for control and NGF-treated PC12 cells appears to be the
same however; hence VIP increases TH activity.
<p>
The effect of VIP on cAMP levels was determined in PC12 cells at three
doses. At the maximal dose tested (10 &micro;M), the cAMP appeared to be
reaching but had not reached a maximal level. At that dose, cAMP was about
8-9-fold increased. Even at the lowest dose used (1 &micro;M), increases in
cAMP were very detectable at 3-fold. In a separate experiment we found
that [<sup>3</sup>H]adenosine is converted more rapidly to
[<sup>3</sup>H]cAMP with VIP treatment.

Purification and characterization of rat striatal tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Rat strial TH was purified from 360 rats whose corpus
striatum (including caudate and putamen) was stored frozen until
extraction. A total 32.5 g tissue was used and disruption was by
sonication in a buffer with many protease inhibitors. Ultracentrifugation
produced a pellet which was re-sonicated and the suspension
re-centrifuged. Supernatants were combined and made 0.9 M with respect to
NaCl, centrifuged, and supernatants applied to phenyl-Sepharose. After
purification diaultrafiltration was done to prepare for heparin-Sepharose,
then n-propyl gallamide-Sepharose was done. These latter two columns were
prepared and not commercial. A single peak elutes from the NPG-Sepharose
column. The phenyl-Sepharose purification produces a 4.5 fold purification
with a 40% activity loss. Heparin-Sepharose represents the greatest jump
in fold-purity with a little more than half the activity recovered from
the load. The advantage of using heparin-Sepharose is that TH elutes at a
constant ionic strength and chromatography depends on the salt cation,
meaning binding to heparin is both ionic strength- and cation-dependent
(see Kuczenski 1981). Side fractions of the NPG-Sepharose peak were kept
separate for other experiments. Specific activity of TH was found to be
406 nmol/min/mg. SDS-PAGE was conducted on silver-stained gels and a
single band 61,300 was evident. A non-denaturing gel was similarly run
according to Davis (Ann. NY Acad Sci 121: 404, 1964) without use of a
stack and a densitometric scan of a silver stained gel shows a single
band. Protease inhibitors are essential to the purification since, without
them, low MW bands on SDS-PAGE were evident. Even with inhibitors present,
long-term storage at nonfreezing temperatures results in degradation: TH
stored for a month and a half at 4&deg; in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) with
the inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate present (DIFP) showed the
presence of a 59.8 kDa band below the 61.3 kDa subunit. In a Tris-maleate
buffer (pH 8.0) with DIFP, storage for the same time and temp resulted in
the 59.8 kDa band becoming predominant, and the appearance of a 57 kDa
band was evident (densitometry scans were done to fix the peaks). Activity
in the Tris buffer had declined to 12.5% of original, while in the
phosphate buffer to 58% of original.
<p>
TH was gel filtered on G-50 fine to remove protease inhibitors and
nonvolatile salts in a ammonium bicarb buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol. It
was lypholized then resuspended in 5% acetic acid and relyophilized. It
was then dissolved in 88% formic acid, centrifuged to remove insoluble
material. The absorbance at 276 nm was then measured and extinction
coefficient based on the dry weight of TH used:
&epsilon;<sub>276</sub><sup>1%</sup> = 5.59 cm<sup>-1</sup>.
Amino acid analysis was then done and is similar to that reported by Okuna
&amp; Fujisawa (1982) for adrenal TH. It has a very high Ser content. From
the composition of 17 Tyr and 2 Trp residues, a theoretical extinction
coefficient at 280 nm can be calculated as
&epsilon;<sub>280</sub><sup>1%</sup> = 5.51 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which
agrees quite well with the experimental value especially in view of the
different wavelenghts. A method to estimate the partial specific volume
from the amino acid composition (Cohn &amp; Edsall, Proteins, Amino Acids,
and Peptides, pp. 370-375, Reinhold Pub. Co, 1943) suggests that TH has a
0.725 cm<sup>3</sup>/g value. TH migrates as a single peak on sucrose
density gradients, and the s<sub>20,w</sub> calculated from relative
mobilities of TH and catalase, using a &nu;=0.725 cm<sup>3</sup>/g,
fixes an average value of 9.68 S. Analytical gel filtration was done
plotting K<sub>av</sub> vs. log MW; assuming TH has an
<i>f</i>/<i>f</i><sub>0</sub> identical with calibration proteins,
it would have total MW of 225,000 for the native enzyme. The
Stokes radius can be estimated by plotting the erf<sup>-1</sup> vs.
R<sub>s</sub> for the standard proteins (the R<sub>s</sub>
or Stokes' radii for the standard proteins are calculated from published
data using the formula R<sub>s</sub> = kT/6&pi;&eta;D. The D<sub>20,w</sub> value for TH was calculated from
the experimentally determined Stokes radius. The values for MW and
for <i>f</i>/<i>f</i><sub>0</sub> for TH were calculated
from the calculated D<sub>20,<i>w</i></sub> value obtained by gel
filtration and the <i>s</i><sub>20,<i>w</i></sub> value estimated
from the sucrose density gradient:

<p>
TH was treated with the crosslinking reagent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate 
(BSSS) and four MW species were shown to resolve on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Without 
crosslinking reagent added, a species with M<sub>r</sub> 64,000 was evident. 
Bands at M<sub>r</sub> 121,000 (the most dominant species), 211,000, and 257,000 
were present. Several lanes were run in which the concentration of cross-linker 
was increased, and with increasing crosslinker present, the higher MW species 
increased in amount. TH appears to be an asymmetric molecule with an axial ratio 
<i>a/b</i> &gt; 5. The cross-linking studies indicate a <q>dimer of dimers,</q> 
the same conclusion of Okuno &amp; Fujisawa for rat adrenal enzyme.
<p>
The pH dependence of TH phosphorylation by PK-A catalytic subunit was
assessed in a Tris-maleate buffer (210 mM) in a range pH 6.0-8.0. The
phosphorylation of TH was best between pH 6.3 and 6.5 and half-maximal at
&gt; pH 7.0. A time course to determine changes in TH activity and extent
of phosphorylation was plotted for incubation for an hour. Maximal
incorporation was 0.84 mol P/mol subunit and reached 20 minutes into the
assay, remaining constant for the duration. Activation was observed at
subsaturating cofactor levels (0.1 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>) correlated to
phosphorylation, but the activity began to decline after 20 min (indeed
after the phosphorylation maximum was reached). The activity of control
(untreated) enzyme was not observed to decrease. The phosphorylation of TH
was verified as labeled bands observable on SDS-PAGE.
<p>
A broader pH activity/stability profile was done in the range 4.2-8.0.
First the activity profile was assessed for purified, PK-A-treated
purified, and crude rat TH (the purified enzyme was preincubated 37&deg; for 5
min either w/ or w/o PK-A, ATP, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, but the crude enzyme was
not so preincubated). TH activity conditions are 20 min at 37&deg; in the pH
range 4.4-7.8 with a single buffer (Tris-maleate at 0.15 M) used. Results
show that phosphorylation increases activity in a broad range from pH
5.6-7.8 (cofactor=1 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> which should be saturating). The
unphosphorylated enzyme is not so broadly active, with a narrow optimum at
pH 5.9 (the optimum for phosphorylated enzyme was pH 6.2). The activity
profile of the crude preparation matched that of the purified
unphosphorylated protein. In the stability test, purified TH either
unphosphorylated or PK-A-treated was incubated 20 min at 37&deg; in pH
4.8-7.8, after which the pH was adjusted to 5.9 and TH activity assessed:
the profile of activity of the phosphorylated enzyme showed that it had
<i>decreased</i> in activity relative to unphosphorylated enzyme
over the entire range. TH is unstable at the more acidic pH values
clearly, the activity of phosphorylated TH starting to decline in activity
below pH 7.4 and falling to undetectable activity levels below pH 5.5. The
unphosphorylated TH is maximally stable above pH 6.4 and declines
precipitously below pH 5.9.
<p>
The instability of phosphorylated TH has been reported previously. The
extent of phosphorylation of TH was assessed for its effect the
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of TH activity with respect to cofactor. A 10
min phosphorylation (37&deg;) decreased the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> from 1.05 to 0.078 mM and increased the
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> from 0.525 to 0.869 mM &micro;mol/min/mg protein. A
60 min phosphorylation reduced the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> to the
same degree as for a 10 min incubation, but the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
was found to decrease to 0.389 &micro;mol/min/mg.
This clearly is the result of the enzyme's inactivation.
<p>
The enzyme kinetic parameters were assessed under a variety of
conditions and are shown in the table below. Note that the
K<sub>m</sub> for tyrosine is not affected by phosphorylation or
by addition of other effectors. Averaging the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine
produces a value of around 29 &micro;M. Phosphorylation and the presence of
NaCl and heparin increased the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> to some extent, for
phosphatidylinositol the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> was decreased. The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for the cofactor is seen to decrease in all cases, with heparin producing
the greatest decrease but PI and phosphorylation very close. All
Lineweaver-Burk plots were linear. It is noteworthy that the
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> was measured differently in the control, but the relative
increases and decreases were the pretty much the same as in plots for the
other substrate.

<p>
The stability of TH activated in the presence of
these effectors was then tested. TH is incubated with the reagent at 37&deg;
for various time intervals, removed, then diluted for assay. The plot of
activity vs. time at roughly 5 min intervals over a 60 min period is
taken. These results support the observations elsewhere that TH activated
by phosphorylation is unstable at this temperature. The time course show
that heparin and NaCl were not present at very high concentrations to
cause activation, preincubation of TH with NaCl and to a lesser extent
heparin, produced residual activation. Activation by 0.5 M NaCl was slow
and required 10-20 min lag before max. activation could be seen (this
despite a 25-fold dilution for the assay to eliminate any effect of the
the reagent concentration). The activation by NaCl was unstable and
returned to controls after 40 min. This slow deactivation of TH has been
observed by Katz et al after preincubating bovine striatal enzyme in 1.0 M
NaCl. Phosphatidylinositol also activated TH but in an unstable manner.
<p>
TH was also preincubated at 37&deg; for various time periods, then assayed
in the presence of effectors. The control enzyme remained steady in
activity over the 60 min period and so unphosphorylated TH seems pretty
stable in that temperature for the length of the period. Phosphorylated
enzyme was 3-fold more active at the start, continued to increase to
nearly 5-fold activity reaching a peak at 10 min, then declined in
activity over the 60 min period although it did not decline to control
levels during the 60 min period.. Enzyme was also activated in the
presence of NaCl, heparin, and PI to nearly equal levels with
phosphorylated enzyme at the start. TH in NaCl and PI were unstable and
decline slowly over the 60 min period to control levels or below controls.
The heparin-activated TH remained fairly stable throughout and showed no
decline. TH was also phosphorylated by PK-A with labeled ATP for both a 5
and 25 min duration, and at a pH of 6.0, 7.0, and 7.8, then run on
SDS-PAGE. The protein stain and autoradiograph showed no redistribution of
protein or labeled bands which might have indicated that proteolysis was
responsible for the activity changes seen with TH in the time courses,
especially for the protein kinase. TH placed in the effectors was examined
on SDS-PAGE in the same fashion to discount proteolytic activity, and no
proteolysis was apparent.
<p>
Does TH phosphorylation alter subunit structure? TH was preincubated
for 10 min at 30&deg; in the presence of effectors (heparin, NaCl, or PI) and
then incubated with three different concentations of chemical crosslinker
BSSS (0.05, 0.2, 1.0 mM). TH was also phosphorylated over a 60 min period
at 37&deg;. Only 0.5 M NaCl appeared to reduce the dimer that was formed,
while other effectors did not alter the pattern. TH phosphorylated and
then cross-linked was then separated and the silver stained corresponding
to monomer and dimer were labeled with equal intensity. No perturbations
seem to occur in the tertiary structure detectable by cross-linking as a
result of effector addition or phosphorylation.
<p>
TH was then phosphorylated by PK-A in the presence of enzyme effectors,
with the incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P measured over a time
course with sample taken every minute for 6 minutes (mol P/mol subunit was
likewise plotted). All plots were generally linear of the time course. It
was predicted that heparin (with M<sub>r</sub> ~6000-20,000) and PI would
slow phosphorylation, but heparin and NaCl enhanced phosphorylation while
PI did too but to a lesser extent. TH without effector present was
phosphorylated at the slowest rate, to 0.075 mol P/mol subunit at the end
of 6 min, while heparin-influenced TH was the fastest at a little more
than 0.20 mol P/mol subunit. If allowed to proceed for 30 min, maximum
incorporation was as above and unchanged. Histone IIA phosphorylation was
also measured under identical conditions; this is done to check to see if
PK-A could itself possibly be more activated as a result and therefore
account for greater phosphorylation. In fact, presence of NaCl, heparin,
and PI caused histone IIA to be phosphorylated only to 20% of control.
Hence, the change is occurring in the TH substrate and not in the protein
kinase.
<p>
In his work with rabbit adrenal TH, Lloyd (1979) reported that PI
causes inactivation (<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is decreased and there is no change
in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of the cofactor which is initially lowered). It would
seem that phosphorylation, high NaCl, and PI induce a conformational state
which is unstable, and the fact that PI and NaCl promote a faster
phosphorylation is further support. Heparin also stimulates faster
phosphorylation and itself causes activation, but this activity remains
stable; it may bind two independent sites where the binding to the second
site stabilizes the active conformer. Data also suggests that heparin
binding is distant from the PK-A phosphorylation site since steric
hindrance by heparin would slow phosphorylation rather than increase it if
it were near.

Complete coding sequence of rat tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA
<p class="Para1">
Poly-A mRNA from PC12 cells was used to generate cDNA,
which was size-selected using a 5-20% sucrose gradient. Molecules &gt;600
bp were inserted into the PstI site of pBR322 using GC tailing. E. coli
strain MC1061 was transformed using method of Hanahan (1983). 50,000
clones using tetracycline selection were obtained from 5 &micro;g mRNA.
Stringent probing conditions with the pTH-1 insert, labeled by nick
translation to 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> cpm/&micro;g, were employed.
Pre-hybridization at 65&deg; for 2 h using 3x SSC and 10x Denhardt's plus SDS,
dextran sulfate, sonicated E. coli. and salmon sperm DNA at 50 &micro;g/mL
was performed. Hybridization was done using denatured probe in same
solution at same temperature for 18 h. Washing 5 times for 30 min each was
done in 3x SSC/10 x Denhardt's, then 4 times in 2x SSC, 0.3x SSC, and 0.1x
SSC/0.1% SDS.
<p>
Previous, pTH-1 contained an insert of 742 bp, which could not contain
the complete coding sequence of TH mRNA. When the 50,000 clones were
probed using the pTH-1 insert, 160 positives were found. 15 chosen at
random were analyzed by restriction analysis. A clone called pTH-10 was
further analyzed as its restriction analysis proved it had little overlap
with pTH-1 and the overlap was at the 3' end. Sequencing showed it to be
575 bp long with a 15-residue poly A sequence. The overlap between pTH-1
and pTH-10 was perfect.
<p>
The 145 other clones were hybridized with single-stranded probe
transcribed from M13 phage DNA template containing the PstI/Sma fragment
from pTH-1. From this, only two clones were positive, the longest one a
1786 bp insert, pTH-51. The poly(A) tail was also present as well as the
Sma site in the 5' end of pTH-1.. Estimating a full-length clone to be
nearly 1900 bp and allowing of ~100 3' poly(A) residues, pTH-51 must be
almost full length. An ATG codon is identified 12 residues from the
oligo(dG*dC) tail at the 5' end of the insert. The Kozak consensus
sequence of CAC present at -4, -3, and -2 positions of the translational
start site suggests that ATG is the translational start codon.
<p>
A TH cDNA probe obtained by screening bovine adrenal gland cDNA library
was used to find an 1800 bp clone, which was partially sequenced. 18 bp
downstream from the oligo(dG*dC) tail was an ATG site, and alignment can
be done from this site easily between the rat and bovine source. Combining
the sequence information from pTH-1, pTH-10, and pTH-51, the deduced
protein sequence of the entire molecule is presented. Although only the 5'
end of pTH-51 was sequenced, restriction analysis reveals it overlaps
identically with pTH-1 and pTH-10. Molecular weight of the deduced
sequence is 55,903. Compare this value to the relative mobility
estimations on SDS gels showing apparent molecular weight of 62,000.
<p>
Secondary structure analysis using the algorithm of Chou &amp; Fasman
(<i>Biochemistry</i> <b>13</b>, 22-245, 1974) was
performed. Of the 498 predicted amino acids, 89 residues were assigned to
&alpha;-helical regions, but these are scattered
throughout the molecule. Only 16 residues are assigned to
&beta;-sheet regions. Seven Cys residues are found, but the
molecule's structural nature cannot possibly depend on disulfide bridges.
Four hydrophobic domains (nucleotides 12-45, 161-200, 246-279, 1253-1283)
are apparent, which may play a role in TH activation shown to be induced
by phospholipids. The first hydrophobic domain is similar to a signal
peptide, which could affect TH interaction with secretory vesicles. TH
shows a net positive charge in the first 300 amino acids, and a net
negative charge in the COOH terminal part. An isoelectric point of 6.4
agrees closely with the reported value in beef TH. Serines at positions 40
and 153 fall within consensus phosphorylation sites for PK-A.

Homology between phenylalanine and tyrosine hydroxylases
reveals common structural and functional domains
<p class="Para1">
Sequences of rat TH and human PAH were aligned using
ALIGN (Barker &amp; Dayhoff, 1972) based on the algorithm of Needleman
&amp; Wunsch (1970). Calculations using the mutation data matrix (MDM)
(Schwartz &amp; Dayhoff, 1978; Dayhoff et <i>al.</i>, 1972)
with bias = 6 and penalty = 25 were employed. Statistical analysis
comparing the optimal alignment score with mean and SD of 30 alignment
scores of randomized sequences have identical amino acid composition as
PAH and TH were done.
<p>
48% (219 out of 449) amino acid match was found in aligning the
sequences, excluding gaps. At the amino terminus &lt;20% of the first 150
amino acid match. In the central region and carboxyl terminus, the spacing
of 5 Cys residues is conserved. Rat TH 238-400 and human PAH 192-354
exhibit 75% identity with no gaps, with any substitutions showing
functional conservation. When compared to random sequences, overall
homology is &gt;50 standard deviations from the mean, highly statistically
significant.
<p>
Rat TH contains 50 additional amino acids on its amino terminus, and
nonhomologous Cys residues can be found downstream. An evolutionary
distance of 5 PAMs was calculated for overlapping regions of rat and human
PAH, and if divergence is believed to be 75 million years ago, this
corresponds to a 7 PAMs/100 million years mutation rate. Between rat or
human PAH and rat TH, a 51-55 PAMs is calculated only for those regions
overlapping the rat PAH sequences (208-452 in PAH and 254-498 in TH).
<p>
Dot matrix comparisons of rat TH and human PAH cDNAs demonstrate
significant homology at the nucleic acid level, especially in the central
regions. No homology is found in the 3' untranslated ends.

Elevation of RNA coding for tyrosine hydroxylase in rat
adrenal gland by reserpine treatment and exposure to cold
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: When rats are treated daily
with reserpine or maintained at 4 degrees C, the level of a specific RNA
coding for tyrosine hydroxylase is elevated in the adrenal gland. The
increase in this specific RNA temporally precedes and is quantitatively
equal to the increase in adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme activity
elicited by these treatments. These results suggest that prolonged stress
may lead to changes in the levels of specific RNA species in the adrenal
gland.

Trans-synaptic increase in RNA coding for tyrosine
hydroxylase in a rat sympathetic ganglion
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: To begin examining molecular
mechanisms underlying trans-synaptic regulation, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
and its messenger RNA (mRNA) were examined in the superior cervical
sympathetic ganglion (SCG) of adult rats. Basal levels of TH mRNA were
detectable in control ganglia by RNA dot hybridization, using the 32P nick
translated PstI-KpnI restriction fragment of pTH.4 as a probe. Reserpine
induced a 3-fold rise in TH activity per microgram protein, and a
simultaneous 3-fold increase in ganglion TH mRNA. As expected, ganglion
decentralization (denervation) prevented the trans-synaptic induction of
TH. In addition, decentralization prevented the increase in TH mRNA,
suggesting that the increase in message was dependent on trans-synaptic
stimulation. Northern blot analysis indicated that the cDNA (complementary
DNA) probe hybridized to a single band of approximately 1900 nucleotides,
which was the same size in all ganglia. Our observations indicate that
induction of TH is associated with a trans-synaptic increase in mRNA
coding for the enzyme. Consequently, trans-synaptic increases in impulse
activity may induce TH by increasing neuronal levels of TH mRNA in the
SCG.

Effect of chronic cold exposure on tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA in

<b>Abstract</b>: The effect of chronic stress
on the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) RNA in rat adrenal gland was
investigated by RNA-DNA hybridization using a cloned TH cDNA probe.
Results of dot-blot hybridization experiments and northern analysis

Laminin increases both levels and activity of tyrosine
hydroxylase in calf adrenal chromaffin cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: We have investigated the
effects of substrate-bound laminin on levels of enzymes of the
catecholamine biosynthetic pathway in primary cultures of calf adrenal
chromaffin cells. Laminin increases the levels of the enzymes tyrosine
hydroxylase, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and
phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase. This effect is selective, in that
levels of other enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, aromatic amino acid
decarboxylase, and acetylcholinesterase) are not increased. The effect of
laminin can be blocked by antibodies directed against a fragment of the
heparin-binding domain of the molecule, whereas antibodies directed
against other fragments do not block the increase in tyrosine hydroxylase.
Thus the laminin domain involved in enzyme regulation in chromaffin cells
is apparently the same as that previously implicated in laminin's
interactions with neurons to potentiate survival and stimulate neurite
outgrowth (Edgar, D., R. Timpl, and H. Thoenen, 1984, EMBO (Eur. Mol.
Biol. Organ.) J., 3:1463-1468). The increase in chromaffin cell tyrosine
hydroxylase levels is preceded by an activation of the enzyme in which the
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> (but not the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) is altered. The effects of laminin appear to be
developmentally regulated, since neither activation nor increased levels
of tyrosine hydroxylase occur in adult adrenal chromaffin cells exposed to
laminin.

Nerve growth factor action is mediated by cyclic AMP- and
Ca<sup>2+</sup>/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases
<p class="Para1">
The work of McTigue et <i>al.</i> had earlier shown that PK-C
activation by PMA treatment of PC12 cells increased TH
phosphorylation which was mapped to increases in selected phosphopeptides.
We show that prelabeled cells treated with PMA over a dose course and
examined by SDS PAGE of extracts shows specific TH labeling that is
dose-dependent and saturable (maximal phosphorylation being 1.5- to
3.5-fold). As little as 2 nM PMA causes increased phosphorylation, with
~70 nM being maximal. These concentrations are within the range reported
for activation of PK-C to cause phosphorylation of other proteins in
general. TH phosphorylation is seen within 1 min of treatment and maximal
phosphorylation is maintained for at least 2 h in the presence of PMA. The
4&beta;-phorbol-12-monomyristate and the 4&beta;-phorbol are
both ineffective at activating PK-C (each &gt;200 nM) and did
not cause increased TH phosphorylation here. The
4&beta;-phorbol-12,13-dibenzoate is as effective as
PMA, however, and induced the same degree of TH phosphorylation as PMA.
Labeled cell proteins separated on SDS PAGE, followed by tryptic digestion
of the excised 60,000 Da band (shown to be exclusively TH by 2-D gel
analysis of immunoprecipitates) and then phosphopeptide mapping on TLE/C.
The result shows that T3 (McTigue et <i>al.</i> nomenclature)
was the only peptide increased in phosphorylation, consistent with the
earlier result in McTigue et <i>al.</i> Cells were labeled
while in the presence or absence of 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-3-glycerol (OAG, a
diacylglycerol) or 1,2-dioctanoyl-3-glycerol (OOG), known to activate
PK-C, and both treatments caused increased TH phosphorylation. PMA, OAG,
and OOG treatments resulted in a 2.3-, 2-, and 4.5-fold stimulation of
labeled phosphate incorporation, resp. The greater potency of OOG relative
to OAG is consistent with previous reports. Phosphopeptide mapping of
tryptic TH obtained from OOG-treated cells shows that T3 is the peptide
with increased phosphorylation, a pattern similar to PMA. Use of varying
concentrations of chlorpromazine or trifluoperazine, both known to inhibit
PK-C in vitro and in vivo, in cells being labeled while in the presence of
PMA show that PMA-induced increases in TH phosphorylation were blocked in
a dose-dependent manner.
<p>
Since NGF stimulated increases in TH phosphorylation are found to be in
the T3 peptide, it seems likely that NGF may act through PK-C. Cells were
labeled in the presence of NGF with or without 0.4 mM chlorpromazine
(CPZ). Labeled TH was isolated on gels and trypsin-treated prior to
phosphopeptide analysis: NGF without CPZ mediated a 3- and 15-fold
increase in T1 and T3 peptide phosphorylation, resp. while NGF with CPZ
resulted in an 80% inhibition of T3 phosphorylation stimulated by NGF. In
other experiments &gt;90% inhibition was achieved with 0.5 mM CPZ or 0.1
mM trifluoperazine. There was no reduction in T1 phosphorylation in
stimulated by NGF. These results indicate that NGF-induced phosphorylation
of T3 results from PK-C activation.
<p>
A previous suggestion that NGF caused activation of cAMP-dependent
protein kinase (PK-A) resulting in phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6
and TH peptide T1 was examined by labeling a PC12 cell line deficient in
PK-A in the presence or absence of NGF. Densitometric analysis of SDS gel
autoradiograms of separated proteins shows TH is 2.5-fold increased in
phosphate and the S6 protein increased as well in wild-type PC12 cells. In
the deficient line, NGF mediated a 1.5-fold increase in TH phosphorylation
while no increase is seen with the S6 protein. Treatment of the line with
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP or cholera toxin resulted in no increase in
phosphorylation of any cellular protein. Phospholabeled TH treated with
NGF in the mutant line was trypsin-digested and phosphopeptide mapped: in
both wild-type and mutant line, the T3 phosphate content was increased,
whereas the T1 increased phosphorylation was clearly missing, indicating
T1 is specifically controlled by PK-A while T3 appears to be
phosphorylated by PK-C.

Presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors control tyrosine
hydroxylase activation in depolarized striatal dopaminergic terminals
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The possible control of
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity by dopaminergic receptor-dependent
mechanisms was investigated using rat striatal slices or synaptosomes
incubated in the presence of various 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine
(dopamine or DA) agonists and antagonists. Under "normal" conditions (4.8
mM K+ in the incubating medium), the DA agonists apomorphine,
6,7-dihydroxy-<i>N,N</i>-dimethyl-2-aminotetralin (TL-99),
7-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT),
Trans-(-)-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-octahydro-5-propyl-2H-pyrazolo-3,4-quinoline,
and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-<i>N-n</i>-propylpiperidine decreased TH activity in soluble extracts of
incubated tissues. In the case of the catechol-containing drugs
apomorphine and TL-99, this effect was partly due to a direct inhibition
of the enzyme, but in all other cases it appeared to depend on the
stimulation of presynaptic DA autoreceptors. No effect of DA antagonists
was detected on TH activity under "normal" conditions. In contrast, when
tissues were incubated in a K+ -enriched (60 mM) medium, (-)-sulpiride and
other DA antagonists enhanced TH activation due to depolarization whereas
DA agonists were ineffective. Because (-)-sulpiride also increased the
enzyme activity in striatal slices exposed to drugs inducing release of
DA, such as veratridine and d-amphetamine, it is concluded that the
stimulating effect of the DA antagonist resulted in fact from the blockade
of the negative control of TH normally triggered by endogenous DA acting
on presynaptic autoreceptors. In contrast to TH activation due to K+
-induced depolarization, the activation evoked by tissue incubation with
dibutyryl cyclic AMP was unaffected by the typical agonist 7-OH-DPAT or
the antagonist (-)-sulpiride. This would suggest that TH control via
presynaptic DA autoreceptors normally concerns possible modulations of the
cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of the enzyme.

Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate increase tyrosine hydroxylase
activity in the superior cervical ganglion of rat
<p class="Para1">
Rat SCG were removed and desheathed in our lab as
described previously. They were incubated in the presence of brocresine
and DOPA synthesis was 100 pmol/ganglion/h. PDBu (1 &micro;M) added to the
medium was found to increase the DOPA synthesis rate by 2-fold (with a
range of 53-138%; <i>n</i>=7), occurring without a lag and
continual for 90 min (it had not reached a maximum). 4-&beta;-phorbol
failed to stimulate DOPA synthesis, indicating that
the phorbol moiety by itself is not responsible for the effect. A log dose
course of PDBu treatment (30 min) showed no detectable DOPA production at
10 nM, but both detectable and half-maximal at 100 nM, near maximal at 1
&micro;M.
<p>
To determine if PDBu was directly stimulating DOPA production or doing
it through release of ACh or other preganglionic secretagogue in ganglia,
the ganglion on one side of the rat was decentralized (done by severing
the preganglionic nerve trunk 2-3 mm from the ganglion, then waiting 4
days for degeneration of the nerve before taking it from the rat). Both
the nondecentralized ganglion and the contralateral decentralized ganglion
were then PDBu-treated (1 &micro;M). The difference between control and
decentralized ganglion in untreated and PDBu-treated showed that DOPA
production was reduced about 20% in decentralized ganglion (not
unexpected). PDBu increases DOPA production by the same %age in both types
of ganglia however; hence PDBu does not appear to act through
preganglionic transmitters.
<p>
The effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence was similarly
assessed. DOPA production in SCG in Ca-free medium was not significantly
different from DOPA production in standard (1.8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>)
medium. Whether Ca was present or absent, PDBu nonetheless increased DOPA
synthesis by a similar %age. This is consistent with the previous result
showing preganglionic factors which might be require Ca for release are
nonetheless uninvolved in PDBu action. Note that phorbol ester-activated
PK-C can still be involved since its calcium dependence can be met by
basal cytosolic levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
<p>
Nicotinic and muscarinic agonists and cAMP-inducing agents all raise
the cAMP level of SCG. PDBu was used in combination with other agents (100
&micro;M DMPP, 100 &micro;M muscarine, or 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP) whose concentrations
maximally stimulate DOPA synthesis in SCG. All three agents by themselves
increase DOPA synthesis: DMPP, 4-fold; muscarine, 2.9-fold; 8-Br-cAMP,
2.3-fold. PDBu by itself increased DOPA prodn. about 2.5-fold. With PDBu
added as well, the results were DMPP, 5.7-fold; muscarine, 4.3-fold; and
8-Br-cAMP, 4-fold. In other words, the results were additive, suggesting
activation of DOPA synthesis by a different mechanism.
<p>
PDBu effects were not inhibited by hexamethonium (3 mM) or atropine (6
&micro;M). Nor do these agents antagonists by themselves have an effect of
DOPA syn. However, these agents have been previously shown by others to
totally block nicotinic and muscarinic action, resp. Hence, PDBu does not
work through the nicotinic or muscarinic system.
<p>
Ganglia incubated under control conditions have ~2.5 pmol cAMP per
ganglion. When treated with 1 &micro;M PDBu, there was not a significant
increase in cAMP but DOPA production increased 50%. Alternatively, when
treated with 10 &micro;M forskolin, the cAMP content increased nearly 40-fold
concomitant with a 440% increase in DOPA prodn.
<p>
Ganglia prelabeled with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> were then
incubated 5 min at 37&deg; in 1 &micro;M PDBu, homogenates were
immunoprecipitated, then run on SDS-PAGE. Autorads were prepared and
densitometrically scanned. The quantitative analysis revealed a 2-fold
increase in label. The differences in labeling could have possibly
resulted from an effect of PDBu to alter the specific radioactivity of
[&gamma;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, which we did not measure,
but this is unlikely since other labeled proteins would be uniformly
increased in their labeling as well, and this was not observed.

Nicotinic and muscarinic agonists, phorbol esters, and

<b>Abstract</b>: The phosphorylation of
proteins in the superior cervical ganglion of the rat was investigated.
Ganglia were incubated with 32Pi, and the 32P-labeled proteins in the
ganglion were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and visualized
by autoradiography. Approximately 40 distinct phosphoproteins could be
visualized by these methods. The most heavily labeled ganglionic protein
was an acidic protein with an Mr of approximately 83,000. Tyrosine
hydroxylase was identified as a doublet of two closely-migrating
radioactive spots. Treatment of intact ganglia with depolarizing agents,
nicotinic and muscarinic agonists, phorbol esters, and agents that
increase the content of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate in the
ganglion stimulated the incorporation of 32Pi into distinct but
overlapping groups of phosphoproteins. All of these agents increased the
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. In contrast, only phorbol esters
and muscarinic agonists increased the phosphorylation of the 83,000
ganglionic phosphoprotein. Our data are consistent with the idea that the
various classes of agonists may activate distinct protein kinases in the
ganglion.

Effects of phorbol ester on tyrosine hydroxylase

demonstrated that in vitro phosphorylation by protein kinase C activated
TH: we show in situ activation of <sup>3</sup>H-DOPA producing activity
after a 5 min lag using 300 nM TPA (brocresine was used to inhibit
aromatic acid decarboxylase). Dose dependence using 30 to 1000 nM TPA was

<p>
PDBu, which activates PK-C in vitro, also increased phosphorylation and

TPA-induced phosphorylation of p56: Similarly, removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup>

Enhanced phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase at more

pheochromocytoma PC12 cells in culture
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells were treated 5 min with 56 mM K<sup>+</sup> or
2 mM Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP and then assayed at two different cofactor
concentrations (6-MPH<sub>4</sub> was 0.1 or 1.0 mM). At cofactor=0.1 mM,
the K<sup>+</sup>-treated cells produced ~2.5 fold increase in TH activity
whereas the Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP-treated cells produced a slightly less than
2-fold increase. At saturating cofactor, the fold differences were
essentially the same. The control (untreated) cells TH activity at
saturating cofactor was a little more than twice the activity of controls
assayed in 0.1 mM cofactor.
<p>
Cells preincubated in <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> for an hour
were checked for TH phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation of extracts
using an antiserum followed by SDS-PAGE; the labeled band observed
comigrates with purified pheochromocytoma TH. With 2 mM
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP, a 70-80% increase in phosphate was found significant,
whereas phosphate in the 56 mM K<sup>+</sup>-treated cells was 350%
increased.
<p>
Cells prepared with labeled P<sub>i</sub>, treated with
agents, extracted, immunopptd, then run on SDS-PAGE was then degraded with
trypsin. The digest was analyzed on paper electrophoresis and two labeled
peptides were resolved for all cells: control, K<sup>+</sup>-treated, and
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP. Purified TH and in vitro phosphorylated by PK-A in
contrast produces only one labeled phosphopeptide. The
K<sup>+</sup>-treated tryptic TH increased radioactivity into
both sites, but the Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP-treated cells produce an increase
only in the site that PK-A phosphorylates.
<p>
Previously it was shown that 56 mM K<sup>+</sup>-treated cells showed
maximal phosphorylation after 1 min (detectable after 30 s), but that TH
activation (also detectable after 30 s) was not maximal until 3 min. The
tryptic peptides were assessed for phosphorylation over a similar time
course. The extent of phosphorylation of both peptides induced by 56 mM
K<sup>+</sup> at 1 and 3 min were similar, with no real increase or no
decrease.

M HCl for 3 h at 100&deg;, the acid hydrosylate separated on high voltage

Selective induction of tyrosine hydroxylase by cell-cell
contact in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells is mimicked by plasma membranes
<p class="Para1">
Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were plated at low
density (30,000/cm<sup>2</sup>) or high density (300,000/cm<sup>2</sup>)
into 24-well Costar dishes coated with poly-D,L-ornithine. Plasma
membranes from cells were also isolated directly from fresh medulla
dissected from the gland and homogenized in buffered sucrose. Differential
centrifugation to removed nuclei and debris and to isolate membranes and
finally to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation was performed; the
5'-nucleotidase specific activity served as a marker for determining
membrane purity.
<p>
Cultures at low density were exposed to 16 and 32 &micro;g of chromaffin
cell plasma membranes (PM) per ml for 3 d. After this period cell number
was the same (cells are postmitotic) in treated and controls. Trypan blue
staining and cell morphology examination indicated no cell death. For PM
added once 24 hr after plating, cells harvested after 3 d show a 2.5-fold
increase in TH activity with the 32 &micro;g/ml dose with no increase at the
lower PM dose. If PM was added both 1 and 2 d after culture and cells were
harvested after one day, and 2.5- and 3-fold increase was observed at both
16 and 32 &micro;g/ml, resp. The PM added to cultures with no cells and
harvested as usual had no TH activity nor interfered with the TH assay. A
dose-response curve of TH activity vs. mass of PM added per ml medium
indicates half-maximal activation occurs at 10 &micro;g/ml PM. The maximal
average TH activation induction was 3-fold. The time course of TH
induction using 30 &micro;g/ml PM (found to be maximal) in low density
cultures which were added 1, 2, and 3 d after culture and harvested after
1 day indicates that after 2 d of culture the TH activity is maximal.
<p>
TH induction by cell contact and by NGF is well known but AChE is not
known to be induced by cell contact. AChE is normally present in the PM
preparations but is inactivated by heat treatment (90&deg;; this
heat-inactivated PM preparation still induced TH activity however in the
low density cultures, although there was an average 28% reduction in
induction ability. This induction by PM must have been
transcription-dependent, since alpha-amanitin added to low density
cultures very much eliminated the effect of TH activity increases caused
by added PM.
<p>
PM treated with 1 M NaCl causes removal or loss of 30% of the protein
from the already washed membrane, yet this salt-treated PM was still able
to induce TH activity increases. The supernatant of the 1 M extract had no
effect. 50 mM octylglucoside treatment of membranes did remove the TH
activity-inducing agents since the pellet no longer induced TH; 80% of the
PM protein was in fact removed. Initial attempts to dialyze away the
detergent resulted in loss of the TH-inducing substances most likely
because of precipitation or inactivation upon removal of the detergent. 25
mM octylglucoside removed at least 34% of the protein but did not extract
the inducing agent: 25 mM is the critical micellar concentration of this
detergent, and only if this is exceeded can the material be extracted.
Therefore the inducing agent must be a thoroughly embedded protein.
<p>
Digestion of the PM with proteases shows that trypsin had no effect,
whereas chymotrypsin reduced induction by 73%. Digest supernatants had no
inductive effect.
<p>
The PM from other tissues was tested for its inductive effect as well.
PM from adrenal cortex, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle were prepared
and compared with adrenal medulla PM. The various tissues differed in
their relative inductive effect to the medulla PM: kidney, 80%; liver,
70%; adrenal cortex, 65%. The sk musc and erythrocyte PM were 5 and 15%,
resp., and was not significant. However this was not with equal total
protein loading: the cortex protein added was about equal to the medulla
protein, whereas kidney and liver added was about 2.5 times as much.

Cholinergic receptor-mediated phosphorylation and activation of
tyrosine hydroxylase in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells
<p class="Para1">
1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP) is a selective
nicotinic agonist which stimulates phosphorylation of 56 kDa protein in
chromaffin cells. Mixed nicotinic-muscarinic agonists (ACh and carbachol)
produced comparable phosphorylation of the protein. In some experiments, a
99 kDa protein was also noticeably phosphorylated. This apparent MW of
56,000 has been observed as being purified subunits of TH from medulla and
the TH in chromaffin cells. SDS gels were run on control and treated cell
extracts, with <sup>32</sup>P added in some cases, and then gel proteins
transferred to nitrocellulose. Anti-TH + <sup>125</sup>I-Protein A were
added and the radioactive band corresponded nicely with the
<sup>32</sup>P-labeled band at 56 kDa.
<p>
Proteins from unstimulated extracts of cells prelabeled with
<sup>32</sup>P were analyzed by 2-D gels and contained two phosphorylated
56 kDa proteins with pI values of 6.36 and 6.27. DMPP treatment not only
enhanced phosphorylation of these two species, but also caused the
appearance of a third 56 kDa protein at pI 6.15. Transfer of these
phosphoproteins to NC and probing with anti-TH indicated that, in the
unstimulated cells, three spots appeared at pI 6.5, 6.37, 6.27, while in
the treated cells there were 4 spots with pI 6.5, 6.37, 6.27, and 6.15,
which means that the 56 kDa spots are all TH with the pI 6.5 isoform being
unphosphorylated and the other proteins representing various levels of
phosphorylation.
<p>
Other agonists were investigated. Muscarinics such as muscarine and
methacholine caused only small increases in TH phosphorylation. The
nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine was more potent than the muscarinic
antagonist atropine in inhibiting carbachol-induced TH phosphorylation.
Although small, muscarinic agonists consistently stimulated
phosphorylation, nicotinic agonists primarily activated these processes
through nicotinic receptors. As for CA secretion processes, stimulation of
CA secretion was strictly the result of nicotinic agonists, with no effect
by muscarinic agonists. In this case, the mecamylamine clearly had a
greater capacity to prevent carbachol-induced secretion than did atropine.
<p>
Carbachol-induced TH phosphorylation indicated by SDS gel analysis
shows a time course in which phosphorylation is maximal in 1-2 min, 70%
maximal after 10 s. The phosphorylation was observed to decline but remain
above control levels between 2 and 30 min. DMPP-stimulated phosphorylation
analyzed by 2-D gels shows that the 3 phosphospecies were significantly
phosphorylated as early as 30 s and remained that way for at least 5 min.
The production of [<sup>3</sup>H]DOPA was used as a measure of in situ TH
activity and a reproducible increase in tritiated DOPA induced by DMPP
could be detected by 2-5 min after treatment, decreasing somewhat between
15 and 30 min.
<p>
With removal of calcium (use of 1 mM EGTA) from the medium reduced TH
phosphorylation in absence of agonist and completely inhibited any
carbachol-induced enhancement. These were similar to effects seen with
DMPP treatment as well. The enhancement of tritiated DOPA production was
not seen with DMPP treatment, indicating the role of calcium in this
process. K<sup>+</sup> depolarization was found however to cause
both Ca <sup>2+</sup>-dependent CA secretion (shown in
previous reports) as well as TH phosphorylation in this report. Maximal TH
phosphorylation was achieved in 30 s when the rate of CA secretion was
maximal as well. In cells not preincubated in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium
yet placed in this medium during K<sup>+</sup> depolarization, TH
phosphorylation was 60% inhibited at the 2 min time point and 90%
inhibited at the 5 min time point. The change in [<sup>3</sup>H]DOPA
production is well-correlated with the change in TH phosphorylation. The
use of Ba<sup>2+</sup>, known to stimulate CA secretion, also enhanced TH
phosphorylation, which again was correlated to DOPA synthetic rate
increases. 2-D gels of the K<sup>+</sup>- and Ba<sup>2+</sup>-treated
cells show increased phosphorylation in all three 56 kDa species at pI
6.37, 6.27. and 6.15, a pattern similar to nicotinic receptor stimulation.
<p>
Use of cAMP analogues or forskolin has no effect on the CA secretion
rate from bovine chromaffin cells. This was found despite previous reports
that PK-A activates TH in vitro (Joh et al, 1978; Yamauchi &amp; Fujisawa,
1979) and that cAMP analogues and forskolin activate TH in chromaffin
cells in situ (Meligeni et <i>al.</i>, 1982). Forskolin did
increase TH phosphorylation however, with TH species at pI 6.37 and 6.27
strongly phosphorylated relative to basal and 6.15 weakly. 1 mM
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP also induced TH phosphorylation of the phospho species
but to a smaller degree than 10 &micro;M forskolin. [<sup>3</sup>H]DOPA
production was increased by forskolin and to a smaller degree by
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP.
<p>
Since cAMP level increases could have accounted for carbachol-induced
TH phosphorylation and activation, measurement of cAMP was done to
determine if they were responsible for what was observed. Carbachol
induced a 2-3-fold increase in cAMP between 2 and 5 min, which
subsequently decreased by 15 min. DMPP induced the same effect of
increasing cAMP levels. The carbachol-induced increase in cAMP was
dependent upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Although it is possible that increases in
cAMP could have resulted from agents secreted by chromaffin cells as a
result of nicotinic receptor-mediated events, it is unlikely since the
medium collected from stimulated cells was used to treat cells not
previously stimulated with nicotinic agonists: there was no increase in
cAMP.

Isolation and sequence of a cDNA clone which contains the
complete coding region of rat phenylalanine hydroxylase. Structural
homology with tyrosine hydroxylase, glucocorticoid regulation, and use of
alternate polyadenylation sites
<p class="Para1">
Rat liver cDNA was prepared and inserted into the <i>Eco</i>RI site
of lambda gt11 Amp3, and the phage then plated
on <i>E. coli</i> RY1090. Screening of 40,000 plaques with
affinity purified rabbit antibody to rat PAH found several, of which one
was purified by several subsequent subcloning steps. A cDNA (lambda rPH1)
with a 1.9 kb insert length was used to screen a rat liver cDNA library
constructed into lambda gt10, with several positives produced and one
(lambda rPH2) showing ~1.9 kb length. Both rPH1 and rPH2 were subcloned
into the EcoRI site of pUC9 &rarr; pRPH1 and pRPH2.
Restriction mapping of the clones showed similar patterns and DNA
sequencing was confirmatory of relatedness. pRPH1 was found to span nt
1-1914 while pRPH2 was 134-2020.
<p>
Mature rat PAH characterized by Iwaki et <i>al.</i> has
acetylAlaAla identified at the N terminus. Ala-Ala is found to occur 78
nts downstream with a continuous open reading frame found up to a stop
codon at position 1434. Since a Met initiator comes before the Ala-Ala
sequence in frame with it, the cDNA therefore contains 74 bp of
5'-untranslated sequence, a protein coding region of 1362 bp, and a 562 bp
3'-UT region. Of interest is the fact that the 5' and 3'-UT regions have
stop codons in all possible reading frames and the 3'-UT region has two
10-bp repeats. Two AATAAA polyadenylation signals are also found and
appear to be used in vivo.
<p>
The deduced sequence reveals a protein of 51,632 Da (452 amino acids),
close to the reported apparent MW on gels and almost identical to the
human enzyme shown to have mass of 51,672. The sequence of a partial rat
PAH cDNA obtained by Robson et <i>al.</i> from the C-terminus
of PAH is in complete agreement. Amino acid composition data has been
previously reported and the predicted sequence agrees with these published
values. The similarity in compositional analysis of residues from rat and
human PAH suggests a high degree of sequence homology. The sequences
differ at 36 positions in human and rat PAH, with most changes being
functionally conservative. A Glu-113 in rat to Lys-113 in human (a radical
charge change) might be compensated for by a Asn-115 in rat to Asp-115 in
human change.  Cys-372 in rat becomes
Ile-372 in human, but the overall Cys content is preserved since Ser-28 in
rat becomes Cys in human. Comparisons of the species show that most of the
substitutions occur in the regions corresponding to 1-11, 59-115, 179-219,
and 359-452. Regions 116-178 and 220-358 are completely conserved except
for one minor change. A previous report indicates that rat liver PAH is
phosphorylated and a single site has been identified corresponding to the
sequence Ser-Arg-Lys-Leu-[<sup>32</sup>P]Ser-Asx-Phe-Gly-Glx-Glx, which
puts this sequence as amino acids 11-20.
<p>
Sequence homology comparison of rat TH and PAH cDNA using the SEQMATCH
alignment utility (see Staden, <i>NAR</i> <b>10</b>: 2951, 1982)
for amino acid comparison shows considerable
homology in the C-terminal portion. From residue 140 to 353 there is 73%
identity, which falls off to 37% after position 353 but is still
remarkable. Use of the dot matrix generator DIAGON shows a representation
visually indicating that very little if any homology is found in the
N-terminal region.
<p>
Interestingly, two allelic forms of PAH have been found (W and L) which
differ in the migration on SDS PAGE. Liver RNA was isolated from rats with
known genotypes of LL, WL, and WW to assess if these forms resulted from
mRNAs of different size. Northern analysis shows two mRNA species are
indeed present at 2400 bases and a minor species at 2000 bases, with the
minor species apparently resulting from the alternate polyadenylation
site.
<p>
Tissue analysis of PAH mRNA expression shows that the kidney expresses
about 20% of the amount expressed in liver. Since the activity in the
kidney is 10% of the amount in the liver, the difference is largely due to
lower mRNA concentrations (transcriptional control) rather than protein
lability. Whole brain RNA showed no hybridizing bands.
<p>
The RNA blots show that H<sub>4</sub> hepatoma cells contain a lower
level of PAH mRNA than rat liver. A variant line (PH&deg;1) produces no
detectable PAH and scintillation counts indicate that mRNA is &lt;3% of
that in H<sub>4</sub> cells. If both types are treated with 1 &micro;M
hydrocortisone for 24 h prior to RNA isolation, PAH mRNA is increase
18-fold in H<sub>4</sub> and PH&deg;1 cells. A labeled probe
was constructed composed of a 1.7 kb <i>Eco</i>RI-<i>Bgl</i>II 5'-end
fragment in which sequences are common to both mRNA species, while a 0.3
kb <i>Bgl</i>II-<i>Eco</i>RI fragment present only in the larger mRNA species was also
used as a labeled probe. Total RNA blotting shows that the common probe
detected both species while the 0.3 kb probe hybed to the larger mRNA
species. This indicates that the smaller species results from the
alternative polyadenylation signal.

Localization of the human tyrosine hydroxylase gene to

Human-mouse hybrid cells were fixed and prepared on
slides (RNase and an alcohol series). Labeled human TH was used as an in
situ hybridization probe and the slides were washed. Slides were then
dipped in Ilford L4 emulsion, then exposed for 5-14 days at 4&deg;, developed
in Kodak D19 for 7 min at 20&deg;, stained with Hoechst 33258 (10 &micro;g/ml in

stained with 10% Giemsa for 15 min. Only grains touching the chromosome
were scored. Cluster of grains are noted but scored as a single
hybridization event on the ideograms show grain distribution. This enables
the ready identification of G-banded chromosomes. The analysis reveals
that TH gene is regionally localized to 11p15. Two preparations of slides
were made: one of low and the other of high stringency during washing, but
there was no difference anyway. 100 cells were scored for the labeling of
chromosome 11 only. Of these 71 had grains on one or both copies. Grain
positions on chromosome 11 were mapped in 41 cells and 75% were located in
p15, and 80% of these toward the distal end.

A single RNA species injected in <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte directs
the synthesis of active tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Full length rat TH cDNA had been poly(dG-dC)-tailed and
inserted into the <i>Pst</i>I site of pBR322.  Its complete sequence
contains at least one internal <i>Pst</i>I site by
nucleotide analysis. TH cDNA was subcloned after partial digestion in the
polylinkers of pEMBL 9+ plasmid. Two clones of pEM-TH1 and pEM-TH2 with
both orientations were isolated. Further manipulation involved removing
the poly(G) tail from the 5' end. A unique <i>Alu</i>I site is
found within the 11 non-coding bp of the 5' end, but with other <i>Alu</i>I
sites, the following steps were taken: (1) pEM-TH2 is digested with
<i>Apa</i>I and <i>Hin</i>dII to generate 1607 bp
fragment and has the entire TH coding portion. (2) The 1607 bp fragment is
digested with <i>Hin</i>fI to produce 127 and 1480 bp 5'- and
3'-fragments, resp. (3) The small 127 bp fragment is then digested with
<i>Alu</i>I, which removes the poly(G) tail. (4) pEM-TH1 is digested with
<i>Apa</i>I and <i>Hin</i>dII and mixed with the 1480 and
<i>Alu</i>I-digested smaller fragment in a ligation mixture.
The recombinant pEM-TH19 is produced and its correct construction
is confirmed by
restriction mapping with <i>Pst</i>I, <i>Bam</i>HI, <i>Apa</i>I,
<i>Eco</i>RI, <i>Hin</i>dIII. Removal of
the poly(G) sequence in the 5' region appears to eliminate the lack
of or slowed translocation of ribosomes during translation.
<p>
pEM-TH19 cut with BamHI and HindIII should produce a fragment
containing the coding and 3'-untranslated region of TH mRNA. This is
inserted into a corresponding site of the SP6 vector. Recombinants
inserted into SP6 can be screened if pEM-TH19 with <i>Pvu</i>I,
which is internal to a &beta;-lactamase gene on the
plasmid and by cleaving pSP6 with <i>Hin</i>dII to prevent
recloning of the linker when ligation is carried out in 5 mM ATP.
Selection is based on ampicillin resistance and restriction mapping. The
new plasmid is pSP6-TH.
<p>
pSP6-TH was linearized with HindIII and transcriped with SP6 polymerase
according to a method. Northerns were run on the transcripts and
hybridization with a TH cDNA probe shows a single species. In the
transcription, the first 37 nt come from the vector and the rest from TH
cDNA, 7 nt of 5'-UT region, the coding region and then the poly(A) and
poly(C) tails. 10 &micro;g RNA is yielded from 5 &micro;g pSP6-TH plasmid. In
the presence of <sup>7</sup>meGpppG and GTP (1:1), these RNA species could
be capped with a 50% efficiency.
<p>
A rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system was then used.
Translation occurred with uncapped RNA but was 5-fold better with capped
RNA preparation (5% incorporation of [<sup>35</sup>S]Met into precipitable
material). The translation products were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. A single band at 62 kDa was seen whether
translation was from capped or uncapped RNA (the signal of capped RNA
translation products was 5-fold greater). This comigrates with native TH
immunoprecipitated from PC12 mRNA translation. The in vitro translation
products were not enzymatically active in a TH assay.
<p>
TH RNA was then microinjected into mature Xenopus oocytes: 25 ng capped
or uncapped RNA in 50 nl water, or alternatively with 50 ng PC12 mRNA.
Controls were injected merely with water. Some oocytes had their medium
changed after 24 hr with [<sup>35</sup>S]Met. After incubating 2 d at 19&deg;,
cell extracts were checked for enzyme activity or immunoprecipitated with
anti-TH. Enzyme activity was detectable on in the oocytes injected with
capped TH RNA (99-fold increase). A labeled 62 kDa band after
immunoprecipation is evident in these cell extracts. Cells not injected or
injected with water, PC12 mRNA (may contain TH?), or uncapped in vitro
transcribed TH RNA did not produce enzyme activity or immunoprecipitable
labeled bands.

Identification of four phosphorylation sites in the
N-terminal region of tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="notes c71">TH preparations from rat pheochromocytoma were
reported by Vulliet et <i>al.</i> (1985) to be contaminated
with traces amounts of a protein kinase phosphorylating TH. If
[&gamma;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP is added, followed by
trypsinolysis and HPLC analysis, peak E is identified as the only eluting
peptide. PK-A catalytic subunit incubation produces the E peak as well,
plus additional peaks A1 and A2 where A1 was the major peak. Incubation
with CaM MPK results in the appearance of E, A1, and A2 as minor peaks
compared to two additional peaks, C1 (major) and C2 (equal to A1 in
amplitude).
<p>
Highly purified TH was phosphorylated in vitro by the kinases and the
HPLC phosphopeptides submitted to amino acid analysis and Edman
sequencing. From the data it is apparent that A1 and A2 contain the
Ser<sup>40</sup> site (there is only one Ser in the peptide)
phosphorylated by PK-A and less so by CaM MPK. Peptide C1 and C2 reflect
alternate cleavage sites which result in a Ser<sup>19</sup>-containing
peptide. Peptide E corresponds to Pro<sup>2</sup> to
Lys<sup>12</sup>, which means that Met is removed from the
protein, as has been shown by Flinta et <i>al.</i> (1986) for
19 eukaryotic proteins in which Pro follows Met. Counting of the amino
acids during sequencing cycles was done for all cycles, and this revealed
that Ser<sup>8</sup> was the phosphorylated site.

The effects of reserpine and haloperidol on tyrosine
hydroxylase activity in the brains of aged rats
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Many neurotransmitter systems
appear to be altered with aging. The effects of aging on the regulation of
tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of
catecholamines in the brain has been examined. The endogenous basal
activity of tyrosine hydroxylase was lower in the hypothalamus of 24 month
old Fisher 344 rats than in the hypothalamus of 3 month old or 6 month old
animals. There was no difference in the basal activity of tyrosine
hydroxylase in the locus ceruleus, frontal cortex, hippocampus, substantia
nigra, or the striatum of rats of ages 3 months, 6 months and 24 months.
Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was increased in the striatum of 3 month old
(60%) and 6 month old (28%) rats after treatment with haloperidol or
reserpine, whereas no change in enzyme activity followed administration of
these drugs to 24 month old animals. In conclusion, increases in tyrosine
hydroxylase activity in the brain that normally occur in the striatum of 3
month old rats after haloperidol or reserpine treatment are significantly
decreased in 6 month old rats and not apparent in 24 month old rats.

activation and was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent. Time courses for
activation and phosphorylation of TH using these concentrations of A23187
and Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP indicate that TH was maximal after 10 min for the
ionophore and for Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP. Phosphorylation was maximal after 10
min with A23187 as well, but a rapid 3-4 fold increase was observed after
2 min, not paralleling the activation increase. The assay results were the
same whether 0.1 mM or 1 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> was used.
<p>
Tryptic phosphopeptides were generated from PC12 preincubated with
labeled phosphate and then stimulated with K<sup>+</sup>, A23187, or
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP. In unstimulated control cells, four peaks at 18, 22,
24, and 32 min were obtained from C<sub>18</sub> HPLC column developed in
a 0-20% <i>n</i>-propanol gradient. K<sup>+</sup> treatment
increased phosphate in the 18, 22, and 32 min peptides. This was true for
A23187-treated cells as well. Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP treatment increased
phosphate only in the last eluted (32 min) peptide.
<p>
Purified pheochromocytoma TH was incubated with pure PK-A catalytic
subunit or with rat brain Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent protein
kinase and increased phosphorylation was found in the M<sub>r</sub>=57,000
band. In the presence of CaM but in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the
Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated a minimal
amount of protein, whether or not TH was present, indicating potential
autophosphorylation of the CaM kinase subunits. TH addition showed the
57,000 band. PK-A alone showed minimal phosphorylation as well, but a
M<sub>r</sub> 57,000 band with TH added. Incorporation was 0.5 to 1.1 mol
0.4 to 0.9 mol <sup>32</sup>P/mol TH subunit for PK-A and CaM kinase,
resp. With PK-A catalytic subunit, an activation was observed, but not
with the CaM kinase. Combined incubation produced an activation not
different from that of PK-A alone.
<p>
Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis of the in vitro incubated proteins on
HPLC show that PK-A increased phosphate into the 32 min peptide seen in
the in situ experiments. The CaM kinase increased phosphate into the 18,
22, and 32 min peptides. These patterns are consistent with the in situ
treatments known to activate these protein kinases. To determine if the 32
min peptides generated by PK-A and the CaM kinase were distinguishable,
the HPLC fractions corresponding to this peak were further analyzed on
thin layer cellulose (Polygram cel 300, Nacherey-Nagel Co.) using
ascending chromatography in a sec-butanol:n-propanol:isoamyl
alcohol:pyridine:water (1:1:1:3:3) solvent system, or using
electrophoresis at 2000 V for 1 hr on Pharmacia FBE 2000 flatbed in a
formic acid:acetic acid:water (50:150:800) pH 1.5 buffer system. A single
peptide is found in both.
<p>
Finally PC12 cells were treated with different combinations of
K<sup>+</sup>, A23187, and Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP to assess whether activation
and phosphorylation effects were additive. 10 min with 56 mM K<sup>+</sup>
and either 1 or 2 mM Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP showed a significant additive
effect on activation. The same was true with 10 &micro;M A23187 and either 1
or 2 mM Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP. The combination of A23187 and K<sup>+</sup>
was not additive insofar as activation. The results were correlated to the
phosphorylation of TH as well.

Evidence for a specific effect of BHT 920, an azepine
derivative, on tyrosine hydroxylase in the dopaminergic system of the rat
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The effect of BHT 920, a
putative presynaptic dopamine receptor agonist, on tyrosine hydroxylase
was investigated in rats. The activity of the high affinity (BH4) form of
striatal tyrosine hydroxylase was investigated dose-dependent manner in
rats treated with BHT 920. This effect was pronounced in the dopaminergic
system and was not observed to the same extent in the adrenal medulla. In
vitro, BHT 920 had no effect upon striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity.
BHT 920 also did not affect either striatal adenylate cyclase activity or
the extent of its stimulation by dopamine. The results concerning tyrosine
hydroxylase were complemented by measurements of dopamine and DOPA in the
striatal and the limbic system. The reduction in DOPA accumulation and in
the high affinity form of tyrosine hydroxylase activity elicited by BHT
920 could be blocked by haloperidol, suggesting that BHT 920 may interact
with the D2 dopamine receptor although a functional antagonism could not
be ruled out. The present results suggest that BHT 920 may exert a
specific effect upon tyrosine hydroxylase in dopaminergic nervous tissue
which is not mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors.

Induction of tyrosine hydroxylase by cyclic AMP and
glucocorticoids in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line: effect of the
inducing agents alone or in combination on the enzyme levels and rate of
synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Rat PC18 cells are a subclone of PC12 cells and differ
from the parent in that doubling time is more rapid (25-30 h for PC18
compared to 3-4 d for PC12) and PC18 adhere more tightly to the flask
substratum, are flatter, and bipolar. Another advantage in using these
cells is that cAMP and glucocorticoids produce large increases in TH
activity, while dexamethasone produces only a 2-fold increase in TH in
PC12 cells, with cAMP producing no statistically significant increase in
these cells at all. The basal level of TH activity in PC18 cells was the
highest in medium containing 10% complete horse serum and 5% complete FCS.
Activity fell off with used of dialyzed sera or serum-free media. The
activity varied with the lot of serum used and the cell density as well.
The problem with complete medium was that tests of TH activity using
dexamethasone were not reproducible; use of serum-free media or media
containing dialyzed sera eliminated the variability as a new lower,
steady-state level was achieved, but the serum-free media increased
doubling time markedly, cell morphology changed, and cells detached from
the flask after 3-4 d. Hence media containing dialyzed sera (against 1
mg/ml Norit A) was used in induction experiments.
<p style="margin:1em 0;font:normal 90% 'Bookman Old Style',Bookman,serif;">
For the structures of steroids mentioned here, see the end of the document.
<p>
Note that all the treatment agents were obtained
from Sigma. Cells conditioned for 2 d in dialyzed serum-containing medium
were treated with inducing agents 3-4 d. In the 3 d experiments, the
protocol was 10 &micro;M forskolin, 0.5 &micro;g/ml cholera toxin, or 0.5 mM
isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) in the presence or absence of 1 &micro;M
dexamethasone (Dex). While the first two agents are well known adenylate
cyclase activators, IBMX is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In the absence
of Dex, all these compounds produce 2-4&#8209;fold increases in TH
activity. Dex by itself increases TH activity 5&#8209;fold. With Dex +
either forskolin or cholera toxin, the increase is greater than the sum of
increases observed with any of the agents used alone. IBMX plus Dex
produces slightly less than what might be observed with additive
increases. 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP is observed to induce a 6&#8209;fold increase in
TH activity (experiments were done to show that 1 mM was the maximally
effective dose, with 0.4 mM being the half-maximal dose). A significantly
greater increase in TH activity was not observed when 8-Br-cAMP was added
in combination with forskolin. With the Dex + 8-Br-cAMP, the increase was
additive to the 6-7&#8209;fold increase observed with Dex alone in the 4 d
treatment.
<p>
A TH activity vs. Dex log dose course was done in a 3 d treatment
period, the range being from 0.1 nM to 1 &micro;M. Maximal activity is
reached with 10 nM Dex, with no significantly greater increases observed
above this concentration (half-maximal on this course was 3 nM). If
treated with the Dex dose course with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP present, the maximal
response point of 10 nM is still unvarying. Additive increases in TH
activity are apparent when Dex is increased above 10 nM with 8-Br-cAMP
present. The response of the PC18 cells to Dex is similar to that shown in
a mouse neuroblastoma cell line.
<p>
PC18 cells were incubated 3 d in 1 &micro;M concentrations of other
glucocorticoids and steroids. A control (a 0.2% ethanol vehicle) did not
show any significant increase in TH over a control which had no additions
whatsoever. The glucocorticoids (corticosterone, hydrocortisone,
triamcinolone) all produced 4-5&#8209;fold increases in TH act., while the
nonglucocorticoid steroids (testosterone, progesterone, &beta;-estradiol)
had no effect on TH. Hence only glucocorticoid
steroid hormones have such effects. With 8-Br-cAMP plus the glucocorticoid
hormones, the increase in TH act. was slightly less than the sum of the
increases observed when either agent is incubated alone. Not only was
there no increase in TH act. with 8-Br-cAMP plus the nonglucocorticoid
steroids, but 8-Br-cAMP-mediated TH act. increase was slightly inhibited.
<p>
Immunotitration of cell extracts was done in order to assess whether TH
activity increases result from changes in specific protein synthesis or
activation of extant holoenzyme. Cell extract supernatant are diluted such
that TH activity per unit volume is identical to that measured in
untreated cell supernatants (the lowest level). When increasing amounts of
supernatant are incubated with 10 &micro;l antiserum to TH, and the immune
complexes precipitated with protein A sorbent, the curves representing
loss of enzyme activity are identical. These results show that increases
in TH activity occur because of the synthesis of new protein.
<p>
Cells are preincubated 2 d in dialyzed sera media, then treated with 1
mM 8-Br-cAMP, 1 &micro;M Dex, or both for different time periods (6, 12, 24,
48, 72, and 96 h). The basal TH act. of untreated cells did not change
during the run of the experiment (up to 4 d). Slow increases are seen with
each agent added alone, with a significant increase not apparent until
after the 24 h mark.  The rate of
increase was approximately equal for either agent alone, reaching a
6-7&#8209;fold increase at the 96 h mark (in data not shown, induction
reached a plateau at the 96 h mark). With combined treatment of both
agents, the increase in TH was equal to the sum of increases with either
agent used alone at all time points.
<p>
A monospecific anti-TH rabbit antiserum was available for
immunoprecipitation experiments designed to measure the TH synthetic rate.
Cells are incubated in medium containing dialyzed serum for 2 d; at that
time, medium supplemented with no drug, Dex, forskolin, Dex + forskolin,
cholera toxin, or cholera toxin + Dex are added for 24 h (the cholera
toxin was added only 6 h, followed by 18 h with Dex in the Dex + CT
combination where necessary); medium then replaced with leucine-free
medium containing 25 &micro;Ci/ml [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine for 60 min, with
drugs added where appropriate. Cells are harvested, extracted,
immunoprecipitated with anti-TH, the immunoppts run on gels and the gels
put to autorad. 50 &micro;l of the anti-TH is able to ppt 150 U of TH
activity, so these experiments used only 100 U of TH activity so as to
precipitate all TH completely. The autorad clearly indicates enhanced
synthesis in all drug-treated cells, with additive or geometric increases
apparent in drug combinations.
<p>
TH degradation rate was also assessed. Cells were labeled for 24 h in
[<sup>3</sup>H]leucine, at which time the medium is replaced with fresh
medium containing 1 mM unlabeled leucine. Radiolabeled TH is sampled using
immunoprecipitation at various time points (0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h),
and the total radioactivity counted. Linear regression analysis of the
data from two experiments illustrated shows a half-life of 34 h and 27 h,
corresponding to first order decay constants of 0.020 h<sup>-1</sup> and
0.026 h<sup>-1</sup>. In a third experiment, the half-life was found to be
36 h. All values are probably overestimates, since it cannot be ruled out
that radiolabel is re-utilized for new TH synthesis during the cold chase.
<p>
Synthetic rate analysis was done in the presence or absence of inducing
agents over various periods of time, followed by 1 hr treatment with
[4,5-<sup>3</sup>H]leucine. As TH half-life is an estimated 30 h, pulse
labeling is sufficiently short at 1 h to ignore the effect which
degradative metabolism might have on the measurements. Incorporation into
total soluble protein is also assessed, and the rate of TH synthesis is
expressed as the fraction of radioactivity in TH over the radioactivity in
total soluble protein. Again the radioactivity counts reflect the
qualitative data observed in the autoradiogram. In cells not treated with
inducing drugs, TH synthetic rate remained constant over the time period
of 24 h. 0.2-0.3% of the total soluble protein synthesized was freshly
synthesized TH. With either 8-Br-cAMP or Dex, the rate of synthesis
increased 5-6&#8209;fold greater than the controls after a 12 h drug
treatment. The change in synthetic rate was actually more rapid than the
change in TH activity observed in the earlier data. With Dex and 8-Br-cAMP
in combination, the change in synthetic rate was 9-10&#8209;fold greater
than controls after 12 h. There was a paradoxical decrease in the rate of
synthesis after 2 d treatment using the drugs combined.

Induction of mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase by cyclic AMP
and glucocorticoids in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line: evidence for the
regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis by multiple mechanisms in
cells exposed to elevated levels of both inducing agents
<p class="Para1">
PC18 cells were used in these studies. Total cellular RNA
was isolated from control cells and those cells treated 24 h with either 1
mM 8-Br-cAMP, 1 &micro;M dexamethasone, or both agents together. Isolated RNA
was denatured with HCHO, subjected to electrophoretic separation on 1.2%
HCHO-agarose gels then transferred to nitrocellulose. TH mRNA was probed
on the NC-bound RNA using nick-translated PstI-KpnI fragment obtained from
pTH.4 (see Lewis et al, 1983). Only one major species, 1.8 to 1.9 kb in
length, was found, in agreement with findings by others of RNA from
pheochromocytoma and adrenal medulla work. It was previously shown that
this species codes for TH. The qualitative hybridization (gel
autoradiographs) shows dramatic increases in TH mRNA expression with both
agents alone or in combination. More quantitative estimations using RNA
dot hybridization involved spotting different concentrations of total
cellular RNA (denatured) to NC paper, then hybriding with nick-translated
probe. The NC papers were then autoradiographed and densities plotted as a
function of total RNA spotted. These results confirm the qualitative
results. It should be noted that there was no additive effect: both agents
alone induced the same (insignificantly different) levels well above
control, while together there was no greater synthesis. The general
increases 6-fold for dexamethasone and 8-fold for 8-Br-cAMP.
<p>
Time course studies indicate that 8-Br-cAMP caused increased TH mRNA to
new steady state levels after a 6 hr treatment period, sustained at those
levels over 4 days with continuous presence of the analog. The rise in TH
mRNA was slower for Dex, but eventually reached the same maximal level as
for 8-Br-cAMP. In cells treated with both inducing agents together, the
rise TH mRNA paralleled that of 8-Br-cAMP alone. Note that increases in TH
protein synthesis and enzyme activity caused by 8-Br-cAMP and Dex shown in
the report above were found to be additive, unlike the results with TH
mRNA synthesis shown here.
<p>
To verify the changes in TH mRNA synthesis, TH protein synthesis, and
enzyme activation shown for these agents, each of these was assessed after
a time in which maximal or near-maximal stimulation is achieved. The TH
activity measurements were done at 4 day treatment, the protein and mRNA
synthesis after 24 h treatment. Both the fold increases in TH activity and
protein were well correlated with either agent alone. With both agents in
combination, additive increases in TH protein synthesis and TH activity
were found. However, TH mRNA synthesis was not additive when both agents
were used in combination, as also shown above.
<p>
It is possible that the additive changes in TH mRNA were not detected
since total cellular RNA was measured: this cannot take into account
changes in cytoplasmic RNA (where protein synthesis occurs) which may
result from a greater transfer of nuclearly located TH mRNA to the
cytoplasmic portion. Therefore, three fractions of RNA were obtained
(cytoplasmic, nuclear, and total) and probed with labeled fragment to spot
TH mRNA. Both the cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA species were identical in
size (no larger species in the nucleus at all), with larger unprocessed
species only detectable after long autoradiographic exposure times. In
cells treated with either 8-Br-cAMP, Dex, or both, there were large
increases in both nuclear and cytoplamsic TH RNA. RNA dot hybridization
assays showed that the relative increases in these fractions parallel the
relative increases in the total cellular TH mRNA levels. There was
therefore no additive increase in the cytoplasmic TH mRNA fraction as
might be expected.

Alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine effects in mice selectively bred for differences in 
sensitivity to ethanol
<p class="abstract">
Abstract: The responses of catecholamine systems in long sleep (LS) and short 
sleep (SS) mice to alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) have been examined. Marked 
differences were found between LS and SS mice in the dose necessary for maximal 
brain catecholamine depletion and in the time-course of the catecholamine 
depletion. Brain catecholamines in the LS mice were depleted by lower doses of 
AMPT and the levels remained depressed for longer periods of time in this line 
of mice. These differences may be explained only partially by an increased 
susceptibility of the LS mice to the hypothermia and toxic effects caused by 
AMPT administration, as they persist with non-toxic AMPT dosage regimens and 
under conditions where the degree of hypothermia is comparable in both lines of 
mice. In addition, there were no differences between the Ki values for the 
effect of AMPT on the tyrosine hydroxylase from striata of these mouse lines. 
The primary cause of the heightened response to AMPT in LS mice would appear to 
be pharmacokinetic in nature, as brain and plasma peak levels of AMPT in LS mice 
were greater and the levels remained higher for a longer time. The depletion of 
brain tyrosine by AMPT combined with the lower affinity of the LS striatal 
tyrosine hydroxylase for the substrate tyrosine may also contribute to the 
heightened response in LS mice.

Regulation of guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase and
tetrahydrobiopterin levels and the role of the cofactor in tyrosine
hydroxylation in primary cultures of adrenomedullary chromaffin cells
<p class="Para1">
The total biopterin content (BH<sub>4</sub> and
BH<sub>2</sub>) and intracellular water of chromaffin cells were
determined for the purpose of estimating effective intracellular biopterin
concentration. The water mass is determined incubating cells with
[<sup>3</sup>H]H<sub>2</sub>O and [<sup>14</sup>C]inulin for a brief time,
decanting the buffer from the cells and draining the plates; cells are not
washed; cells lysed with 0.1 M HCl and radioactivity assessed for dual
label in both the medium and the lysates. The intracellular water =
difference between [<sup>3</sup>H]water and [<sup>14</sup>C]inulin in
distribution spaces. Five different chromaffin cell preparations were
evaluated and a range of 2-10 &micro;M total biopterin was estimated. The
average was 4 &micro;M. The average total biopterin was 8.2 &plusmn; 1.1
pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells, and water was 2.0 &plusmn; 0.1 &micro;l/10<sup>6</sup>
cells (hence 4 &micro;M). The total biopterin of whole adrenal medulla is
12.0 nmol/g wet wgt and if water is 70% tissue wgt, then the biopterin
concentration would be 18 &micro;M. Note that the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of
BH<sub>4</sub> for TH is within this range. 80% of total biopterin is
BH<sub>4</sub>.
<p>
TH can be regulated by many factors, including BH<sub>4</sub> other
than as a substrate. Intracellular BH<sub>4</sub> levels can be controlled
since its biosynthetic pathways are understood and inhibitors of certain
metabolic pathways are known. It has been demonstrated that sepiapterin is
converted in vitro to BH<sub>4</sub> in the presence of sepiapterin
reductase and dihydrofolate reductase (it has also been shown in rat brain
in vivo). We measured changes in (1) cellular BH<sub>4</sub>, (2)
intracellular Tyr hydroxylation, and (3) extractable TH activity when
cells are treated with sepiapterin (100 &micro;M) or sepiapterin plus
N-acetylserotonin (200 &micro;M) (all treatments 60 min at 37&deg; in
CO<sub>2</sub> incubator). Results show the Tyr hydroxylation rate was
doubled with sepiapterin, the cellular BH<sub>4</sub> content itself
increased 3.5-fold; there was no detectable increase in TH enzyme
activity. With NAS+sepiapterin, the BH<sub>4</sub> increased only slightly
over controls (27%) but still significant, while Tyr hydroxylation had
increased a significant 45% above untreated controls; no detectable
increases in TH activity were seen.
<p>
These results show first that no modification of the TH holoenzyme is
occurring and that rate changes are due to substrate availability changes.
The figure below shows the many ways that BH<sub>4</sub> can be formed
(see also Nichol et al, <i>PNAS USA</i> <b>80</b>: 1546, 1983; Smith
&amp; Nichol, <i>BBRC</i> <b>120</b>: 761, 1984).
The pathway from sepiapterin can be
blocked by NAS, and these experiments show that sepiapterin produces
BH<sub>4</sub> in chromaffin cells as in other tissues, and that it is
inhibited by NAS. Addition of NAS alone does not modify BH<sub>4</sub>
levels, Tyr hydroxylation, or TH activity, for the time period in which
the experiment was conducted. In another experiment, BH<sub>4</sub> was
added (to 500 &micro;M) to intact cells for assessment of Tyr hydroxylation.
Indeed, hydroxylation was more than doubled above controls. Use of
exogenously applied BH<sub>4</sub> below 100 &micro;M had no effect; above
that there is a concentration-dependent increase in Tyr hydroxylation. If
NAS was added to cells for 72 h, the level of BH<sub>4</sub> had reduced
to almost half of untreated controls.
Tyr hydroxylation had been reduced to 25% of the level of untreated
controls; and NAS-treated cells had a small but significant decrease in TH
activity. If exogenous BH<sub>4</sub> was added to 0.5 mM to these
NAS-treated cells, the level of Tyr hydroxylation had returned to control
levels. Methotrexate (MTX) also inhibits cofactor synthesis as the pterin
is related in structure. 100 &micro;M MTX added to cells for 72 h decreases
BH<sub>4</sub> and Tyr hydroxylation by 50%. None of these treatments with
these inhibitors really changed the level of TH activity nor CA levels in
storage vesicles. All results given above indicate that BH<sub>4</sub> is
present at subsaturating levels and in effect is partly responsible for
rate limitations in TH activity.
<p class="center">
  <img src= "./THLitDrawings/biopterin_synthesis.gif"
   alt="Tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism">

<p>It was previously reported that chromaffin cells
treated with reserpine depletes intracellular CA levels and increases TH
activity. We repeat this result using a 72 h treatment: 200 nM reserpine
lowers BH<sub>4</sub> to 58 &plusmn; 16% of controls, and TH activity is elevated
to 121 &plusmn; 2% of controls. CA levels were lowered 60%. As little as 24 h
treatment period is necessary to see changes in TH activity; the others
observed within 1 h but remain constant after. GTP cyclohydrase (GTP-CH)
activity was also measured and shown to increase (33% increase, sign.)
despite the lowered BH<sub>4</sub> levels. Tyr hydroxylation was also
shown to decrease although TH activity is elevated; hence TH activity in
vivo is not fully expressed as a result of another limiting condition
which may be present, among these the effect of increasing cytosolic
catecholamines (known to inhibit TH) or by decreasing BH<sub>4</sub>
levels. When exogenous BH<sub>4</sub> was brought to 0.1 mM in the medium,
both controls and reserpine-treated cells show increases in Tyr
hydroxylation by 64 and 50%, resp. biopterin progressively accumulateds in
both treated and untreated cell cultures, but &lt;20% is in the form of
BH<sub>4</sub>. Reserpine does not affect the biopterin accumulation in
the medium or the proportion of BH<sub>4</sub> present.
<p>
Tetrabenazine (TBZ) is a reserpine-like substance (but less potent)
which also acts to deplete uptake of CAs into chromaffin vesicles. 100
&micro;M TBZ added to cells for the same time and conditions as reserpine. It
lowered CA levels to the same degree as reserpine, increased GTP-CH
activity but to a greater extent (85%), and TH activity was similarly
reduced to the same extent as for reserpine. Only the BH<sub>4</sub> level
was opposite in value, actually increased 47%. In a separate experiment
TBZ increased BH<sub>4</sub>, TH activity, and Tyr hydroxylation. To
determine if there was a correlation between CA level and GTP-CH activity.
The inhibitor &alpha;-methyl-<i>p</i>-tyrosine was added to 1 mM for 72 h
and was found to decrease CA levels by 21% (stat sig) but GTP-CH activity
was increased 144% (more
than double). Cells treated with 10 &micro;M pargyline and 10 &micro;M
iproniazid, nonspecific MAO inhibitors, enhanced GTP-CH by 74% and 121%,
resp.; the CA level was signficantly elevated by pargyline (49% over
control) but iproniazid had not effect on CA. 150 &micro;M brocresine was
used (a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor) as its effects are known: from
control levels, CA was reduced 15%, GTP-CH increased 48%,
BH<sub>4</sub> increased 59% (more than any other), and TH
activity about the same as for TBZ and reserpine treatment.
<p>
Guidotti &amp; Costa (1977) have reported that reserpine probably acts
through cAMP to induce increases in TH synthesis. Five different
treatments were conducted for 72 hr and changes in some or all of five
parameters measured (GTP-CH and TH activities, CA and BH<sub>4</sub>
levels, and Tyr hydroxylation). 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP had the following effect:
GTP-CH, +65%; BH<sub>4</sub>, +41%; TH, +76%; Tyr OHation, +331%; CA
level, -38%. As early as 24 h the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on TH and GTP-CH
activities were detectable, maximal after 48 h, and still elevated after
96 h. Dose dependence measurements on GTP-CH shows 100 &micro;M 8-Br-cAMP is
half-maximal. Treatment with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP at 1 mM produced the
following (comp. to untreated): GTP-CH +330%; CA level, -33%. 50 &micro;M
forskolin had the following effects: GTP-CH act., +71%; BH<sub>4</sub>,
+23%; TH activity, +53%; and CA level, -49%. 1 &micro;g/ml cholera toxin:
GTP-CH act., +35%; TH act., +39%; and CA level, -30%. 1 mM theophylline:
GTP-CH, +194%; CA level, -34%. All of these agents alter cAMP levels in
various ways, and in all GTP-CH and TH activity is since to increase in
roughly the same way, and CA levels decrease.
<p>
Kinetic constants for the GTP-CH enzyme were determined after the 72 h
8-Br-cAMP treatment and the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> was observed to double
while the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for GTP was
not changed; such increases are the result of either activation or of new
protein synthesis of the enzyme. To assess the latter possibility,
chromaffin cells were incubated in 2 &micro;g/ml cycloheximide or 8-Br-cAMP
and its combination for 72 h. GTP-CH activity and levels of BH<sub>4</sub>
and CA were determined. With cycloheximide alone, GTP-CH activity drops a
signif. -34%, while changes in cofactor and CA were insignificant. The
changes in the three measures by 8-Br-cAMP were reproduced similarly as
above. The cycloheximide+8-Br-cAMP combination effectively stopped the
8-Br-cAMP induction, with BH<sub>4</sub> levels unchanged from controls,
and CA significantly lowered compared to controls (-18%).
<p>
As a final experiment, cAMP levels were measured in cells treated with
various reagents used in this study. 50 &micro;M forskolin and 1 &micro;g/ml
cholera toxin added for 60 min induce the greatest increases in the cells,
at 71- and 81-fold, resp. Note doses of cholera toxin below 1 &micro;g/ml did
not consistently enhance GTP-CH or TH activities. Cells were treated over
a time course with 200 nM reserpine or 100 &micro;M TBZ, and points at 1, 5,
24, and 48 h assessed. These agents did not affect cAMP levels at all,
with levels of cAMP remaining at control levels except at the early time
points at 1 and 5 hr, in which cAMP levels were significantly lowe than
controls.
<p>
DISCUSSION. The level of BH<sub>4</sub> found in this study was below
that for normal TH activity for either activated or basal TH. It is
observed that Tyr hydroxylation is stimulated with BH<sub>4</sub>
addition, showing cofactor is limiting. Reserpine was found to inhibit
increases in Tyr hydroxylation even those TH is increased; this again
indicates a limiting effect of BH<sub>4</sub>. Still other factors may
affect TH activity, as addition of exogenous biopterin sources
(sepiapterin or BH<sub>4</sub>) did not always increases Tyr hydroxylation
to the same degree as levels were elevated. BH<sub>4</sub> levels are
affected by regeneration from BH<sub>2</sub> reductase, de
novo synthesis from GTP, and degradation, uptake, and release. TBZ,
brocresine, 8-Br-cAMP, and forskolin affected BH<sub>4</sub> levels by
increasing GTP-CH activity. The effect of the cAMP analog included de novo
protein synthesis. But GTP-CH activity does not always affect
BH<sub>4</sub> level, since reserpine induces GTP-CH but BH<sub>4</sub>
levels decline.

A rapid and sensitive assay for tyrosine 3-monooxygenase

(Dr. B. Schircks in Jona, Switz.), [3,5-<sup>3</sup>H]-L-tyrosine
(30-50 Ci/mmol) (NEN or

is dried under a stream of N<sub>2</sub> or Ar at time of assay and then
reconstituted in 0.5 mM of unlabeled tyrosine to sp. act. of 0.4
&micro;Ci/nmol. This is discarded at the end of the day. After 4-6 months,
the original stock is discarded or re-purified. For these studies
trypsin-treated crude bovine adrenal medulla TH is used (13.52 nmol/min/mg
protein). The assay is done in 12 x 75 mm tube at a final 100 &micro;l
volume: 5 &micro;mol MES, pH 6.1; 2.5 nmol tyrosine HCl; 180 &micro;g catalase
(Sigma C-100); 0.5 &micro;mol DTT; 50 nmol BH<sub>4</sub>. Blanks are
obtained by omitting BH<sub>4</sub>, which are virtually the same if
tissue is omitted. Reactions are started by adding BH<sub>4</sub> and
incubated for 20 min at 37&deg;. Reactions are terminated by adding 1.0 ml of
a stirred suspension of 7.5% (w/v) charcoal in 1.0 M HCl. Mixtures are
vortexed and centrifuged 300-500 x g for 10 min. Aliquots are transferred
to scintillation vials with 10 ml Aquasol II. In every assay, two
additional tubes receive 100,000 dpm of <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O (in 100
&micro;l) and were treated with charcoal as were the samples. The fraction of
tritiated water recovered is determined for purposes of the assay (~94%).
The calculation of velocity in pmol/min is:

<p>
The optimal amount of charcoal to be used was determined by plotting tritiated 
water recovered vs. the % charcoal suspension. 7.5% was found. The volume of 
charcoal slurry to add was also determined and found to be 1.0 ml. A variety of 
charcoal brands was tested as well: Norit A was unsatisfactory, but RIA grade 
Norit A and the Darco G-60 from Fisher were okay. The assay was compared to the 
Dowex cation exchange method, and a correlation value (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.9929) 
indicates they are comparable.

Purification of adrenal chromaffin cells on Renografin gradients
<p class="Para1">
Bovine adrenal medullary cells were prepared by collagenase digestion
with some modifications of previous procedures (see Wilson and Viveros,
1981; Wilson and Kirshner 1983; Greenberg and Zinder, 1982; Livett, 1984).
Adrenals from the slaughterhouse were trimmed of fat and transported
on ice to the laboratory.  Glands were perfused using a syringe
by injecting into the adrenal vein four times 3-5 ml of a buffer of
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 7.8 mM glucose, 200 U/ml pen G, 40 &micro;g/ml
gentamicin, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, warmed to 37&deg;., over a
period of 15-30 min and maintained warm.  At 15 min intervals, glands
were then injected 4 times with buffer containing 0.15-0.20% collagenase,
30 &micro;g/ml deoxyribonuclease, and 100 &micro;M CaCl<sub>2</sub>.  Cortices
were removed, medullae pooled then minced, and digestion continued
by stirring with 10 ml collagenase per gland for 30 min warmed.
Serial filtering through 250, 125, then 53 &micro;m nylon mesh was done,
and cells washed twice (centrifugation was 100 &times; <i>g</i>
for 5 min).  Adrenal cortex cells were also prepared similarly.
<p>
Cells were then resuspended in 45% Percoll in a buffer of 0.15 M NaCl,
5 mM KCl, 7.8 mM glucose, 1 mg/ml albumin, 0.1 mg/ml phenol red,
and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4).  Centrifugation was for 20 min at
15-20&deg; in Sorvall SS-34 at 48,000 <i>g</i><sub>av</sub>.
Cells at the 1.045 and 1.075 g/ml densities were collected.
Cells were washed twice in the basal buffer (NaCl, KCl, glucose,
antibiotics, HEPES) containing CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgSO<sub>4</sub>
at 1 mM each.
<p>
Alternatively cells were resuspended in 14% (327 mOsm, 1.068 g/ml)
or 15% (345 mOsm, 1.073 g/ml) Renografin, prepared by dilution of
60% stock (Renografin-60) with water.  A 7.5% Renografin solution
is prepared by dilution of the 15% solution using basal buffer,
not water, and is used as an overlay.  Generally, a 20 ml Renografin-cell
suspension is overlaid with a 10-15 ml solution of 7.5% Renografin,
using a peristatlic pump (for each adrenal gland employed).
These are centrifuged at 7700 <i>g</i><sub>av</sub> for 20 min
in an SS-34 rotor at 15-20&deg;.  A diffuse band develops at the
interface and cells are collected from it.  These are then washed
twice in basal buffer with calcium and magnesium.  Similar results
are obtained with 1000 <i>g</i><sub>av</sub> at 20-25&deg;.
<p>
Cell culture is DMEM:F-12 (1:1), buffered with 5 mM HEPES,
containing 28.6 mM sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/ml pen G, 20 &micro;g/ml
gentamicin, 50 U/ml nystatin, 250 &micro;M ascorbic acid, and
5% calf serum;  cell density is 2 million/ml.  Cells are plated
in 24-well plates at 10<sup>6</sup>/well.
<p>
Results show that cells have similar buoyant densities in either
Percoll or Renografin, indicating not differences in osmolarity.
Epinephrine-containing cells have mean buoyant densities of
1.065 g/ml, and norepinephrine-containing cells have buoyant densities
of 1.056 g/ml.  Nonetheless there is a significant overlap in the
densities of the two cell types.  Renografin-purified cells showed
greater catecholamine-to-protein ratios compared to Percoll-enriched
cells.  Discontinuous gradients were tried to improve upon enrichment.
Cells floated out of 14-15% Renografin with a 7.5% overlay gave
good recovery, with 30-40% purification compared to crude cell preps.
Most contaminating cells and debris sediment to the bottom of the
heavy cushion.  The presence of 1 mg/ml albumin has no effect on
the purity or recovery of cells.
<p>
The Renografin discontinuous gradient was compared to Percoll
self-generated gradients.  Renografin cells contained 21% more
catecholamine than Percoll-prepared cells (catecholamine content
in nmol/million cells)  while total catecholamine recovery
was comparable for both (74 vs 73%).  The ratio of epinephrine
to norepinephrine was greater for Percoll vs. Renografin (4.2 vs
3.3, compared to 2.8 for crude cells).  A higher proportion of
Renografin-enriched cells stain positive for neutral red (90% vs.
74% for Percoll vs 58% for crude preps).
<p>
Cells were cultured to assess the effects of purification on
the culture.  Plots of total catecholamine vs. days in culture
show a rapid loss of catecholamine because of plating, no matter
what the enrichment protocol.  Any loss in catecholamines was
a pattern identical in both enrichment systems.  After the first
day, catecholamine levels remained constant out to 10 days in culture.
<p>
The different preparations were also assessed for their ability to
secrete catecholamines by nicotine stimulation.  Cells had been
in culture for two days.  Treatment was for 15 min before samples
were prepared for analysis.  The percentage
of cell content secreted was plotted against the dose in a range
from 1 to 20 &micro;M.  A 10 &micro;M dose produced maximal secretion,
with nearly 50% of the norepinephrine secreted, and 32% of the
epinephrine secreted.  There was no difference at all between
cells purified with Renografin or Percoll.

Influence of cell-cell contact on levels of tyrosine
hydroxylase in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: We have studied the regulation of tyrosine
hydroxylase by cell-cell contact in primary
cultures of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Preparation of dissociated
chromaffin cells from bovine adrenal medullae or the harvesting of
cultured cells resulted in a rapid decrease of the specific mRNA(TH)
(defined as the amount of mRNA(TH) (where TH represents tyrosine
hydroxylase) per microgram of total RNA). The decrease in mRNA(TH) levels
appears to be stimulated by the loss of cell contact, as it occurs much
more rapidly than would be expected from the turnover rate of mRNA(TH) in
cultured cells. Similarly an enhanced rate of tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme
degradation was observed in chromaffin cells when brought into low contact
cultures. In contrast to the decrease in mRNA(TH) levels, however, the
decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme levels was not so rapid and could
be prevented in high contact cultures. The mRNA(TH) increased 4-fold in
high contact cultures relative to dissociated cells within 1 day after
plating. Similarly the rate of synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme
molecules was maximal after 1 day, although the increase in the absolute
amount of tyrosine hydroxylase occurred only slowly. The increase in
specific mRNA(TH) by cell contact was inhibited by alpha-amanitin,
indicating that cell contact evokes an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase
levels by increasing the transcription of mRNA(TH), in addition to
inhibiting the degradation of tyrosine hydroxylase molecules.
<p>
Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were cultured at 10,000 or 300,000
cells/cm<sup>2</sup> (low vs. high density).  At the low density,
cell-to-cell contact was thought to be removed, and measurement of
TH activity 6 h after extraction from tissue showed it was 33% of
the activity of freshly prepared cells.  TH activity did recover
somewhat, remaining at 24 h as it was at 6 h, but climbing to 53% of
the original by 72 h.  This could be attributable to a 15% fraction
of cells that make contact with each other despite all efforts to
maintain single cells.  At 30,000/cm<sup>2</sup> one-third of cells
make contact and TH activity is twice that of activity of cells
at 10,000/cm<sup>2</sup>.  At the high density, TH activity does
not change significantly after 24 h but reaches a maximum at 72 h,
which is 200% of that in freshly prepared cells and 3.7-fold higher
than the low density.
<p>
The fall in activity as a result of lower density might be due
to reversible inactivation of catalysis, or to irreversible proteolytic
degradation.  Cells were cultured at high density for 2 d, with
[<sup>35</sup>S]methionine added for the last 19 h.  Cells were
then replated at high or low density, then taken after 15 min or 3 h.
Labeled TH was immunoprecipitated, run on SDS-PAGE, then fluorographed
to reveal a 60 kDa band.  Quantitation reveals that TH in cells at
low density have only 29% of specific TH (19% of total immunoprecipitatd)
of freshly obtained cells after 3 h.  For high density cells
the specific TH activity fell only to 72% and the amount of immunopptd
TH to 69% of freshly harvested cells.  Results show that loss of TH
activity is due to degradation.  Harvest of the high density cells
and re-plating at low density gave specific TH activity that was 20%
of harvested cells, as compared to 33% in low density from fresh cells.
<p>
A ds cDNA library of bovine adrenal medulla poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA was
constructed according to the Gubler and Hoffman method and size-selected
on 5-20% sucrose gradients.  Molecules of &gt;1 kb size were inserted
into the <i>Pst</i>I site of pBR322 by oligo(dG-dC) tailing.  Recombinants
were then transformed into <i>E. coli</i> strain MC1061 using the
Hanahan procedure.  About 50,000 clones were obtained and screened
by rat TH cDNA probe pTH-51 described by Lamouroux et al.  11 clones
were positive, with one clone (B1) identfied as bovine TH cDNA by
partial sequence analysis (according to Grima et al).  The B1 cDNA
consisted of about 1700 bp starting at 5'-end therefore covered the
translated region.
<p>
The B1 cDNA was then used in Northern analysis of poly(A)<sup>+</sup>
RNA obtained from oligo(dT) chromatography of total RNA.  The blot
showed detection of 1.9 and 2.5 kb bands using nick-translated cDNA probes.
These were detectable only in adrenal medullary tissue and freshly
harvested chromaffin cells.  Bands were detectable not only in
poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA, but also total RNA.  With more stringent
hybridization conditions (hyb temp 65&deg;, washing temp 70&deg; in
0.1 &times; SSC), the band was still detectable.  The 2.5 kb band
eventually disappeared from the cultured chromaffin cells.  There was
no re-appearance (detection) of this band in serum-free medium or standard
culture conditions, nor by addition of 1 &micro;g/ml NGF, 1 &micro;M dexamethasone,
or 10% fetal calf serum.
<p>
A 2.2 kb band is observed in the low and high density cultures at a lower
level than the 2.5 and 1.9 kb bands.  This band and the 1.9 kb band
persist in the cultured cells.
<p>
Quantitation of bands from total and messenger RNA gels was done by
densitometry of the negative image of ethidium bromide-stained gels.
The validity of this method was shown by a linear response for
60 to 2000 ng 28 S rRNA.  The ratio of 28 S and 18 S rRNA is constant,
and 95% of the total RNA is ribosomal RNA.  For that reason 28 S rRNA
was taken as a measure of total RNA.  Total RNA per million cells was
the same for high and low density cultures.  Additionally, the
response of detecting TH mRNA was linear to the amount of total RNA
applied.
<p>
3-day cultures of high and low density cells were analyzed for message
expression.  TH mRNA was surprisingly low in freshly harvested cells,
at a level that persists in both low and high density cells after 3 h
plating.  This level continued at 11 h but increased to a maximal level
by 19 h, which for high density cultures was 3-fold in one experiment,
but with a mean of 4.3-fold over four experiments.  The increase of TH
mRNA in low density cultures was slight.  The quantitative difference
between TH mRNA and TH activity was 2.5- and 2.4-fold between the high
and low density cultures at 3 d.
<p>
TH mRNA increase was half-maximal by 16 h and TH activity half-maximal
by 48 h, a lag of 32 h.  There is a question whether this is a slow
accumulation of TH holoenzyme, or perhaps a delay in translation.
To answer this, chromaffin cells cultured at high density were loaded
with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine 4 h before harvest.  The TH is immunoprecipitated
and run on SDS-PAGE.  Cells that were labeled 25-29 h after initial
plating showed 3.7-fold more newly synthesized than cells labeled
between 4-8 h after plating.  The newly synthesized mRNA remains elevated
at 72 h.  This agrees with the earlier results showing a 3-fold increase
in mRNA by 19 h after plating.
<p>
At different time points, 10 &micro;g/ml &alpha;-amanitin was added
to cultures, and cells were harvested at 24 h after initial
plating.  Results showed mRNA levels of 26, 29, and 89% of
24 h control at times 3, 5, and 19 h.  Cycloheximide had no effect
on this synthesis.  TH mRNA in &alpha;-amanitin cultures 24 h after
plating is 25.7% of control and similar to the amount in freshly
prepared cells (14.6%) and 3 h high density cultures (21%).  The turnover
is much more than 1 day for this mRNA.  Treatment of high density
cultures with &alpha;-amanitin at 3-9 h after plating effectively
inhibited any increase in TH activity (as measured at 72 h).  Addition
of the RNA polymerase II inhibitor after 9 h of plating was less
effective, since transcription is full-scale by then.
<p>
High density cultures at 2 days were trypsinized and then re-plated
at high and low densities in a 30 min procedure.  (This process takes
4 h when chromaffin cells are harvested from adrenal gland, from killing
of the animal to plating, and including a 90 min collagenase treatment.)
After the replating, cells were analyzed at 2 and 4 h for TH activity
and mRNA levels.  Specific TH activity in low density was 25% of the
activity of high density cells after the 2 h replating.  However
specific TH mRNA was the same in freshly prepared cells and in the
2 and 4 h replated cells.  This increased by 3-fold after 48 h.
Although the amount of total RNA was not different between high and low
density cells after dissocation and replating, it is clear that
dissocation of cells results in a rapid degradation of TH mRNA.

Stimulation by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide of
catecholamine synthesis in isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells
<p class="Para1">
Cells are isolated by sequential digestion of adrenal
medullary slices. The freshly isolated cells are then treated.
<sup>14</sup>C-catecholamine synthesis was assessed over a dose course of
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in which cells had been
preincubated with <sup>14</sup>C-tyrosine for 15 min. Four points
(0, 0.3, 1.5 and 7.5 &micro;M) were tested. At 1.5 &micro;M considerable
increases in synthesis have take place (25% increase). This stimulation
was sustained for at least 45 min. While it may stimulate synthesis, it
does not stimulate CA release. Other bioactive peptides such as secretin
and substance P at 10 &micro;M did not affect CA synthesis. With
<sup>14</sup>C-DOPA as a substrate instead of <sup>14</sup>C-tyrosine, CA
synthesis was not increased: therefore the VIP must have stimulated
tyrosine hydroxylation.
<p>
Since stimulation of CA synthesis by nicotinic agonists and
depolarizing agents is known to depend upon extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>,
the dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediated by VIP was tested. The results
show that whereas carbamylcholine did depend upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the
action of VIP did not. The effect of carbamylcholine was however over
3-fold greater than that of VIP.
<p>
The effect on cAMP level was assessed (by separating on ion-exchange
column then using a protein binding method) to see if VIP mediated its
effect through this pathway. VIP did not increase cAMP. Forskolin (10
&micro;M) did raise levels 10-fold. With a combination of forskolin and VIP,
the effect was the same as with forskolin alone.
<p>
It is known that 4&alpha;-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate
(PDD) does not stimulate protein kinase C in cells where it is active. 0.1
to 10 &micro;M PDD had no effect with these cells as well (data not shown).
Treatment of the cells with VIP and carbamylcholine was found to be
additive, indicating independent pathways at the very least. TPA, which
alone stimulated CA synthesis as much as carbamylcholine alone, was found
not to be additive with VIP treatment. H-7, an inhibitor of PK-C, was
found to prevent the increase caused by TPA and VIP, whether singly or in
combination. It seems therefore that VIP and TPA act through a common
mechanism, strongly indicating that VIP acts through PK-C. The hydrolysis
of phosphoinositides often accompanies PK-C activation and is being
investigated.

Phosphorylation of purified rat striatal tyrosine
hydroxylase by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II: effect of an activator protein
<p class="Para1">
Rat striatal TH was purified according to the Richtand et
al procedure (&gt;90% on gels). Rat brain activator was purified according
to Yamauchi et al (1981). The Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM kinase II was purified
from rat brain and rabbit liver. CaM came from bovine brain, and PK-A was
prepared from bovine heart.
<p>
TH incubated with either the liver or brain CaM kinase II with MgATP
(labeled) incorporated 0.5-0.8 mol P/mol 62 kDa subunit. This could be
inhibited if EGTA were present. PK-A produced the same extent of
phosphorylation. With both enzymes, phosphorylation was additive, showing
different sites being involved for at least one of the enzymes. The
autorads of SDS-PAGE resolved in vitro phosphorylations show that TH
subunit was the major phosphate acceptor, although the protein kinases
also showed some autophosphorylation as well. All phosphorylated sites
were Ser.

on gels as a 59 kDa polpeptide). Limited trypsin treatment produces a 59
kDa, then a 57 kDa band. When TH which has been label-phosphorylated with
both PK-A and CaM kinase II is limit-digested with trypsin, all three
species are labeled on the PK-A phosphorylated enzyme (62, 59, and 57
kDa), while proteolysis of the 62 kDa causes loss of the phosphate in the
59 kDa species. The 57 kDa species could not be immunoprecipitated by the
antibody according to Coomassie stains.
<p>
C<sub>18</sub>-reversed phase HPLC separation of thoroughly trypsin
digested (1 mg/ml) TH which had been phospholabeled with CaM kinase II or
PK-A was done, and the major peptides eluted at different times. The major
peptide of PK-A phosphorylated peptide eluted at 28 min (14%
acetonitrile). The CaM kinase II major tryptic peptide eluted at 16 min
(8% acetonitrile) while a minor peptide eluted at the same position (28
min) as the PK-A major peptide. A minor peptide at 9 min was also apparent
in both preparations.
<p>
Our previous report (Richtand et al) has shown that purified rat
striatal TH phosphorylated by PK-A results in a 7-fold decrease in
the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for cofactor, and a 1.7-fold
increase in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>. Essentially identical
results are obtained in this study as well. TH is also phosphorylated to
0.5 mol/mol using CaM kinase II, but there is no effect on either the
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> or the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> parameters of both cofactor and
substrate. Double reciprocal plots are essentially concave downward at
very low cofactor (&lt;0.1 mM) concentrations of TH phosphorylated by CaM
kinase II.
<p>
Previously Yamauchi et al have described a 70 kDa homodimer which is
necessary for 2-fold activation of TH in the presence of MgATP,
Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM, and Ca/CaM kinase II. TH which had been
phosphorylated by CaM kinase II had purified activator protein added after
10 min, and a 2.5 fold stimulation was seen. This was not due to presence
of TH in the activator, nor to any increased phosphorylation of TH. The
activator protein may actually be more effective since some preparations
contained phosphatases. Also the activator protein was specific for TH
previously phosphorylated by the CaM kinase II. TH which had been
incubated in Ca, MgATP, and CaM and later treated with activator gave no
activation response. TH incubated with these and PK-A alone showed an
activation; addition of the activator added nothing to the activation
already observed. However, addition activator to CaM kinase
II-phosphorylated protein gave a 1.5-fold activation (less than the PK-A
activation). Increasing amounts of activator protein added to CaM kinase
II-treated TH yielded a hyperbolic saturation curve. Activator heated to
70&deg;C for 15 min destroyed the ability of the protein to activate TH.
<p>
The kinetic parameters of activation by the activator did not involve a
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> change for cofactor (6-MPH<sub>4</sub>).  There was
a 1.7-fold increase in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>,
however. The activator changed no parameters for nonphosphorylated TH as
well. Co-incubation of PK-A and CaM kinase II eliminated any effect
created by the activator.

Brain 14-3-3 protein is an activator protein that
activates tryptophan 5-monooxygenase and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase in the
presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>,calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
II
<p class="Para1">
The 14-3-3 protein is a soluble, acidic protein whose
name comes from a designation system by Moore and Perez (<i>Physiological
and Biochemical Aspects of Nervous Integration</i>, F. D. Carlson, ed.,
pp 343-359, 1967). It is abundant in brain tissue (1% of
soluble brain protein) but also found in testis and intestine in lower
amounts. It is localized in neurons in the brain. Other biochemcal
characterizations show a 50 kDa protein of two dissimilar 25 kDa subunits,
or a 67 kDa protein of a 29 and 32 kDa subunits.
<p>
The bovine brain 14-3-3 protein is characterized and compared to
protein from other sources. It shows remarkable similarity: pI in the
acidic range (4.7-5.3), 55 kDa molecular mass, two distinct subunits
revealed by SDS-PAGE. The amino acid composition analysis is nearly
identical with human 14-3-3 protein and the rat TH activator (amino acid
analysis done by Yamauchi et al, <i>JBC</i> <b>256</b>, 5405, 1981) as
shown on the mol% basis. There is also a blocked N-terminus.
<p>
The possibility that the 14-3-3 protein and the rat activator were
identical came from the amino acid analysis data showing a high
correlation coefficient. Also the rat activator was reported to be acidic
and dimeric. There is also an apparent difference in the total amount of
the subunits: two distinct polypeptides run on SDS gels in which the
faster band accounts for 90% of the protein in the stain for both the
bovine and rat brain proteins. The human protein also has one subunit
outnumbering the other by 9:1. Antiserum testing using an mouse
anti-bovine brain 14-3-3 reacts with both the bovine 14-3-3 and the rat
activator.
<p>
The bovine brain 14-3-3 was then incubated with Trp 5-hydroxylase and
CaM kinase II, with addition of 14-3-3 over a dose course. Activation (up
to a 2-fold maximum) is found to be dose-dependent and saturable. Both the
rat activator and 14-3-3 were tested and showed almost identical curves.
Both were maximal at between 15-20 &micro;g/ml. The cocentration for
half-maximal activation by the activator was 1 &micro;g/ml, for 14-3-3
protein 2.5 &micro;g/ml. A role for 14-3-3 protein in the regulation of
serotonin and catecholamine regulation (because it activates Trp and Tyr
hydroxylases) is discusssed.

Activation of tyrosine hydroxylase in PC12 cells by the
cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP second messenger systems
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells were treated with sodium nitroprusside over a
dose course. B&ouml;hme et <i>al.</i> (1978) have shown that this
agent activates guanylate cyclase and enhances cGMP biosynthesis. After 20
min, Na nitroprusside enhanced the activity of TH measured in vitro. A
maximal response was seen with 100 to 1000 &micro;M, although 1 &micro;M
significantly activated TH as well. To characterize the cyclic nucleotide
forming ability more in this cell type, [<sup>14</sup>C]guanine and
[<sup>14</sup>C]adenine were used to label the nucleotide pools.
Subsequent treatment with nitroprusside increased cGMP formation 4-fold
without affecting cAMP. Forskolin produced a relative 5-fold increase in
cAMP without affecting cGMP formation. Methacholine (an acetylcholine
congener with muscarinic properties) failed to affect either cAMP or cGMP
relative formation. cGMP content was measured by RIA and increased nearly
3-fold.
<p>
Although it has been demonstrated that cAMP and cGMP will activate each
other's particular protein kinases, they demonstrate preferential
affinities for their specific protein kinases. Heat-stable inhibitor for
PK-A was employed to assist in identification of the particular kinases
involved and to check for changes in TH activation. It has been shown
previously that this inhibitor has little effect on PK-G (Traugh et al.,
<i>Methods Enzymol.</i> <b>38</b>: 290, 1974).
Various conditions (PC12 extract, extract + ATP, extract + ATP + cGMP,
ext. + ATP + cGMP + heat-stable inhibitor, &amp;c) were tested for changes
in TH activation. Where ATP was absent, TH activity was not significantly
changed from the extract. The same was true for only when the cyclic NMPs
and inhibitor were present and when only ATP was present (although there
was a noticeable elevation). Only three conditions (ext. + ATP + cGMP;
ext. + ATP + cGMP + inhib; and ext. + ATP + cAMP) produced significant
activation. Activation with cGMP or with cGMP + inhibitor was approx. 50%
increased, with cAMP almost doubled. Also shown was that cAMP in the
presence of inhibitor was about the same as controls.
<p>
The effect cyclic nucleotides on catecholamine biosynthesis and TH
activity in intact PC12 cells was also examined using various agents,
including 8-bromocGMP (8-Br-cGMP), 8-bromocAMP (8-Br-cAMP), and dibutyryl
cAMP (Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP) and dibutyryl cGMP (Bt<sub>2</sub>cGMP) for a 20
min treatment period. TH activity was determined on PC12 extracts, while
catecholamine biosynthesis was assessed in
<sup>14</sup>C-tyrosine prelabeled cells harvested and measuring
dopamine/norepinephrine levels via paper chromatography. Results show no
significant enhancement of either TH activity or CA biosynthesis when
Bt<sub>2</sub>cGMP, cGMP, or cAMP (all 1 mM) were used. The latter two are
not surprising in that they are relatively impermeable to cell membranes
or rapidly degraded by phosphodiesterases. Also another report indicates
that Bt<sub>2</sub>cGMP is not a good activator of PK-G (Lincoln
&amp; Corbin, <i>Adv. Cyc. Nuc. Res.</i> <b>15</b>:
132, 1983). Both significant increases in TH activity and CA biosynthesis
were observed with both 8-Br analogs of the cNMPs, with
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP, with forskolin, with Na nitroprusside, and with
NaNO<sub>2</sub> (forskolin was 10 &micro;M, Na nitroprusside 100
&micro;M, and the rest 1 mM). The cAMP analogs and forskolin showed more than
3-fold increases in CA biosynthesis and 2-fold increases in TH activity.
Curiously, while 8-Br-cGMP and the nitro compounds showed less enhancement
than those substances known to affect cellular cAMP levels, the increases
in TH activity and CA biosynthesis were very comparable. The differences
in the percentage increases in situ (CA biosyn.) vs. in vitro (TH
activity) may be related to transport of tyrosine into cells, the presence
of endogenous tyrosine affecting changes in specific radioactivity of
product determinations, and effects of using an artificial reducing
cofactor in the activity assay compared to the natural cofactor.
<p>
A time course was also conducted to examine changes in CA biosynthesis
using selected agents. Results show a higher rate of CA synthesis by 10
&micro;M forskolin treatment (3-fold) than when 0.1 mM sodium nitroprusside
was used (about 2-fold rate enhancement compared to control). The TH
inhibitor iodotyrosine was also tested at 0.10 mM and the rate of
synthesis was between 5-10% of the control rate, indicating TH was largely
responsible for CA synthetic changes. &alpha;-Methyl <i>p</i>-tyrosine was also tested and responded as for the other
inhibitor (data not shown). 25 &micro;M pargyline, an MAO inhibitor, was
shown to produce a 20-50% increase in CA specific radioactivity by itself;
when in the presence of stimulating agents, the increase was greater.
<p>
It has been shown that guanylate cyclase and PK-G are present in all
tissues examined; nonetheless, their particular activities may not be
sufficient to activate TH in all cell types in which TH occurs. To examine
this, rat corpus striatal synaptosomes and bovine adrenal chromaffin cells
were treated with either 0.1 mM Na nitroprusside, forskolin, and
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP (for 20 min) and TH activity assessed. All three
reagents produced increases in TH activity in both tissues judged to be
significant. In rat striatal synaptosomes, a 50% increase in TH activity
is observed with 0.1 mM Na nitroprusside while forskolin (10 &micro;M) and
Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP (1 mM) produced a 130-140% increase. In chromaffin
cells, the Na nitroprusside increases TH activity by 75%, while the cAMP
stimulators were increased about the same as in synaptosomes.

Organization and evolution of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene
<p class="Para1">
Total rat genomic DNA restricted with <i>Eco</i>RI, <i>Hin</i>dIII, and
<i>Kpn</i>I was examined in a Southern analysis using full-length
TH cDNA as a probe.  Both an <i>Eco</i>RI and <i>Kpn</i>I site are
present in TH cDNA, with no site for <i>Hin</i>dIII. As these digests produced
two bands while the other produced only one, TH is a single copy gene. A
recombinant lambda phage containing the entire TH coding region was
examined by sequencing, Southern analysis, and endonuclease mapping: the
TH gene is 7.3 kb long with a 4.1 kb 5' flanking sequence and 0.63 kb 3'
flank.
<p>
>From sequencing strategies, intron/exon splice junctions were
determined using alignment with TH cDNA. 13 exons ranging from 51-421 bp
in length were found. A "TATA" box is located 30 nt upstream from the
start codon, and 15 nt further upstream is a cAMP response element. Lewis
et <i>al.</i> (<i>JBC</i> <b>258</b>,
14632 (1983)) have reported that cAMP analogues regulates TH mRNA
transcription. Sequence homology of the coding regions, including
conservation of bases near intron/exon splice junction sites, with the
human PAH (phenylalanine hydroxylase) gene is noticeable. Gene size is
different however as the rat TH gene is only 7.3 kb long with 2.0 kb of
intervening sequence, while the human gene is 90 kb long with one intron
23 kb long. Preliminary data shows the human TH gene to be only 8 kb long,
which argues against species bias in gene organization.
<p>
10 out of the 12 splice sites in human PAH are in homologous positions
to the rat TH gene, suggesting the same ancestral gene. Exons 1-5 are
spread out across 75 kb in human PAH, while exons 6-13 are crammed into 16
kb of genome. Since these 3' exons show the most homology to TH, it has
been proposed that the 5' exons resulted from a recruitment of exons from
unrelated genes. However, the point of divergence must be upstream of exon
3, since splice sites following exons 2, 3, and 4 are conserved despite
lack of amino acid homology, and it would unlikely that random chance
would permit this splice sites to appear at the same location.
<p>
Because of the divergent nature of the 5' exons, homology searches with
other genes were done with the sequences in exons 1 to 4. None were found.
A "parsimonious" model to explain PAH and TH differences would predict an
ancestral gene with exons 3 through 13. With some recombination and
mutation, less homologous domains are attached to the conserved 3' region.
The ancestral gene is modified to have 14 introns (15 exons) and is
duplicated in the genome. TH and PAH each lost 2 introns, then PAH deletes
a portion of its 5' end.

A single human gene encoding multiple tyrosine
hydroxylases with different predicted functional characteristics
<p class="Para1">
Human pheochromocytoma tumor poly(A)<sup>+</sup>
RNA was isolated and its cDNA prepared into &lambda;gt10. 50,000
independent recombinants were obtained and
30,000 of those were screened with rat pTH-51, which contained the
complete coding sequence of rat TH. Of the 150 positives, these were
re-screened wit the 5' <i>Pst</i>I fragment of pTH-51, and the
3 clones obtained were analyzed by restriction mapping and partial
sequencing. All 3 extended to the poly(A)<sup>+</sup> tail and
were identical in the central and 3' regions, but diverged in the 5'
regions. They were dubbed HTH-1, -2, and -3. There is 89% homology in the
coding portion between HTH-1 and the rat molecule.
The 5'-untranslated region shows 60% homology
while the 3'-noncoding region shows none. The transcriptional initiation
site was mapped using primer extension with a 25mer complementary to amino
acids 16-40. The fragment extended to a total 69 nts, indicating that
HTH-1 lacks only 10 bp at its 5' end.
<p>
Except for 12 bp between nt 90 and 91 in HTH-1, HTH-2 was identical,
indicating alternative splicing to produce several messages. Using known
sequences from a rat genomic clone of TH, this is confirmed: A TATA box is
at -64 while three initiation sites at -35 to -33 revealed by primer
extension shows that the 1st exon is 90 bp long, where HTH-1 and HTH-2
diverge. The usual splice acceptor sites are located at the intron
junctions, and the 12 bp found in the coding of HTH-2 corresponds to the
12 bp in the 5' end of the 1st intron.
<p>
With HTH-3 the first exon has no homology with those of HTH-1 and
HTH-2. It starts with an AUG specifying a reading frame matching
downstream coding sequences common to all three HTH mRNAs. Primer
extension experiments using a 25mer complementary to bases in the putative
N-terminus of HTH-3 show two faint bands at 161 and 154 bases, resp. The
second product may be a result of arrested reverse transcription or as a
result of slightly different initiation site under the control of the same
promoter. 45 bases of the extended fragments match the 5' end of the HTH-3
sequence shown, suggesting HTH-3 lacks 116 bp at its 5' end in order to be
full length. If you look at HTH-1 pre-mRNA, it has 119 bases before a ATG
codon appears, corresponding to the 5' end of HTH-3.
<p>
S1 nuclease mapping has confirmed the presence of multiple mRNAs in
pheochromocytoma tumor with the use of uniformly labeled single-stranded
probes. The 5' ends of the cDNAs were subcloned into M13 vectors,
exploiting the <i>Eco</i>RI site, the <i>Sma</i>I site in the 5' terminus
of HTH-3 and the internal <i>Sma</i>I
site common to all three at position 100. Calculated lengths are 216, 222,
and 183 bases, resp., for HTH-1, -2, and -3. Using the probe originating
from HTH-1, protected fragments of 216 bases were obtained as expected
corresponding to HTH-1 mRNA; A second set of protected fragments of 109
and 107 bases was associated with HTH&#8209;2 and &#8209;3. The two other
probes yielded the expected protected fragments of 222, 183, 107, and 109
bases. RNAs from human adrenal glands showed a similar expression of
multiple TH mRNAs, indicating that tumor tissue was not a special case.
Relative amounts of RNA quantitated shows that type 2 mRNA dominates, with
relative ratios of ~1, 2, and 0.4 for HTH-1, -2, and -3, resp.
<p>
Other TH-expressing tissues were examined for type mRNA expression as
well. In the dopaminergic substantia nigra and noradrenergic locus
coeruleus, HTH-1 and -2 are present but no HTH-3. Since these were from
post-mortem human brains, it can be argued that post-mortem stability of
mRNAs differs, but this is unlikely since different relative quantities of
multiple TH mRNAs were observed in rat tissues immediately analyzed after
killing of the rat.
<p>
Relationships of TH structure and function are now made clear: Campbell
et al have already demonstrated that phosphorylation occurs in the amino
terminal region at multiple sites. The structural evidence shows much
variation in the amino terminus of the multiple human forms, while the
carboxyl region show the greatest intraspecial and even interspecial
conservation of amino acids, suggesting it to be the catalytic domain.
Certain serine residues in HTH-1 and HTH-2 are conserved in relative
position with the rat TH subunit. Addition of a VRGQ sequence to HTH-2
makes the affected Ser now a potential site for CaM-dependent
phosphorylation. HTH-3 contains a length of uncharged residues which might
explain why TH is associated with chromaffin cell secretory vesicle
membranes.
<p>
Perhaps certain pathological conditions attributed to
neurophysiological or behavioral changes may result from a differential
expression of the multiple mRNA forms of TH. Parkinson's disease resulting
in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons show that surviving neurons
compensate by increases in TH activity, possibly resulting from a
differential expression of one form over another. It is noted that the
human TH gene has been assigned to chromosome 11p15 near the
Harvey-<i>ras</i>-1 and insulin genes, the relative order being TH,
Harvey-<i>ras</i>-1, insulin and the centromere. An autosomal
dominant manic-depressive psychosis has been found to be linked to insulin
and very strongly to Harvey-ras-1 genes. This strongly suggest the
involvement of altered expression of TH or expression of mutant TH.

Full-length cDNA for rabbit tryptophan hydroxylase:
Functional domains and evolution of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases
<p class="Para1">
Goat polyclonal anti-rat PAH antibody was
affinity-purified on a rat PAH column and used to immunoblot (along with
<sup>125</sup>I-labeled porcine anti-goat IgG) lanes of
cytoplasmic fractions of extracts of various tissues: rat liver, which
showed a strong reaction for PAH present in large amounts in this tissue;
rabbit liver, an even stronger reaction for presence of PAH (showing
cross-species immunoreactivity); mouse raphe nucleus, which showed weak a
cross-reactive band which was TH subunit; and rabbit pineal body, with a
band of same M<sub>r</sub> as PAH but actually TrpH. Activity assays for
PAH showed no such activity in pineal body, whereas TrpH was present and
removed from supernatant by immunoprecipitation with anti-rat PAH.
<p>
A rabbit pineal body cDNA expression library was constructed using 500
pineal bodies to produce rabbit poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA. 800,000 plaques
indicate that 92% recombinants were available. Clones expressing protein
were identified with anti-rat PAH. The library was rescreened with the
cDNA insert of clone prbTRH401 according to Maniatias et <i>al.</i>
(<i>PNAS USA</i> <b>72</b>: 1184, 1975). Mini phage lysates were
prepared according to
Cameron et <i>al.</i> (<i>NAR</i> <b>4</b>: 1429, 1977). DNA sequencing was by
dideoxy method. EcoRI fragments were subcloned into M13mp18 phage
and sequenced in both orientations. The 1.7 kb EcoRI fragment of
prbTHR479 was sequenced by the sequential deletion method used by
Henikoff (<i>Gene</i> <b>28</b>: 351, 1984).
<p>
The longest cDNA clone (prbTHR479) contained 2441 bases and had a
single long open reading frame starting with an ATG at 132 and stopping at
TGA at 1464. This codes for a protein of 444 amino acid and predicted MW
of 51,007. Homology to the sequence of a truncated rat TrpH cDNA clone
obtained from rat pineal using a monospecific antibody to rat TrpH shows
that of the 94 amino acids aligned, only 5 are different, with at least 3
of these being functionally conservative (Lys &rarr; Arg or
Ile &rarr; Val).
<p>
The prbTRH479 was used to probe total RNA from various rabbit tissues
to check for message expression, using stringent hybridization and wash
conditions. Hybridization was observed only in rabbit pineal and brainstem
and not in liver, kidney, muscle, or lung.
<p>
Homology to other aromatic amino acid hydroxylases shows rabbit TrpH is
53% homologous to human PAH whereas there is slightly less homology (48%)
with TH. Many of the nonhomologous changes are functionally conservative.
The greatest homology is in the COOH terminus.

Identification and cell type specificity of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Genomic DNA encoding the rat
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene was isolated from a lambda phage library
using a nick-translated fragment from a cDNA clone for rat TH. We have
determined the initiation site for TH RNA synthesis and have sequenced
1100 bases of the primary transcript and 5' flanking region. The 5' end of
the transcript is the same in several rat tissues in which TH is expressed
as well as in rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC). RNA prepared from PC cells
that had been stimulated with dexamethasone also mapped to the same
transcription start site. Sequence upstream from the initiation site
contains the canonical TATA box, but no apparent CAAT box. When a portion
of the 5' flanking region of the TH gene (-773 to + 27) is fused to the
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, it promotes expression of
CAT in pheochromocytoma cells and GH4 cells, but not in two neural tumour
lines, RT4-D and B103, nor in several non neural cell lines. This suggests
that this region of the TH gene has features that confer tissue-restricted
expression on the TH promoter.

increases cause 2- to 3.5-fold increase in PC7e. Run-on transcription was
assayed in pheo cell nuclei isolated from cells treated with 1 &micro;M Dex
or 10 &micro;M forskolin over a time course (the assay was 30 min). RNA
produced in the assay is mixed with TH DNA fixed to NC filters. Plots of
run-on transcription in terms of control levels vs. inducer treatment show
that both Dex and forskolin increased TH gene expression. Forskolin
produced the more rapid rise, maximal at 8-fold after 30 min and already
declining by 45 min. After 24 h forskolin-treated cells were showing a
more declined level but still 3.5-fold above controls. The Dex-treated
cells show a slower rise and still climbing after 60 min (8-fold at this
time point), but at the 24 hr point, a slight decline was evident; the
maximum is therefore reached between the 1 and 24 h time points.
Transcription of Dex-treated cells at 24 h was still greater at 7-fold
than for forskolin-treated cells.
<p>
The 5'-flanking region of TH from -773 to +27 nt was inserted in a
vector pUC-CAT, which contains no promoters or enhances and codes the CAT
reporter downstream of the insertion site. The 27 bases upstream the
transcription start do not contain the AUG start codon (hence translation
initiation is of the prokaryotic type). The TH-CAT construct is
transfected into PC7e using CaPO<sub>4</sub> technique. A CAT activity vs.
construct mass curve shows linear increases in activity up to 20 &micro;g
transfected DNA. 24 h after transfection, cells are treated with either
Dex, forskolin, or 8-Br-cAMP and 24 h later cells are assayed for CAT
activity. The forskolin- and 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells show a 1.6- and
2.1-fold increase in CAT activity over basal, while Dex-treated cells were
slightly lower in CAT than controls. Indeed in several experiments the
range of CAT activity in Dex-treated transfected cells ranged from 61-85%
of basal levels. Cells transfected with pSV2-CAT construct show a higher
level of CAT activity than those transfected with TH-CAT construct; SV40
promoter and other enhancer elements are present and are expected to be
very up-regulated. The agents used here did not affect the pSV2-promoter
mediated CAT activity.
<p>
In another experiment cells are transfected with an RSV (Rous sarcoma
virus) CAT construct, as this contains special enhancer elements. Basal
CAT expression for 5'-TH-CAT and RSV-CAT construct in transfected cells
are nearly equal. The cAMP analog treatments induced a 2.1-fold greater
level of CAT activity in RSV-CAT-transfected cells compared to the TH-CAT
cells.
<p>
A new TH-CAT construct was employed which excised the region between
-773 and -272, leaving the promoter region between -272 and +27.
Transfected PC7e cells produced a lower basal CAT activity than those
which had been transfected with the longer upstream sequence, but the
range of variation was high with transfection using precipitates of this
DNA. Forskolin- and 8-Br-cAMP-treated transfected cells were equally
induced at 3.3-fold; although this shows higher CAT levels than for the
longer upstream sequence, some experiments had cAMP-induced activity equal
to or lower than the longer construct. Dex-treated cells showed a 60%
increase in CAT activity, in contrast to the longer construct.
<p>
A determination of whether transfection itself affect the ability of
cells to respond to inducers was made by comparing the level of endogenous
TH mRNA in transfected and untreated cells. These results show no
difference in the induced or basal levels of TH mRNA in transfected or
nontransfected cells.
<p>
The 5'TH-CAT (-773/+27) construct was transfected into GH<sub>4</sub>
(derived from anterior pituitary tumor) used the DEAE-dextran transfection
technique. GH<sub>4</sub> cells do not produce detectable TH activity, and
they respond to forskolin by stimulating transcription of prolactin and
growth hormone. Forskolin- and 8-Br-cAMP-treatment resulted in a 2.0- and
2.2-fold increase in CAT activity, resp., and Dex treatment had no effect.
Others have previously reported that pSV2-CAT constructs do not produce
CAT activity in this cell type, and that RSV-CAT is expressed at high
levels. We additionally show that CAT expression in RSV-CAT transfected
cells is not altered when treated with the cAMP inducers or with Dex.
<p>
Changes in CAT activity were generally monitored over a 2-day period
after transfection to determine a time course of inducer effects.
Forskolin was added in one experiment after transfection whereas in the
above experiments a 24 h recovery period was given before inducer was
added. CAT activity was detectable 18 h after the transfection only (no
inducer). With induction/transfection, CAT activity was above basal at 24
h post-transfection; at 43 hr, the increase was 2.4-fold.

Isolation and characterization of the human tyrosine
hydroxylase gene: identification of 5' alternative splice sites
responsible for multiple mRNAs
<p class="Para1">
Full-length human TH cDNA was labeled and used as a probe
of a human genomic library obtained from <i>Bam</i>HI-digested
human leukocyte DNA. Several bands are found. Probing with exon-specific
human cDNA probes, the 4.6 kb fragment is found to contain exons 1 and 2,
a 1.0 kb fragment contains exon 3, and 2.1 and 2.3 kb fragments contain
exons 4-13. This hybridization pattern suggests that the gene is single
copy and no more than 10 kb in size, from the sum of the fragments.
<p>
The bacteriophage clone (lambda hTH-1) containing the human TH gene is
11 kb long and was previously shown to hybridize to restriction fragments
containing the 5' and 3' ends of rat cDNA, which shows the entire coding
region is in the clone. The gene spans 8.0 kb in length, which in the
clone is bound by about 1.5 kb of 5' and 3' flanking sequence. The gene
was sequenced in its exons and splice junctions several times. The gene
contains 13 exons ranging from 51 to 479 bp in length. Unlike the rodent
gene, the human gene has two alternative splice sites which can include or
exclude exon 2, i.e. join exon 1 to exon 2 or exon 3.
<p>
As for the splice junction, all of them were identical or very close to
the consensus sequence established for such junctions. Most splice donors
were matched very well. With the exception of the alternative splice site
within the first human intron, there is conservation of splice sites
between human and rat. Nucleotide sequence homology between rat and human
is 89% in the coding regions, but there is practically no homology in the
introns. The relative sizes and positioning of the introns has been
preserved however.
<p>
All exons were sequenced using both strands, and the sequence
comparison with Grima et <i>al.</i> was true except for amino
acid 370, which they reported as serine (5'-TCA-3') and we report as
tyrosine (5'-TAC-3'). This correction makes human agree with rat sequence,
in a region known for its near identical homology (91%).
<p>
Human and rat exon 1 share 82% identity. The additional 12 bp extension
seen in exon 1 to form type 2 human TH may have resulted from a point
mutation creating a new splice site in intron 1. Note that these 12 bp
share 50% identity with the rat splice junction. A 52-mer corresponding to
the human exon 1 with the 12 bp extension was created as a probe to see if
rat TH gene had such a sequence. Weak hybridization was found within rat
intron 1 ~400 bases upstream of exon 2. But sequence analysis revealed no
significant homologies using the IFIND program, in which of 81 nts, only
40 matched, there were 24 mismatches, and 8 were unmatched because of two
gaps. No donor or acceptor sequences could be found.

Preganglionic stimulation increases the phosphorylation
of tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglion by both
cAMP-dependent and calcium-dependent protein kinases
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Electrical stimulation of the
preganglionic cervical sympathetic trunk increases the phosphorylation of
tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglion of the rat by a
nicotinic mechanism and by a noncholinergic mechanism. We have measured
the incorporation of [32P]Pi into specific tryptic phosphopeptides in
tyrosine hydroxylase in order to identify the protein kinases that
phosphorylate this enzyme in electrically stimulated ganglia. 32P-labeled
tyrosine hydroxylase was isolated from the ganglion by immunoprecipitation
and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was subjected to tryptic
hydrolysis. Seven tryptic peptides were resolved from these hydrolysates
by two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis and chromatography.
Preganglionic stimulation (20 Hz, 5 min) increased the incorporation of
32P into four of these peptides. In the presence of cholinergic
antagonists, however, electrical stimulation increased the labeling of
only one phosphopeptide. From a comparison of the effects of preganglionic
stimulation with the effects of agonists that activate specific protein
kinases, we conclude that electrical stimulation increases the
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase by both a cAMP-dependent protein
kinase and a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The nicotinic
component of preganglionic stimulation appears to be mediated by a
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, while the noncholinergic
component appears to be mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
Although protein kinase C can phosphorylate tyrosine hydroxylase, this
kinase does not appear to participate in the stimulation-induced
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglion.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase by cyclic GMP-dependent
protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
TH was purified from rat pheo and was obtained &gt;90%
pure according to SDS-PAGE. cGMP-dependent protein kinase was purified
from bovine lung according to Glass and Krebs (<i>J Biol
Chem</i> <b>254</b>: 9728-9738; 1979). Catalytic subunit of
cAMP-dep. protein kinase was obtained from bovine heart according to Hartl
&amp; Roskoski (<i>Biochemistry</i> <b>21</b>: 5175-5183; 1982).
<p>
TH was incubated with PK-G or PK-A cat. subunit for different periods.
The stoichiometry of incorporation was measured using labeled ATP. Both
enzymes incorporated a maximal 0.6 mol P/mol subunit which paralleled an
increase in the activity of TH for each enzyme. Activation and phosphate
incorporation for PK-G was 2-4-fold slower than for PK-A. Omission of ATP,
PK-A cat subunit or PK-G, or Mg<sup>2+</sup> eliminated all activation of
TH. cAMP was two orders of magnitude less effective in stimulating PK-G
than cGMP. In activated TH, <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for
6MPH<sub>4</sub> was reduced from 800 to 160 &micro;M by both kinases at pH
6.0, suggesting a similar mechanism in activation.
<p>
To assess whether both kinases phosphorylate the same or different
sites, PK-G and PK-A, either singly or together, were mixed with TH and
the stoichiometry of incorporation using labeled ATP ascertained. With
PK-G alone, 0.63 &plusmn; 0.12 mol <sup>32</sup>P/mol subunit was observed. With
PK-A alone, 0.67 &plusmn; 0.09 mol <sup>32</sup>P/mol subunit. With both, the
incorporation was 0.64 &plusmn; 0.13 mol <sup>32</sup>P/mol subunit, indicating
that both kinases probably phosphorylate the same site. The final
stoichiometries were the same whether both kinases were added together at
the same time or one incubated for 30 min and a second 30 min incubation
for the other.
<p>
TH phosphorylated by each kinase was subsequently digested with trypsin
and then analyzed on HPLC using 5 &micro;m C<sub>18</sub>-reversed phase
column. Peaks at 29 and 34 min were the prominent tryptic peptides of
PK-G-treated TH. When compared to PK-A-treated TH which had a very
significant peak at 34 min, and the fact that analysis of PK-G incubated
alone produced a similar 29 min peak as in the PK-G + TH analysis, it
seems apparent that the 34 min peak is the TH peptide which is the target
of both kinases. Identical migration patterns of the phosphopeptides in
the 34 min zone was shown using IEF (data not shown).

Rat pheochromocytoma tyrosine hydroxylase is

<p>
Gel filtration of trypsinized labeled TH showed a non UV-absorbing band
eluting with calibrated standards corresponding to 12 peptides long, while
the strongly UV-absorbing 56 kDa band eluted in the void volume.
Phosphorylated peptide was passed on to DEAE-Trisacryl, eluted with 0.2 M
ammonium carbonate, then passed over Trisacryl GF05 which showed that the

<p>
The peptide was acid hydrolyzed and hydrolysate run developed on
thin-layer cellulose. The labeled amino acid was identified as a serine.
Gas-phase sequencing showed it corresponded to positions 38-45 (the

Angiotensin II Increases Cytosolic Calcium and Stimulates

with 15 ml 0.2% fresh collagenase (Sigma) in BSS, left 10 min at
37&deg;, this also repeated 3 times.  After removing medulla from cortex,
and mincing, filtering was through a nylon mesh (Tetco HC3160),

<p>The percent CA release was compared to other agonists.  Angiotensin II was more 
similar to KCl than nicotine, which produced a release greater than 2-fold.  The 
control treatment showed that KCl and AII were 3- to 4-fold greater.
<p>
Quin-2 fluorescence was measured against time to observe changes in 
intracellular calcium with three treatments.  Resting cells show a peak 143 
&plusmn; 22 nM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Angiotensin II at 1 &micro;M 
showed a peak calcium of 313 &plusmn; 43, KCl at 50 mM was 316 &plusmn; 17, and 
nicotine at 62 &micro;M was 321 &plusmn; 41.  These are all significantly 
different from the resting control.  Times to reach peak value were 20-30, 
15-25, and 10-20 sec, resp.  Times to reach basal level were 3-7, 8-16, and 2-4 
min, resp.  There was an effect of the collagenase used to prepare cells on 
these experimental results.
<p>
Combination treatments were also tried.  It was clear that AII
following nicotine caused greater increases in intracellular calcium,
while control nicotine-on-nicotine and AII-on-AII showed no response.
In Ca-free medium, there was only a slight but detectable response
to AII addition.  Treatment in presence of verapamil at 100 &micro;M
attenuated Quin-2 increases to AII, KCl, and nicotine, while at 1 mM, all
responses were abolished.  The same results were also seen with
nifedipine (data were not shown).
<p>
These results show that these cells depend on extracellular calcium
largely, but that intracellular stores are also mobilized.  The minimal
level at which a response was seen was 0.001 &micro;M (1 nM), but
this is higher than measured serum levels two orders of magnitude
lower.  Local concentrations of AII in the medulla could be higher
since the hormone is secreted immediately upstream of these cells
in the blood circulatory architecture.

Activation of tyrosine hydroxylase by micromolar concentrations of
calcium in digitonin-permeabilized adrenal medullary cells
<p class="Para1">
Bovine adrenal medullary cells were isolated and cultured
and then permeabilized with 30 &micro;M digitonin. The permeabilized cells
were then treated with 1 &micro;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> which resulted in an
increase in the soluble TH activity. Previous reports have shown that TH
is released by digitonin treatment. Immunotitration curves of TH activity
vs. antiserum added showed that the slopes of decreasing activity in
control and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-treated cells intersect at the same volume of
antiserum added, indicating near identical equivalence points: this
suggests that increases in enzyme activity are due to modifications of TH
itself rather than a change in the number of enzyme molecules.
Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration dependence was assessed for the
permeabilized cells: enzyme activation is half-maximal at 0.2 &micro;M and
maximal at 1 &micro;M. ATP was essential for this activation step.
<p>
cAMP has been shown to increase catecholamine synthesis and TH activity
in adrenal medullary cells. First the dose response of medullary cells to
cAMP was assessed, with maximal activation reached at 100 &micro;M cAMP. Next
the stimulatory effect of 1 &micro;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> on TH activity
in the presence of 100 &micro;M cAMP was assessed and additional activation
was observed, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts through a pathway
distinct from cAMP. Recent reports by Albert et <i>al.</i>
(1984) suggest protein kinase C being involved in TH activity increases,
so permeabilized cells were treated with a variety of chemicals. 1 &micro;M
TPA alone had a significant effect (2-fold) compared to basal (5 mM EGTA)
cells. This was similar to the response of 1 &micro;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> alone.
Combined Ca and TPA produced an additive response. 1 &micro;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>
with 100 &micro;M W-7 or 50 &micro;M TFP (known to inhibit CaM binding and are
weak inhibitors of PK-C) produced the same effect as Ca<sup>2+</sup>
alone, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> works through the
calmodulin pathway and other pathways as well.

Tyrosine hydroxylase is activated and phosphorylated on
different sites in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells treated with phorbol
ester and forskolin
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells are incubated 1 h in <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> and extracts were
immunoprecipitated with anti-TH serum, precipitates separated on SDS gels
and autorad. A band at M<sub>r</sub> ~60,000 is observed. Cells treated 15
min with 2 &micro;M PMA caused a 2-3-fold increase in the observed
phosphorylation; this was also marked by a 2-fold activation of TH. Medium
containing no Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM EGTA) had no effect on either activity
or phosphorylation of TH in either control or PMA-treated cells.
Trifluoperazine-pretreated cells (0.1 mM TFP, 15 min) which are then
treated with 2 &micro;M PMA indicates a 60-70% reduction in TH activity and
phosphorylation compared to cells not TFP-pretreated, although TFP does
not affect the basal activity or phosphorylation. 0.1 &micro;M forskolin
caused 2-fold activation and increased phosphorylation, which resulted
whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> was present or absent. Nor did TFP pretreatment
affect the stimulation produced by forskolin.
<p>
The time course of activation at 2 &micro;M PMA was found to increase
significantly after 5 min, and reach maximal at 10 min. Phosphorylation
was significantly increased after 2 min and maximal after 10-15 min. 0.1
&micro;M forskolin treatment also correlated activation with phosphorylation
and the degree of activation was found the same whether the assay was done
with 0.1 or 1 mM 6-MePtH<sub>4</sub>. Phosphorylation of TH by 0.1 &micro;M
forskolin treatment reached 2-fold maximally while that by 2 &micro;M PMA
reached at least 3-fold after 20 min. cAMP level determinations were made
on cells in which forskolin dose varied indicates that forskolin at 20 nM
begins to increase cAMP, with an effective dose 100 nM, while PMA has no
effect on cAMP levels. The changes in cAMP with forskolin dose are
correlated exactly with changes in TH phosphorylation and activation as a
function of forskolin concentration. As for PMA, TH activation and
phosphorylation occur simultaneously at a PMA concentration about 50 nM
and are maximal at 200 nM PMA
<p>
Cells were treated with 1-olelyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) at three
different doses (200, 400, and 600 &micro;g/ml) and at 400 &micro;g/ml OAG in
Ca-free medium. TH activity in 0.1 and 1 mM 6-MePtH<sub>4</sub> and TH
phosphorylation were assessed and activity was found to be maximally
reached at 400 &micro;g/ml, and these changes occurred despite the absence of
Ca<sup>2+</sup>. 400 &micro;g/ml of either 1,2-diolein or 1,3-diolein were
without effect. 1 &micro;M ionomycin incubation for 15 min itself produced a
3-fold increase in TH activity and phosphorylation, which are comparable
to the effects previously reported with another
Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, A23187 (Tachikawa et <i>al.</i>, 1986).
<p>
Cells preincubated in labeled ATP were again treated with PMA, OAG,
forskolin, or ionomycin and the TH was immunoprecipitated, prepped on SDS
gels, eluted from the gels and then treated with 5 mg/ml trypsin for 24 h
(twice), and phosphopeptides separated on HPLC. From the PMA-treated
cells, four peptides at 17, 20, 23, and 28 min into a 0-20% n-propanol
gradient in 0.05% TFA with a 1 ml/min flow and 1 ml collected fractions
were obtained. Retention times were slightly different from a previous
report because of column quality variability. Ionomycin-treated cells
produced all peaks but the one at 23 min, a pattern identical to 56 mM
K<sup>+</sup>- and A23187-treated PC12 cells. Agreement with 2-D
thin-layer electrophoresis/chromatography methods is found as well. PMA or
OAG treatment enhanced phosphorylation of the 20 min peptide a great deal,
while forskolin treatment apparently selectively enhanced the
phosphorylation at the 28 min peptide. The 28 min peptide is identical to
tryptic peptide obtained from cells stimulated with dibutyryl cAMP and
from in vitro phosphorylated TH treated with protein kinase A.
Rechromatography of each HPLC peak using either thin-layer electrophoresis
or chromatography demonstrates that the peaks at 20 and 28 min are only
one species, but the peak at 17 min contained two species separable by
TLE, although one of those had 80-90% of the radiolabel. These peptides
from 17, 20, and 28 min are identical to the same phosphopeptides obtained
from K<sup>+</sup>-depolarized cells.

Mechanism of oxygen activation by tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Iron presence in rat adrenal TH was previously inferred
from experiments in which Fe addition increased enzyme activity. Hoeldtke
&amp; Kaufman (1977) had showed presence of 0.5-0.75 Fe/TH subunit in TH
from bovine adrenal medulla. Our work with atomic adsorption spectroscopy
shows one Fe atom/subunit. No other metals could be found. This parallels
our earlier studies with PAH iron presence. Since <i>o</i>-phenanthroline binds 1:1 stoichiometrically with the enzyme,
and since it is specific for ferrous iron, the redox state must be 2+. No
absorbance changes at 510 nm (used to detect iron-phenanthroline complex)
were seen with TH or phenanthroline alone, and changes were linear with
respect to enzyme or compound added.
<p>
A hysteretic cycle of oxidation to 3<sup>+</sup> state and reduction to
2<sup>+</sup> state as was done in studies with PAH was performed using
hydrogen peroxide and tetrahydropterin. When peroxide treated, no spectral
changes at 510 nm were observed in the presence of phenanthroline.
Catechol does interact with ferric atom however and a spectral shift could
be observed with extinction at 650 nm. Enzyme turnover was inhibited, but
only when the catechol was present and the enzyme had been peroxidized.
Addition of reduced pterin cofactor to peroxided enzyme restored activity,
even with catechol present, indicating that the cofactor is able to reduce
the iron atom. TH also has a fluorescence spectrum similar to that of PAH,
in which the latter has an A<sub>max</sub> of 340 nm (excitation is 275
nm) which is senstive to the iron redox state. While PAH shows a 100%
fluorescence intensity increase when its iron is reduced from
3<sup>+</sup> to 2<sup>+</sup>, TH fluorescence quenched by 1 equiv of
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is not 50% of the native TH value. Still, a
hysteretic cycle of 3-4 times with &gt;90% of retention of TH activity can
be obtained and observed as cycling fluorescence emission as well.
<p>
Tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor is presumed to have a 4&alpha;-carbinolamine 
intermediate in its acid-catalyzed dehydration leading to the reduction of TH 
iron, but such intermediates are unstable (<i>k</i><sub>deh</sub>=0.01 
s<sup>&minus;1</sup> in Tris buffer, pH 8.4, 25&deg;). Conditions must be found 
to increase the formation rate to be greater than the dehydration rate, which is 
easily done for PAH. But the cofactor has a propensity to auto-oxidize, and the 
inherent low activity of TH makes it necessary to concentrate a large amount of 
enzyme. Using a number of different pH values and temperatures to maximize TH 
activity and stabilize the 4&alpha;-carbinolamine, pH 8.2 at 25&deg; was found 
at which 1.0 &micro;M TH oxidizes BH<sub>4</sub> (20 &micro;M) with an initial 
velocity of 0.005 s<sup>-1</sup> and 4&alpha;-carbinolamine dehydrates 
with a first order 0.008 s<sup>-1</sup>. Intermediate accumulation may be sensed 
by utilizing the UV absorbance changes occurring when BH<sub>4</sub> is 
oxygenated to its 4&alpha;-carbinolamine prior to dehydration to BH<sub>2</sub>. 
Two wavelengths at 244 and 334 nm are monitored simultaneously during TH 
oxidation of limiting amounts of BH<sub>4</sub>. The lower wavelength monitors 
changes in absorbance due to oxygenation of BH<sub>4</sub> to 
4&alpha;-carbinolamine, as well as overall oxidation to BH<sub>2</sub>. The 
latter component can be factored out by using the 334 nm absorbance changes, 
which are sensitive only to BH<sub>4</sub> to BH<sub>2</sub> transitions, since 
the intermediate does not absorb at this wavelength. Initial experiments 
starting with 2.0 &micro;M TH, 20 &micro;M tyrosine, and 20 &micro;M 
BH<sub>4</sub> failed to indicate the formation of any 4&alpha;-carbinolamine. 
Simultaneous determination of the amount of tyrosine hydroxylated indicated only 
40-50% of the BH<sub>4</sub> cofactor was being used in hydroxylation events. 
Since the intermediate forms only when tyrosine is hydroxylated, its observed 
rate constant of formation was less than the rate of dehydration, meaning none 
could be detected. The balance of BH<sub>4</sub> was being directly converted to 
BH<sub>2</sub> in a TH-dependent manner which may or may not be autocatalytic. 
This may result from the use of a relatively basic pH in these studies, since 
other incubations indicated that &gt;95% of the cofactor is used in tyrosine 
hydroxylation at a lower pH (pH 7.2), 25&deg;. However, increasing the TH enzyme 
to 5 &micro;M enabled detection of 4&alpha;-carbinolamine and construction of 
reaction progress curves for formation and decay of the intermediate. When done, 
the first order decay (<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>=0.008 s<sup>-1</sup>) is observed to 
be identical with that of PAH under identical incubation conditions. Hence TH 
possesses no carbinolamine dehydratase activity, confirmed when TH is added to a 
solution of 4&alpha;-carbinolamine generated by PAH turnover. Total 
4&alpha;-carbinolamine generated during the incubation can be assessed by 
extrapolation of the first order-decay phase to zero: hence 15.5 &micro;M 
intermediate was formed in an experiment in which 15.0 &micro;M tyrosine was 
hydroxylated, both values overlapping within their errors about the mean.
<p>
Phenylalanine as a substrate for TH was assessed, since there are some
reports that it can be a substrate as well. Conditions were such that one
turnover event per enzyme molecule could be detected. However, no
mono-oxygenation of phenylalanine, nor oxidation of BH<sub>4</sub> or
6-MPH<sub>4</sub> at multiple concentrations in excess of the base line
could be detected. Rather, controls suggest competitive inhibiton by Phe
instead of the seeming "uncoupling" effect on tetrahydrobiopterin
oxidation.
<p>
Since BH<sub>4</sub> is oxidized significantly in the presence of TH and 
tyrosine at pH 8.2, determination of whether this oxidation was TH- or 
tyrosine-dependent was assessed by measuring initial velocity of oxidation of 
BH<sub>4</sub> with 20 &micro;M cofactor in the presence of 2.0 &micro;M TH at 
pH 8.2 and 7.2, 25&deg;. Subtracting residual oxidation of BH<sub>4</sub> 
occurring in the absence of TH as a control, initial velocities of 0.004 and 
0.002 s<sup>-1</sup> were found at pH 8.2 and 7.2, resp. The first value is of a 
magnitude comparable to the oxidation rate induced with 1.0 &micro;M TH in the 
presence of substrate. One interpretation is that there is a TH hydroxylating 
intermediate involved in the mechanism. PAH is known to utilize 
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a cofactor for oxidizing tetrahydropterins in 
absence of the substrate, but 2.0 &micro;M TH/20 or 200 &micro;M 
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/pH 8.2 or 7.2 failed to increase the rate of 
oxidation. Since H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/BH<sub>4</sub> support a hysteretic 
cycle, oxidation of TH may control the pterin oxidase activity.

<p>
The most likely structure of the hydroxylating species is a
peroxytetrahydropterin. This implies that a peroxide might be able to
substitute for Phe oxidation by PAH or Tyr oxidation by TH. When TH is
incubated with 10-fold excess H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a slightly
greater than stoichiometric oxidation of Tyr results. There is no
hydroxylation if either TH or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is omitted. There
is also no hydroxylation as well if TH and a 100&#8209;fold excess of
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is included, but this clearly results from
enzyme inactivation by the high amount of peroxide present: in the 10-fold
excess experiment, 80% of TH activity is recoverable, but in the 100-fold
excess experiment, all activity is lost. With other peroxides, 10&#8209;
and 100&#8209;fold excess levels of <i>tert</i>-butyl
hydroperoxide resulted in no tyrosine hydroxylation and complete enzyme
inactivation, <i>m</i>-chloroperoxybenzoic acid causes total
TH inactivation and nonenzymic tyrosine hydroxylation. TH during these
experiments also slowly self-inactivated during turnover, a process
observed with PAH.
<p>
The experiments above suggest that formation of a transient
hydroxylating species in which the activated group is the part of the
cofactor or polypeptide can be scavenged by addition of tyrosine. 1.0
&micro;M TH/1.0 &micro;M BH<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> were incubated for a
period of time to form the hydroxylating species, then quenched by
addition of tyrosine after various intervals of time. If Tyr is added
after 1 min, about 50% hydroxylation occurs (with respect to TH) whereas
longer times result in hyperbolically less hydroxylation. The
hydroxylating species may not involve BH<sub>4</sub> however, since the
BH<sub>4</sub> to BH<sub>2</sub> oxidation was followed and found
to occur completely within 30 s. Since the ability to hydroxylate is lost
with time, it is probable that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is being formed
from the unstable intermediate which would normally be presented to
tyrosine, although it is not ruled out that the
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> product is the means used by
TH to achieve the hydroxylation. 15 &micro;g/ml catalase failed to inhibit
any hydroxylation by &gt;10%. Therefore, if
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the means by which TH
hydroxylates Tyr, it is tightly bound to the enzyme.
<p>
DISCUSSION. The present data show comparable mechanistic oxidative
events with respect to PAH and TH. As BH<sub>4</sub> cofactor is
brought into reactive contact with O<sub>2</sub> positioned and activated
by an Fe(II) atom within the subunit, the peroxytetrahydropterin formed
can go on to one of two paths: (1) either complete the cycle by
transferring the outermost peroxy oxygen to tyrosine to form DOPA, leaving
the 4&alpha;-carbinolamine which rapidly dehydrates to
BH<sub>2</sub> or, (2) in the event of no available substrate, TH merely
oxidizes BH<sub>4</sub> to BH<sub>2</sub>, usually under nonphysiological
conditions (e.g., no substrate or pH is 8.2). Fe(II) provides orbital
overlap, overcoming the spin-forbidden nature of reacting triplet
O<sub>2</sub> with BH<sub>4</sub>. This contrasts with bacterial
aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, which utilize reduced flavins and no
metal centers, but which share a similar mechanism of oxidative transfer.
Reduced flavins are known, however, to react with O<sub>2</sub> more
easily to produce the necessary peroxyflavins, a pathway less accessible
to tetrahydropterins because of the greater instability of the semiquinone
form used.
<p>
A major difference between PAH and TH is the environment of the metal
center, reflected in the results in which they interact with peroxides
differently and in the fact that isolated TH contains Fe<sup>2+</sup>
whereas PAH is always isolated in its Fe<sup>3+</sup> form and must
necessarily be reduced to the Fe<sup>2+</sup> form. Moreover, PAH rapidly
self-inactivates during turnover unless protected by catalase, whereas TH
inactivates only at an extremely slow rate. Inactivation of PAH in
uncoupled turnover most likely results from its ability to perform Fenton
chemistry on bound H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which generates extremely
reactive hydroxyl radicals, causing oxidation of critical amino acids in
the catalytic center and effectively inactivating the enzyme. This Fenton
chemistry would be:

style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]--> PAH-Fe<sup>3+</sup> +
HO<sup>-</sup> + HO&bull;
<p>
Measurement of the reduction potential of the
free aqueous Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> couple and the
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/OH<sup>-</sup>,OH&bull; couple
indicate the favorability of this chemistry. In an environment with
slightly more positive reduction potential, redn of Fe<sup>3+</sup> is
less favored so that the Fe center can exhibit alternative modes of
peroxide reactivity and Fenton chemistry. Treatment of TH with more easily
oxidized peroxides such as <i>tert</i>-butyl hydroperoxide or
<i>m</i>-CPBA results therefore in enzyme inactivation and an
inability to react with these peroxdes in any other way.
<p>
The observation that TH has the unique ability to utilize
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Tyr hydroxylation while PAH cannot may be
the result of favorable kinetic/thermodynamic properties: (1) Tyr is
energetically easier to hydroxylate than Phe because of ring activation
toward electrophilic addition provided by the p-hydroxyl moiety; (2) the
difference in redox potential of the Fe<sup>2+</sup> enables
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activation in competition with Fenton chemistry
predominate in PAH catalysis. The TH Fe center may activate
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in one of two ways, either by serving as a
Lewis acid for increasing the electrophilicity of the peroxide oxygen
transferred into tyrosine, or by forming a discrete ferryl species as in:

<p class="noteswithin c8">Such ferryl species have never been demonstrated
forming with non-heme iron enzymes, but evidence of such a species
transient in solution has been observed with ferrous EDTA reacted with
peroxide. Tyrosine is an effective scavenger of this species, whereas
benzoate is not.

Isolation of a novel cDNA clone for human tyrosine hydroxylase:
alternative RNA splicing produces four kinds of mRNA from a single gene
<p class="Para1">
Total RNA was taken from 8 g of human pheochromocytoma
using the guanidinium thiocyanate method. From it 120 &micro;g of
poly(A<sup>+</sup>)RNA was obtained using oligo(dT)-cellulose
chromatography. cDNA synthesis from this was from a standard method.
Ligation with an EcoRI linker was followed by size fraction to size select
for &gt; 1 kbp DNA. These were inserted into &gamma;11, and
recombinants number 600,000 clones. A 23-mer corresponding to
complementary to nt 481-503 of the rat sequence was synthesized,
5'-labeled, and used to screen the human library.
<p>
Northern blots were prepared from human pheochromocytoma tissue and the
labeled 23mer used as a probe. A strong signal on a 2.0 kb band is
evident. From a library of 300,000 plaques, 28 clones were shown positive
by plaque hybridization. 20 of the 28 showed clones with a 2.0 kb insert.
Three were randomly selected (hTH 502, 703, 903), analyzed by restriction
mapping and sequence analysis. One clone (hTH 903) corresponded to type 2
(HTH-2). hTH 502 was found identical to hTH 703, and both were similar but
clearly distinct from each of three types reported previously. hTH 502 and
703 had a 93 bp insertion consisting of a 12 bp sequence characteristic of
type 2 (HTH-2) and a 81 bp sequence of type 3 (HTH-3). This TH cDNA has
been designated type 4. The insertion is at the same point (between the
90th and 91st nt of type 1) and does not alter the reading frame,
therefore making TH type 4 the longest of the four types.
<p>
A full length hTH 502 cDNA and fragments from the 3' end (coding +
noncoding) and the 5' coding end were used as probes for a Southern blot
of human genomic DNA. The genomic DNA was prepared from human placenta and
digested with either EcoRI, BamHI, or HindIII (20 hr, 37&deg;), run on agarose
gel, transferred to Zeta-probe nylon (BioRad) and stringent hybridization
carried out. The full length probe produced four bands of the BamHI
digest: 5, 2.4, 2.2, and 1.9 kbp. The 5'-end probe found the 5 kbp band in
the same digest, while the 3'-fragment found the 2.4 and 1.9 kbp fragment
exclusively. The HindIII digest showed a 9.4 kbp band with full-length
probe. Bands at 20 and 13 kbp were evident in the EcoRI digest, each band
detected exclusively by the 5'- and 3'-fragment, respectively. These
results taken together suggest human TH is encoded by a single gene per
haploid DNA genome.
<p>
DISC. Alternative splicing to produce different messages is common in
eukaryotic gene expression (see Leff et al, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 55: 1091,
1986). It occurs in two ways: (1) alternation splice sites present in one
exon or (2) selective insertion or deletion of an entire exon. From nt
88-96 in type 4 cDNA the sequence (5'-ATG|GTAAGA-3') is homologous to the
consensus around a splicing donor junction:<br>
5'-(C/A)AG|GT(A/G)AGT-3'. Hence the 12 bp fragment of type 2 results from
intra-exonal alternative splicing. Sequences from 100-108 and from 181-189
in type 4 premessage have no homology and so the 81 bp insertion clearly
is derived from an independent exon.

Isolation of a full-length cDNA clone encoding human

Four types of mRNA were reported recently for human TH.
Type 2 has a 12 bp sequence inserted between the 90th and 91st nt (amino
acid 30 and 31) of type 1 TH. Type 4 has an additional 81 bp inserted
after the 12 bp sequence of type 2 TH. Some confusion surrounded type 3 TH

Effect of spermine on tyrosine hydroxylase activity
before and after phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
Bovine adrenal TH is incubated with PK-A in the presence
or absence of 50 &micro;M spermine over a time course. Both TH activity and
phosphorylation are analyzed, with phosphorylation observed on SDS gels
followed by autoradiography. We have shown earlier that spermine (and
other polyamines) inhibits the unphosphorylated TH, but the time course of
activity here shows spermine has no effect on the phosphorylation or
activation of TH by PK-A. Dixon plotting of activity vs. spermine
concentration shows a break. A biphasic effect on TH activity had been
shown in our earlier report. We note that the pH optimum of the
phosphorylated TH is shifted from 6.0 to 6.4, and the pH profile is not
distinguished in the presence or absence of spermine. Lineweaver-Burk
plots of activity vs 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> concentration using
nonphosphorylated TH in the presence of spermine show the typical downward
deviation in the biphasic form. The Hill coefficient is found to be 0.7.
Spermine demonstrates negative cooperativity against the 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>
cofactor binding site. On another LB plot of activity vs tyrosine
concentration, the plot generally demonstrates a decrease in the
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> without changing the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine; the
K<sub>i</sub> value is 68 &micro;M. With phosphorylation, the
negative cooperative effect of spermine on the pterin binding site is
gone. Any inhibition demonstrated was competitive with respect to
6-MPH<sub>4</sub> (K<sub>i</sub> = 145 &micro;M). Inhibition of tyrosine
binding to phosphorylated TH by spermine was noncompetitive, and the
K<sub>i</sub> value increased 4-fold. <sup>14</sup>C-spermine mixed with
TH and separated on Sephadex G-50 shows spermine does not bind tightly to
TH.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>. TH is allosterically inhibited by spermine, showing
negative cooperativity presumably due to an anionic property at the site
of pterin binding in which spermine occupies the site instead. We note
that the sequence DPDDLDLD is present as residues 185-191 in the rat TH,
having 4 neg. charges while spermine has 4 pos. charges. Another
regulatory site which is on the other hand cationic is the phosphorylated
site which is phosphorylated and diminishes the ability of spermine to
exhibit its influence.

Tyrosine hydroxylase: purification from PC12 cells,
characterization and production of antibodies
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells grown as indicated and harvested then washed
in 10 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>, pH 6.4 + 0.2 M sucrose. With leupeptin added,
cells extracted by sonication, ultraspun at 100,000 x g. The 30-42%
AmSO<sub>4</sub> cut was taken and purified over Sepharose CL-6B.
After that, DE-52 was used with a 0 to 0.5 M NaCl gradient. Following
pooling and diluting to reduce ionic strength, purification over
heparin-Sepharose was done: column was washed first with 100 mM
AmSO<sub>4</sub> in buffer, then activity eluted with 0.25 M
AmSO<sub>4</sub>. Active fractions stored at -80&deg;. Final spec. activity of
258,000 pmol/min/mg (215-fold purified) with a yield of 8% (declared in
the text) obtained.
<p>
SDS polyacrylamide gel analysis revealed a subunit MW of about 60,000.
HPLC and FLPC gel filtration columns indicated a native MW below the
predicted 240,000. On Sepharose CL-6B, TH activity elutes after catalase
(M<sub>r</sub>=232,000), indicating that TH is not a tetramer or that it
interacts with the matrix. Cross-linking with dimethylsuberimidate
following by SDS-PAGE indicate a protein of M<sub>r</sub>=125,000,
suggesting TH is a dimer.
<p>
2-D gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with anti-TH shows
TH to possess charge heterogeneity, with 3 spots appearing at pI 5.4, 5.6,
5.9 and all moving at 60,000. In addition, amino acid analysis of the PC12
TH differed in the quantity of certain amino acids as oppposed to those
predicted from analysis of rat striatum and adrenal gland TH or that
predicted from PC12 TH sequence analysis.
<p>
PC12 TH had an optimum of 6.5-7.0, and there was buffer salt
dependence. Trp and Phe were explored as alternative substrates: only Trp
was hydroxylated to any extent (1% of Tyr hydroxylation) and Phe was not
converted at all. The charge heterogeneity of TH subunit demanded
examination as to whether it may be a glyco- or lipoprotein: results with
Schiff's staining, double staining with Coomassie Blue and Ag, binding to
ConA-Sepharose, and <sup>3</sup>H-mannose incorporation in situ were all
negative. Neuraminidase treatment indicated a shift in M<sub>r</sub> of
TH, but when the neuraminidase was used in the presence of protease
inhibitors, there was no shift, indicating proteases were present in the
neuraminidase preparation.
<p>
Rabbit antiTH sera were prepared and immunoprecipitation was successful
for TH in PC12 cell extracts as well as for rat brain, adrenal, and human
pheochromocytoma with measurable activity in precipitates. There was no
cross-immunoprecipitation of Trp or Phe hydroxylase activities from pure
PAH and TrpH in extracts of midbrain. When incubated with the antibody
alone (no Protein A in the immunoprecipitation), there was no effect on TH
activity: antibodies themselves can be inhibiting or activating in some
cases. Single precipitin lines were observed in Ouchterlony plates
(optimal antiserum titer of 1:2000 shows it to be an unusually good
antibody). The antiTH was of the IgG subclass as 1) it bound to Protein-A
Sepharose and 2) it reacted on Westerns with an anti-IgG antibody.
<p>
Immunoaffinity chromatography was attempted by first enriching for IgG
from the crude serum on Protein-A Sepharose. Eluted antibodies were then
incubated with CNBr-activated Sepharose to make the affinity column. There
was substantial removal of TH activity in the effluent. The column was
washed with equilibrating buffer and 0.5 M NaCl and then eluted with 6 M
urea. The TH appeared on Western blots. No activity is recoverable because
of the denaturing conditions.

Both short- and long-term effects of nerve growth factor
on tyrosine hydroxylase in calf adrenal chromaffin cells are blocked by
S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitors
<p class="Para1">
Calf chromaffin cells plated at a low density of
10000/cm<sup>2</sup> on a polyornithine substrate and exposed to 800 ng/ml
NGF show an increase in TH activity after 5-10 min. This activation
reaches a stable maximum after 30-60 min of continual NGF exposure. Cells
on a laminin substrate on the other hand show a much larger increase in TH
activity, maximal after only 5 min exposure but declining within 15-30 min
to a level of activity still 2-fold higher than for the polyORN plate
cultures. The level of TH expression (in terms of molecules of TH) were
measured using immunotitration and were not found to show a difference in
the laminin vs. polyOrn cultures. Use of adult chromaffin cells showed no
significant activation of TH with NGF treatment, no matter whether the
cells were plated on polyOrn or laminin.
<p>
Certain drugs were used (for a 3 hr exposure) to check for the
inhibition of methionine incorporation into protein. Two forms of labeled
methionine were used: the <sup>3</sup>H-methyl form was used as
an indicator of the methylation inhibition whereas the <sup>35</sup>S-form
was used as an indicator of decreased protein synthesis. In control cells,
the <sup>3</sup>H-methyl form was incorporated 7-fold greater than the
<sup>35</sup>S-form in TCA-precipitable material. The drugs
5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA),
5'-<i>S</i>-(2-methylpropyl)adenosine (SIBA),
9-&beta;-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A), and D-Eritadenine (EA)
were shown to have no effect on protein synthesis. EA has a small effect
(20% inhibition) on methylation, whereas with MTA and ara-A inhibition was
&gt;50%. SIBA had a small effect on protein synthesis (20% inhibition) and
blocked methylation additionally (30%). Cycloheximide inhibited protein
synthesis 50% without selective effect on methylation. It is not clear why
both forms of methionine are inhibited to the same extent, but a
regulatory relationship between protein synthesis and methylation may
exist. When cells which had been plated on laminin and treated for 3 hr
with each of the drugs prior to NGF treatment for 5 min were tested for
activity, both MTA and ara-A were found to inhibit TH activation. CHI, EA,
and SIBA had no effect.
<p>
To distinguish the effect of the drugs on NGF-mediated TH activation
from that mediated by 8-bromo-cAMP, laminin-cultured cells were treated
with the inhibitors then exposed to the cAMP analogue for 5 min. There was
no observed effect on activation.

Long-term effects of observed increase in TH levels with continual NGF
exposure become apparent after 48 hr. When the inhibitors were added for
48 hr continually, significant decreases in TH and LDH levels are
observed. Cells treated for 24 hr with the drug and then 24 hr with a
washout medium (no drug) showed that MTA and EA selectively inhibited
methylation with no effect on protein synthesis. Ara-A and SIBA by
contrast significantly inhibited protein synthesis. The effects of MTA
were fully reversed after the 24 hr washout period whereas EA appeared to
be irreversible. Cells incubated with NGF + a drug/inhibitor for 24 hr
then with NGF alone for another 24 hr show that MTA and EA blocked
increases in TH activity levels induced by NGF, and SIBA was without
effect. The ability to form methyl esters was tested by incubating cells
in either 3 mM MTA or 10 &micro;M EA for 24 hrs and then pulsing with
[<sup>3</sup>H-methyl]methionine and then later examining for
<sup>3</sup>H-methyl esters (heat volatile cpm/10<sup>5</sup> cells):
methyl ester formation was decreased by 55%.
<p>
LDH levels were examined in cells treated with drugs using the same
protocol as used to test the capacity to block NGF activation. There was
no effect on LDH specific activity. In another experiment the long term
simultaneous exposure of cells to 8-Br-cAMP and the drugs was assessed
insofar as the effects on TH activity. With 8 Br-cAMP and either MTA or
EA, there was no difference in the overall increase in TH activity seen
than with 8-Br-cAMP alone. However, ara-A plus 8-Br-cAMP completely
inhibited the long-term activation difference caused by 8-Br-cAMP.

Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase from bovine adrenal medulla
<p class="Para1">
Polymerization is a problem during this purification
procedure. Particle-bound enzyme which has been solubilized by
chymotrypsin digestion has been successfully purified. The most critical
point of purification is removal of a low activity form eluted just after
the high activity form on a DEAE-Sephacel column.
<p>
<b>Assay procedure</b>. A 100 &micro;l total assay mixture contains in
order of addition: 20 &micro;l of 1 M Na acetate, pH 6.0, 10 &micro;l of 2 mg/ml
catalase (beef liver source, Boehringer), 10 &micro;l of 10 mM ferrous
ammonium sulfate, 40 &micro;l total of water and/or enzyme, 10 &micro;l of 10
&micro;M tetrahydropterin dissolved in either 5-100 mM HCl or 1 M
2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 &micro;l of 1 mM L-tyrosine. Tetrahydropterin stock
can be stored frozen in a dark tube; its concentration can be determined
from its A<sub>264</sub> using 18,500 M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> in 2
M HCl. Use of either the commercially available
(6-<i>RS</i>)-6-methyltetrahydropterin or the natural biopterin,
(6<i>R</i>)-<span class="small-caps">l</span>-<i>erythro</i>-
tetrahydropterin depends upon what studies are to be
done. When doing kinetic studies, use of natural compound is preferred.
Biopterin is synthesized from
<span class="small-caps">l</span>-rhamnose, reduced
by catalytic hydrogenation in 1 M HCl over PtO<sub>2</sub> catalyst to the
(6-<i>erythro</i>-tetrahydrobiopterin, and the natural 6R form is
separated from the 6S form by HPLC.
<p>
Blank reactions employ
<span class="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-tyrosine and
3-iodo-<span class="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine
instead of <span class="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine.
50 pmol of DOPA is added to another blank as a
standard. The reaction proceeds at 30&deg; for about 10 min and is stopped
with 300 &micro;l of 0.5 M perchloric acid, which has 50 pmol DOPA as an
internal standard. 200 &micro;l of 0.2 M EDTA and 300 &micro;l 1 M
K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> are added to adjust pH to 8.0-8.5, and
centrifugation at 1600 g for 10 min at 4&deg; is done. The clear supernatant
is passed through a double column (column #1 is 0.2 ml [0.5 x 12.5 cm]
Amberlite CG-50, type I 100-200 mesh washed by cycling of acid and sodium
forms with 2 M HCl and 2 M NaOH, then equilibrated in 0.4 M
KP<sub>i</sub>, pH 6.1; and column #2 is 100 mg alumina which has been
activated--boiled in 2 M HCl [1 liter/200 g] for 30 min in reflux
condenser and washed very extensively in water until all cloudiness is
gone and pH ~4-5--and oven-dried at 100&deg; for a couple hours). The effluent
is discarded from both columns, then both columns are washed in 1.5 ml
water. DOPA and alpha-methyl-DOPA generally pass through the Amberlite
column and adsorb to alumina. The alumina is detached from the upper
column and then washed with 1.5 ml water 2 times, then with 0.1 ml of 0.5
M HCl. With another 0.2 ml 0.5 M HCl, DOPA and alpha-methyl-DOPA elute.
The Amberlite does remove other catecholamines which can interfere with
the DOPA being analyzed on HPLC.
<p>
The alumina column eluate is injected directly onto an HPLC with
standard C<sub>18</sub> column and electrochemical detection system.
Mobile phase is 0.1 M KP<sub>i</sub>, pH 3.5, with 0.6 ml/min flow and

of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 0.32 M sucrose. Homogenate is
centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h and supernatant applied to 40 x 2.6 cm
DEAE Sephacel previously equilibrated in standard buffer + 0.05 M NaCl.
The standard buffer will be defined as 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 8% sucrose,
1 mM dithiothreitol. After washing the column (&gt; 1 liter), gradient
elution with 800 ml buffer from 50-300 mM NaCl is performed. The
<b>first</b>, sharply eluted fractions are collected and brought to 40%
saturation with AmSO<sub>4</sub>, which is centrifuged. The pellet is
resuspended and clarified before loading on to a 100 x 2.6 cm BioGel
A-1.5m gel filtration column. After collecting the active fractions, the
material is applied to 5 x 2.6 cm heparin-Sepharose, which is washed with
100 ml buffer + 0.1 M KCl, then 300 ml buffer + 0.1 M KCl, then eluted
with 200 ml linear gradient of 0.1 to 0.5 M KCl, where its purity should
be &gt;90%. The heparin pool is then concentrated with AmSO<sub>4</sub>
(60% saturation), dissolved in minimum buffer volume and applied to a
narrower 100 x 1.6 cm BioGel A-1.5m column.
<p>
This purification procedure may be similarly applied to the soluble TH
from other tissues: bovine brain (caudate nucleus), rat adrenal gland and
caudate nucleus, and human adrenal gland and brain (caudate + putamen).
Note that rat enzyme is particularly more soluble and aggregates less than
the bovine enzyme. The purified TH is stable at &minus;80&deg; for 2 months
when protein is &gt;50 &micro;g/ml. The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of the enzyme for
various substrates under different conditions is given in the table below.

Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase from rat adrenals
<p class="Para1">
This is a purification protocol. Two activity assay
methods are given. One makes use of a fluorimetric measurement of DOPA
formation, in which the alumina-purified product is reacted with
trihydroxyindole. However, if other catechols are present the method
cannot be used. An alternative is a radiochemical assay in which

<p>
The first assay method uses 100 &micro;l 0.5 M MES, pH 6.1, 100 &micro;l 1 mM
<span class="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine, 30 &micro;l of
3 mg/ml catalase (Boehringer), 5 &micro;l 0.2 M DTT, 5 &micro;l of
5 mM FeAmSO<sub>4</sub>,
25 &micro;l 20 mM 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-methyltetrahydropteridine,
and then a suitable volume of enzyme, final vol=0.5 ml. Before
adding enzyme, the reaction mixture is pre-incubated at 30&deg;
for 5 min, then the enzyme added. After 2
or 3 min, it is stopped with 0.5 ml 6% TCA. After centrifuging the
supernatant is transferred to another tube to which is added 0.1 ml 10%
EDTA, 0.4 ml 1 M Tris, and 0.1 ml 0.2 M <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide in that order. Final pH ~8.4. 60 mg of
acid-washed alumina is added quickly, since DOPA is not stable in alkaline
solution. After vortexing 15-20 s, the alumina is allowed to settle and
supntnt removed. After washing 2 x with 2 ml water, extraction with 1.6 ml
0.1 N HCl is done, mixing for 10-15 s on vortex, and the extract is
neutralized to pH 6.5 with 0.5 ml of 0.5 M
K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. 0.1 ml 0.25%
K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] is then added. After 3 min, 1.0 ml of
freshly prepared alkaline ascorbate solution (9 <i>N</i>
NaOH:2% ascorbic acid:ethylene diamine 9:1:0.2 (v/v/v) ) is added. After
10 min, fluorescence is measured with excitation of 360 nm and emission of
490 nm. Fluorescence is stable for 1 h. [Method using radioactive tyrosine
is given but not summarized here.]
<p>
Purification protocol describes use of 600 rat adrenal glands which are
extracted and centrifuged at very high speed. A 30-40% ammonium sulfate
cut is taken, the suspended pellet dialyzed, then run over an Ultrogel AcA
22 column. Pooled enzyme is adjusted to 0.3 mg.ml, and the pH brought down
to 5.8 with 0.1 M acetic acid. After 15 min, the acid-precipitable
material is centrifuged. The supernatant is again adjusted with acetic
acid down to 5.2, and the resulting precipitate collected and resuspended.
The enzyme is applied to a heparin-Sepharose column, washed with buffer
containing 0.1 M ammonium sulfate, then eluted with buffer containing 0.25
M ammonium sulfate. After dialysis of active pool, the enzyme is passed
over a phosphocellulose, which is then washed in buffer, and then buffer +
0.1 M NaCl. Elution is with 0.15 M ammonium sulfate + buffer.

Effect of dopamine on tyrosine hydroxylase in cultured
rat adrenal medulla
<p class="Para1">
Adrenal medullary explants were exposed to 1.0 mM DOPA
for 20 h and this resulted in a 67% decrease in TH activity as assessed in
tissue homogenates. <i>m</i>-Hydroxybenzylhydrazine blocked
aromatic amino acid decarboxlyase, which says this effect cannot be due to
DOPA itself. When 1.0 mM dopamine was used in the culture, TH activity
fell 49% in the same time period. 5 mM dopamine in the culture medium
resulted in a greater decrease of TH activity. The dopamine content was
6-fold higher in the tissue but norepinephrine did not increase. Direct
inhibition of dopamine is not the explanation since TH assays are done on
dialyzed homogenates (catecholamines are removed).

The multifunctional
Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase mediates
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells prelabeled with
<sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> and stimulated to increase
intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by treatment with K<sup>+</sup> (56 mM),
carbachol (100 &micro;M), or A23187 (10 &micro;M), all treatments for 5 min.
Direct activation of protein kinase C was achieved by treatment of cells
with TPA (1 &micro;M), or 1-oleyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) (200 &micro;M), a
diacylglycerol, for a treatment period of 5 min. Control and treated cell
extracts were run on SDS gels and phosphate incorporation into TH
determined from its band. In the presence of 2.4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, all
treatments increased incorporation an average of 1.5-fold. When 0.1 mM
EDTA was used instead of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, the calcium-dependent
incorporation was blocked (equal to untreated levels). In the presence of
the calcium channel blocker, 10 &micro;M nitrendipine, and 2.4 mM
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, potassium-depolarized cells showed less phosphate
incorporation than the controls, while carbachol-stimulated cells showed
slightly more phosphate content, but the conclusion is that the blocker
inhibited both. 1 &micro;M calmidazolium, a CaM antagonist, in the presence
of calcium had the same effect at inhibiting phosphorylation.
<p>
Labeled cells which were treated with K<sup>+</sup> or TPA and their
extracts subjected to 2 D electrophoresis, with the second dimension
analyzed on both 9% and 15% acrylamide. In controls can be found 2 major
and 3 minor phosphorylated forms of TH, which were verified on other gels
using immunoblotting. With treatment by TPA or K<sup>+</sup>, a shift in
the abundance of the spots can be seen as the more acidic species increase
in amount relative to the less acidic TH, an indication of
phosphorylation. The 2 D gel shows that TH and a dozen other proteins are
affected by both treatments. About 6 proteins were shown to become more
acidic by K<sup>+</sup> treatment but were unaffected by TPA, while 3
proteins were phosphorylated in response to TPA but not K<sup>+</sup>.
<p>
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated pathways can be direct, such a mediation
through PK-C or CaM kinase, or indirect, that is, by stimulating adenylate
cyclase which thereby activates PK-A. Specific kinases can be studied with
what is known about their biochemistry. PK-C can be desensitized or
down-regulated by prolonged incubation with phorbol esters, correlated
with the observation that turnover of PK-C is enhanced after translocation
to the membrane. PC12 cells treated in this way are viable for one week
with minimal morphological changes (not shown). Phorbol ester binding and
PK-C activity are shown to decrease in TPA-treated cells, but PK-A and CaM
kinase activities, measured in Na perchlorate cell extracts, do not fall
in response to TPA, and the activities do not change over the period of a
week of TPA treatment.
<p>
The CaM kinase was partially purified from control and TPA-treated
extracts to make sure it was the kinase previously described. It was found
that this kinase was totally dependent upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CaM, and
was inhibited by trifluoperazine and calmidazolium. The kinase was
associated with phosphorylation of 50- and 60-kDa subunits at "sites"
characteristic of the autophosphorylated rat brain kinase. Moreover, this
kinase demonstrated phosphorylation site specificity for MAP-2 identically
to the extensively characterized rat brain CaM kinase, as shown in V8
digests of phosphoMAP-2. After cells were desensitized for PK-C
(demonstrated by inability to increase TH phosphorylation in response to
either TPA or OAG), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry caused by K<sup>+</sup>
depolarization, by nicotine, or by A23187 ionophore caused increased TH
phosphorylation in these TPA-treated cells, thus leading to the conclusion
that Ca-activated pathways, other than through PK-C, cause increased TH
phosphorylation.
<p>
cAMP levels were measured to determine if Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was
affecting their levels. However, K<sup>+</sup> depolarization, nicotinic
stimulation, ionophore, or TPA significantly changed cAMP levels. Hence,
PK-A may be ruled out as the mediator induced by
Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
<p>
Purified PC12 cell TH was treated with purified kinases: PK-C, CaM
kinase, and PK-A. All kinases increased phosphorylation. Tryptic
phosphopeptides were generated and examined on 2-D TLC-cellulose. Previous
reports show that CaM kinase will incorporate 3.9 mol P/mol TH, while PK-A
and PK-C will incorporate only 1 mol P/mol TH, which have been reproduced
here. 2-D peptide mapping indicates that PK-A phosphorylates a single
site, peptide E, while PK-C produced two spots in peptide E and B. CaM
kinase phosphorylated five peptides, including E and B, with a strong
preference for peptide B.
<p>
The in vivo basal phosphorylation of TH was generally distributed over
6 phosphopeptides, with peptides E and F detectable only with long
exposure times. Peptide C, found in vivo, was not phosphorylated by any of
the kinases in vitro. Depolarization produced increased incorporation into
all peptides over the majority of 10 experiments, especially B, D, and E,
except none in C. TPA or OAG treatment produced the same pattern of
peptides as did PK-C in vitro incubation, indicating a consistent effect
for this kinase. Most of the incorporation was into peptide E, although B
was occasionally present.

Soluble tyrosine hydroxylase (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase)
from bovine adrenal medulla: large scale purification and physicochemical
properties
<p class="Para1">
[Much of the notes are verbatim taken from the report.]
<p class="Para1">
<b>Notes on method</b>. Glands are transported on ice
from slaughterhouse and the medulla dissected free. Portions of 50-100 g
tissue passed through stainless steel tissue press prior to homogenization
in 0.25 M sucrose (3 ml/g tissue) using Potter-Elvehjem type Teflon-glass
homogenizer. Ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h was followed by 20%
saturation with saturated AmSO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.0), then centrifugation
at 40,000 g for 15 min. Supernatant adjusted to 35% AmSO<sub>4</sub>
saturation, left for 1 h, then centrifuged. The pellets are stored at -80&deg;
or are resuspended in 0.5 L of 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM
2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10% (w/v) sucrose, called Buffer A,
diluted to 3 L with Buffer A, then mixed with 1200 mL DEAE-Sephacel
slurry, previously equilibrated. The slurry is packed in a 11.5 x 15 cm
column and washed with 3 bed vols. Elution is by linear gradient from 0 to
0.3 M NaCl, then stepped up to 0.5 M NaCl. Two activity peaks are eluted
with the second broad and containing a large amount of activity. The first
peak is collected and diluted with an equal volume of buffer A which
contains no PMSF or 2-mercaptoethanol, but instead contains 1 mM DTT and
16 &micro;M leupeptin (buffer B). This applied to a 2.5 x 18.5 cm
heparin-Sepharose column. 7 column volumes of buffer B adjusted to pH 8.3
and containing 0.1 M KCl are washed through, and the column is then
reequilibrated in buffer B. Elution is by linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.7
M KCl in buffer B.
<p>
Pooled fractions of activity are concentrated 5-fold (using Amicon
XM-100 membrane) and the concentrate is brought to 0.8 M with
AmSO<sub>4</sub>, and this is applied to a 1.6 x 15 cm L-tyrosine-agarose
column, equilibrated in buffer B containing 0.8 M AmSO<sub>4</sub>.
Elution is with buffer B containing 0.4 M AmSO<sub>4</sub> + 20% (w/v)
ethylene glycol. The peak fractions are concentrated to 5 ml, which is
then loaded on to Superose 6B (1.5 x 120 cm) equilibrated in 50 mM
KP<sub>i</sub>, pH 7.0, and 0.1 M KCl + 5% sucrose.
<p>
<b>Results</b>. Heterogeneity in TH is explained in part by different
isoforms resulting from expression of multiple mRNA species and by
variable contents of post-translationally modified (phosphorylated)
protein. The low phosphate form of TH was purified since it is reported to
be the most stable form. From DEAE-cellulose, the second large peak yields
a final product of low purity and specific activity. From 2.5 kg of
medulla we are able to obtain TH with 425,000 pmol DOPA/min/mg specific
activity (17.2 mg total protein, 4.5% yield). Significant purification is
achieved in heparin, AmSO�<sub>4,</sub> and DEAE steps, in that order,
with the tyrosine-agarose column actually providing a reverse purification
(apparently some activity falls off). The Superose column provided
additional significant purification. From the Superose column came a
single symmetrical peak with apparent M<sub>r</sub> 210,000. The
absorbance at 700 nm was measured with that at 280 nm, and both coincided.
The tyrosine agarose column was used to remove high MW proteins which
would have co-purified with the enzyme on the gel filtration column.
<p>
SDS-PAGE using either Coomassie BB or Ag staining showed homogeneity
with a subunit size of M<sub>r</sub> 60,000. IEF analysis showed a broad
range of activity in the pH range 5.5-6.0. The first 27 residues were
sequenced and showed homology with two of the forms in human
pheochromocytoma TH (89%) and rat TH (85%). The iron content of 0.66 &plusmn;
0.09 mol Fe/mol subunit was found by atomic absorption and X-ray
fluorescence spectrophotometry. Zinc was found as well to be 0.13 mol/mol
subunit. Phosphate was found to be present at 0.62 mol/mol subunit.
<p>
Enzyme activity in the presence of 2 mM bathophenanthroline sulfonate
or <i>o</i>-phenanthroline (Fe(II) chelators) inhibited TH
activity by &gt;95%. 4 mM Tiron (an Fe(III) chelator) and 4 mM
bathocuprine sulfonate (a structural analog) had no effect. Several
divalent metal ions inhibited TH with Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup>
being the more potent (IC<sub>50</sub> at 0.5 and 1.2 mM, resp.). The
light absorption spectrum was determined and a maximum at 280 nm was found
(Abs=1.04 at 1 mg/ml with a 1 cm light path). A shoulder at 420 nm is
observed, which is typical of Fe(III)-containing proteins. A broad band at
700 nm accounts for the blue-green color of concentrated solution of the
enzyme. With 2 M guanidine-HCl the absorption at 700 nm disappears.
Addition of 10 mM Na dithionite, a strong reducing agent, causes a more
slow disappearance. The light spectrum of TH was unaffected by 1 mM
tyrosine (substrate), 100 mM hydroxyurea (a free radical scavenger), or
aerobic addition of natural cofactor, BH<sub>4</sub>, (0.2 mM) or DTT (1
mM) at pH 7.0
<p>
The EPR spectra was assessed for the resting enzyme at 3.6 K and a
high-spin Fe(III) (S=5/2) is revealed from the spectrum. [The spectrum is
determined using a Varian E-9 system equipped with Oxford Instr helium
flow cryostat. Sample at 8 mg/ml (=133 &micro;M enzyme monomer) is placed in
phosphate buffer and magnetic field measurements are taken to assess the
<i>g</i> values. Spectra of enzyme in 1.0 mM L-tyrosine are
recorded as well. Spectral recording conditions: microwave frequency =
9.09 GHz, microwave power = 0.25 mW, modulation amplitude = 1.0 mT, time
constant = 1.0 s, and scan time = 8 min.] <i>G</i> values for
the axial type of EPR signal are 6.7-7.2, 5.3-4.7, and 2.0-1.9. The
theoretical <i>g</i> for the three lowest Kramers doublets of high-spin
Fe(III) show that the observed <i>g</i>
values correspond to the E/D values in the range 0.03-0.06, i.e.,

is used to derive the energy levels. The effective <i>g</i> values are obtained 
as 
<i>g</i><sub>eff</sub>=(<i>E</i><sub>2</sub>-<i>E</i><sub>1</sub>)/&beta;<i>H</i
>, where the difference in energy is the separation of energy in the particular 
Kramers doublet (see Petersson et <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta</i> <b>913</b>: 
228-237, 1987).]
<p>
The model also predicts a possible transition at <i>g</i> = 5.9 for the 
corresponding middle Kramers doublet, a feature more pronounced at higher 
microwave power. An asymmetric line shape and the width (13-16 mT at half 
height) of the low field peak at <i>g</i> = ~7 shows that the axial type of EPR 
signal originates from &gt;1 species. 1 mM tyrosine addition (a 15-fold excess) 
or 5 mM phenylalanine (100-fold excess) causes no significant change in the 
axial-type of EPR signal. However, addition of 10 mM dithionite (200-fold 
excess) caused disappearance of the signal, indicating a reduction of iron. No 
such reduction was observed with aerobic or anaerobic addition of the 
6-MPH<sub>4</sub> (200 &micro;M). A small contribution around <i>g</i> = 4.3 is 
indicative of high-spin Fe(III) in a ligand field of rhombic symmetry. Tyrosine 
addition increased the <i>g</i> = 4.3 signal and is accounted for by a minor 
decrease in the axial type of EPR signal. The rhombic type of signal is 
isotropic. Even if its amplitude is significant, it accounts for a small 
quantity of iron compared to the anisotropic axial type signal (see Slappendel 
et al, <i>BBA</i> <b>667</b>: 77, 1981). A small and variable contribution 
around <i>g</i> = 2 is observed and results from contaminating type II copper 
(found to be present at a maximum of 0.06 mol/mol subunit).
<p>
A correlation (plot of the difference between A<sub>700</sub> and
A<sub>800</sub> against the axial EPR-signal--the intensity as measured by
the area below the low-field peak at <i>g</i> = 7) can be
shown between the intensity of the blue-green color and the axial type of
EPR signal, and both were highly correlated to enzyme purity as well.
<p>
Fluorescence spectra were generated as well. An excitation maximum at
278 nm (emission wavelength at 335 nm) and an emission maximum at 335 nm
(excitation wavelength at 295 nm) is found; some fine structure is present
in the excitation spectra. The position of the exc maximum with its
half-width of 55 nm indicates at least two populations of Trp residues.
Some residues are not completely exposed to solvent and this is supported
by a red shift of the emission spectrum to 355 nm induced by guanidine
HCl. Addition of 1 mM natural cofactor, 10 mM L-Phe, or 0.1 mM L-Tyr did
not alter the fluorescence spectrum.
<p>
Previous reports show a high affinity of Phe hydroxylase to
phenyl-Sepharose when substrate-activated. TH will bind phenyl- or
octyl-Sepharose. Affinity to the gel increased as a function of ammonium
sulfate concentration, indicating that binding of TH to tyrosine is
dependent upon hydrophobic interaction. Binding is interfered with by
L-Phe or L-Tyr. In contrast, PAH binding was increased to hydrophobic
resins when amino acids were in fact included in the buffer. Elution of TH
from the tyrosine column was not possible with 2 mM tyrosine, 10 mM Phe,
or 1 mM BH<sub>4</sub> unless the AmSO<sub>4</sub> concentration was
reduced.
<p>
TH incubated in the presence of labeled ATP and PK-A was found to
incorporate 0.28 mol [<sup>32</sup>P]phosphate per monomer under our
conditions after 5 min. This rate was not affected by substrate or
cofactor presence, but was slightly inhibited by 0.22 mM dopamine and 0.25
mM norepinephrine. <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tetrahydrobiopterin was
reduced from 0.47 mM to 0.19 mM, and the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> was
unchanged.

Phosphorylation of bovine adrenal chromaffin cell tyrosine hydroxylase:
temporal correlation of acetylcholine's effect on site phosphorylation,
enzyme activation, and catecholamine synthesis
<p class="Para1">
Cultured chromaffin cells were preincubated with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>
and TH obtained by immunoprecipitation, the separated on SDS gels,
and gel slices digested with trypsin.  Tryptic
phosphopeptides were separated on HPLC, with 7 peptides recovered at 15,
25, 37, 39, 40, 42 and 44 min (0-15% MeCN over 50 min at 1.5 ml/min). If
the immunoprecipitation step was omitted, the recovery of radioactivity
was 3-4-fold higher. Rechromatography of the peptides on HPLC using a more
basic pH in the solvent did not produce more than one peak for each loaded
peptide. On 2-D thin layer electrophoresis/chromatography each peptide
migrated as a single spot, sufficient to say that each HPLC peak
corresponded to one peptide. The use of 2-D TLE/C alone did not provide
separation between peptide 5 and 6 of the HPLC peak. HPLC peak 3
corresponds to peptide C, while peaks 5 and 6 correspond to peptide E (see
Haycock et <i>al.</i>, 1982). Phosphoamino acid analysis on
each HPLC peak fraction indicates &gt;75% of radioactivity is P-Ser, with
none present as P-Thr or P-Tyr.
<p>
When cells were treated with acetylcholine (concentration sufficient to
stimulate CA secretion), either the immunoprecipitated TH or the
M<sub>r</sub> 60,000 band was trypsin-digested and separated on HPLC. The
<sup>32</sup>P content of peptides 3 to 7 increased, with phosphate
content of peptides 3, 5, and 6 increasing rapidly (a maximum reached in
10-15 s), maintaining for 2 min, then falling to baseline in 4 min.
Peptides 4 and 7 increased in <sup>32</sup>P gradually, reaching max in 4
min, gradually declining but still above basal levels after 16 min. (This
pattern observed in 5 experiments using 5 different chromaffin cell
preps.) No consistent effect was observed for peptides 1 and 2. Changes in
the cellular specific radioactivity of the gamma phosphate-labeled ATP
pool during stimulation and under basal conditions were measured: there
was no change in the basal cell pool (8.5 &plusmn; 0.7 nmol of ATP with specific
radioactivity of 1.6 &micro;Ci/nmol) while acetylcholine-treated pool was
slightly increased (7.1 &plusmn; 0.6 nmol ATP with spec. rad. of 1.8
&micro;Ci/nmol), but the stimulation could be attributed to secretion of
unlabeled ATP within the granule during release of CA. Cells that were
stimulated with 55 mM KCl produced identical results with acetylcholine
stimulation: causing an increase in peptide 3, 5, and 6 phosphate content.
This is important since it demonstrates that the plateau and decline of
phosphate in these TH sites is not due to cholinergic receptor
desensitization but rather membrane depolarization alone is sufficient to
induce the effect.
<p>
The calcium dependency of this process was assessed by incubating cells
with EGTA 10 min prior to stimulation. Removal of the extracellular
Ca<sup>2+</sup> prevented both the rapid incorporation of label into
peptide 3, 5, and 6, and the slower incorporation into peptides 4 and 7.
<p>
Measurement of TH activity was done to assess effect on it by
stimulation. Activity assays of 100,000 g supernatants of extracted
acetylcholine-treated cells revealed a time course of activation virtually
identical to that for the phosphorylation of peptides 3, 5, and 6.
Moreover, the activity declined in parallel with the loss of phosphate
content in these peptides, with nearly the same half-life of decay.
Comparison of this phosphorylation of TH to in situ dopamine synthesis was
done using L-[<sup>14</sup>C]-tyrosine addition at the same time that
cells were stimulated: it was remarkable to observe
<sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> evolution increasing in the same period as the
phosphorylation of peptides 3, 5, and 6. This enhanced rate of CA
synthesis however did not decline thought TH activity did. Rather, the
enhanced rate of synthesis was similar to the sustained elevation of
phosphorylation in peptides 4 and 7.
<p>
Cells were stimulated with 10 &micro;M forskolin, known to maximally
elevate cAMP in these cells, and the treatment caused a very different
result to appear in the HPLC peptides. Indeed only peptide peak 6 was
shown to increase its phosphorylation, with incorporation maximal within 1
min and remaining without decline for at least 8 min. The temporal
activation of TH correlated well with the forskolin-induced
phosphorylation observed.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>. The measurement of changes in ATP specific
radioactivity in chromaffin cells in basal and stimulated cells was
necessary to demonstrate that increases in labeled phosphate in TH protein
were the result of activated cellular processes and not merely because the
ATP specific radioactivity increased and thereby in situ TH labeling
increase was incidental to that process. The physiological significance of
a sustained enhanced dopamine synthesis correlated to similar continued
elevation of phosphate in peptides 4 and 7 may suggest that the modified
TH interacts with other compounds such as phospholipids or catecholamines
to enhance dopamine synthesis.
<p>
Comparison of the retention times of tryptic phosphopeptides in our
study with the results from previous studies in which TH was
phosphorylated by known protein kinases in vitro shows that peptides 1, 2,
4, and 7 are not known to be phosphorylated by any of the known kinases.
We have discounted the possibility that trypsin digestion conditions were
different (they were not) from those of previous studies or that species
or tissue differences were the problem since the study by George et <i>al.</i> used both TH and protein kinases from bovine
chromaffin cells.

Characterization of the catalytic domain of bovine
adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
INTRO. Prior work by Vigny &amp; Henry (1982) and
Kuczenski (1973) shows that limited trypsin digestion activates TH,
producing a 34 kDa fragment containing the activity. This fragment cannot
be activated by any phosphorylation, consistent with models (Grima et al,
1985; Ledley et al, 1985) showing that the N-terminal region contains the
phosphorylation sites and is the regulatory domain and
substrate-recognition region. Homology with other aromatic amino acid
hydroxylases shows a conservation of catalytic regions.
<p>
RESULTS. Bovine adrenal TH was isolated and digested with trypsin. The
34 kDa fragment containing catalytic activity was prepared on SDS-PAGE
gels. This fragment was shown to have catalytic activity on nondenaturing
gels, and was also immunoreactive on Westerns. N-terminal sequencing was
performed on the first 17 cycles. Comparisons to the rat sequence deduced
from cDNA shows that the first residue of the fragment starts with
position 158, consistent with the fact that position 157 is an Arg and
would be attacked by trypsin. This is also the first report of the protein
sequence from bovine TH. 80% identity can be found for the bovine and rat
sequences compared.

Rat sequence start with R-157. Bovine sequence
first two cycles (corresponding presumably to residues 158 and 159 in rat)
were not identifiable. The R-454 is not the bovine numbering but a rat
numbering assigned as the C-terminus of the fragment based upon the number
of amino acids it would take to generate a lost 5 kDa fragment at the
C-terminus.<br>
[The Saadat et al. and D'Mello et al. deduced cDNA sequences were not
known by the authors but are included for comparison. They both begin at
R-150, a 7-residue difference from the rat.]
<p>
Note the prediction of the site of cleavage at
the C-terminal end. Studies with trypsinolysis of PAH (Iwaki et al.,
<i>J. Biochem.</i> <b>261</b>: 2051, 1986) show that a
catalytically active region from PAH about 35 kDa is generated from a lost
11 kDa N-terminal fragment and a lost 5 kDa fragment. This 35 kDa fragment
aligns quite well with the TH 34 kDa fragment.
<p>
Native TH was assayed at pH 5.8 and the tryptic fragment of TH assayed
at pH 6.1. The tryptic fragment shows a lower <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for both
tyrosine (16 &micro;M) and cofactor (80 &micro;M) than does the native enzyme
(39 &micro;M for tyrosine and 290 &micro;M for cofactor). The <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
was also increased (appropriately). Similar results were reported by
Kuczenski long ago.

Bradykinin activates tyrosine hydroxylase in rat
pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase is
activated in PC-12 cells by bradykinin in a concentration-dependent manner
with maximal stimulation occurring at 1 &micro;M. This stimulatory effect
occurs within 15 s and is maximal at 5 min. This stimulation is due to an
increase in the affinity of tyrosine hydroxylase for its pterin cofactor,
and can be blocked by a specific bradykinin receptor antagonist. These
data indicate that bradykinin can regulate the activity of tyrosine
hydroxylase in PC-12 cells.

Resonance Raman studies on the blue-green-colored bovine
adrenal tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (tyrosine hydroxylase). Evidence that the
feedback inhibitors adrenaline and noradrenaline are coordinated to iron
<p class="Para1">
(Nearly all of the text of the notes is directly taken
from the text of the paper due to the complexity of the
physico-biochemical methods employed here.)
<p class="notes c133"><b>Note on method</b>. Raman spectra on purified
bovine adrenal TH were done with protein = 40 mg/ml (a distinctly
blue-green solution) in a 4 mm dia. spinning quartz cell held at 2-8&deg; by a
stream of cold N<sub>2</sub> with a Spectra Physics models 171 argon ion
and 375B dye lasers as excitation sources. Spectra were recorded in 2
cm<sup>-1</sup> steps at 10 s per step using a Spex Industries Model 1403
Spectrometer operating with a constant 5 cm<sup>-1</sup> band pass
interfaced with a Spex Datamate. Five-point averaging was done to smooth
some spectra. Resonance enhancement was determined by measuring the
intensity of the peaks with the intensity of the sulfate A<sub>1</sub>
stretch at 983 cm<sup>-1</sup> as a reference. Intensities were not
corrected for self-absorption and spectrometer response. EPR spectra of
the sample obtained at 4 K before and after the Raman spectroscopy were
similar (a Varian E-109 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument
ESR-10 continuous flow cryostat was used).
<p>
Extensively dialyzed TH exhibits visible absorption bands at 700 and
420 nm, both wavelengths with absorption coefficients of 1900 (M
iron)<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>. The blue-green color shows strong
correlation to the nearly axial high spin Fe(III) EPR signal in the enzyme
and the large absorption coefficient and presence of a high spin Fe(III)
center are consistent with assignment of a <i>d-d</i> transition and
suggest the absorption band arises from a
ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition (both previously reported).
Resonance Raman spectroscopy is useful in analyzing transitions of this
type in metalloproteins and in providing insight into the nature of the
ligand in the chromophore. With 605.2 nm excitation, resonance-enhanced
vibrational modes are observed at 454, 494, 527, 604, 635, 835, 1130,
1272, 1320, 1426, and 1476 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Measurement of intensities of
the enhanced modes above 1130 cm<sup>-1</sup>, namely shown for
1272 and 1476 cm<sup>-1</sup>, relative to the sulfate standard at 938
cm<sup>-1</sup>, show increases in intensity with increasing excitation
wavelengths (488 to 620 nm), matching the contour of the low energy band
and indicating that observed vibrations are coupled to the 700 nm band.
Tyrosine and cysteine coordination to metal centers has been examined for
resonance-enhanced vibrations. Metal-sulfur proteins such as iron-sulfur
and "blue" copper proteins give rise to spectra rich in features in the
metal-ligand region (300-800 cm<sup>-1</sup>) but are featureless
in the region of 1100-1700 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Metal-tyrosinate proteins
exhibit features typical of metal-ligand deformations, but also show peaks
due to internal ligand vibrations of 1170, 1280, 1500, and 1600
cm<sup>-1</sup> associated with the phenolate ring modes. These modes are
observed in transferrins, several non-heme dioxygenases, and purple acid
phosphatases. With exception of the 1280 cm<sup>-1</sup> feature, which
corresponds to the C-O stretch which can vary as much as 30
cm<sup>-1</sup>, the other modes deviate only in a small way. The TH Raman
spectra is similar to, but somewhat distinct from, the spectra of
metal-tyrosinate proteins. The 1600 cm<sup>-1</sup> mode is not observed,
and the 1500 cm<sup>-1</sup> band is shifted to 1476
cm<sup>-1</sup>, and there are extra bands at 1320 and 1426
cm<sup>-1</sup>.
<p>
Comparison with iron-catecholate complexes shows these high energy
features at 1271, 1320, and 1476 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to
catechol complexes, obtained at long wavelength excitation, such as: 1)
the <i>E</i>S complexes of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase and
protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (in this case, the Tyr vibrations can be
distinguished from the catecholate vibrational modes by choosing an
excitation wavelength not in resonance with the tyrosinate charge-transfer
band or deuterating the catechol); 2) the catechol complex of Phe
hydroxylase 3) synthetic catecholate complexes. Hence, high spin Fe(III)
would appear to be coordinated by catechol. Of interest is the 527
cm<sup>-1</sup>, observed in spectra in which both oxygens are coordinated
to the metal and not in monodentate catecholate complexes. A 528
cm<sup>-1</sup> feature had been previously assigned to the
chelate mode in the deformation of five-membered rings in
[Fe(oxalate)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>. Similar wavenumbers in this region
have been assigned to iron containing mixed ligands which include
catechols in which the configuration was said to be bidentate.
<p>
TH was treated in 8 M urea and the blue-green color disappeared. This
was then dialyzed in 0.01 M acetic acid to remove metal and urea. In the
presence of 5% (v/v) thioglycolic acid or 5% (v/v) phenol, acid hydrolysis
of the protein did not show significant amounts of DOPA or other
catechols, whereas large amounts of tryptophan could be recovered (the
antioxidants prevent the breakdown of Trp during hydrolysis). When TH in 8
M urea was precipitated with 10% (v/v) perchloric acid, the released
soluble material exhibited a UV-fluorescence maximum at 320 nm with
excitation at 280 nm, characteristic of a catechol in acid solution.
Cation-exchange and reversed-phase HPLC analysis using either fluorescence
or UV detection revealed presence of norepinephrine and epinephrine.
Quantitative analyses revealed 0.11 mol NEpi and 0.25 mol Epi per mol
enzyme subunit. The ratio of NEpi/Epi of 0.43 is similar to that found in
chromaffin cell extracts.
<p>
Raman spectra for synthetic inorganic complexes of
Fe[N-(2-pyridylmethyl)iminodiacetate] complexed with epinephrine and
catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) show similar vibration features with some
differences in the number of and intensity with each of the peaks between
the plain catechol complex and the epinephrine complex. The spectral data
on the catechol Fe(PDA) complex closely agrees with the features of Phe
hydroxylase while the adrenaline Fe(PDA) complex has features seen in TH.
<p>
Recovery of substoichiometric amounts of catecholamines in TH
preparations (0.36:1), together with analyzed iron content of 0.7 mol
iron/mol subunit suggests that TH exists in three populations of the
apoenzyme, TH, and blue-green TH-catecholamine complex. Precise
quantitations of the three populations is difficult since it requires
substantial amounts of enzyme.
<p>
Studies of iron-phenolate and iron-catecholate complexes show a
correlation between energies of the charge-transfer transitions and the
Lewis acidities of the Fe(III) centers, which aids in identification of
the amino acids used to coordinate the metal to the protein. Spectra on a
series of Fe(III)-catecholate complexes with tripodal ligands of varying
Lewis basicities were taken, and the energies of the two catecholate to
Fe(III) charge-transfer bands were found to depend upon the nature of the
iron environment, which was blue-shifted as the Lewis basicity of the
tetradentate ligand increased. Progressive replacement of the neutral
histidine-like ligand by carboxylate results in a systematic shift of the
absorption maxima to shorter wavelengths (see Cox et al, <i>JACS</i>
<b>110</b>: 2026, 1988). From the table showing
the UV spectra with synthetic ligands designed to mimic carboxylic acid
amino acids and the imidazole on histidine, complexed with the presence of
either catechol or adrenaline, it can be inferred that the spectrum of TH
is consistent with the presence of one or two COO<sup>-</sup> groups and
two or three neutral ligands (such as those in His imidazole). Similar
conclusions have already been made for soybean lipoxygenase and rat liver
phenylalanine hydroxylase, and recent extended x-ray absorption fine
structure studies on soybean lipoxygenase suggest the presence of 3-5 His
and 1 or 2 COO<sup>-</sup> coordinated to the Fe center.
<p>
It is noteworthy that His at 113, 192, 247, 317, 331, and 336 are all
conserved in rat and bovine PAH and TH, where the last 3 His are in the
most highly conserved region of the COOH-terminal portion. It must be kept
in mind that two of the ligand coordination sites in the iron sphere are
available to catechols, and oxygen may bind to one such site.
<p>
More than 20 years ago it was proposed that catechols achieved
inhibition of TH most likely through a mechanism of complexing with the
iron center. This is now shown. A working model for catecholamines in the
function of TH is now proposed, partly based on the mechanistic studies
done with PAH:
<p>
Prereduction of the Fe(III) form to Fe(II) is necessary and is achieved
by tetrahydropterins in PAH (6-methyltetrahydropterin with
<i>E</i><sub><i>m</i>,7</sub> = +160 mV).
Catecholamines bind strongly to Fe(III) to generate the blue-green
chromophore and an EPR species with <i>g</i><sub>max</sub> ~7.
As adrenal TH has a high affinity for catecholamines, it is likely that
a substantial amount is inactive and not reduced by 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>.
Others have evidence that Fe(III) is not reduced by 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> if
CAs are present prior to cofactor addition. Reduction by dithionite of
CA-bound TH is the only way to eliminate the blue-green color and the EPR
signal.

Cholinergic regulation of protein phosphorylation in
bovine adrenal chromaffin cells
<p class="Para1">
Chromaffin cells were cultured on collagen-coated dishes.
Extracts of cells were solubilized in 1% SDS and run on SDS gels and
immunoblotted with antibodies to various proteins known phosphorylated in
chromaffin cells. Antibodies to a 100 kDa and 87 kDa proteins plus to
protein III were used against 3 panels of extract proteins with increasing
total protein loaded in lanes: the intensity of the immunostain is
observed to increase. A standard curve of immunostain intensity vs. known
amount of specific protein can be constructed and used to estimate the
amount of the 4 proteins (100 kDa, 87 kDa, and proteins IIIa and IIIb) in
terms of &micro;g/mg total protein and likewise the # molecules/cell (with MW
of each protein known and assuming 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mg protein). The
table of these calculations for 4 d old cultured cells shows that the
following data: 100 kDa, 2.4 &micro;g/mg prot, 1.4 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>; 87 kDa,
0.9 &micro;g/mg prot, 0.62 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>; Protein IIIa, 0.16 &micro;g/mg

10<sup>6</sup>.
<p>
Cells were prelabeled with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>
and then stimulated with 100 &micro;M acetylcholine for 1 min.
SDS-solubilized extracts run on gels show that label is incorporated into
two proteins of M<sub>r</sub> &#8776; 60,000 and &#8776; 100,000. In rare cases, a
96 kDa protein also incorporated label. Immunoprecipitation with anti-100
kDa, -87 kDa, and protein III shows that phosphorylation was enhanced by
acetylcholine stimulation in all three.
<p>
The ACh-induced 60 kDa protein phosphorylation had been described by
Amy &amp; Kirshner (<i>J. Neurochem</i>. <b>36</b>:
847, 1981) and had been identified as TH (Meligeni et al, Haycock et al,
Haycock et al, all 1982). The protein with M<sub>r</sub> = 100,000 is also
the 100 kDa protein described by Amy and Kirshner. It is possible to
estimate the phosphate incorporated from immunolabeling (although not all
the protein is immunoprecipitated). Anti-100 kDa antibody coincides with
the <sup>32</sup>P spot of M<sub>r</sub> =100,000 on 2D gels and
SDS-PAGE. Also the purified 100 kDa protein is phosphorylated only on Thr
residues in vitro by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent protein kinase III;
phosphoamino acid analysis of the M<sub>r</sub> =100,000 region shows that
both P-Ser and P-Thr, but ACh treatment enhances only P-Thr.
<p>
The chromaffin cell 87 kDa and protein III cross react to antibodies of
87 kDa and protein III purified from different sources and obtained in
this lab. Other similarities include <i>S. aureus</i> V8
protease partial digests of protein kinase C-treated 87 kDa from the
purified source and of 87 kDa protein from ACh-treated chromaffin cells:
both show the same M<sub>r</sub>=13,000 phosphopeptide on SDS-PAGE.
Purified protein III phosphorylated by PK-A and V8 digested shows
phosphopeptide bands at M<sub>r</sub> = 18,000 (major) and at 9,000
(minor). Protein IIIa and IIIb from ACh-treated chromaffin cells shows
this digest pattern just the same.
<p>
Nicotine (50 &micro;M, 2 min), veratridine (150 &micro;M, 2 min), high K (40
mM, 2 min), and A23187 (10 &micro;M, 10 min) all show the same
phosphorylation patterns in P-incubated chromaffin cells for the five
proteins studied (TH, 100 kDa, 87 kDa, and Proteins IIIa and IIIb) as does
ACh treatment (100 &micro;M, 2 min). Muscarine (100 &micro;M, 2 min) showed no
significantly enhanced phosphorylation. The fact that nicotine enhances
this phosphorylation shows that nicotinic cholinergic receptors are
involved. The action of veratridine, K, and A23187 suggests that there is
a Ca-dependence.
<p>
Indeed the Ca dependence was indicated by the use of EGTA both before
and after ACh treatment. If added before ACh treatment, EGTA prevents
phosphorylation in all proteins. If EGTA is added 1 min after ACh
treatment, it could reverse the phosphorylation of 100 kDa, 87 kDa, and
Protein III, but not of TH. CA release was similarly affected, whether
EGTA is added before or slightly after.
<p>
Chromaffin cells treated with 1 &micro;M PDBu for 10 min increased
phosphorylation of TH, 87 kDa, and protein III, but did not affect 100 kDa
protein. 10 &micro;M forskolin for 10 min increased phosphorylation of TH,
100 kDa, and protein III, but not 87 kDa. 1 &micro;M PMA and 10 &micro;M
dioctanoylglycerol produced similar effect as PMA; 1 &micro;M
4&alpha;-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (a phorbol ester known to be
without effect) had no effect on phosphorylation.
<p>
DISCUSSION. The common thread in the ACh-enhanced phosphorylation of
the specific proteins observed here is that intracellular Ca increases
caused by action of ACh lead to activation of an array of different
protein kinases: Ca/CaM kinase III is known to phosphorylate 100 kDa
protein; PK-C phosphorylates 87 kDa protein; Ca/CaM kinase I
phosphorylates Protein III.
<p>
The 100 kDa protein has been recently shown to be elongation factor 2
(EF-2).

Cloning of quail tyrosine hydroxylase: amino acid
homology with other hydroxylases discloses functional domains
<p class="Para1">
3-week old quails were decapitated and the adrenals
removed. Total RNA was prepared from which poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA was
obtained by oligo-(dT) cellulose chromatography. cDNAs were synthesized
and size-selected for &gt;500 bp on 5-20% sucrose gradients. Transformed
<i>E. coli</i> were screened with a rat TH cDNA probe using
low stringency, and 9000 positives were found. After 2 additional rounds,
three positive were obtained and analyzed. Restriction mapping indicated
that the 3 clones overlapped. The longest fragment of 750 bp was sequenced
and shown to have an open reading frame of 228 nt with 75.4% homology with
rat nucleic acid sequence. Since this could have been the full length of
the protein, the Gubler and Hoffman method for preparing full-length
messages in &lambda;gt10 vectors was performed. Without amplification,
100,000 phage were directly plated and high stringency screening gave 2
positives. That the insert in the lambda vectors made TH was confirmed by
antibody screeining using TH antiserum: a &beta;-galactoside hybrid
protein was expressed and induced using
the bacterial expression vectors pEX 1-3 after cloning into the
<i>Pst</i>I site, and the extracts were run on gels and immunoblotted.
<p>
The lambda vector (&lambda; QTH<sub>3</sub>) was
found to have an insert of 2077 bp. Sequencing revealed a 74% homology in
the open reading frame when compared with both human and rat clones. The
deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein of 491 aa, with molecular
mass of 56 kDa and calculated isoelectric point of 6.69. Introducing a
single gap in the sequence for optimal alignment with human TH form 1, a
77% homology is revealed with both mammalian sequences. The striking
differences between the sequences is the fact that quail TH has 11 Cys
residues while there is only 7 in the mammalian sequences.
<p>
Alignment with phenyalanine hydroxylase was done as well in view of the
similarity of PH with TH. With select gaps being introduced in both quail
TH and the human and rat PH sequences, the greatest coincidence occurs
between amino acids 63 and 491. The greatest homology is between 262 and
393 (the G region), with the surrounding domains being less conserved. The
greatest divergence is in the N-terminal region, with &lt;25% homology in
this area.

Predicted amino acid sequence of bovine tyrosine
hydroxylase and its similarity to tyrosine hydroxylases from other species
<p class="Para1">
An independent determination of the bovine TH sequence
(see above).
<p>
Bovine adrenal medulla cDNA was prepared into the <i>Pst</i>I site of
pBR322. After transformation of <i>E. coli</i> MC1061 with recombinants,
positives were screened for with rat TH
cDNA pTH-51. Recovery of inserts from recombinants were restriction mapped
and strategies developed for sequencing in M13mp18 or mp19. Sequencing was
performed using M13 clones in which a universal 17-base primer or
TH-specific primers. The large fragment of <i>E. coli</i> DNA
polymerase I (Klenow?) was used to extend primers with the dideoxy-chain
termination method.
<p>
Of 11 cDNAs obtained, 7 were sized on gels. The largest, B1, was ~1700
bp and was used for sequencing. B1 was found to be incomplete, with the 5'
end missing, but the smaller B7 (~1000 bp) was found to contain the rest
of a sequence producing the necessary open reading frame. The rest of the
7 were all contained within that structure shown for B1 but were
confirmatory nonetheless. The first ATG initiator codon is preceded by the
consensus CACC and is consistent with the Kozak translational initiation
site of eukaryotes. Moreover, the predicted amino acid sequence starting
from the first ATG shows considerable homology to rat TH. The 491 amino
acids predicts a MW of 55,011, less than the 59,000 estimated on SDS gels.
<p>
Of interest are the phosphorylation sites: Ser-8, Ser-19, and Ser-40
are present and within the same consensus sequences shown for rat. Ser-153
is not present in bovine, being substituted with Ala. Present in both rat
and bovine TH is an RLVS sequence which may be phosphorylated by PK-A. In
quail TH, position 153 is taken by Ala, while and RRLS sequence is present
at position 199.
<p>
We divide TH into 8 regions (A-H), as according to Fauquet et <i>al.</i>
for the rat TH. Region G (amino acids 262-400 in rat,
255-393 in bovine) shows the greatest identity with 95% between rat and
bovine and 92% between bovine and quail. The very least similarity is in
the N-terminus: region C (positions 59-96 in rat and 59-89 in bovine)
shows 46% and E (117-165 in rat and 110-158 in bovine) shows 61%.
<p>
Of interest is a <q>deletion gap</q> of seven amino acids in region C
missing in bovine but present in rat. Chou &amp; Fasman secondary
structural analysis and Kyte &amp; Doolittle hydrophobicity plots indicate
that bovine region C possesses extended hydrophilic character, while in
rat the hydrophilic nature is brief and immediately followed by a region
of hydrophobic character with a high probability for an extended alpha
helix. A suggestion is made here that rat TH may partition more easily
with cell organellar membranes, making it more likely to associate with
secretory vesicles.

Isolation and nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone
encoding bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase: comparative analysis of
tyrosine hydroxylase gene products
<p class="Para1">
Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA from bovine adrenal medulla was
prepared as cDNA by Gubler and Hoffman method (1983) and inserted into
lambda gt10. 450,000 independent plaques were obtained and 70,000 were
screened with a 300 bp probe corresponding to 3' end of rat PC-12 TH mRNA
(7000 plaques per 150 mm plate). 36 positives were obtained and 32 of
these were additionally purified. Analysis of the inserts of the 32 showed
a cDNA length ranging from 0.5 to 3 kb by EcoRI restriction digestion.
Southern analyses indicated that all but one of the 32 clones gave
positive signals when hybridized to radiolabeled rat TH cDNA probe. Both
plaque screening and Southern analysis indicate strong cross-species
homology.
<p>
Nine independent clones of varying sizes were all sequenced. One clone,
lambda bTH<sub>1-5</sub>, is ~1.8 kb long and found by sequencing to be
1722 bp long with 14 bp 5' noncoding region with an open reading frame of
1473 bp and a 209 bp 3'-uncoded region. 8 smaller cDNA clones were found
to subsequently confirm the sequences of lambda
bTH<sub>1-5</sub>. The only variation in sequence identity was in
the three residues upstream of the polyadenylation site: 5'-CAT-3'. In
other clones this sequence varied as 5'-CATC-3' and 5'-CATCCTTG-3'. This
heterogeneity may result from strain differences, allelic variants, unique
RNA processing, or perhaps a cloning artifact. The sequence was compared
by computer analysis to rat and human TH sequences previously reported,
and a high level of sequence identity is observed. cDNA prepared from
lambda bTH<sub>1-5</sub> and from rat TH were used as probes of
poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA from bovine medulla: both cDNA revealed a single
mRNA species of ~1.8 kb.
<p>
Sequence homology comparison of bovine, rat, and human using the
GENALIGN program indicate bovine TH shares 79% and 84% nucleotide identity
with the coding regions of the rat and human TH cDNAs, resp. Virtually no
identity was found in the untranslated regions, and the lengths of the
uncoded regions were also dissimilar. As for amino acid identity, bovine
TH shows 85% and 84% sequence conservation with rat and human, resp. The
bovine molecule is shortened 7 and 6 amino acids relative to rat and
human, resp, with all of the absent residues corresponding to the
alanine-rich region in the N-terminus (positions 51-68) present in rat and
human. The Ser-153 in rat is substituted for Ala in the cow, which may be
significant.
<p>
The differences in size suggested by nucleotide sequences of the rat
and bovine TH mRNAs extended to a Northern analysis of the species mRNAs
using the rat cDNA as probe. The bovine TH mRNA was estimated to be 100 nt
smaller than the rat. No size differences were found with TH mRNAs from
rat adrenal medulla or substantia nigra, and there was no hybridizing band
in rat striatal RNA, used as a negative control. Adrenal medulla tissue
was extracted and run on SDS gels and the extract proteins transferred to
nitrocellulose, followed by immunoblotting with antisera to rat PC12 TH:
Bovine TH had an apparent MW of 54,300 whereas the rat was slightly larger
at <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 56,200, in close agreement with values
of protein molecular weight predicted by nucleotide sequences. The results
were identical with antiserum to bovine TH as well. Since the Northern and
Western analyses are consistent with predictions possible from nt sequence
analysis, these differences are natural and the sequence data is not a
cloning artifact.
<p>
Sequence homology of TH from several species to the catalytically
functionally similar phenylalanine hydroxylase is well established. It has
been suggested that other enzymes in the catecholamine biosynthetic
pathway all derive from a common ancestral gene to form members of a
multigene family. Comparison of the bovine TH sequence at both the
nucleotide and amino acid levels with phenylethanolamine
<i>N</i>-methyltransferase (which converts norepinephrine to
epinephrine) show absolutely no homology. It appears unlikely that the
enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway evolved to their present form in a
manner coordinated by duplication of a single gene.

Structure of the human tyrosine hydroxylase gene:
alternative splicing from a single gene accounts for generation of four
mRNA types
<p class="Para1">
Human TH type 4 cDNA was used to screen a human genomic
library provided by Maniatis. From 10<sup>6</sup> recombinant phages, 1
positive was isolated (gHTH-1). Southern analysis of the DNA using the 5'
and 3'-fragments as probes indicated the insert was missing the 5' end of
the TH gene. A library composed of 20 kb long EcoRI fragments was also
constructed since it is known that the 5' end of TH gene is on such a
fragent. From 100,000 recombinants, 1 clone (gHTH-E20) was obtained.
<p>
Following isolation of the clones, complete sequencing was done.
Exon/intron boundaries could be fully delineated from comparison with the
cDNA to find the genomic coding regions. Consensus donor and acceptor
splice sites are apparent. The transcriptional start site is assumed to be
29 bp upstream of the ATG start codon because (1) cDNA nucleotide
sequences isolated by others so far match this region, (2) the canonical
TATA box (TTATAA) is observed 26 bp upstream of the putative initiation
site, (3) Grima et <i>al.</i> used the primer extension method
to indicate a transcriptional start around 30 bp upstream.
<p>
It is known that the four types of human TH result from alternative
splicing of the pre-mRNA. Two modes are possible: one is the alternative
use of two donor sites within an exon, which is true for the 12
nucleotides at the 3' end of exon 1 included to make type 2 or 4 as
opposed to type 1 or 3, resp. The other mode involves the
inclusion/exclusion of an entire exon. Expression of type 1,2 or 3,4 mRNA
is determined by inclusion of exon 2 of the gene altogether.
<p>
Computer-assisted analysis of the secondary structure of the primary
transcript predicts the formation of four stable hairpin-loops in introns
1 and 2. Within intron 1 is structure A, with a free energy
(&Delta;<i>G</i>) of formation of the complement -48.3 kcal/mol.
Within intron 2 two hairpin-loops structures B anc C, with free
energies of -26.0 and -38.8 kcal/mol, resp. A sequence in intron 1 also
complements with a sequence within intron 2 to form a stable structure
(-37.1 kcal/mol), structure D. Formation of structures A through C may
facilitate inclusion of exon 2 since this juxtaposes exons 1 and 2 as well
as exons 2 and 3. Formation of structure D, necessarily not allowing
formation of structure A since part of the sequence is common to both,
would join exon 1 to 3, causing exclusion of exon 2.
<p>
Tissue distribution of the mRNA types has been done by
Grima et <i>al.</i> using S1 protection studies.  Adrenal medulla and
pheochromocytoma express types 1, 2, and 3, and certain parts of the brain
express only types 1 and 2. These tissues may express trans-acting factors
which stabilize or assist in the formation of stable hairpin-loop
structures.
<p>
The reason alternative splice sites may arise in processing of primary
transcripts largely depends upon secondary structure alternatives. It has
already been shown that hairpin-loop structures inserted into primary
transcripts results in this splicing.
<p>
Transcriptional control of TH gene may result from inducible factors
present variously in tissues. Lewis et al have just shown that cAMP can
induce transcriptional activation of the 5'-flanking region of the TH
gene. Human and rat TH 5'-flanking region comparison shows 70% identity
and many conserved blocks. The CCCCCGCCTC sequence in 9 of 10 bases is
conserved with the SP-1 transcription factor binding sequence.

Multiple human tyrosine hydroxylase enzymes, generated
through alternative splicing, have different specific activities in
<i>Xenopus</i> oocytes
<p class="Para1">
cDNAs corresponding to all 4 human TH forms were obtained
from lambda <i>gt</i>10 librarry previously and inserted into
<i>Eco</i>RI-digested pSPT18, which contains the SP6 promoter
for in vitro transcription of mRNAs. Transcription was actually done on
plasmids linearized with <i>Pvu</i>I and which were filled
with T4 polymerase (to prevent noncovalent recircularization). Inclusion
of GTP and m7GpppG during transcription ensured capping of the mRNA. The
transcripts contain untranslated region on the 5' end from both vector and
human TH mRNA. 50 ng of mRNA in 50 nl water was then injected into
<i>X. laevis</i> mature oocytes and the oocytes immediately
incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine over the next 2 d. Oocytes were
extracted with TX-100-containing buffers in order to preserve TH activity
for assay.
<p>
When each mRNA is injected, recovery of active TH is seen with each.
All activity is well above the basal. Immunoprecipitates of extracts using
specific anti-rat TH are run on SDS gels and autoradiographed, with HTH-1
and -2 showing labeled polypeptides of 62.3 kDa, and HTH-3 and -4 showing
67.6 kDa bands. The antibody was at a titer (1:100) which was sufficiently
saturating for all forms. The relative abundance of each form can be
assessed by direct densitometric analysis of the autorad since each form
has the same number of Met residues and the specific radioactivity of the
[<sup>35</sup>S]Met was identical for the incubations. This relative
abundance can be compared to the activity results to yield a relative
specific activity, which is expressed as a % of HTH-1 specific activity:
HTH-1, 100%; HTH-2, 34.8%; HTH-3, 58.0%; HTH-4, 59.2%. Hence, HTH-1 is the
most active form, followed by HTH-3 and HTH-4, and then HTH-2.
<p>
In vitro translation of the HTH mRNAs in reticulocyte lysates was done
to compare the oocyte translation products. A higher resolution SDS-PAGE
here made it possible to resolve HTH-1 and -2, and to demonstrate the
presence of a lower MW minor band as well for each form. This band may be
the result of translational start at an internal and in-frame AUG codon
downstream of the true AUG start site for TH; this AUG codon is also
flanked by a Kozak consensus sequence. It is noteworthy that this AUG
codon is present in quail and bovine TH mRNA but not in rat.

Characterization of rat and human tyrosine hydroxylase
genes: functional expression of both promoters in neuronal and

<p class="Para1">
Denatured ds DNA was used as a template for
primer-extended sequencing. RNA was isolated and purified with olgio-dT.
Anti-sense oligos complimentary to rTH exon 1
(5'-dGCCAAGCAGGCCGAGGCTGTCACG) or exon 2 (5'-dCAAGGTTCATCGGACGGC) were
annealed to poly(A<sup>+</sup>)RNA taken from rat PC12 cells, and
then primer-extended. Plasmids used include the somatostatin promoter
linked to CAT reporter (pD(-71)cat); the RSV promoter linked to luciferase
gene (pRSVL) and only the luciferase gene (pSVOAL).
<p>
In comparing the 5'-flanking regions of rTH and hTH genes, rat and
human TH promoter regions show 74% identity from the start codon to -380
bp, at which point the identity falls off. No CCAAT, Sp1, or Ap1 binding
sites can be found in the promoter region. An Ap2 site is present in rTH
at position -125 bp, with hTH having 80% identity with this sequence. Both
genes have CRE in the same position relative to the start site (at -46
bp). Human TH promoter has &lt;65% identity to rat TH promoter at sites
proposed to regulate expression by glucocorticoid (-471 to -453) and by
EGF (-93 to -80 and -30 to -17). Although it has been shown that
glucocorticoid response elements are within introns, introns of rTH and
hTH show no obvious candidates showing the essential motif of
&#8209;dTGTCCT&#8209; or &#8209;dTGTTCT&#8209;.
<p>
Using the rat pheo cell line, PCG2 to test the capability of rTH and
hTH 5' flanking regions to function as promoters in neuron-like cells,
prTHluc and phTHluc were transfected and shown to produce luciferase
activities which were 8.8 and 11.1% of control levels, resp. Constructions
in which either TH promoter were in the opposite orientation to the
reporter gene were inactive.
<p>
The rTH and hTH promoters were tested for their ability to function in
non-neuronal cells. Luciferase activity in extracts of rat NIH 3T3 cells
transfected with prTHluc averaged 8.6%. Human promoter showed activities
of 1.7%. 3T3 cells transfected with the neuroendocrine-specific promoter
somatostatin linked to CAT reporter produced enzyme activity of 127% and
118% of the control pRSVcat.
<p>
Alternative splice sites in hTH intron 1 generate multiple mature TH
mRNA species. Sequencing of the rat and human intron 1 region show no
significant homologies and only 51% identity. Four alternative hTH mRNA
species are found in derivatives of chromaffin tissue such as
pheochromocytomas. As such, mRNA from PC12 cells derived from this tissue
was used in primer extension analyses to whether different rTH messages
were potentially present, using an oligo complimentary to rat exon 2. A
147 bp product accounting for exon 1 and and 5'-untranslated region was
obtained, with no higher MW species.

Inactivation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by
ascorbate in vitro and in rat PC12 cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase activity
is reversibly modulated by the actions of a number of protein kinases and
phosphoprotein phosphatases. A previous report from this laboratory showed
that low-molecular-weight substances present in striatal extracts lead to
an irreversible loss of tyrosine hydroxylase activity under cyclic
AMP-dependent phosphorylation conditions. We report here that ascorbate is
one agent that inactivates striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity with an
EC<sub>50</sub> of 5.9 &micro;M under phosphorylating conditions. Much higher
concentrations (100 mM) fail to inactivate the enzyme under
nonphosphorylating conditions. Isoascorbate (EC<sub>50</sub>, 11 &micro;M) and
dehydroascorbate (EC<sub>50</sub>, 970 &micro;M) also inactivated tyrosine hydroxylase
under phosphorylating but not under nonphosphorylating conditions. In
contrast, ascorbate sulfate was inactive under phosphorylating conditions
at concentrations up to 100 mM. Since the reduced compounds generate
several reactive species in the presence of oxygen, the possible
protecting effects of catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were
examined. None of these three enzymes, however, afforded any protection
against inactivation. We also examined the effects of ascorbate and its
congeners on the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase purified to near
homogeneity from a rat pheochromocytoma. This purified enzyme was also
inactivated by the same agents that inactivated the impure corpus striatal
enzyme. Under conditions in which ascorbate almost completely abolished
enzyme activity, we found no indication for significant proteolysis of the
purified enzyme as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. We also found that pretreatment of PC12 cells in culture
for 4 h with 1 mM ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, or isoascorbate (but not
ascorbate sulfate) also decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity
25-50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels in rat
pheochromocytoma PC12 cells by cell-cell contact
<p class="Para1">
In these experiments PC12 cells are grown to highest
densities in uncoated plastic, but replated at high or low densities on
poly-<span class="c1">d,l</span>-ornithine-coated dishes. PC12 cells
adhere better to poly-Orn. PC12 cells are generally present as small
aggregates 4 h after replating at low density (20,000 /cm<sup>2</sup>).
These cells were not tightly associated but spread on the culture dish,
resulting in a lower extent of cell-cell contact. High density (500,000
cm<sup>-2</sup>) cultures had extensive cell-cell contact and formed large
number cell aggregates.
<p>
TH activity was assessed and low density cultures show a 95% decrease
in specific activity 4 h after replating.. After 28 hr, restoration of TH
activity was 3.6-fold higher than the 4 hr time point but never increased
above that even after 3 days in culture. Cells replated at high density
also experienced a drop in TH specific activity but only by 45% as a
minimum within the first 20 h. After that time point, activity steadily
recovered to pre-plating levels by the 3rd day of culture. At the 3rd
culture day, there was a 6-fold difference in TH specific activity between
the high- and low-density cultures.
<p>
The changes in TH specific activity of high-density PC12 cell cultures
could be altered by gene expression inhibitors. The inhibitors
cycloheximide (CHI) (? mg/ml) or &alpha;-amanitin (?
mg/ml) were added 4 h after replating and change in total protein and TH
spec. activity monitored at 24 h (for untreated only) and 72 h (for
treated and untreated). There was no difference in total protein for
untreated cells at the 24 and 72 h points, although TH spec. activity had
doubled (essentially recovered). The CHI-treated had showed a total
protein and TH spec. act. both of which were ~55% of 72 h untreated
controls. The &alpha;-amanitin-treated cells also had
lower total and specific proteins, only ~45% of controls. Treated cells
were still viable according to trypan blue exclusion but were more rounded
in morphology than untreated cells. This experiment indicated the need for
de novo transcription and translation in the recovery of TH activity in
high-density cultures. These experiments also demonstrate a turnover rate
for TH of about 3 d, much slower than a turnover rate fo ~2 hr in freshly
replated low-density cells.
<p>
PC12 total RNA was prepared on a Northern blot and TH cDNA from pTH-51
rat TH coding region used as a probe. A band ~1.9 kb was shown to
hybridize, a little above the 18S rRNA marker. Quantitative determinations
(using densitometric analysis of autorads; calibrated by loading with
different &micro;g RNA) showed that low-density cultures had 78% lower TH
mRNA levels 20 h after replating and mRNA levels remained consistently low
even after 3 d in culture. High-density cultures showed a decrease in
message at 4 h, the decrease smaller than for low density cultures
(mirrored in TH activity analyses). At 28 h replating message was
increased to its maximal level and remained constant until day 3. mRNA
levels were 5-fold greater in high- than low-density cultures. Increases
in mRNA always preceded increases in TH specific activity by about 1 day.

Role of the N-terminus of rat pheochromocytoma tyrosine
hydroxylase in the regulation of the enzyme's activity
<p class="Para1">
Trypsin digestion of TH leading to its activation is
reexamined. 0.5 mg/ml purified from rat pheo tumors was incubated with
trypsin (trypsin:TH 1:100 w/w) over a time course and the reaction stopped
with trypsin inhibitor prior to immediate activity assay and SDS PAGE. A
maximal near-3-fold activation is observed after 10 min, with activation
near half-maximal anyway by the first min. A progression of four bands is
seen during the limited digestion: bands at 62, 60, 58, and 56 kDa, of
which the 62 kDa is gone by the 1st min, and the 56 kDa being the only one
present after 10 min.
<p>
Purified TH was phosphorylated when it was incubated with labeled ATP
under phosphorylating conditions. Presumably endogenous kinases are
present in order to effect this phosphorylation. The labeled TH is then
subjected to limited tryptic digestion and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Autorads
show that the 62, 60, and 58 kDa species are labeled while the 56 kDa
species is not. Since Ser-8, -31, and -40 are the phosphorylated residues,
the 56 kDa species must be lacking the N-terminal region which includes
removal of at least the first 40 amino acids.
<p>
Polyclonal and monoclonal (2/40/15 MAb) antibodies to TH were available
for Western analysis of the many species. The polyclonal reacted with the
62 and 60 kDa species while the MAb only reacted with the undigested TH,
suggesting that the amino acids absent in the 60 kDa fragment contained
the MAb immunoreactive epitope.
<p>
TH digested for 30 sec was loaded onto a 1 ml heparin-Ultrogel column
and the 60 kDa fragment was eluted with 0.20 M KCl. Microsequencing was
performed but revealed the presence of 3 different proteins: (i) a
residual amount of full-length 62 kDa protein, (ii) a protein starting
with Gly, corresponding to Gly<sup>13</sup> of TH, and (iii) a
protein starting with Ala, corresponding to Ala<sup>17</sup> of TH,
missing the first 16 amino acids. We now show that the first 16 amino
acids of TH are essential for recognition by the 2/40/15 MAb.

Molecular cloning of cDNA coding for brain-specific
14-3-3 protein, a protein kinase-dependent activator of tyrosine and
tryptophan hydroxylases
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The 14-3-3 protein is a
family of acidic proteins present exclusively in the brain and is believed
to have a function in monoamine biosynthesis because of its ability to
activate tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase in the presence
of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II. In this study, we
resolved bovine brain 14-3-3 protein into seven polypeptide components by
means of reversed-phase chromatography and determined the amino acid
sequence of one of these components (eta chain) by cloning its cDNA from a
bovine cerebellum cDNA library. The eta-chain mRNA is 1.8 kilobases long
and encodes a polypeptide of 246 amino acids and
<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 28,221. Computer-assisted analysis of the sequence
indicates that the eta chain exhibits no internal sequence repeats, nor
does it have significant sequence similarity to other proteins with known
amino acid sequence. However, the eta chain appears to consist of two
structural regions that are distinguishable in their clearly different
charge characteristics: the almost neutral amino-terminal region and the
strongly acidic carboxyl-terminal region. The structural features of the
eta chain and the domain organization of tyrosine and tryptophan
hydroxylases suggest that the 14-3-3 protein binds to the regulatory
domain of the phosphorylated hydroxylases through its acidic
carboxyl-terminal region and activates the hydroxylases by inducing an
active conformation.

Both synaptic and antidromic stimulation of neurons in
the rat superior cervical ganglion acutely increase tyrosine hydroxylase
activity
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Electrical stimulation of the
preganglionic cervical sympathetic trunk produces an acute increase in the
rate of DOPA synthesis in the rat superior cervical ganglion. The present
study was designed to test the possibility that this acute transsynaptic
stimulation of catechol biosynthesis could be, at least in part, a
consequence of an increase in the firing rate of the postganglionic
sympathetic neurons. For this purpose, the effect of stimulation in vitro
of the preganglionic cervical sympathetic trunk was compared to that of
stimulation of the predominantly postganglionic internal and external
carotid nerves. Stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk at 10 Hz for
30 min produced a 4.6-fold increase in DOPA synthesis, while simultaneous
stimulation of the two postganglionic trunks produced a 3.1-fold increase.
The internal carotid nerve is known to contain a small population of
preganglionic fibers that synapse on principal neurons in the ganglion
before entering this nerve trunk. To eliminate the possibility that the
effect of stimulation of the internal carotid nerve is mediated by
synaptic stimulation via these preganglionic "through fibers", the effect
of stimulation of previously decentralized ganglia was examined. While
decentralization reduced the magnitude of the effect of stimulation of the
internal and external carotid nerves, a 2.0-fold increase in DOPA
synthesis was still seen. In addition, when these nerve trunks were
stimulated in control ganglia that had been maintained in organ culture
for 48 h to allow time for the degeneration of afferent nerve terminals,
DOPA synthesis increased 4.1-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide activate tyrosine hydroxylase
in sympathetic nerve endings
<p class="Para1">
100-200 g Sprague-Dawley males are killed by cervical dislocation to
obtain submaxillary glands or by decapitation to obtain irises or pineal
glands.  After dissecting out these end organs, the submax. glands are
cut perpendicularly and bonded together to form several slices in a single
unit.  Irises were taken medial to the ciliary body.
<p>
Most of the mass of noradrenergic neurons is in the cell body rather than
in the terminals of innervated end organs, and it is not surprising that
TH has a higher specific activity in peripheral ganglia.  Acute
regulation in the end organ is determined using an <i>in situ</i> assay
previously employed for SCG, in which DOPA is allowed to accumulate
in the ganglia while treated with brocresine (the DOPA decarboxylase
inhibitor).  Assay sensitivity is increased using a high efficiency
amperometric electrochemical system for DOPA.
For activity in the iris or slice of submaxillary gland, increases
in DOPA were found to be linear for at least 25 min with brocresine
present.  For the submaxillary slice, measurements of tissue and medium
were performed:  increases were largely in the slice for 15 min, which
plateaued, and then increases in the medium overtook the slice.  DOPA
formed in the tissues then diffuses out in the medium.
<p>
The inhibitor &alpha;-methyl-<i>p</i>-tyrosine was found to completely
inhibit DOPA formation in both iris and submaxillary gland.  The DOPA
that accumulates in the standard reaction of each tissue sample appears
stable.  DOPA in the irises was not significantly changed after 10 min
or more when &alpha;MT was used to block production; this was so with
or without secretin treatment.  The fact that DOPA did not accumulate
with &alpha;MT inhibition and that DOPA did not degrade with downstream
inhbition by brocresine treatment further validates this assay method.
<p>
The SCG was also removed bilaterally 2 d before assaying DOPA accumulation,
and that and the NE content in the iris and submaxillary gland were
reduced by 96%.  Immunohistochemistry reveals that TH is found in a
dense meshwork of fibers in the iris, and that removing the ganglia
reduces this immunoreactivity.  Hence DOPA accumulates in these tissues
at the axon terminal regions of sympathetic neurons which originate
in or pass through SCG.
<p>
TH activity was also measured in vitro in homogenates of iris and pineal gland.
with subsaturating 6MPH<sub>4</sub> cofactor.  Results of the <i>in situ</i>
DOPA-accumulating assay were compared to this <i>in vitro</i> homogenate
assay, and for pineal gland, the homogenate assay appeared to be a
better measure.  Results of the submaxillary gland homogenate assay gave a
nonlinear time course.  Ganglionectomy affecting the pineal gland caused
a 22% loss in DOPA accumulation, but a &gt;99% loss in NE content,
and TH in homogenates showed an 85% loss in activity, indicating that
DOPA in pineal gland accumulates other than by preganglionic stimulation.
<p>
Secretin and VIP stimulate DOPA synthesis in intact iris by 4-fold maximally,
according to the <i>in situ</i> assay.  Secretin, with EC<sub>50</sub>
at 30 nM, was more potent than VIP (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1 &micro;M).
At 10 &micro;M, secretin stimulated the iris 2.7-fold, VIP 2.1-fold.
Secretin also had a 4-fold maximal effect on submaxillary glands,
with EC<sub>50</sub> 100 nM;  VIP at 10 &micro;M stimulated 1.5-fold
(aprotinin is added to these assays to inhibit kallikrein protease).
The reason for the lower potency of the peptides for submaxillary gland
could be the result of incomplete inhibition of kallikrein (despite
500 KIU/ml aprotinin), or failure to inhibit another protease that
degrades the peptides.  Alternatively, there could be a difference in
receptor affinity and effect as well for the different tissues.
<p>
Peptide histidine isoleucine amide (PHI) was incubated at 10 &micro;M
and was found to increase DOPA synthesis in submaxillary slices by
1.7-fold.  N-terminal amidated fragment of human growth hormone releasing
factor (hGRF[1-29]NH<sub>2</sub>) at 10 &micro;M  had no effect on DOPA
synthesis.  Note that PHI is colocalized with VIP on the same rat cDNA and
in brain tissue.  The effect of PHI and absence of effect on hGRF shows the
specificity of peptidergic stimulation.
<p>
Secretin produced a 2-fold maximal stimulation of TH activity in homogenates
of pineal gland, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 20 nM.  VIP stimulated
1.4- and 1.8-fold at 10 and 30 &micro;M, resp.
<p>
Because VIP causes release of several substances from nerve terminals,
the effect of VIP on TH activation could be indirect as a result of
the release of an stimulating substance.  In all cases of VIP-induced
release, there is a dependence on calcium.

Site-specific phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase
after KCl depolarization and nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>TH activation.</b> TH activity from 13000 x g
supernatant extracts of PC12 which had been treated with 56 mM KCl or 50
ng/ml NGF was measured, with KCl depolarization showing 2.09- and
3.58-fold increase in activity when assayed at 1 and 0.1 mM
MPH<sub>4</sub>, resp. (Control values= 2.28 and 0.48 nmol DOPA/min/mg
protein. NGF enhanced spec. activity 1.49- and 1.39-fold at respective
MPH<sub>4</sub> concentrations.
<p>
<b>TH phosphorylation and phosphopeptide analysis.</b> PC12 cells are
pre-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> and then treated with KCl or
NGF, lysed, run on SDS-PAGE, with autoradiographs revealing increased
incorporation into a 60 kd band in the treated vs. the controls. Bands
excised were exhaustively trypsinized and analyzed on HPLC, with 5 peaks
(C1 @ 20', C2 @ 23', H25 @ 25', E @ 29', A1 @ 37') and H25 being the most
phosphorylated relative to the others, especially in the NGF-treated TH.
<p>
Identification of the phosphopeptides was done using known kinases in
vitro. PK-A phosphorylation produced phosphopeptides A1 and A2 (A2 @ 40'),
which are alternate tryptic cleavage sites; CaM MPK phosphorylation yields
A1, A2, and C1, C2, indicating A1/A2 contains the Ser-19 peptide, with E
peptide also being found. Partially purified PDPK phosphorylation shows
greatest incorporation into peptide E (Ser-8). Similar maps had been
generated with pTH precipitated with MAb to rat pheochromocytoma TH.
<p>
<b>Identification of H25 peptide.</b> Phosphoamino acid analysis shows
Ser is amino acid which is phosphorylated. Edman sequencing shows
radioactivity at the 7th cycle. Gas phase sequencing did not allow
conclusive results since more than one peptide was found. Synthesis of
peptides corresponding to tryptic fragments (TH<sup>2-12</sup>,
TH<sup>25-33,</sup> and TH<sup>152-160</sup>), followed by phosphorylation
by PDPK then HPLC would allow identification. TH<sup>2-12</sup> was
eliminated from consideration since it was known to correspond to peptide
E. TH<sup>23-38</sup> peptide was phosphorylated by PDPK, trypsinized,
then run on HPLC and did co-migrate with peak H25. The peak was verified
by amino acid analysis. TH<sup>152-163</sup> was not phosphorylated.

Tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA in the neurons of the
tuberoinfundibular region and zona incerta examined after gonadal steroid
hormone treatment
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The dopamine-producing
neurons of the tuberoinfundibular region are known targets of estrogen and
progesterone, and are of considerable neuroendocrine importance. To
determine the anatomical distribution, and number of cells that contain
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA in the tuberoinfundibular region and other
regions of the brain we carried out in situ hybridization on sections
prepared from ovariectomized female rats given either oil vehicle, or
estrogen, or estrogen plus progesterone. The intensity of label per cell
was assessed to compare the relative amount of mRNA found per cell among
TH-mRNA containing cells. [3H]cRNA probes to the rat TH sequence were
used. Autoradiograms demonstrated the presence of TH-mRNA in the cytoplasm
of cells in the arcuate and periventricular nuclei, zona incerta,
substantia nigra, and the adrenal medulla. The number and anatomical
distribution of cells that contained TH-mRNA was identical to the number
and distribution of cells previously demonstrated by others to contain TH
immunoreactivity. In the arcuate and periventricular nuclei, compared to
treatment with estrogen alone, estrogen plus progesterone did lead to a
statistically significant decrease in the number of TH mRNA-containing
cells we could detect. No alteration in the mean number of grains per
cell, among cells detected as containing TH-mRNA was found in any group.
In contrast, these same hormone treatments had no effect on the number
TH-mRNa producing cells we could detect in the zona incerta. Most of the
cells in the zona incerta are found within the same tissue sections as
arcuate/periventricular cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

In vitro phosphorylation of bovine adrenal chromaffin
cell tyrosine hydroxylase by endogenous protein kinases
<p class="Para1">
<b>Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of TH.</b>
Several proteins--a 60 kd band most prominent, were phosphorylated
when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to 100,000 &times; <i>g</i> chromaffin
cell extract supntnts.
Immunoprecipitation revealed only a 60 kd band. The phosphorylation
was time- and temperature-dependent, required Mg<sup>2+</sup>
as well, and was maximal with &micro;M concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
<p>
Addition of cAMP or PK-A C subunit also demonstrated increased
phosphorylation. Use of Walsh inhibitor protein abolished this effect, but
did not alter the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced effect.  cGMP was tried as well,
but produced no phosphorylation, contrary to the suggestion by Roskoski
and Roskoski (1987).
<p>
<b>Involvement of phosphoprotein phosphatases.</b> Supernatant proteins
were label phosphorylated, gel filtered, and TH dephosphorylation
examined. At 37 C, only 25% of total <sup>32</sup>P remained in the
protein after 5 min, leveling off immediately. The same was true if
Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not work by
inhibiting phosphatases. 25 mM NaF inhibited dephosphorylation
effectively, while 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> effectively accelerated it to
completeness within 10 min.
<p>
<b>Other modulator effects.</b> Since trifluoperazine completely
inhibited activation of TH by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, either CaM kinase or PK-C
must be involved. Addition of CaM or phosphatidylserine, however, did not
enhance <sup>32</sup>P incorporation, perhaps suggesting that these
modulators are already at saturating levels. DEAE chromatography to remove
lipids and CaM, followed by addition of either CaM or PS, did show
increased phosphorylation, but not when Ca<sup>2+</sup> or the modulators
alone were added. This suggests both a PK-C pathway and a CaM pathway. In
the presence of 200 &micro;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM was half-maximal at 0.29
&micro;M and maximal at 1.16 &micro;M. (At maximal CaM, EC<sub>50</sub> for
Ca<sup>2+</sup> was 10 &micro;M.) 100 &micro;g/ml PS was required for maximal
phosphorylation while as little a 5 &micro;g/ml showed detectable levels. If
DAG was used, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement was at submicromolar
quantities (compared to 50 &micro;M for maximal concentrations of PS).
<p>
<b>Site analysis.</b> TH phosphorylated by added cAMP and
Ca<sup>2+</sup> was trypsinized and peptides isolated on HPLC. cAMP
treatment elicited a peptide at 42 min (present also under basal
conditions), as did addition of PS/Ca<sup>2+</sup> (PK-C stimulation).
Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM addition showed three peaks including the 42 min
peptide, as well as two @ 37' and 40'. Ca<sup>2+</sup> produced
the same three peptides. Re-chromatography of ea. peak in a pH 6.5 TEAP
system shows that all peaks eluting at 42' in TFA also co-eluted in TEAP.
These peptides were compared to the in situ phosphorylated peptides
reported previously.
<p>
<b>TH activation.</b> Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition resulted in a 2.5-fold
increase in activation of TH in the chromaffin cell extracts which was
dependent upon Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP. cAMP addition resulted in a
3.4-fold activity increase, which was effectively blocked by inhibitor
protein to PK-A. Combined addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP produced
additive effects with respect to phosphorylation and activation
(5.7-fold). With DEAE fractionated material, cAMP produced both
phosphorylation and activation in parallel, but neither
Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PtdSer nor Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM produced activation
although they induced phosphorylation. Addition of cAMP to these
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated fractions did not enhance activity compared to
cAMP.

Evidence for the Formation of the 4a-Carbinolamine During The
Tyrosine-Dependent Oxidation of Tetrahydrobiopterin by Rat Liver
Phenylalanine Hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
PAH combines with BH<sub>4</sub>, oxygen, and phenylalanine to form
a quaternary complex.  A hypothetical 4a-hydroperoxide-tetrahydrobioptern
intermediate has been suggested.  Phenylalanine is hydroxylated,
and the intermediate 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin is formed.
This is released from the enzyme with dehydration spontaneous to
form quinoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH<sub>2</sub>), which can isomerize
to form 7,8-BH<sub>2</sub> or eliminate the side chain to form
a lactoyl aldehyde and 7,8-dihydropterin (PH<sub>2</sub>).
Near UV spectra were taken of BH<sub>4</sub>, the carbinolamine,
and the 7,8-dihydropteridines.
<p>
In 20 mM potassium phosphate at pH 8.2  BH<sub>4</sub> has a broad
maximum centered at 297 nm (&epsilon;=10,200
M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>), with a broader shoulder
at 255 nm (&epsilon;=4,900 M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>).
The carbinolamine has peak at 246 nm (&epsilon;=19,600
M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>), and broad smaller peak
at 285 nm (&epsilon;=8,500 M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>).
qBH<sub>2</sub> has two very broad peaks at 255 nm (&epsilon;=6,500
M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and 301 nm (&epsilon;=8,700
M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>), with a shoulder at
370 nm (&epsilon;=3,700 M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>).
A composite spectrum of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin and 7,8-dihydropterin
is presented, with maxima at 278 nm (&epsilon;=9,800
M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and 325 nm (&epsilon;=5,000
<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>).  The BH<sub>4</sub>
and 7,8-dihydropteridine spectra compare well with previously published
spectra.  Spectra of qBH<sub>2</sub> can only be extrapolated because
of its instability;  its spectrum is similar but not identical to
spectra for quinonoid 6-methyldihydropterin and quinonoid-6,6-dihydropterin.
The 255 nm peak of qBH<sub>2</sub> is red-shifted by about 10 nm relative
to peaks for the synthetic pteridines.
<p>
Scans were collected over time after adding BH<sub>4</sub> to a reaction
mixture.  Initially the spectrum looks like BH<sub>4</sub>, with a maximum
at 297 nm.  Over the next half-minute, the 297 nm peak starts to disappear

with an extinction twice that of what it had.
<p>
These initial spectra are a composite of BH<sub>4</sub> and carbinolamine
absorbances.  The emergence of a 278 nm peak reflects conversion of
phenylalanine to tyrosine.  The rise at 246 nm is the strong contribution
of carbinolamine.  Absence of a significant absorbance at 340 nm shows

Tyrosine hydroxylase content of residual striatal
dopamine nerve terminals following 6-hydroxydopamine administration: a
flow cytometric study
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Fluorescence-activated cell
sorting based on immunolabeling with a monoclonal antibody to tyrosine
hydroxylase and a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody was used to
identify striatal synaptosomes derived from nigrostriatal dopamine nerve
terminals. The amount of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in
dopaminergic striatal synaptosomes prepared from control rats was compared
to the amount in dopaminergic synaptosomes prepared from rats that had
received intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine. Although the
absolute number of dopaminergic synaptosomes was decreased in lesioned
animals, those residual dopamine terminals present contained more tyrosine
hydroxylase than did dopamine terminals from control rats. Both the
decrease in the absolute number of dopamine terminals and the increase in
tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in residual terminals were
proportional to the extent of the lesion, as determined by measurement of
striatal dopamine levels. These results suggest that an increase in the
amount of tyrosine hydroxylase protein in residual terminals may represent
one compensatory mechanism by which residual dopamine neurons maintain
normal striatal function after partial destruction of the nigrostriatal
dopamine projection.

Identification of protein phosphatase 2A as the major
tyrosine hydroxylase phosphatase in adrenal medulla and corpus striatum:
evidence from the effects of okadaic acid
<p class="Para1">
Cytosolic bovine adrenal TH was purified and treated with
PK-A or CaM-MPK. After brief tryptic digestion and TCA precipitation,
wherein &gt;90% of the <sup>32</sup>P radioactivity is soluble, the
phosphopeptides are analyzed for phosphoamino acids (TLE at pH 1.9),
indicating only P-Ser is present, and also separated on HPLC, wherein one
labeled peak at 15% MeCN is eluted for PK-A-treated TH and one major at
13% MeCN and one minor at the peak for PK-A are eluted for the
CaM-MPK-treated TH. Edman sequencing shows the lone peptide from PK-A/TH
was RQSLIEDAR, while that of the major peptide from CaM-MPK/TH was
AVSELDAK, corresponding to TH residues 38-46 and 17-24 from the deduced
bovine sequence. Although the bovine adrenal TH sequence shown by Edman
sequencing differs from the rat pheochromocytoma TH sequence only slightly
(also shown by Edman analysis from Campbell et al, 1986; rat pheo sequence
for Ser-19 peptide is AVSEQDAK while Ser-40 peptide is RESLIEDAR), both TH
subunits from the different species are phosphorylated in the same manner
by the protein kinases.
<p>
Four major types of serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases
account for all phosphatase activity in a variety of mammalian tissues.
Type 1 and 2A are active in absence of divalent cations and can be
inhibited with either 0.2 &micro;M inhibitor-1 or inhibitor-2 (for type 1
phosphatases) or 2 nM okadaic acid (for type 2A phosphatases although
micromolar okadaic acid inhibits both type 1 as well as type 2A
effectively). Type 2B protein phosphatase is Ca<sup>2+</sup> and
calmodulin-dependent and is inhibited naturally by EGTA or
trifluoperazine. Type 2C phosphatases are Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and
insensitive to okadaic acid. Extracts of bovine adrenal medulla or the
cortex were incubated with phosphorylase in the presence of EGTA and no
added divalent cations (to eliminate the effect of type 2B and 2C
activity) and additions of either inhibitor-2 or okadaic acid revealed
that type 2A phosphatases were present 10:1 over type 1. This ratio is
6-fold greater than in rabbit corpus striatum and 40-fold greater than in
bovine skeletal muscle extracts were type 1 phosphatases predominate.
Since nearly all of the phosphatase activity in the extracts of medulla
and cortex were abolished in the presence of inhibitor-2 and okadaic acid,
all of the phosphatase activity in these tissues is attributable to type 1
and 2A phosphatases. The finding that nearly all of the phosphatase
activity failed to bind heparin-Sepharose and that the phosphorylase alpha
subunit was dephosphorylated more rapidly than beta subunit further
supports the evidence that type 2A is in high proportion.
<p>
TH labeled with <sup>32</sup>P was used instead of labeled
phosphorylase as a substrate in extracts containing EGTA and no divalent
ions and variously inhibited with either inhibitor-2 or okadaic acid. The
results show that nearly all of the inhibition was by okadaic acid while
inhibitor-2 had no effect on dephosphorylation in extracts from medulla,
cortex, and rabbit adrenal and corpus striatum. Purified catalytic
subunits of type 1 showed this weak dephosphorylation action on TH, which
could be completely abolished by inhibitor-1 or -2, indicating no type 2A
contamination was present. Type 1 had a 40-fold higher phosphorylase
phosphatase/TH phosphatase activity than did type 2A. Measurements of
okadaic acid doses show that extracts of medulla and basal ganglion
diluted 1:300 to produce a phosphorylase phosphatase activity &lt;0.1
mU/ml required 0.1 nM okadaic acid to inhibit phosphorylase
dephosphorylation 50% and 0.2 nM to inhibit TH dephosphorylation.
<p>
Some type 2C phosphatase activity is present in medulla, cortex, and
corpus striatum, since 5 &micro;M okadaic acid (inhibiting type 1 and 2A)
added to increasing concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> restored phosphatase
activity. However it is unlikely that type 2C contributes significantly
since at optimal [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]=20 mM, type 2A is still 3.6-fold
greater in the medulla and 6-fold greater in corpus striatum than type 2C.
And a physiological free Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 1 mM makes type
2C 11% and 7% of total phosphatase activity in these tissues, resp.
Presence of BH<sub>4</sub> at 100-300 &micro;M had no effect on the
phosphatase activity.
<p>
Although the TH dephosphorylation study was done using PK-A
phosphorylated TH, the results on dephosphorylation by the type of
phosphatases shown is no different for the CaM-MPK phosphorylated TH. Note
that the type 2A phosphatase cDNA from bovine adrenal cortex is known and
the deduced enzyme structure differs in only one position from the rabbit
skeletal muscle 2Aalpha isoform.
<p>
Okadaic acid added to intact adipocytes and hepatocytes has been shown
to alter carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as would be expected. Cultured
chromaffin cells were incubated in 1 &micro;M okadaic acid and total protein
phosphorylation was found to increase 2.7-fold and TH-specific
phosphorylation (shown by densitometric scanning of the 60 kDa band on SDS
gels) was found to increase 3.1-fold. TH activity was determined to
increase 1.8-fold at pH 7.0 while TH activity at pH 6.0 was not changed.
Okadaic acid added directly to the assay had no effect on activity. Since
the unphosphorylated enzyme has a pH optimum of 6.0 while the
phosphorylated enzyme has an optimum at a higher pH, this suggests that
okadaic acid had direct effects on inhibition of dephosphorylation of TH.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in protein kinase
C-deficient PC12 cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: In order to study the role of
protein kinase C in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation
in PC12 cells, the effects of various agonists on diacylglycerol
accumulation in PC12 cells were measured and the ability of these agonists
to increase the phosphorylation tyrosine hydroxylase in protein kinase
C-deficient cells was evaluated. Bradykinin (10 &micro;M) and elevated
extracellular K+ (55 mM) increased the accumulation of [3H]diacylglycerol
in PC12 cells that had been prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid, and so
might be expected to activate protein kinase C in these cells; in
contrast, nerve growth factor did not increase diacylglycerol accumulation
in PC12 cells. Protein kinase C-deficient PC12 cells were prepared by
incubating the cells for 24 h with 1 &micro;M phorbol dibutyrate. This
treatment resulted in the loss of approximately 90% of the protein kinase
C activity in the cells. Control and protein kinase C-deficient cells were
incubated with 32Pi for 90 min and then stimulated with various agonists.
32P-labeled tyrosine hydroxylase was isolated from the cells by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to tryptic hydrolysis.
32P-containing phosphopeptides were separated by two-dimensional
thin-layer electrophoresis and chromatography, visualized by
autoradiography, and quantitated by scintillation counting Treatment of
control cells with phorbol dibutyrate increased the incorporation of 32P
into one tryptic phosphopeptide (referred to as T3) in tyrosine
hydroxylase. Phorbol dibutyrate did not increase the phosphorylation of
this peptide in protein kinase C-deficient cells. Bradykinin or 55 mM K+
increased the incorporation of 32P into four tyrosine hydroxylase
phosphopeptides, including peptide T3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Preganglionic nerve stimulation increases mRNA levels for
tyrosine hydroxylase in the rat superior cervical ganglion
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Increased synaptic
stimulation of sympathetic neurons in vivo causes a delayed increase in
the activity and the amount of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). To determine
whether these changes result from an increase in the messenger RNA for TH,
the rat preganglionic cervical sympathetic trunk was electrically
stimulated unilaterally for 90 min, and 48 h later RNA was extracted from
stimulated and contralateral control superior cervical ganglia. Northern
blots probed with a cDNA for TH demonstrated that nerve stimulation
produced about a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of TH mRNA in the
ganglion. These results indicate that synaptic stimulation leads to an
increase in TH mRNA, either by increasing the rate of transcription of the
TH gene or by increasing the stability of its mRNA.

Isolation and structural characterization of the bovine
tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: A bovine tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) cDNA probe was used to screen a charon 30 genomic library. Screening
of approximately 1 million recombinant phage resulted in the
identification of one clone, lambda B1, containing the entire bovine TH
gene. Results derived from restriction endonuclease mapping and sequence
analysis reveal that the bovine gene contains 13 exons spanning
approximately 7 kb of genomic DNA. Determination of the transcription
initiation site indicates that the TH gene has a 5' untranslated region of
27 bp. A TATA-box sequence is located between positions-29 and -24 from
the transcription initiation site and a cyclic AMP regulatory element
(CRE) between-45 and -38. Although the TH gene appears to be
glucocorticoid responsive in vitro, no regions bearing identity to the
consensus sequence for the glucocorticoid regulatory element (GRE) were
detected within approximately 1.5 kb of 5' flanking sequence. A
cross-species comparison of the 5' flanking sequences of the bovine, rat,
and human TH genes reveals strong sequence and positional conservation of
seven sequence elements. An analysis of the nucleotide sequence within
these elements reveals similarity to the consensus sequences reported for
known cis-acting regulatory elements and transcription factor binding
sites, suggesting that they may play a role in the regulation of TH gene
expression.

5'-Flanking DNA sequences direct cell-specific expression
of rat tyrosine hydroxlyase
<p class="Para1">
In previous work the TH gene fragment from -773 to +27
was inserted into promoterless vectors containing CAT reporter gene at the
appropriate site. Transfection into a PC8b cell directed CAT expression,
but a rat CNS tumor cell line (B103), a rat peripheral neural tumor line,
and two fibroblast lines (mouse L and rat Fr3T3 cells) showed not CAT
activity. Three other rat cells lines (anterior pituitary AtT20,
pancreatic insulinoma RIN-5F, and hepatoma HTC) were transfected with the
-773 to +27 and -272 to +27 and there was no CAT expression. An anterior
pituitary line, GH<sub>4</sub>, reported by us previously showed variable
and unexpected expression (it also produces growth hormone and prolactin).
<p>
Various deletions of 5' upstream control sequence were transfected into
PC8b and GH<sub>4</sub> and CAT activities are expressed relative to a
RSV-CAT construction transfected as a control (the Rous sarcoma viruse
promoter is a strong promoter having no tissue-specific requirements).
PC8b cells transfected with constructs of TH upstream sequence as follows:
from -773 to +27, -272 to +27, -226 to +27, and -212, to +27 showed CAT
activities between 36-41% of controls and were the highest values. From
-4800 to +27, there is only a 4% CAT expression. Constructs of -187 to +27
and even less, were &lt;5% of controls in the PC8b cells. For
GH<sub>4</sub>, expression was not much greater than 5% for
any of the constructs. It was observed that removing the TATA box and CRE
element (construct -18 to +27) essentially brought expression to the level
of background.
<p>
As for the largest construct it is evident that repressors may be
involved in attenuating TH gene expression. Further deletional analysis
suggests that this upstream repression region is between -4.8 and -2.2 kb.
<p>
As a control against variable transfection efficiencies seen in the
various constructs, cells were co-transfected with a plasmid containing an
SV40 promoter/b-galactosidase construct and the CAT activity normalized.
The four deletion constructs above were still the highest four in CAT
activity, but the -4800 to +27 construct was considerably higher in
activity (less repressed). The drop off between -212 and -187 was still
very apparent. Both PC8b and Fr3T3 cells showed this enhanced CAT
expression between -773 and -212, although the effect is weaker in the
fibroblast line.
<p>
Does an activator exist between -272 and -187? An AP1 binding site
(5'-TGATTCA-3') occurs between -206 and -200 and falls within the deletion
range (this sequence is conserved with perfect identity in both rat and
human TH gene). AP1 is the product expressed by proto-oncogene <i>c-jun</i>
and its binding sites form the enhancers of several viral and
cellular genes. They also mediate phorbol ester induction.  Others
have shown that AP1 also associates with the <i>c-fos</i> product
and that AP1 has an increased affinity for its binding site.
Sequences between -272 and -187 only demonstrate necessary but
not sufficient sequences for increased transcription. A 78% DNA
sequence homology between rat and human TH gene exists between
-220 and +1 (allowing for gaps), and homology is reduced upstream
of -220. Other than AP1, binding sites have been identified for
other transcription factors AP2 (5'-[G/C]CC[T/G]CGGG-3' starting at -221),
POU/Oct (5'-A[T/G]GCAATT-3' starting at -176), SP1 (5'-CCCCGCCT-3' with
perfect consensus and identity starting at -120) and CRE (5'-TGACGTCA-3'
starting at -45). In addition is a 6 base TATA box starting -29. Note
these are all relative to rat TH gene and not human TH gene. Nevertheless
the drop-off of activity observed here corresponds to deletion of the AP1
site.
<p>
The possibility for POU/Oct binding is interesting since its members
are expressed in large amounts in some brain tissues.

Evidence from EPR spectroscopy that phosphorylation of
Ser-40 in bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase facilitates the reduction of
high-spin Fe(III) under turnover condtions
<p class="Para1">
We did EPR studies before on bovine adrenal TH which
showed the presence of high spin Fe(III) with a slightly distorted axial
symmetry and a signal with g values of 7.0, 5.2, and 1.9 ( |E/D| = 0.04).
The signal does not change when substrates or cofactors are added alone or
in combination.
<p>
We phosphorylated the enzyme with PK-A catalytic subunit (to 0.6 to 0.8
mol P/mol subunit) and large changes in the EPR signal are now observed
under turnover conditions (ie., all substrates are present and the enzyme
is catalyzing during EPR signal collection). The signal for phosphorylated
enzyme but not under turnover conditions looks indistinguishable from the
unphosphorylated enzyme, but a difference spectrum (substraction of one
against another) shows a 30% decrease in the axial type signal at 3.6 and
7 K. No major effect on the microwave saturation behavior of the EPR
signal was observed at 3.6 or 7 K upon phosphorylation.
<p>
Addition of 1.5 mM <span class="small-caps">l</span>-tyrosine
(far above normal) and incubation in the tube for 1 min at 25&deg; prior
cooling at 3.6 K revealed a decrease of 80 &plusmn; 8% in the axial type
signal for the phosphorylated enzyme. For less phosphorylated enzyme
(&lt; 0.5 mol P/mol subunit) the effect was not as pronounced.
A new signal with <i>g</i> values of 9.2, 4.8, and 3.7 were observed.
This suggests a high spin Fe(III) with a distorted rhombical symmetry
(| E/D | = 0.22-0.25). The g values of 4.8 and 3.7 originate from the
middle Kramers doublet and the associated spectral features are
clearly seen at higher microwave power. With addition of tyrosine,
the isotropic <i>g</i> = 4.3 signal increases as well. Addition of tyrosine
to nonphosphorylated enzyme shows only a small decrease (4%) in the
axial type signal.
<p>
Phosphorylated TH under aerobic conditions at 25&deg; and with
1.5 mM <span
class="c1">l</span>-tyrosine and 2 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> present (but no
DTT) results in time-dependent changes in the EPR signal The signals with
g<sub>max</sub> = 7.0<span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (|E/D| =0.04)
and g<sub>max</sub> = 9.2 (|E/D| = 0.22-0.25) disappeared virtually and
during the incubation turnover conditions were present. With an elapse of
5 min (pH between 7.1 and 7.3), 59 nmol (390 &micro;M) DOPA had accumulated
in the EPR tubes and was continued until the cofactor had been consumed.
With unmodified (unphosphorylated) enzyme and with protein
phosphatase-treated enzyme, there was less than 25% decrease in the axial
type EPR signal and the DOPA formed was 1/8th the amount in the same time
period.
<p>
Measurements were also take with the phosphorylated TH with only the
6-MPH<sub>4</sub> (2 mM) present at 25&deg;. After a 1 min incubation, a
significant (55 &plusmn; 15%) decrease in the axial type signal was seen and no
new signal was evident. After 5 min, the signal was almost undetectable.
Such spectral changes are not observed for unmodified enzyme or for enzyme
containing protein phosphatase (only a 10% maximal decrease in signal is
evident). When 1.5 mM tyrosine is added to this mixture after 5 min at
25&deg;, a high spin Fe(III) of the rhombic type is seen with g values
centered around 4.3.
<p>
DISCUSSION. As proposed previously, the Fe(III) form is likely to be
involved in binding catecholamines. Isolated enzyme shows half of it
containing bound catecholamines with dopamine the major inhibitor. Binding
of the catechol to Fe(III) probably lowers its redox potential. EPR
properties did not change under turnover conditions or with cofactor
present, and this likely indicates that Fe(III) is not part of any
catalytic cycle. Phosphorylated TH incubates with tyrosine shows a
disappearance of signals during turnover. Addition of cofactor also made
the signal undetectable. Since Fe(II) is essentially silent to the EPR,
these results should be interpreted as phosphorylation facilitating
reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). Models for PAH and rat TH activity have
previously indicated that Fe(II) is a necessary redox state for catalysis.
<p>
Addition of <span class="c1">l</span>-tyrosine to phosphorylated TH
causes a new EPR signal indicating formation of Fe(III), an effect
observed for PAH as well. Its appearance could mean that Fe(III) is a
catalytically active form. So how does activation by phosphorylation work?
It could be (1) increases K<sub>i</sub> for catecholamine binding and
permits cofactor to reduce the iron atom or (2) alters binding affinity of
cofactor instead: with phosphorylation, a conformational shift brings in
new residues which are pH dependent (not pH shift with phosphorylation)
and which bind cofactor.

Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in rat PC12 cells
by neuropeptides of the secretin family
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme
in catecholamine biosynthesis, is subject to regulation by the
cAMP as well as the calcium and cGMP second messenger
systems. Treatment of intact rat PC12 cells with neuropeptides including
secretin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) stimulated tyrosine
hydroxylase activity 2 to 3-fold in vitro. Secretin (EC<sub>50</sub> = 10 nM) was
about 3 orders of magnitude more potent than VIP (EC<sub>50</sub> = 3 &micro;M). A
combination of several protease inhibitors failed to enhance the potency
of either peptide. Other members of the secretin family including glucagon
and peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) stimulated tyrosine hydroxylase
activity to a lesser extent. Somatostatin, which is not homologous to
secretin, was ineffective. The maximal response of tyrosine hydroxylase
activation to 1 &micro;M secretin occurred within 6-15 sec. Secretin, VIP,
and forskolin also enhanced tyrosine hydroxylase activity
(3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine production) in intact cells, as determined by
high performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection.
Secretin, VIP, PHI, and glucagon increased the levels of cAMP in PC12
cells more than 10-fold, as determined by radioimmunoassay. We also
demonstrated that cAMP is released from the cells into the incubation
medium following secretin treatment. Secretin and VIP treatment also
enhanced the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in a
concentration-dependent fashion, as measured subsequently in vitro. Based
on the greater potency of secretin in comparison with VIP, PHI, and
glucagon, we suggest that the PC12 cells contain a secretin-preferring
receptor that increases cAMP levels and brings about an activation of
tyrosine hydroxylase activity through the stimulation of cAMP-dependent
protein kinase.

Adenosine receptor activation and the regulation of tyrosine
hydroxylase activity in PC12 and PC18 cells
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells were treated (all treatments for 5 min) and TH
activity and cAMP levels assessed. 0.1 mM adenosine increases cAMP 6-fold
and TH activity by 31% (judged significant by p &lt; 0.05). ATP, ADP, and
AMP (all 0.1 mM) produce 9-fold increases in cAMP and 55% increase in TH
activity. 1.0 &micro;M 2-chloroadenosine and 10 &micro;M
5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) were even more effective than any of
the naturally occurring nucleotides, with a 20- to 21-fold increase in
cAMP and 80-90% increase in TH activity. Inosine (essentially deaminated
adenosine), guanosine, IMP, and exogenous cAMP (all 0.1 mM) had no
significant effect on cAMP or TH activity. Theophylline is an adenosine
P<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist as well as phosphordiesterase inhibitor,
but its effect here (at 0.1 mM) was to decrease to a significant extent
cAMP by 50% and TH by 25%. Time course studies with NECA and adenosine
show full TH activation within 15 seconds. These effects were not
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent since medium contained 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM
LaCl<sub>3</sub> or 4 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>. PK-A activity was also measured
in cell extracts in which 10 &micro;M cAMP was added or not added, and
results expressed as a ratio. The ratio is pretty much mirrored in the

PC12 cells treated with adenosine deaminase have been reported to show
lower cAMP basal levels; the enzyme reduce both adenosine and adenine
nucleotides levels produced endogenously and auto-stimulating adenine
receptors. PC18 cells do not respond to NGF unlike PC12 and were found
here to be unable to respond either to theophylline or to adenosine
deaminase addition (no decrease in cAMP or in TH activity) whereas PC12
cells lowered both cAMP level and TH activity. Dose courses as high as 5
times that considered normal had no effect on the PC18 cells. AMP
deaminase was similarly used without effect. On the other hand, NECA or
2-chloroadenosine addition responded as did the parent PC12 cells, both
with cAMP increases and TH activity.
<p>
Dipyridamole is an inhibitor of adenosine transport and deoxycoformycin
a poison for adenosine deaminase. PC12 and PC18 cells treated 10 min with
20 &micro;M dipyridamole show large (20-fold) increases in cAMP levels and %
increases in TH activity. 50 &micro;M deoxycoformycin for the same time had
virtually no such effect on either measure. Combined treatment of both
also was not different than dipyridamole alone, indicating that
deoxycoformycin does not potentiate the cAMP-increasing effect of the
transport inhibitor. Adenosine deaminase was also combined with
dipyridamole treatment to show that the latter stops transport and does
not inhibit phosphodiesterase: results show a significant decrease in cAMP
and TH activity indistinguishable from adenosine deaminase addition alone.
The conclusions from this data are to show that mitigation of external
adenosine effects are largely due to a rapid uptake of adenosine.
<p>
Since ATP is found in both cholinergic and adrenergic secretory
vesicles and is associated with dopaminergic vesicles, there may be a
physiological importance to adenosine receptor stimulation. PC12 cells
were stimulated with DMPP and a time course for release of ATP measured.
The earliest time point measurable (with methods used here) is 1 min after
stimulation, and ATP was increased at this point, 3- to 4-fold at 2 min,
and back to control levels by 4 min. 2 mM hexamethonium abolished the 10
&micro;M DMPP effect. LaCl<sub>3</sub> is a calcium antagonist and also
inhibits the DMPP-stimulated ATP release.
<p>
The A<sub>2</sub> adenosine receptor is specific for AMP or adenosine.
Is ATP metabolized to either of these forms for use as a receptor
activator? Starting with 100 &micro;M [<sup>14</sup>C]ATP, it was found that
55% of the ATP had been degraded within 1 min and the decline was steady
for the 20 min measuring period. This rapid initial degradation was due to
conversion to ADP which increased after 2 min, peaked, then began a steady
decline. The formation of AMP/adenosine (the solvent system used in the
chromatography here does not resolve the chemicals) was observed to
increase hyperbolically over the 20 min period, apparently as a result of
conversion from the ADP. The time course of degradation of both AMP and
ADP was analyzed in parallel using labeled nucleotides and results show
ADP is degraded at a rate an order of magnitude greater than for AMP. Use
of another TLC system showed that any AMP losses were seen as increases in
adenosine and not in another degradation product.
<p>
Centrifugation of cells for 5 min at 13,600 g and measurement of
supernatant for ATPase, ADPase, and AMPase activities indicate that &lt;
0.25% of these activities are found in the supernatant, indicating these
activities are associated with cells and not in the medium. The ATPase
activity was not inhibited by the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
specific inhibitor, ouabain (1 mM) or agents known to inhibit a variety of
other ATPases (1 mM vanadate or 10 mM NaF). Hence PC12 cells contain the
mechanisms for converting ATP to AMP.

A cholinergic antagonist blocks cold stress-induced alterations
in rat adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The role of nicotinic cholinergic transmission
in cold stress-induced alterations in rat adrenomedullary tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) mRNA was investigated by RNA
dot-blot hybridization, using a cloned TH cDNA probe. Chlorisondamine, a
ganglionic blocking agent, greatly attenuated the induction of TH mRNA
levels caused by cold exposure, whereas carbachol and nicotine,
cholinergic agonists, increased TH mRNA in control animals. These results
suggest that cholinergic nicotinic receptors play a key role in the
transsynaptic induction of adrenal TH gene expression.

Mechanistic Studies on Phenylalanine Hydroxylase from <i>Chromobacterium
violaceum</i>.  Evidence for the Formation of an Enzyme-Oxygen Complex.
<p class="Para1">
The most general form of the velocity equation for an enzyme that
reacts with three substrates is
<p class="eqn" style="font-size:75%">
  <i>v</i> = <i>VABC</i> / [constant + (coef A)<i>A</i> + (coef B)<i>B</i> +
  (coef C)<i>C</i> + <i>K</i><sub>a</sub><i>BC</i> +
  <i>K</i><sub>b</sub><i>AC</i> + <i>K</i><sub>c</sub><i>AB</i> +
  <i>ABC</i>]
<p>
All coefficients and constants can be determined by holding the ratio
of two substrates constant at different fixed concentrations, and varying
the third substrate concentration.  Reciprocal plots indicate a sequential
mechanism (because all lines in which the other two substrates were
examined at a fixed ratio while the 3rd substrate was varied were
intersecting).  A plot of the intercept and slope of oxygen against
[Phe] showed nonlinearity.  Plots of the intercept against oxygen while
Phe and DMPH<sub>4</sub> were varied did show linearity in the intercept,
while slope plots were parabolic.
<p>
These results eliminate a mechanism of completely random substrate loading
since the slope vs. substrate and intercept vs. substrate would be nonlinear
for all substrates.  Cleland has pointed out that if a substrate adds more
than once, the interpretation can be problematic.  Nonetheless, the
clear interpretation is that substrate A adds first to PAH, followed
randomly by either substrate B or C [described as random <i>BC</i>
(steady-state A) ter].  The rate equation simplifies to:
<p class="eqn" style="font-size:75%">
  <i>v</i> = <i>VABC</i> / [constant + (coef A)<i>A</i> +

  <i>K</i><sub>b</sub><i>AC</i> + <i>K</i><sub>c</sub><i>AB</i> +
  <i>ABC</i>]
<p>
Dropping the <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> terms is seen in the linearity of
the intercept vs. oxygen for the cofactor and Phe substrate.  The
<i>A</i> term makes the slope and intercept nonlinear for oxygen, and
this implicates oxygen as the first substrate to bind the enzyme.
>From all the data, the Km values for oxygen, Phe, and DMPH<sub>4</sub>
are 210, 176, and 38 &micro;M, resp.  <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is
34.4 &micro;mol/min/mg.  Steady-state parameters are estimated from the
secondary plots of initial rate data and agree well with values obtained
from the computer fit.

Activation of ganglionic tyrosine hydroxylase by peptides of
the secretin-glucagon family: structure-function studies
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The hydroxylation of tyrosine
to dopa is the rate-limiting reaction in catecholamine biosynthesis. It
has been previously reported that secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide
and peptide histidine isoleucine amide, all members of the
secretin-glucagon family of peptides, increase dopa synthesis in superior
cervical ganglia in vitro. We report here that two other members of this
peptide family, rat growth hormone-releasing factor and helodermin H38, a
component of Gila monster venom, also increase the rate of dopa synthesis,
while glucagon-like peptides I and II and a number of other peptides
tested produce no effect. Since analogs of cAMP also increase dopa
synthesis, it is of particular interest that all of the peptides that
increase catechol synthesis also raise the levels of this cyclic
nucleotide in the superior cervical ganglion. Helodermin H38 stimulated
the rate of dopa synthesis and the level of cAMP with similar potencies
(EC<sub>50</sub> values of approximately 10 nM) and with maximal
effects of two- and two-fold, respectively. By either measure, rat
growth hormone-releasing factor produced a two-fold increase at
10 &micro;M and a three- to four-fold
increase at 30 &micro;M. Analogs of peptides of the secretin-glucagon family
with a deletion or modification of the N-terminal histidine were much less
effective in these assays at the concentrations tested than were their
parent compounds, demonstrating an important role for this amino acid in
conferring activity on these peptides. In addition to increasing dopa
synthesis in intact tissue, incubation of ganglia with rat growth
hormone-releasing factor, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide or
peptide histidine isoleucine amide also increased the activity of tyrosine
hydroxylase measured subsequently in ganglion homogenates. Thus, the
peptidergic stimulation of dopa synthesis observed in the intact superior
cervical ganglion appears to be due, at least in part, to the activation
of tyrosine hydroxylase. Together with previous studies, these findings
support the hypothesis that certain members of the secretin-glucagon
family increase catecholamine synthesis in sympathetic neurons by a
cAMP-dependent activation of tyrosine hydroxylase.

Expression of rat tyrosine hydroxylase in insect tissue
culture cells and purification and characterization of the cloned enzyme
<p class="Para1">
The plasmid pVL941 contains a unique <i>Bam</i>HI site downstream
of the viral polyhedron initiation codon, but it is altered from
ATG to ATT so that the inserted gene's initiation codon is used
instead.  Plasmid pKR8 is generated by removing the <i>Eco</i>RI
site in pVL941 with the <i>Eco</i>RI digestion, filling with
Klenow fragment, then re-ligating with DNA ligase.  A polylinker
is placed within the BamHI site to produce a unique <i>Eco</i>RI site.
Plasmid pBacRTH95, which contains the cDNA for rat TH inserted into
<i>Eco</i>RI, is partially digested with <i>Eco</i>RI
and now inserted into vector pKR8.  To select the properly
oriented insert, digestion with XhoI and PstI will produce different
length fragments depending upon orientation.  The plasmid with the
proper orientation is pLJC9, which was confirmed by sequencing from
upstream of the insertion point through the beginning of the TH-coding
region.
<p>
<i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> (Sf9) cells are co-infected with pLJC9
and wild type <i>A.&nbsp;californica</i> polyhedrosis virus using
calcium phosphate.  Recombinants viruses are screened by hybridization
with a rat TH oligo.  6 plaques are selected and plaque-purified to a
constant polyhedrin-minus phenotype to produce 4 final recombinants.
Medium supernatant of the 4 recombinants was used to infect Sf9 cells,
and two days later, cell extracts were analyzed on SDS gels.  Control
infections included (1) no virus added, (2) wild-type added, (3) virus
expressing &beta;-galactosidase or chloramphenicol transferase added.
Three of the four recombinants expressed a protein of
M<sub>r</sub> 55,000 which was 5% of total protein.  Specific
activities of 30-100 nmol DOPA/min/mg were found.
Immunoblotting of the gels with anti-whole rat TH produced bands
at 55,000 Da and no reaction was found in the control cells.
<p>
The recombinant TH was purified from 2.1 g Sf9 cells infected 48 h
earlier.  Cell pellets are lysed by sonication and centrifuged 20 min
@ 17,500 x g, ammonium sulfate precipitated in the 30-42% fraction,
and the pellet is resuspended in 10% glycerol Tris buffer with standard
inhibitors before purification on a heparin-Sepharose column.  TH is eluted
in the 0.9 x 5 cm column using a 100 mL 0 to 1.4 M KCl linear
gradient.  All of this can be done in a day
with a 20-fold purification, which is consistent with TH being 5% of the
total cell protein.
<p>
The purified TH is analyzed for SDS gel mobility
(55,000). Analytical gel filtration using an Ultrogel AcA22 shows an
active holoenzyme of 250,000, consistent with its tetrameric state;
elution of the recombinant is the same as bovine adrenal TH.
Silver stain and periodic acid-Schiff reaction shows
no carbohydrate.  Edman degradation was not
useful, suggest N-terminal blocking.  TH in
insect cells already contain 1.15 mol P/mol subunit, suggesting
phosphorylation.  In vitro incubation with
PK-A C subunit in ATP produced no activation, whereas bovine TH was highly
activated.  The recombinant has 0.1 atom
Fe<sup>2+</sup> per subunit and 10 &mu;M ferrous
ammonium sulfate was necessary to fully activate the enzyme.
A visible absorbance spectrum does not produce a
reported blue color absorbance to indicate endogenous catechols, but the
bovine enzyme did not either.
<p>
Kinetic properties were assessed.  Using 1 mM 6-methyltetrahydropterin,
the apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine is 45 &mu;M.
Using 100 &mu;M tyrosine, the apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for the cofactor is 35 &mu;M.  Using saturating conditions for cofactor and
substrate, <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is 1700 nmol DOPA/min/mg.
With previous purifications from natural sources reporting a
range of 260 to 1600 nmol/min/mg.  The natural cofactor
(6<i>R</i>)-tetrahydrobiopterin was at pH 6.5.  Substrate inhibition
is routinely observed at &gt;50 &mu;M tyrosine.  Various parameters are
reported and dependence upon oxygen is measured with oxygen tension in the
assay controlled.  DOPA is found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor
and the pH optimum is measured by assessing the changes in
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for both tyrosine and cofactor, with turnover
number being maximal at pH 7.1.

Short- and long-term alterations of gene expression in
limbic structures by repeated electroconvulsive-induced seizures
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Rats were submitted to a
series of 10 daily electroconvulsive shocks (ECS). A first group of
animals was killed 1 day after the last seizure and a second group 30 days
later. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity was measured using an in vitro
assay in the nucleus caudatus, anterior cortex, amygdala, substantia
nigra, ventral tegmental area, and locus ceruleus. The mRNA corresponding
to this enzyme (TH-mRNA) was evaluated using a cDNA probe at the cellular
level in the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, and locus ceruleus.
Met-enkephalin (MET)-immunoreactivity and the mRNA coding for the
preproenkephalin (PPE-mRNA) were assayed in striatum and the central
nucleus of the amygdala. The day after the last ECS an increase of TH
activity was observed in the ventral tegmental area, locus ceruleus, and
substantia nigra in parallel with a similar increase in the amygdala and
striatum; in the anterior cortex TH activity remained unchanged. TH-mRNA
was increased in the locus ceruleus, evidencing the presence in this
structure of a genomic activation. The amounts of MET and PPE-mRNA were
unaffected in the striatum but increased in the amygdala. Thirty days
after the last ECS we observed a decrease of TH activity in the amygdala
and of TH-mRNA amount in the ventral tegmental area. In the locus ceruleus
TH-mRNA remained higher in treated animals than in controls whereas TH
activity returned to control levels. These results demonstrate that a
series of ECS induces an initial increase of the activity of
mesoamygdaloid catecholaminergic neurons followed by a sustained decrease
through alterations of TH gene expression which could mediate the clinical
effect of the treatment.

Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells by bradykinin
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase is
activated and phosphorylated following treatment of PC-12 cells with
bradykinin. In order to determine the mechanisms by which this occurs, we
have evaluated the second messenger systems that may be responsible for
this activation and phosphorylation. Inositol phosphates appear to play an
important role in the activation and phosphorylation of tyrosine
hydroxylase because bradykinin treatment significantly increased the
formation of [3H]inositol phosphates and the concentration of
intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in PC-12 cells. The uptake of
extracellular 45Ca2+ into PC-12 cells at 1 min was significantly increased
(107%) by bradykinin treatment and this increase was blocked by La3+, an
inorganic calcium channel inhibitor, but not by nifedipine, an inhibitor
of voltage-dependent calcium channels. The activation of tyrosine
hydroxylase in PC-12 cells following bradykinin treatment was partially
inhibited by La3+. Additivity experiments were performed to evaluate
whether the activation and phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in
PC-12 cells following treatment with bradykinin (10 microM) was similar to
the activation and phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in PC-12 cells
following treatment with dibutyryl cAMP (2 mM), 4 beta-phorbol-12
beta-myristate-13 alpha-acetate (PMA) (2 microM), and high K+ (56 mM). The
combination of bradykinin and PMA produced additive effects, indicating
that the activation of tyrosine hydroxylase by treatment with these two
compounds was through different mechanisms. Furthermore, exposure of PC-12
cells to bradykinin did not increase intracellular cAMP levels. The
combination of bradykinin and PMA treatments produced only partial
additivity in tyrosine hydroxylase activity and phosphorylation. No
additivity was produced with bradykinin and high K-treatment.
Phosphopeptide analysis was performed on tyrosine hydroxylase obtained
from PC-12 cells treated with bradykinin. Bradykinin treatment produced a
significant incorporation of [32P]-phosphate into two phosphopeptides of
tryptically digested tyrosine hydroxylase. One of these peptides
corresponds to a peptide obtained by trypsinization of purified tyrosine
hydroxylase that is phosphorylated by purified
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The other 32P-tyrosine
hydroxylase-peptide obtained from PC-12 cells treated with bradykinin
corresponds to the phosphorylation site obtained during PMA stimulation of
PC-12 cells. These results indicate that bradykinin treatment increases
intracellular inositol phosphates, calcium, and possibly diacylglycerol
levels in PC-12 cells. These effects could then increase
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity and possibly
calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein (protein kinase C) activity,
resulting in increased phosphorylation and activity of tyrosine
hydroxylase.

Nerve stimulation in vivo acutely increases tyrosine
hydroxylase activity in the superior cervical ganglion and its end organs
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Previous studies have shown
that preganglionic nerve stimulation in vitro increases acutely the
activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in
catecholamine biosynthesis, in sympathetic neuronal cell bodies in the rat
superior cervical ganglion (SCG). In the present study, we have examined
whether a similar increase occurs after nerve stimulation in vivo, and
whether this enzyme activity also increases in sympathetic nerve terminals
in autonomic end organs. Immediately following stimulation at 10 Hz for 15
min in vivo, TH activity was found to have increased 4- to 8-fold in the
SCG and in 3 of its end organs: the iris, the pineal gland and the
submaxillary gland. These results indicate that increases in sympathetic
nerve activity in vivo can lead to increases in TH activity both in
adrenergic cell bodies/dendrites in the SCG and in adrenergic nerve
terminals/fibers in various autonomic end organs.

Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of
tyrosine hydroxylase gene by protein kinase C
<p class="Para1">
Griffith &amp; Schulman (1988) and Cahill et al. (1989)
have previously described TH phosphorylation and Matthies et al. (1987)
have reported on noradrenaline release in response to TPA treatment of
PC12 cells.
<p>
In this report, kinetics and concentration of TPA
were investigated using <sup>3</sup>H-PDBu binding as a measure
of PK-C content.  Cells were treated with 100 nM TPA and a time
course was followed:  at 30 min a small increase was found, but this
increase was followed by a decrease in binding to 20% of control at 24 h.
Measurement of binding over an  increasing TPA concentration showed
a similar decrease to 20% of control at 100 nM TPA (used for time course).
Subcellular localization studies indicate that both membrane fractions
bind more <sup>3</sup>H-PDBu than cytosolic, but both fractions bind
less over a time course of 24 h. These results add evidence to a model
of PK-C translocation to membranes initially, followed
by down-regulation mediated by calpain proteolysis (Tapley and Murray,
1984; many others).
<p>
A time course of TPA-treated PC12 cells and controls was run on SDS
to immunoblots which were probed with antibody to the 14-amino acid
hinge region between two domains of PK-C.  A single 79 kDa band was
found in controls and TPA-treated cells for the first 4 h of the
time course, corresponding to intact PK-C.  Bands at ~45 kDa (perhaps the
catalytic domain), ~33 kDa and 35 kDa (perhaps the regulatory domain)
subsequently began to appear with disappearance of the 79 kDa band.
Disappearance of the 79 kDa band was complete at 24 h.  When cells
which had been treated for 24 h with TPA, were followed by another
24 h without TPA, the 79 kDa band reappeared, indicating de novo
synthesis.
<p>
Northern blots for TH mRNA show that TPA (100 nM, 15 min) results
in a 67% increase in TH mRNA.  A maximum 150% increase was registered
after 4 h, decreasing to 40% of control value after 8 h, remaining
below controls after 24 h.  Removal of TPA resulted in both
a 50% increase in PK-C and 200% increase in TH mRNA, above the control
level.  When leupeptin (100 &mu;M), an inhibitor of calpain, was added
to these incubation, down-regulation of PK-C was avoided, and TPA-treated
cells still showed higher PK-C activity than controls with inhibitor
present.  Also TH mRNA reduction did not occur, suggesting that
decreases in TH mRNA expression are tied to PK-C down-regulation.
Staurosporine treatment did not affect decrease in levels of
TPA-induced TH mRNA, but the decrease was only ~20%, which
returned to control levels after 4 h.
<p>
Nuclei from TPA-treated PC12 cells were isolated after different
times of TPA treatment.  In vitro RNA synthesis in the presence of
[<sup>32</sup>P]UTP was allowed, and Northern blots probed using
the TH gene and controls plasmid pBR322 and NADH cDNA.  No signal
was found for pBR322, and the NADH probe was quantitatively
indistinguishable from untreated controls.  With TH, a maximal
2-fold increase after 15 min was observed, with the signal
decreasing rapidly to control levels after 4 h.  At variance with
the situation where depletion of PK-C resulted in TH mRNA decrease
is a failure to observe a similar decrease in TH transcription when
cells were depleted of PK-C.  Hence PK-C may also serve a
post-transcriptional role in quantitative regulation of TH mRNA, either at
level of pre-RNA processing or of the stability of the processed
message.  When cells were treated with actinomycin D over various
time periods (0-24 h), a slight increase in TH mRNA is observed up
to 8 h treatment, dropping to 50% of controls after 24 h, indicating
a long message half-life.  A probe consisting of 200 bp TH intron
decreased steadily in the presence of actinomycin D, suggesting
actD-arrest of transcription is rapid and that the long delay in
mRNA processing is not due to slow penetration of the drug.
TPA treatment in presence of actD produces a significant mRNA
increase after 1 h followed by a decrease greater than that of
actD treatment alone.  Hence TPA affects TH mRNA expression at
the post-transcriptional level.

<u>Multiple TH phosphopeptides in PC12 cells.</u>  TH subunit purified
from PC12 cells migrated as 62,000 Da band slightly above the catalase
standard.  Labeled PC12 cells were extracted and TH immunoprecipitated
was run on SDS gels.  The excised band was limit digested with trypsin
and separated on HPLC (0.4% acetonitrile/min) into 5 major phosphopeptides.
Samples of each peak were combined for separation on 2D thin-layer cellulose
(one plate was electrophoresed in the first dimension toward the anode in
pH 1.9 buffer then chromatographed, and another plate electrophoresed
toward the cathode in pH 8.9 buffer then chromatographed):
only five spots appeared, indicating only that the HPLC peaks corresponded
to only one peptide;  the 5 spots were better resolved on the pH 8.9 plate.
Thin-layer isoelectric focusing on Servalyt 3-10 Precote gels gave pI
values from the lowest to highest in this order: PC-1 (3.2)&lt;PC-3
(3.5)&lt;PC-2~PC-5 (3.9)&lt;PC-4 (5.1), where PC-1 elutes first and PC-5
elutes last on HPLC.  Phosphoamino acid
analysis showed all of the peptide to be phosphoserine.
<p>
<u>Regulation of <sup>32</sup>P incorporation into TH phosphopeptides.</u>
40 mM K<sup>+</sup>, 100 &mu;M veratridine, and 50 &mu;M nicotine were
shown to increase phosphate content of TH.  Brief treatments (30-60 s)
increased phosphorylation of  PC-1 and PC-2 two- to three-fold, while
1.5 mM EGTA added prior to treatment abolished these effects.  Longer
treatments (5 min) eventually resulted in 20-30% increase in
phosphorylation of PC-5.  The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ionophore A23187
at 10 &mu;M for 30 min not only increased phosphorylation into
PC-1 and PC-2, but also increased phosphorylation into PC-3 by five-fold.
Incorporation in PC-1 and PC-2 (Ser-19) was not observed previously since
previous studies used longer incubation times and higher temperatures
indicating increased phosphorylation into PC-3 (Ser-31) and PC-5
(Ser-40).  A23187 and ionomycin in previous studies were shown
to increase phosphorylation in all peptides but PC-4 (Ser-8).
<p>
Forskolin (10 &mu;M, 10 min), 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM, 5 min),
diBu-cAMP (1 mM, 5 min), which all are known to raise intracellular
cAMP, all increased phosphorylation 2-fold into TH, namely PC-5 (Ser-40),
depending upon the phosphorylation state of PC-5.  When pre-treated
with theophylline to reduce total phosphate, there was a 4-fold
increase in phosphorylation when forskolin was added.  Vasoactive
intestinal peptide and secretin also increased PC-5 phosphorylation,
but substance P, neurotensin, and somatostatin did not.
<p>
Phorbol esters (PDBu at 1 &mu;M, 15 min) produced a major increase
(2.4-fold) in PC-3 (Ser-31) and a very minor increase (35%)
in phosphorylation of PC-5.  A similar  effect was shown for
4&beta;-phorbol dibutyrate (1 &mu;M, 30 min).  In vitro work
with protein kinase C shows phosphorylation is mainly on PC-5,
which differs from the in situ work here and reported in previous studies.
This suggests that PK-C activation by phorbol esters acts upon TH
indirectly.
<p>
NGF was shown to increase PC-3 phosphorylation (50 ng/ml, 30 min).
EGF was also tried for different times and doses, and with different
sources of PC12 cells at various stages of confluence, but there was
absolutely no phosphorylation increase into TH, which disagrees with
an earlier report by McTigue et al.  One reason may be that transduction
system(s) influenced by EGF are active in control cells.
<p>
Phosphatases have been found to dephosphorylate TH, so okadaic acid
(1 &mu;M, 30 min), which inhibits protein phosphatases 1 and 2A,
was added and found to increase phosphate content in all tryptic
phosphopeptides of TH.
<p>
<u>Phosphorylation site analysis.</u>  Manual Edman degradation
followed by subtractive analysis of each cycle on autoradiographs
of thin-layer cellulose electrophoresis plates produces a pattern
in which free phosphate is liberated at the cycle where the
phosphorylation site is.  Both PC-1 and PC-5 revealed free
phosphate on the 3rd cycle, PC-2 on the fourth, and PC-3 and
PC-4 showed nothing through six cycles that were done.  Sequencing on
purified peptides showed that PC-1 was
A<sub>22</sub>V<sub>13</sub>XE<sub>16</sub>Q<sub>22</sub>D<sub>13</sub>A<sub>17</sub>K<sub>8</sub>
with numbers representing picomole yield.  The subtractive Edman
analysis had shown a loss of positive charge at pH 1.9
and 8.9, suggesting a modification of Lys.
Moreover, an increase in mobility was observed at pH 8.9 reflecting a
deamidation of Gln to Glu.  Hence,
AVS(p)EQDAK was assigned, with Ser-19 as phosphorylation site.
RAVS(p)EQDAK was assigned to PC-2, reflecting an
alternate tryptic cleavage site at Arg-15.  Sequencing of PC-3 and
PC-4 produced results of QAEAVTS(p)PR and PTPSAPS(p)PQPK.

Differential effect of membrane depolarization on levels
of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase mRNAs in PC12
pheochromocytoma cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Membrane depolarization has
been widely used to elucidate the response of the nervous system to
prolonged neuronal activity or stress. We studied the effect of treating
PC12 cells with membrane depolarizing stimuli, 50 mM KCl, or 150 microM
veratridine, and the subsequent changes in the mRNA levels of the
catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine
beta-hydroxylase (DBH). TH mRNA levels were found to increase 2- to 5-fold
after continuous treatment for 1-12 h with 50 mM KCl. Depolarization with
150 microM veratridine had a similar effect on TH mRNA. In contrast, DBH
mRNA levels were unchanged by either KCl or veratridine treatment. The
role of calcium in the increase of TH mRNA levels elicited by
depolarization was examined. The increase in TH mRNA was inhibited by the
chelation of calcium with 3 mM EGTA. However, in contrast to their effect
on phosphorylation of TH elicited by acute depolarization, the calcium
channel blockers, nitrendipine and verapamil, and the calmodulin
antagonists, W7 and trifluoperazine, did not prevent the increase in TH
mRNA levels subsequent to several hours exposure to depolarizing stimuli.
The calcium ionophore, A23187, alone was unable to induce TH mRNA levels.
Thus, the increase in TH mRNA elicited by depolarization is mediated
differently than the acute phosphorylation of the enzyme.

Tyrosine hydroxylase in secretory granules from bovine adrenal medulla
<p class="Para1">
Granules from adrenal medulla were prepared in buffered
1.6 M sucrose by centrifugation according to a known method.
Membranes from granules were also prepared.  First cell fractions
were checked for TH activity (total and specific).  Homogenates
and their supernatant (cytosol) indicate the highest TH activity is truly
soluble.  Examination of the granule shows that intact granule
contains TH activity and that this activity is associated with
the membrane and not the internal contents of the membrane.
A very high specific activity is found in the granule membrane.
It is estimated from these activity distributions and from
immunochemical work that 5-7% of bovine TH is membrane bound,
and this may be an underestimate since TH inhibitors are known
to be present in the fractions assayed.  Polyclonal antiserum
to rat PC12 TH was used in Western analysis:  a protein with
M<sub>r</sub>=58,000 and moving slightly faster than PC12 TH
(M<sub>r</sub> = 60,000) was evident in granule membranes and
cytosolic fractions, but not in the granule contents fraction.
Verification that the 58,000 protein was bovine TH was checked
by pre-incubating PC12 TH with the antiserum and by using a
second set of antibodies (monoclonal) which recognize PC12 TH
and pheochromocytoma TH to show they also recognized the
M<sub>r</sub> 58,000 protein.
<p>
The granular lamellar orientation was a factor as well:
were the membranes opened and closed inside out during isolation?
(1) After isolation, granules were opened and epinephrine content
assessed:  2.5 &mu;mol/mg protein, in agreement with previous
values.  (2) Granular lysis liberates much protein as well, and
SDS-PAGE shows a major band at M<sub>r</sub> 70,000, consistent
with the M<sub>r</sub> of chromogranin A.  Such results rule out
possibilities that cytosolic TH is trapped in re-sealed granules
during the isolation procedure.  To show that contaminating membranes
are not present, granular membrane preparation was centrifuged on
linear sucrose gradients and both TH and dopamine &beta;-hydroxylase
activity measured (DBH is a known marker);  both peaks were coincident.
<p>
We then tried extracting TH from the purified membranes.  High salt
extraction (0.1 to 2.0 M KCl) at pH 7.2 was without effect as no
immunoreactive TH was obtained.  8 M urea treatment removed some
but not all of the TH from the membrane.   0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
also removes some TH immunoreactivity from granules
but repeated washing show TH is resistant to removal.
<p>
Detergent extraction NP-40 and TX-100 (both nonionic) and
CHAPS (zwitterionic) can solubilize TH in a concentration-dependent fashion.
Still some TH remained with the pellet (stayed in the granule membrane)
at the highest detergent concentrations used (1% (v/v) for the
nonionics or 10 mM for CHAPS) as indicated by immunoblots.  CHAPS
released the most (43%:  amount in supernatant/amount in
pellet+supernatant) at the highest concentration used.
NP-40 released the next greatest, and TX-100 released the least (22%).
Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is generally used to remove
extrinsic contaminants and distinguish real integral membrane proteins;
the removal of TH by the detergents here extends the
confirmation that TH is integral to the membrane.
<p>
Triton X-114 can be precondensed and used to separate three phases:
detergent, phospholipid, and aqueous.  Granule membranes were
prepared according to a known method and immunoblots prepared
for each.  TH prepared in this way is found in the detergent
and phospholipid phase, virtually none in the aqueous.  Adrenal
cytosol was also TX-114-fractionated and all TH was found in the
aqueous phase.  That TH is present in detergent and phospholipid
phases suggests an intrinsic and hydrophobic protein, resp.
Hence TH exists in multiple forms.
<p>
Phospholipase C has been shown to activate
membrane-bound TH in brain and this enzyme can release ACh esterase from
vesicle membranes.  A PLase C specific for
phosphatidylinositol was tried up to 20 &mu;g/ml and could neither release TH
based on activity or immunoreactivity, so it is unlikely but not ruled out
(since only one type of PLase C was used) that TH is covalently linked to
a phospholipid.
<p>
The membrane orientation (transmembrane, exterior,
or interior) of TH was to be determined using iodination techniques shown
to be successful for locating dopamine &beta;-hydroxylase.  However, the
iodination of TH was not useful.  Rather
granules were treated with PK-A using labeled ATP and an assessment of
<sup>32</sup>P incorporation was made.
Numerous proteins were found to be
phosphorylated and immunoprecipitation with anti-TH followed by SDS-PAGE
revealed a band of M<sub>r</sub> 58,000 (TH) was
one of them (quite heavily phosphorylated).
<p>Granules were then treated with a variety of
proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, V8 protease, proteinase K) for 30 min at
RT.  As a control, cytosolic TH was
similarly treated.  In the granule
preparation, a 58,000 band remains prominent (showing resistance of TH)
but immunoreactive fragments can be seen, showing some TH is susceptible
to attack.  By contrast the cytosolic TH is
degraded by virtually all proteases.

Nerve growth factor regulates tyrosine hydroxylase gene
transcription through a nucleoprotein complex that contains c-Fos
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: We have studied nerve growth
factor (NGF) regulation of the expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
gene in PC12 cells. The TH gene encodes the initial and rate-limiting
enzyme of the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. We show that the TH gene
is transiently transcriptionally induced by a mechanism reliant on new
protein synthesis during 1-2 hr of NGF stimulation, a time following the
induction of the c-fos gene at 15 min post-NGF treatment. A potential
regulatory sequence located within the TH gene promoter, the TH-FSE,
shares homology to a known regulatory element, the fat-specific element
(FSE), which is found upstream from genes activated during adipocyte
differentiation and binds the Fos-Jun transcription factor complex. We
show that the TH-FSE DNA sequence elevates the basal level of
transcription from the rat TH promoter and is required for NGF
inducibility. This DNA element binds authentic Fos-Jun products produced
abundance during NGF stimulation and by in vitro translation. We
demonstrate further that the TH-FSE can bind proteins present in PC12
nuclear extracts in a sequence-specific manner. The DNA/nucleoprotein
complex that forms increases in abundance during NGF stimulation and
reaches a maximum level at 4 hr of treatment. Antibody inhibition studies
utilizing an anti-Fos antibody indicate that Fos and/or Fos-related
antigen(s) associate with the TH-FSE and suggest that the Fos protein
family contributes to the regulation of TH in vivo. These results support
a model in which NGF-induced immediate early genes, including c-Fos,
contribute to the regulation of delayed early genes such as TH and thereby
control neuronal differentiation.

pH-Dependent release of catecholamines from tyrosine hydroxylase
and the effect of phosphorylation of Ser-40
<p class="Para1">
Bovine and rat adrenal TH are purified for these studies.
The bovine enzyme has tightly bound to it 0.35 mol catecholamine
(CA; either NorEpi or Epi) per subunit (Andersson et al., 1988).
We show a very slow of CA at a neutral pH at 4&deg; when the pH
is varied from 3 to 7.  Rate of release is very much increased as the pH
is made to fall.  TH precipitated by AmSO<sub>4</sub> at pH 4.4
to remove endogenous CA shows an ability to rebind NorEpi at pH 7.0.
The dissociation constant increases 8-fold from pH 6.0 to pH 4.0.
From the plot of free [<sup>3</sup>H]-NorEpi vs. pH, one can see that
binding is dependent upon a functional group with pK<sub>a</sub>=5.3
at 4&deg;, which suggests a salt bridge between
NorEpi and a COOH group on TH.  Resonance Raman spectroscopic
studies indicate that additional charge transfer interactions
between CAs and the high-spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) (Andersson et
al, 1988).  This suggests that the distance
for this interaction is the same order of magnitude as shown for the
Fe(III)-oxyanion bond length in the [Fe(salen)catechol]<sup>-</sup>
model complex, i.e. about 1.8 &Aring; (see Heistand II et al,
<i>Chem</i>. <b>21</b>: 676, 1982).  This pH-dependent
release of CAs leading to TH activation was also shown for TH from other
sources as well:  partially pure rat adrenal
TH in our study, and rat pheochromocytoma TH and rat striatal enzyme
activated by brief acid treatment and marked by release of dopamine in
other studies.
<p>
In a previous study of bovine adrenal TH treated with PK-A in
vitro, phosphorylation at Ser-40 increased activity and
altered the spectroscopic properties of the CA-Fe(III) complex at the
active site.  Plots of the % bound
[<sup>3</sup>H]-NorEpi vs. incubation time in
release experiments comparing phosphorylated and control TH (control TH
was incubated in the absence of magnesium acetate) allow for calculation
of the rate constant at pH 7.0/30&deg; for release of bound CA, given as a
pseudo-first order rate constant of <i>k</i><sub>-1</sub> =
8.7 x 10<sup>-5</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for the control and a 6-fold
increase in the constant for phosphorylated TH,
<i>k</i><sub>-1</sub> = 5.1 x 10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.
At more acidic pH values, the effect of
phosphorylation is less pronounced.  These
findings support the conclusion that Ser-40 phosphorylation activates the
enzyme by facilitating the reduction of the enzyme-bound Fe(III) by the
cofactor.  CAs are competitive inhibitors of
the cofactor and phosphorylation reverses the inhibition.
We conclude that physiological low (or off) TH
activity states result from a population of TH molecules inhibited by
bound catecholamines, while during physiologically excited states, TH is
phosphorylated, resulting in reduced affinity for catecholamines and
sustaining the possibility that cofactor may now bind to the enzyme.

GABA receptor modulation of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in
the rat adrenal gland
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Chromaffin cell
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors play a role in modulating
catecholamine secretion. The present experiments examined the role of GABA
receptors in modulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) induction in rat

effect on TH activity or TH mRNA. However, bicuculline potentiated
reserpine's effect on TH activity and TH mRNA induction. These data

Identification of MARPP-58, a morphine- and cyclic
AMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 58 kDa, as tyrosine hydroxylase: evidence
for regulation of its expression by chronic morphine in the rat locus
coeruleus
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Previously, we have
identified a number of morphine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoproteins
(MARPPs) in the rat locus coeruleus (LC) and other brain regions. We now
show that one of these phosphoproteins, a 58 kDa protein designated
MARPP-58, is tyrosine hydroxylase. First, MARPP-58 comigrates with
immunolabeled, immunoprecipitated, and purified tyrosine hydroxylase on 1-
and 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Second, MARPP-58, immunoprecipitated
tyrosine hydroxylase, and purified tyrosine hydroxylase yield identical
1-dimensional phosphopeptide maps. Third, MARPP-58 exhibits a regional and
subcellular distribution in brain consistent with tyrosine hydroxylase.
Identification of MARPP-58 as tyrosine hydroxylase made it possible to
determine whether increases in MARPP-58 phosphorylation induced by chronic
morphine in the LC reported previously are associated with alterations in
enzyme activity and expression in this brain region. We show that chronic
treatment of rats with morphine increases levels of tyrosine hydroxylase
activity, immunoreactivity, and mRNA in the LC. Induction of the enzyme by
chronic morphine was blocked by concomitant treatment of rats with the
opiate receptor antagonist naltrexone, indicating that morphine produces
this effect through the activation of opiate receptors. Consistent with
previous observations that the chronic morphine-induced change in MARPP-58
phosphorylation is specific to the LC, changes observed in enzyme
activity, immunoreactivity, and mRNA were not observed in a number of
other brain regions studied. The results indicate that chronic morphine
regulates the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase specifically in the LC
and suggest that such regulation reflects long-term adaptations of LC
neurons to chronic morphine at the level of gene expression.

Effects of cold exposure on rat adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase:
an analysis of RNA, protein, enzyme activity, and cofactor levels
<p class="Para1">
Rats were placed for different periods of time (1-48 h)
in ambient temperatures of 5&deg;C.  Relative TH
mRNA levels were determined using RNA dot-blot hybridization.
1 h exposure results in a 58% increase relative to
controls, with a 3- to 4-fold increase observed with 3-6 h of exposure,
remaining constant for the duration at that level.
Since dot-blots do not accurately assess specificity
of hybridization, Northern blots show these RNA increases to involve TH
RNA (a 1.9 kb species).  Northerns of
purified polyribosomal RNA also indicate that TH mRNA increased by 70% on
average in this fraction during the first hour of exposure.
<p>Anti-TH antibodies were then used to assess changes
in TH protein in light of the RNA changes.
A standard curve was constructed on the Western blots to see if there was
any linearity in the signal response of the 56 kDa species; the data
clearly indicate there was.  Two bands seen
at 68 and 86 kDa were visualized as well, but were present using control
sera too;  these bands did not vary as did
TH over the time course of stress.  The time
course of stress indicates TH protein increases 50-60% as early as 3 h
after exposure, with 200-300% increases seen by 72 h.
Maximal increases in TH immunoreactivity appear to
precede corresponding increases in TH activity, a phenomenon reported by
Fluharty <i>et&nbsp;al.</i> (1985).  The temporal
relationship between activity and protein level was analyzed using
cold-stressed vs. sham-shaved animals and a monoclonal antibody.
There were no statistically significant
differences between either TH activity (<i>p</i>=0.82) or TH
protein (<i>p</i>=0.35) between sham-shaved and untreated
controls.  Immunoreactivity rises rapidly
after 24 h, reaching 3.25-fold after 72 h.
Significant increases are seen in TH immunoreactivity and two-way ANOVA
comparing activity changes is seen at 24 h cold exposure (<i>F</i><sub>(5,34)</sub> = 7.58,
<i>p</i>&lt;0.01).  Little increases in
TH activity (~50%) at the 48 h time mark.
Hence, the statistical evidence shows significant increases in TH protein
after 24 h relative to changes in TH activity.
<p>Catecholamine biosynthesis is nonetheless elevated
notwithstanding absence of an apparent increase in TH activity in
vitro.  This may reflect changes in cofactor
availability as a mode of regulating TH activity in vivo.
For this reason biopterin levels in the medulla were
assessed and found to increase 158% within 12 hr of exposure, being over
2-fold elevated between 24-72 h.  Others
have shown that biopterin concentration is rate-limiting, and hence TH
activity is affected more by cofactor than by protein expression.

Multiple messenger RNAs of monkey tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Total RNA was taken from tissues of various primates (including man)
and primers for TH
(primer 1: <span style="font-family:Courier;">5'-CCGTGTCTGAGCTGGACGCCAAGCAGGC-3'</span>;
primer 2: <span style="font-family:Courier;">5'-CCTTGCGGGAGCTGGACGCCAAGCAGGC-3'</span>)
were prepared for cDNA synthesis using MMLV reverse transcriptase,
with subsequent amplification by PCR.  Type 1 is typically the
minimally coded form (a form with homology to all mammalian species),
while other types have inserted sequences between nucleotide 90 and 91
of type 1.  Amplified cDNA was then run on agarose gels (4% Nusieve
GTG agarose (FMC) and stained with ethidium bromide.  For the primers
used here, the predicated products based on what is known for human
types have lengths of 93, 105, 174, and 186 bp for types 1-4, in that
respective order.
<p>
Two products were found in human pheochromocytoma (93 and 105 bp),
and also in adrenal and brains (pons and medulla oblongata) of
<i>Macaca fuscata</i> and <i>Macaca irus</i>.  These would be
the corrected predicted size of type 1 and 2, resp.  Only 1
product (type 1 TH correpondence) was
found in tissues from <i>Sunkus murinus</i> and rat.  Southern
hybridization was performed using type 3 and 4 probes, but positives
were found only in the human pheochromocytoma.
<p>
DNA of type 1 and 2 TH mRNAs from the two <i>Macacus</i> spp. were cloned
into pUC119 and the clone used for sequencing (done twice from separate
amplifications; Sequenase from USB was used).  Type 2 mRNA was found
to contain a 12 bp insertion which was a 100% match with human type 2.
Type 1 monkey mRNA lacks the insertion, but is otherwise identical with
type 2.  Difference between type 1 human and the monkey amounted to
two and three nucleotides, for <i>M irus</i> and <i>M fuscata</i>, resp.
but only for the region amplified (not the whole message).

Species and regional differences in the expression of cell-type
specific elements at the human and rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene loci
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The expression of the
catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), is confined
to several different types of neuroendocrine cells. Using a transient
assay system, we examined more than 10 kb of the human TH gene and 6.5 kb
of 5' flanking sequences of the rat TH gene for DNA elements that confer
cell-type specific expression. Surprisingly, these elements do not appear
to be conserved in position or sequence across species. When plasmids
containing DNA sequences - 749 bp from the transcription start site of the
rat gene were introduced into PC12 cells, up to sixfold higher levels of
expression were observed as compared to the same fragments introduced into
HepG2 cells or LAN-1 cells. In contrast to the rat gene, analogous
fragments of the human 5' promoter failed to confer cell-type specific
expression. However, when plasmids containing a truncated thymidine kinase
promoter and either orientation of a 760 by 3' human TH gene fragment were
introduced into PC12 and LAN-1 cells, we observed a six- and 3.5-fold
increase, respectively, over that observed for HepG2 cells. Subsequent
deletion of this fragment led to significant activation of transcription
in PC12 and HepG2 cell lines. These data indicate the presence of multiple
elements contributing to the cell-type specific expression of tyrosine
hydroxylase genes.

Steady-state kinetic mechanism of rat tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
Tyrosine, oxygen, and tetrahydrobiopterin are the three substrates
of TH.  In the studies used here, 6-methyltetrahydropterin is
used since its <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values are in a more accessible
range than for the physiological substrate.  Pairs of
substrates are varied at a nonsaturating concentration of the third
substrate.  Variation of tyrosine and TH<sub>4</sub> at
250 &mu;M oxygen produces intersecting line patterns on
double-reciprocal plots (K<sub>cofactor</sub>=46 &mu;M;
K<sub>tyr</sub>=32 &mu;M; <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>=92 min<sup>-1</sup>).
Data fit best using a sequential mechanism.
When oxygen and cofactor were varied at 150 &mu;M tyrosine, similar results
were obtained (K<sub>cofactor</sub>=30 &mu;M;
K<sub>oxygen</sub>=21 &mu;M; <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>=75 min<sup>-1</sup>).
When tyrosine and oxygen were varied at 500 &mu;M
cofactor, the data were then best fit with an equilibrium ordered
mechanism (K<sub>tyr</sub>=22 &mu;M; <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>=91 min<sup>-1</sup>).
These results establish a quaternary complex between substrates and enzyme.
Oxygen did not act as a substrate inhibitor, as
previously reported, but if assays at 1.2 mM oxygen were done for 2 min,
apparent inhibition may result as a nonlinear production of DOPA during
this period.
<p>
The rate equation of a ternary complex as this can produce 8 terms:

<table align="center" class="eqn"
   style="margin:1em -20%;text-align:center;font-size:83%;">
<tr>
 <td>[Tyr][O<sub>2</sub>][6MPH<sub>4</sub>]
<tr>
 <td style="border-top:1px solid black;">
  [Tyr][O<sub>2</sub>][6MPH<sub>4</sub>] +
   <i>K</i><sub>Tyr</sub>[O<sub>2</sub>][6MPH<sub>4</sub>] +
   <i>K</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>[Tyr][6MPH<sub>4</sub>] +
   <i>K</i><sub>6MPH<sub>4</sub></sub>[Tyr][O<sub>2</sub>] +
   coeff(Tyr)[Tyr] +
   coeff(6MPH<sub>4</sub>)[6MPH<sub>4</sub>] +
   coeff(O<sub>2</sub>)[O<sub>2</sub>] + constant
</table>
<p>
If one saturates for each substrate and varies the other two,
the analysis can be simplified rather than varying all three.
Tyrosine exhibits substrate inhibition at concentrations
above 150 &mu;M, and decreased precision because of shortened
assay times at concentrations of oxygen above ambient
combined with its low apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> rule
out that approach for that substrate.  Rudolph &amp; Fromm
have shown that if two substrates are varied in a
fixed ratio while examining different concentrations of the third, the
presence of individual terms in the rate equation can be determined from
the shapes of the slopes and intercept replots, since terms containing the
concentrations of the two substrates in fixed ratio contain squared terms
to generate nonlinear plots.  The ratio of
tyrosine and cofactor was varied with changes in oxygen, and a replot of
slope vs 1/[tyrosine] produces a nonlinear plot passing through the
origin.  The intercept plot is linear, with a finite intercept.
The <i>y</i>-intercept of a slope replot is
<i>K</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>/<i>V</i>.  This value is zero when
tyrosine and oxygen are varied together.  Nonlinearity in the slope
replot indicates a finite value making up the constant term in the
equation above.  Because the slope replot line is linear, the
coef(O<sub>2</sub>) term is zero.  When all three substrates are varied,
but in a fixed ratio, both the slope and intercept replots were nonlinear.
If the intercepts of the slope replots are finite, so are the values
<i>K</i><sub>Tyr</sub>/<i>V</i> and <i>K</i><sub>6MPH<sub>4</sub></sub>/<i>V</i>.
Nonlinear intercept plots are consistent with nonzero values for
coef(Tyr) and coef(6MPH<sub>4</sub>), and nonlinear slope replots
indicate the constant is not zero.  The first equation now reduces to
the steady-state equation for rat TH:

<table align="center" class="eqn"
   style="margin:1em -20%;text-align:center;font-size:83%;">
<tr>
 <td>[Tyr][O<sub>2</sub>][6MPH<sub>4</sub>]

 <td style="border-top:1px solid black;">
  [Tyr][O<sub>2</sub>][6MPH<sub>4</sub>] +
   <i>K</i><sub>Tyr</sub>[O<sub>2</sub>][6MPH<sub>4</sub>] +
   <i>K</i><sub>6MPH<sub>4</sub></sub>[Tyr][O<sub>2</sub>] +
   coeff(Tyr)[Tyr] +
   coeff(6MPH<sub>4</sub>)[6MPH<sub>4</sub>] + constant
</table>
Because the <i>K</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> term has been eliminated,
the apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> determined from varying tyrosine
and the cofactor at fixed oxygen is the actual value, 92 min<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
The K<sub>6MPH<sub>4</sub></sub> value, determined to be 30 &mu;M
by varying oxygen and cofactor together, and the <i>K</i><sub>Tyr</sub>,
determined to be 22 &mu;M by varying tyrosine and oxygen together,
are their intrinsic values.  The remaining values are determined
then as coef(Tyr) = 1710 &mu;M<sup>2</sup>, coef(6MPH<sub>4</sub>) =
1730 &mu;M<sup>2</sup>, and the constant is 8.7 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>
&mu;M<sup>3</sup>.
<p>
Both product and dead-end inhibition experiments were done to determine
if tyrosine or 6MPH<sub>4</sub> bound first. 6-methyl-7,8-dihydropterin
(the oxidized cofactor) was found to be competitive with its reduced
form (6-methyltetrahydopterin; 6MPH<sub>4</sub)) and noncompetitive
with tyrosine.  Norepinephrine demonstrated typical catechol class
competitive inhibition with cofactor. 3-iodotyrosine was competitive with
tyrosine, and uncompetitive with cofactor.  DOPA was noncompetitive with
both cofactor and tyrosine.  The transition state analogue
4a-hydroxytetrahydropterin is unstable in solution and so cannot be
tested as an inhibitor.  All results are consistent with the addition
first of 6MPH<sub>4</sub> (cofactor), followed by tyrosine.  The
noncompetitive inhibition data with DOPA suggests it is the first
product released, followed by the oxidized dihydropterin.

Effects of peptides of the secretin-glucagon family and cyclic
nucleotides on tyrosine hydroxylase activity in sympathetic nerve endings
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Previous studies have shown
that certain peptides of the secretin-glucagon family stimulate tyrosine
hydroxylase activity in sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical
ganglion and three of its end organs, i.e., the iris, pineal gland, and
submaxillary gland. To determine whether a similar regulation occurs in
other sympathetic neurons, the effects of two of these peptides, secretin
and vasoactive intestinal peptide, were examined in the right cardiac
ventricle of the rat, a tissue innervated primarily by the middle and
inferior cervical ganglia. Both peptides stimulated tyrosine hydroxylase
activity, measured in situ, in this tissue. In addition, several second
messenger systems were investigated as possible mediators of this
peptidergic stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in autonomic end
organs. 8-Bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and forskolin elevated
tyrosine hydroxylase activity in slices of both the right ventricle and
the submaxillary gland. 8-Bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate also
stimulated tyrosine hydroxylase activity in both tissues, whereas
nitroprusside stimulated activity only in the submaxillary slices.
Furthermore, the phosphodiesterase inhibitors 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine
and/or Ro 20-1724 potentiated the stimulation by secretin, as well as the
stimulations by forskolin and nitroprusside. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate also
stimulated tyrosine hydroxylase activity in cardiac and submaxillary
slices; however, no potentiation of these effects was seen following
addition of either phosphodiesterase inhibitor. These data, taken together
with those of previous studies, suggest a role for a cyclic nucleotide,
probably adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, in the peptidergic
stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in sympathetic nerve
terminals.

Note that the standard errors, included in the

using Cleland's <i>v</i>=VAB/(AB + AK<sub>b</sub> + BK<sub>a</sub> +
K<sub>ia</sub>K<sub>b</sub>) with the exception of
tryptophan in which <i>v</i>=VAB/(AB + AK<sub>b</sub> +
BK<sub>a</sub>) fit best.
Racemic mixtures were used for some amino acids, and
it was assumed that only the L-isomer was available.

<p style="text-indent:0;">
Observed rates were all dependent upon enzyme
concentrations (enzyme = a rat TH recombinant expressed in baculovirus and
purified from infected insect cell extracts).
There was no turnover in the absence of added amino
acids or in the presence of saturating amounts of the competitive
inhibitor, 3-iodotyrosine.  Hence measured
rates were the result of catalysis by TH.
The fitting of the data for all but tryptophan suggests a sequential
kinetic mechanism, where the tryptophan data suggests a ping-pong
mechanism.  Substrate inhibition is found at
high concentrations of all amino acids except 4-methoxyphenylalanine,
which has a low solubility and permits studies only up to 2 mM.
There is no turnover with 3-pyridylalanine.
Differences in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> are not very significant, with the only significant
change with the large tryptophan molecule.
Some size effects are reflected in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value as well.
<p>Compounds presumed to represent transition-state
analogues were tested for their ability to inhibit TH.
If the mechanism of oxidation starts with the logical
removal of the phenolic proton on tyrosine to activate the aromatic ring,
then the resulting phenoxide should bind more tightly than the protonated
form.  4-Pyridylalanine N-oxide (I) was
tested as a mimic.  An intermediate
hydroxycyclohexadienone species is postulated as a keto intermediate of
the dihydroxylated product, so the analogues 4-hydroxy-3-pyridylalanine
N-oxide (II) and 3-[N-(3'-HO-4'-pyridone)]-2-aminopropionic acid (III) are
tested as well.  Bovine adrenal TH was used
instead of the rat recombinant since ferrous ammonium sulfate affects the
stability of II and III but is necessary for rat enzyme activity.
Several reversible pyridylalanine inhibitors
were used as well against the varying concentrations (20-200 &mu;M) of
tyrosine.  All compounds proved to be weaker
inhibitors than DOPA itself, except for phenylalanine, which was
comparable.

   alt="drawn structure of tyrosine-like inhibitors">

<p>
The pH dependence on steady-state kinetic
parameters of TH has been shown recently.
The <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>-pH profile is bell-shaped
which suggests possibly acid or base catalysis being involved.
If a peroxypterin and tyrosine hydroxylation is to
occur, proton transfers are a must.  If the
solvent is involved in the transfer, catalytic rates will be altered in a
D<sub>2</sub>O solvent due to isotope effects on
rate exchange.  Examination of V<sub>
max</sub> and V/K<sub>tyr</sub> at initial velocity rates in a pH and pD range from
6 to 8 (using 6-methyltetrahydropterin and oxygen at varied tyrosine
concentration) shows (H/D)<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and
(H/D)V/K<sub>tyr</sub> ratios of 1.0 and 1.1,
resp.  Hence no solvent-exchangeable proton
is transferred in the rate-limiting step.
The effects of D<sub>2</sub>O on the pK<sub>
a</sub> is normal.
<p><u>Discussion</u>.
Changes in the substitution of the amino acid ring show that turnover by
TH is unaffected by this property (comparable <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> data).
Tyrosine is
found to be the last substrate to bind.  The
V/K<sub>tyr</sub> value reflects the value of all
rate constants for all steps from binding through the first irreversible
step.  Only with increasing size of the para
position is a decreased affinity observed.
A general lack of acid-base chemistry is seen, consistent with observation
of a primary isotope effect on the reaction;
this suggests an attack by an electrophilic oxygen
species, but if this occurred in a slow step, a wide range of
significantly different <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values
should be observed.  Dehydration of the
4a-hydroxytetrahydropterin to the quinoid dihydropterin, limiting for the
action of phenylalanine hydroxylase, is unlikely for TH: (i) dehydration
is typically limiting where conditions of low tetrahydropterin
concentrations and high levels of enzyme (PAH), where the need for
dehydration to the quinonoid dihydropterin before reduction by
dihydropteridine reductase limits the amount of BH<sub>4</sub> available.
These experiments were done with initial rate conditions making such recycling
unnecessary.  (ii) Dehydration rates of a
hydroxytetrahydropterin would be pH dependent.
It is more rapid at pH 6.5 than at pH 8 and above,
typical for PAH assay conditions.  (iii)
Detection of the hydroxypterin as a TH product is difficult, requiring 20-
to 50-fold higher enzyme concentrations higher than those used in the
studies.  (iv) The kinetic constants for
tyrosine and 3-OH-phenylalanine were indistinguishable from values
determined by measuring the rate of DOPA production directly.
<p>Substrate specificity of TH is not strictly
known.  Contradictory results have been
obtained using phenylalanine.  Purified
bovine enzyme has been reported by two groups to produce tyrosine, and a
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> similar to tyrosine is reported
by one (similar to data in this report).
Another has reported formation of 3-hydroxyphenylalanine, which was found
in this work, but tyrosine/3-hydroxyphenylalanine product ratio is about
25.  Rat TH could not convert phenylalanine
at all, as shown by two other groups, but did work well on tryptophan.
<p>Solvent isotope effects are not seen as well.
Formation of a hydroxylated amino acid requires
transfer of exchangeable protons, but formation of another hydroxylating
intermediate, such as a peroxytetrahydropterin does not.
The rate-limiting step has been shown for phenol
hydroxylases which are pterin-dependent:
reduced flavins and tetrahydropterins react with molecular oxygen to form
the semiquinone and superoxide.  Subsequent
reaction of the radical pair and proton transfer to form the peroxy
cofactor are rapid.  This mechanism
involving no initial acid-base catalysis requirement is confirmed by
reaction of 4-methoxyphenylalanine with TH (the ether can form no
phenoxide) and by the inability of transition state analogue III, the
phenoxide intermediate, to inhibit the reaction.
<p>The proposed hydroxycyclohexadienone transition
state intermediate was tested.  There was a
weak inhibition, but it might have been stronger if the pyridyl ring
accounted for the difference in affinity for the natural cofactor and this
inhibitor.  Uncoupled oxidation of
tetrahydropterin clearly does not occur without the amino acid, and the
amino acid may specifically induce a conformational change in the enzyme
which brings it into reactive proximity with the oxidizing cofactor.
<p>In another possible mechanism, tyrosine would be
oxidized to form a hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical.
Transfer of an H atom would form the dihydroxylated
product.  The transition analogues II and
III would not be expected to inhibit in this case.
Also, homolytic cleavage of a peroxyhydropterin to
form a hydroxyl radical reactive to the amino acid is possible (hydroxide
radicals formed from peroxides are known to form in the presence of
transition metals).

&omega;-Conotoxin inhibits the acute
activation of tyrosine hydroxylase and the stimulation of norepinephrine
release by potassium depolarization of sympathetic nerve endings
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Increased Ca2+ influx serves
as a signal that initiates multiple biochemical and physiological events
in neurons following depolarization. The most widely studied of these
phenomena is the release of neurotransmitters. In sympathetic neurons,
depolarization also increases the rate of synthesis of the transmitter
norepinephrine (NE), via an activation of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH), and this effect also seems to involve Ca2+ entry. We have examined
whether the mechanism of Ca2+ entry relevant to TH activation is via
voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and, if so, whether the type of Ca2+
channel involved is the same as that involved in the stimulation of NE
release. We have investigated the isolated rat iris, allowing us to
examine transmitter biosynthesis and release in sympathetic nerve
terminals in the absence of sympathetic cell bodies and dendrites.
Potassium depolarization produced a three- to fivefold increase in TH
activity and an approximately 100-fold increase in NE release. Both
effects were dependent on Ca2+ being present in the extracellular medium,
and both were inhibited by omega-conotoxin (1 microM), which inhibits
N-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. In contrast, the dihydropyridine
nimodipine (1-3 microM), which blocks L-type Ca2+ channels, had no effect
on either measure. These data support the hypothesis that increases in NE
biosynthesis and release in sympathetic nerve terminals during periods of
depolarization are both initiated by an influx of Ca2+ through
voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and that a similar type of Ca2+ channel is
involved in both processes.

heparin-Sepharose using a linear NaCl gradient to elute, then
butyl-Sepharose using a descending linear ammonium sulfate gradient, then
a Sepharcryl S-300 column to produce a single peak.

determination was made for TH-2.  The data
show that TH expressed in this system is tetrameric and not subjected to
degradation found in the expression of exogenous proteins in <i>E coli</i>
(this is because this strain does not express the <i>lon</i> and
<i>ompT</i> proteases).
Also, post-translational processing in bacteria is
absent, as even the rat recombinant is supposedly N-terminal blocked; the
comparable activities and tetrameric structure in the bacterial system
suggest such processing as found in eukaryotes is nonessential.
<p>Protein stability was assessed in the
recombinants.  First the pH optimum was
assessed by incubating TH-1 at different pH values for 2 hr at either 0&deg;
or 30&deg;.  Two buffers were used to cover the
range of pH from 5 to 9, and activity was measured at pH 7.5 with added
FeAmSO<sub>4</sub>.
For the higher temperature, a distinct optimum was
seen at pH 7.0, seen before with both TH-1 and TH-2.
At the cold temperature, TH-1 stability was virtually
unaffected by pH.  The pH stability profiles
for TH-2 and -4 at both temperatures were nearly identical to the TH-1
profile.
<p>As the recombinant isozymes were isolated using
EDTA-containing buffers, a metal analysis revealed a low content for both
iron and zinc metal.  TH-1 was dialyzed 24 h
at 4&deg; in a 1 mM dipicolinic acid metal chelator buffered solution to see
if what little metal present (only 0.04 mol Fe/ and 0.02 mol Zn/mol
subunit) was extractable and it was not.
Therefore a TH activity determination of TH-1 was made for a dose course
of FeAmSO<sub>4</sub>:
as little as 1 &mu;M caused a 40-fold increase in
activity.  Even after incubation with the
metal chelator, the dose course profile of activation remained the
same.  Our work is in contrast with previous
studies (Ishii et al) which show that TH transiently expressed in COS
cells and only TH-2 (not TH-1) benefitting from Fe addition.
Another group has shown that brain TH is stimulated
with Fe(II) addition indicating that metal may be limiting under basal
conditions; our data show that a significant amount of TH may be present
as apoenzyme in vivo.
<p>The effect of other transition metals (Zn(II),
Co(II), Ni(II)) is known as they are potent inhibitors of TH.
This inhibition is very pronounced if incubation is
done for a time prior to assay (about 10 min).
TH activity was measured over a dose course of added
salts of the three metals above for TH-1 in which metal is added 10 min
before assay or at the start of assay.  The
order of effectiveness of inhibition showed Zn the most potent, then Co,
then Ni.  10 &mu;M ZnSO<sub>
4</sub> produced an 85% inhibition.
All metals produced effective and complete inhibition
at 0.5 mM.  Specific Fe(II) and Fe(III)
chelators also were effective:  1 mM
1,10-phenanthroline completely inhibited the enzyme.
The relative potency of these inhibitors at 1mM, pH
7.5 was 1,10-phenanthroline &gt; bathophenanthroline &gt; tiron &gt;
noradrenaline &gt; dipicolinic acid &gt; EDTA &gt; ethylenediamine.
<p>To ascertain that the recombinant TH was binding
added iron, binding studies were conducted.
The studies were done at pH 5.4-6.5 since iron salts have problems with
stability and solubility at neutral pH; nonspecific binding of iron and
zinc occurs at pH &gt; 6.0 (seen in preliminary work); and the enzyme was
found stable as shown above in the range pH 5-9.
Enzymes were incubated at different concentrations of
<sup>59</sup>Fe(II) and <sup>65</sup>Zn(II) (range 0.2 to 15 &mu;M)
and the free and bound
metal ions separated by rapid ultrafiltration.
A Scatchard plot was constructed for TH-1 binding to
Fe(II) and Zn(II) and for TH-4 binding to Zn(II).
Data shows the stoichiometry of binding to be 1.0
metal atom/subunit with no sign of cooperative binding.
The time course of Fe(II) binding and changes in
enzyme activity to TH-1 were assessed too, and both remained constant
throughout the 90 min period as the metal binds very rapidly.
Competitive binding studies using a 1000-fold excess
unlabeled Fe(II) or Zn(II) effectively eliminated binding by the labeled
Fe or Zn, indicating the validity of the results.
<p>
Metal dissociation-exchange studies were conducted
using TH labeled with either <sup>55</sup>Fe(II),
<sup>59</sup>Fe(II), or <sup>65</sup>Zn(II) by incubating the enzyme
(40 &mu;M) with 0.5 mM
of other ion in a MES-KOH pH 6.0 buffer for 20 min at 0&deg;.
Enzyme was then isolated by rapid gel filtration at pH
7.5 and results indicated 0.35 atom Fe and 0.33 atom Zn/subunit.
This dissociation was pH-dependent with both
metals showing similar profiles, with the amount of free metal declining
at the higher pH.  Control studies with free
<sup>65</sup>Zn(II) and <sup>55</sup>Fe(III) indicated that part
of this profile can be
explained by Fe(III)hydroxide precipitation (but not Zn(II)hydroxide) at
pH &gt; 7.  With 0.1 mM norepinephrine
present the dissociation profile for iron was not changed.
However, with 1 mM DTT present, both zinc and iron
release were increased at the neutral and alkaline pH.
At pH 7.5 and 25&deg; about 65% of the bound <sup>59</sup>Fe was
released after 2 h.
If EDTA, dipicolinic acid, 1,10-phenanthroline,
bathophenanthroline, or tiron were present, the fraction of free
<sup>59</sup>Fe increased.
Catechol-type iron chelators were much less effective
and decreased the rate of dissociation.
Dissociation of Fe and Zn show pseudo-first order kinetics and temperature
dependence.  At pH 7.0 in 1 mM EDTA, the
rate constant for release of Zn atom was 0.018 min<sup>-1</sup> at 20&deg;.
<p>
The data showing the effect of DTT above on
increased release of metal was further explored.
Enzyme was incubated in HEPES-KOH at pH 8.5 for the
time and temperature above in a log dose course of DTT and the release of
labeled Fe or Zn measured.  The data show
that with increased DTT concentration there is a greater metal
release.  Enzyme was also incubated with
natural cofactor, (6<i>R</i>)-tetrahydrobiopterin, and was
also shown to cause a concentration-dependent release of <sup>55</sup>Fe
from TH-1 (60% increase at 0.1 mM
tetrahydrobiopterin pH 7.5).
<p>
Both very pure bovine and rat TH have a
characteristic blue-green color because of an iron-catecholamine
coordination complex.  Fitzpatrick et al.
have reported that highly concentrated recombinant rat TH expressed in
baculovirus is colorless.  An absorption
spectrum of pure recombinant TH-1 from 300 to 800 nm also shows this form
of TH to be colorless.  Addition of dopamine
did not alter this spectrum.  However, when
Fe(II) ammonium sulfate was added together in equimolar amounts with
dopamine, distinct absorption peaks are observed, a prominent one at 680
nm.  The absorption coefficient at 680 nm is
&epsilon; = 2.0 (mM enzyme)<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>, close to
that observed for purified bovine adrenal TH,
&epsilon;<sub>700</sub> = 1.9 (mM enzyme)<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>.

Phosphorylation of rat tyrosine hydroxylase and its model
peptides in vitro by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
Kinetic parameters for phosphorylation of TH by PK-A were
determined with particular attention to maintain initial velocities.
A <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of
7.1 &mu;mol/min/mg PK-A C subunit and <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
of 136 &mu;M protein was found.  TH activity
optimum pH has been found to be pH 6, suggesting conformational changes in
TH which would affect its phosphorylation by PK-A.
However, at pH 6, 7, and 8, there are no differences
in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> or <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.  Some protein
substrates are phosphorylated with a dependence upon [Mg<sup>2+</sup>],
but no such sensitivity to Mg<sup>2+</sup> is shown here.
<p>
Concentration of the pterin cofactor
(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>-biopterin) was varied to
determine its effect on influencing PK-A phosphorylation of TH.
Along with the tyrosine substrate and product
inhibitors, DOPA and NE, there was no effect.
<p>
Various protein and peptide substrates were tested
using PK-A C subunit (5 nM) under strict conditions of initial velocity
determination (the assay time is only 2 min).
Under these conditions, only 2.3% of the TH is
phosphorylated while Kemptide is 23% phosphorylated (a previous group
determined it to be 25%).  When various
synthetic peptides of TH corresponding to actual or potential
phosphorylation sites were used, it was found that peptides containing
serine-40 were phosphorylated the best (with range of <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
equal to 108 to 183 &mu;M and range of <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> between
4.7 and 7.1 &mu;mol/min/mg).  Peptide TH<sup>150-157</sup>,
with a consensus site for PK-A (RRVSDDVR) was also phosphorylated with a
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of 3.4 &mu;mol/min/mg, but the
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 9300 &mu;M was very high for good substrates.
TH<sup>169-176</sup> (RKVSELDK) was not phosphorylated at all.
TH<sup>15-24</sup> (RRAVSEQDAK), which would be a good PK-A site
if the Ser were not <u>two</u> amino acids removed from the
Arg-Arg pair, showed a decent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> but a poor
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.  With TH<sup>37-46</sup> (RRQSLIEDAR) being the
best peptide among the three Ser-40 peptides tested (because it
had the minimal number of amino acids with a good <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>), a hypothesis explaining the
differences in kinase kinetic parameters is put forward suggesting that
carboxyl-side amino acids (1 or 2 positions downstream) also influence Ser
phosphorylation, namely the aliphatic amino acids such as Leu, Val, or Ile
(at the <i>i+2</i> positions) do not
interfere with phosphorylation as much as acidic residues (Glu, Asp).

Allosteric effect of tetrahydrobiopterin cofactors on

indicated that biopterin might be the regulatory factor of the enzyme

the stereochemical structure of (6R)BH4, the naturally-occurring cofactor,
took an important role on the kinetical properties of the enzyme in

PC-12h cells were grown in Cosmedium-001 (Cosmo-Bio)

Genes for human catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Catecholamine
neurotransmitters--dopamine, noradrenaline (norepinephrine), adrenaline
(epinephrine)--are synthesized in catecholaminergic neurons from tyrosine,
via dopa, dopamine and noradrenaline, to adrenaline. Four enzymes are
involved in the biosynthesis of adrenaline: (1) tyrosine 3-mono-oxygenase
(tyrosine hydroxylase, TH); (2) aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC,
or DOPA decarboxylase, DDC); (3) dopamine beta-mono-oxygenase (dopamine
beta-hydroxylase, DBH); and (4) noradrenaline N-methyltransferase
(phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, PNMT). We cloned full-length
complementary DNAs (cDNAs) and genomic DNAs of human
catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes (TH, AADC, DBH, PNMT) and determined
the nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences. We
discovered multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of human TH, human DBH, and
human PNMT. Four types (types 1, 2, 3, and 4) of human TH mRNAs are
produced by alternative mRNA splicing mechanism from a single gene. We
found the multiple forms of TH in two species of monkeys, but only a
single mRNA corresponding to human TH type 1 in Sunkus murinus and rat,
suggesting that the multiplicity of TH mRNA is primate-specific. Total TH
mRNA, especially the most abundant type 2 and type 1 mRNAs in the human
brain, were found to be reduced during the process of aging. The multiple
forms of human TH may give additional regulation to the human enzyme,
probably through altered phosphorylation and activation. We have succeeded
in producing transgenic mice carrying multiple copies of the human TH gene
in brain and adrenal medulla. The level of human TH mRNA in brain was
about 50-fold higher than that of endogenous mouse TH mRNA. In situ
hybridization demonstrated an enormous region-specific expression of the
transgene in substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. TH
immunoreactivity in these regions, Western blot analysis, and TH activity
measurements proved definitely increased TH in transgenic mice, though not
comparable to the increment of the mRNA. However, catecholamine levels in
transgenics were not significantly different from those in
non-transgenics. The results suggest complex regulatory mechanisms for
human TH gene expression and for the catecholamine levels in transgenic
mice. Kohsaka and Uchida in collaboration with us applied genetically
engineered (human TH cDNA-transfected) non-neuronal cells to brain tissue
transplantation in parkinsonian rat models. We isolated and sequenced a
full-length cDNA encoding human AADC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Tyrosine hydroxylase in rat brain dopaminergic nerve
terminals:<br>
multiple-site phosphorylation <i>in vivo</i> and in
synaptosomes
<p class="Para1">
<u>Identity between TH phosphorylation sites in rat brain
and PC12 cells</u>.  Rat brain striata were
prelabeled in vivo with 0.5 to 2 mCi <sup>
32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> and extracts
were treated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-TH to reveal a labeled
M<sub>r</sub> ~62,000 band.
TH labeling of the 62 kDa product cannot be discerned
without immunoprecipitation.  Immunoblots of
striatal extracts processed according to the in vivo protocol or the
protocol for synaptosome isolation which were developed with
affinity-purified sheep anti-TH also revealed an
M<sub>r</sub> ~62,000 band.  Tryptic
peptides of immunoprecipitated and digested TH labeled in vivo were
separated on HPLC or 2-D TLE/C.  HPLC
separation of either the in vivo labeled or synaptosome labeled TH tryptic
peptides produced identical elution patterns anyway:
five labeled peaks were observed (CS-1 through
CS-5).  The HPLC profile also matched in
appearance with the in situ labeling studies of TH with PC12 cells
(Haycock, 1990), and it could be inferred that CS-1 and -2 are Ser-19,
CS-3 is Ser-31, CS-4 is Ser-8 and CS-5 is Ser-40.
Phosphoamino acid analysis shows that P-Ser is the
only phosphoamino acid present.  The 2-D
TLE/C showed 5 spots matching the pattern seen with PC12 cells.
TLIEF on Servalyt Precotes 3-10 allowed the
following pI assignments:  CS-1, ~3.1;
CS-2, ~3.8; CS-3, 3.5; CS-4, 5.0-5.5; CS-5,
4.0-4.2.
<p>Six cycles of Edman sequencing were done manually,
and subtractive analysis was done to allow identification of the P-Ser
site.  After each cycle, the reaction
products were subjected to electrophoresis at pH 8.9 or 1.9.
Single phosphorylation sites for CS-1, -2, and -5 were
indicated after 3, 4, and 3 cycles, resp.
No sites after 6 cycles were revealed by CS-3 and -4.
With the PC12 cells, the phosphorylation sites were 3,
4, 7, 7, and 3 for the corresponding five peptides, so the similarities
are striking.  Other similarities of the
phosphorylation site analysis was tested by digesting these tryptic
peptides a second time with endoproteinase AspN or endoproteinase GluC and
re-chromatographing the double digests on HPLC.
<p>
<u><sup>32</sup>P incorporation into TH in vivo</u>.  The
medial forebrain bundle, preincubated in <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>, was
electrically stimulated using conditions described previously which had
resulted in TH activation and catecholamine biosynthetic rate
increases.  Incorporation of phosphate was
increased 91% relative to controls in 16 of 17 rats.
Unstimulated striata showed a distribution of label
incorporation as follows:  Ser-19, 26%;
Ser-31, 57%; Ser-8, 4%; Ser-40, 14% (result of 9 exp).
With electrical stimulation, the distribution (%
relative to controls) was:  Ser-19, 236%;
Ser-31, 176%; Ser-40, 194% (also result of 9 exp.).
The increase in Ser-8 was 109% of control, determined
in only 5 rats.  It is noteworthy that a
consideration of the <sup>32</sup>P-Ser-19/<sup>32</sup>P-Ser-31
ratio shows that electrical stimulation of
rat tissue in one author's laboratory produced a decrease in the ratio
while in the other author's laboratory a consistent increase was
observed.  Previous work has shown that
<sup>32</sup>P incorporation of Ser-19 in
electrically stimulated tissue decreased relative to incorporation into
Ser-31.
<p>The effect of depolarization was logically
determined by treatment with 40 mM K<sup>+</sup>
(for 30 s) and with veratridine, previously shown to increase Ser-19
phosphate incorporation.  The time of
incubation was clearly significant:  &lt;5 s
duration restricted incorporation into Ser-19, but longer (up to 4 min)
incubations also increased Ser-31 phosphate content.
With the K<sup>+</sup>
treatment time increased to that of electrically stimulated tissue,
Ser-31/Ser-19 increased.  With some
differences in how tissue samples are handled (perfused rat adrenal,
electrode-attached median forebrain bundles, cultured chromaffin cells),
the different effects of phosphate incorporation into the various sites
are accounted for.
<p>The effect of (or interference by) cAMP-acting
substances was assessed to ensure that Ser-40 phosphorylation was a factor
in the response.  PC12 cells have been shown
to release adenosine which acts in an autocrine fashion by elevating cAMP
levels via A<sub>2</sub> receptors and increase
Ser-40 phosphate.  Synaptosome treatment
with 10 &mu;M 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine for 15 min (this cmpnd mimics
adenosine), with 20 &mu;M 2-chloroadenosine for 10 min (in either the
presence or absence of 0.4 U/ml adenosine deaminase), or with 100 &mu;M
theophylline for 5-15 min did not effect the results of phosphate
incorporation into TH during depolarization.
The inclusion of adenosine deaminase or theophylline
alone during the labeling period was also without alteration of the effect
of basal or K-stimulation.  Vasoactive
intestinal peptide, shown to enhance Ser-40 phosphorylation in PC12 cells,
superior cervical ganglia, and perfused rat adrenals, was completely
without effect in these studies.
Observation that Ser-40 phosphorylation did occur with TH activation upon
treatment with forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, or Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP was
confirmatory that cAMP messenger systems were intact in the study.
<p>
It had been shown in PC12 cells that Ser-31
phosphorylation increased in response to NGF and phorbol esters.
For the striatal synaptosomes, 1 &mu;M phorbol
12,13-dibutyrate after 5 min could be observed to increase Ser-31
phosphorylation, although 50 ng/ml NGF after 5-15 min did not.
Okadaic acid (1 &mu;M, 15 min) increased incorporation
into all 4 sites of the striatal synaptosomal TH for the time period, as
previously shown for PC12 cells.

<b>Abstract</b>: Limited proteolysis of

having Mrs of approximately 57,000 and 56,000 in SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence, Ser-Pro-Arg-Phe-Val,
of the 56-kDa species indicated that calpain cleaved off the N-terminal
region (residues 1-30) encoded by the first exon including Ser-8 and
Ser-19, the phosphorylation sites by proline-directed protein kinase
(PDPK) and by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (kinase II),
respectively, from the native TH. The removal of the N-terminal region
from the native molecule induced a slight but significant activation of TH
at pH 7.0. The native TH behaved as the tetramer with an Mr of 240,000. In
contrast, calpain-cleaved TH showed the monomeric Mr by gel permeation
chromatography and increased Ki for catecholamine which inhibits the
native TH in competition to the coenzyme,
DL-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (6MPH4). These results imply that
calpain cleavage would effectively release TH from the feedback inhibition
by removal of the N-terminal region resulting in disruption of the
quaternary structure.

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide induces tyrosine hydroxylase in PC12 cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Physiological stress induces
tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine
biosynthesis, via trans-synaptic mechanisms within the adrenal medulla.
Previous studies have implicated cAMP as a second messenger capable of
inducing tyrosine hydroxylase; however, it is unclear whether any receptor
coupled to adenylate cyclase mediates tyrosine hydroxylase induction.
Recently, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, whose receptor is coupled to
adenylate cyclase in many tissues, has been shown to meet many of the
criteria for a neuromodulator within the adrenal medulla. We therefore
undertook a series of studies to determine whether vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide may induce tyrosine hydroxylase in PC12 cells, a cell line
derived from rat adrenal medulla. Here we report that vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide produces a transient, time- and
concentration-dependent increase in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels which
is followed by a stable increase in tyrosine hydroxylase protein. The
increase in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA does not occur in a mutant PC12 cell
line deficient in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, indicating that
the effect of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is mediated through the
cAMP second messenger pathway. This is the first report demonstrating that
a neuromodulator which acts on an adenylate cyclase-coupled receptor can
induce tyrosine hydroxylase.
<p>
The total RNA of PC12 cells was denatured in formaldehyde and
immobilized on nylon (GeneScreen) using the Bio-Rad slot-blot apparatus,
and hybridized with TH.36 cDNA which had been nick-translated
in the presence of <sup>32</sup>P-ATP.  PC12 cells (grown in 1:1
DMEM:Ham's F-12 with 5% horse and 10% fetal bovine sera at
200,000-300,000 cells/35 mm well in a 6-well plate 24-48 h before
treatment) were treated with VIP at different log (from 1 nM to 30 &mu;M)
concentrations (all reactions include a 30 min pre-incubation with
50 &mu;M theophylline to inhibit the autocrine effect of adenosine
on affecting cAMP levels).  Changes in TH mRNA levels are seen with
the slot-blot after 6 h treatment.  At 10 &mu;M VIP, the TH mRNA is
more than doubled.  Similar results are seen with 10 &mu;M forskolin
and 1 &mu;M dexamethasone.  A significant increase is detected with as
little as 10 nM VIP, maximal by 20 &mu;M VIP.  This response mirrors
the response of the activation of both adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP-dependent
protein kinase (PK-A) in PC12 cells caused by VIP treatment.   This
response is also consistent with reports of adenylate cyclase activation
caused by VIP in the frontal cortex and sympathetic ganglia.
<p>
The time course of induction was also followed.  At 10 &mu;M VIP,
a significant increase is seen by 2 h, maximal at 6 h (with a plateau
between 3 and 5 h), and returning to baseline by 24 h.  Changes in
TH protein expression were followed to see if translation mirrors
transcription:  after 9 h significant increase is first seen.
Despite the decline in mRNA levels, protein levels reached maximal
by 24 h and were steady by the last time point at 48 h.  The time
course of protein induction is consistent with gene expression of
other proteins, but the transcription time profile was more rapid:
this may be due to special rapid gene expression system devoted to
the function of a tissue like the adrenal gland.  There is a report
that transcriptional increases were detectable within 30 min of
electrical stimulation of human thoracic sympathetic ganglia in vivo.
The decline in mRNA level is not due to any instability in VIP itself
(confirmed by HPLC analysis of sampled media);  moreover, this
decline in mRNA has been seen with other depolarizing agents that
induce mRNA increases.
<p>
A126-1B2 is a mutant PC12 cell line deficient in PK-A activity.
Cells of the mutant stimulated with 0.1 mM dibutyryl cAMP had only
30% of the PK-A activity of the wild-type (also reported elsewhere).
Dibutyryl cAMP can normally induce ornithine decarboxylase in the wild-type,
but induction is reportedly completely blocked in the mutant, despite
residual PK-A activity.  10 &mu;M VIP or forskolin were incubated
with wild-type, and the increases in mRNA were typical.  However
there were no detectable increases in TH mRNA with the mutant cell
line.  Dexamethasone induces TH gene transcription in a cAMP-independent
manner and was tested as a positive control:  the induced increase in
wild-type and mutant cell were nearly identical via the glucocorticoid
receptor-mediated pathway.
<p>
8-Br-cAMP has already been shown to induce TH gene expression in bovine
chromaffin and PC18 cells, and a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) is
found in the 5' regulatory region of the TH gene.  Although nicotinic
stimulation is shown to induce TH gene expression, the link is not
mediated within the cell directly.  Instead, VIP or ATP released
through the chromaffin granule could stimulate this action in an
autocrine manner.

Different effects on activity caused by phosphorylation
of tyrosine hydroxylase at serine 40 by three multifunctional protein
kinases
<p class="Para1">
TH was purified from PC12 cells using a method developed
in 1982 in this laboratory.  The enzyme was
then incubated with three common kinases:
(i) PK-A, 0.78 mol P/mol subunit, (ii) PK-C, 0.43 mol P/mol and (iii)
CaM-MPK II, 1.19 mol P/mol.  Further
additions of enzyme did not change the value of the incorporation,
indicating maximal level.  Values of
incorportation have been reported to range from 0.6 to 1.3 mol P for PK-A,
0.5 to 0.7 mol P/mol for PK-C, and 0.8 to 1.3 for CaM-MPK II.
This variability may be attributed to enzyme purity,
different experimental conditions, uncertainty of protein
determination.  Protein concentration of TH
used in this study was done using a known absorption coefficient of
A<sub>280</sub> = 0.992 at 1 mg/ml/cm.
This is calculated from the content of stable
amino acids Ala, Leu, and Val, as determined by amino acid analysis, and
from those obtained from the predicted sequence using 55,835 for the
subunit, arrived at by substracting the weight of the initial methionine
residue from 55,966 estimated from Grima et al. predicted sequence
data.  Lowry determinations resulted in
overestimations of protein content by 1.34 with BSA as standard.
Phosphorylation sites of maximally
phosphorylated TH by these kinases were determined by HPLC of tryptic
phosphopeptides.  Chromatograms reveal both
OD @ 215 nm as well as radioactivity.
Elution with acetonitrile was with a program of 0.5 ml/min flow rate,
0-15% MeCN for first 30 min, 15-25% for next 50 min, 25-40% for next 30
min, and 40-100% for next 10 min.  0.25 mL
fractions were collected.  For PK-A, a
single radiolabeled peak at 60 min (19-20% MeCN) eluted, designated as
peak II;  for PK-C, this same peak plus 4
minor peaks at 39 (~14%)--designated as peak I, 43 (~15%), 45-46 (~16%),
58-59 (~19-20%) min. were eluted.  For
CaM-MPK II, two peaks, a major one at 39, which was peak I, and half as
labeled one at 60 min, which is clearly peak II.
<p>Edman analysis of peak II is assigned to RQSLIEDAR,
with the third cycle having radioactivity (serine 40).
Peptide content was confirmed by amino acid
analysis.  The same analysis for peak I
indicated a sequence of AVSEQDAK, corresponding to serine 19.
The final results suggest that PK-A acts on Ser-40
exclusively, with PK-C making it also its primary site, and CaM-MPK II
phosphorylates primarily on Ser-19 but also on Ser-40 (ratio of
ser-40:ser-19 = 0.36-0.64).  A suggestion is
made that TH can be phosphorylated by PK-A on all four subunits, with the
other kinases phosphorylate on only two of the four.
<p>Indeed in an experiment in which TH was maximally
phosphorylated by PK-C, then PK-A was added after a time, additional
phosphate incorporation was found.  The same
was found for CaM&nbsp;MPK&nbsp;II, followed by PK-A addition.
When CaM&nbsp;MPK&nbsp;II was incubated followed by PK-C
addition, no additional incorporation was observed, suggesting
phosphorylation at the same sites by these kinases.
Activation of the enzyme was studied as well, with
plots of activation relative to control against incubation time with the
kinase.  3-fold activation by PK-A was
observed while PK-C and CaM&nbsp;MPK&nbsp;II had no effect.
That PK-A was the sole effector of this activation was
dramatized by later addition of PK-A to the other kinases, in which cases
this same dramatic activation was observed.
The CaM&nbsp;MPK&nbsp;II had calmodulin added to it, but the previously reported
"activator protein" was not added.
<p><u>Discussion</u>.
Plots of TH activation versus its phosphorylation state (mol P/mol
subunit) suggest that activation is solely dependent upon Ser-40
phosphorylation.  A linear relationship is
seen between Ser-40 subunit phosphorylation and TH activation.
Phosphorylation of the third and fourth subunits of
the homotetramer are required for an all-or-nothing activation, while
phosphorylation of the first and second subunits results in no activation,
but may make the rest of the subunits susceptible to phosphorylation.
If all the subunits are equivalent in undergoing
phosphorylation by PK-A, a sigmoidal activation curve would be observed
for phosphorylation by the third subunit while a concave curve would be
shown for the fourth subunit.  Many
possibilities exist for explaining the linear relationship between
activation and phosphorylation: half of the enzyme has been modified by a
mechanism which then allows phosphorylation at Ser-40 by PK-C or CaM MPK
II as well as PK-A without activation, while the remaining two subunits
are phosphorylated by PK-A resulting in activation.
The possibility that the half of the enzyme modifed by
PK-C and CaM&nbsp;MPK&nbsp;II may be a denatured inactive form, making the
phosphorylation possible but nonutilitarian, is unlikely because
denaturation at 30&deg; for 13 h or 100&deg; for 5 min did not permit any
additional phosphate incorporation.
<p>Limited proteolysis has been used to activate TH,
with resulting subunits of 34-40 kDa.  The
cooperativity of subunits in activation by phosphorylation is suggested by
this fact as well.

Primary structure of mouse tyrosine hydroxylase deduced from its cDNA
<p class="Para1">
As transgenic mice overexpressing human TH have been
produced recently, a knowledge of mouse TH structure becomes
important.  Mouse brain cDNA from a
&lambda;gt10 library was probed with type 4 human TH and five
of the 10<sup>6</sup> screened plaques were
positive.  EcoRI digestion produced among
the inserts the largest (&lambda;TH-1) at 1.7 kbp.
Subcloning into Bluescript KS vector (from
Stratagene) allowed dideoxy sequencing or both orientations (exonuclease
III and mung bean nuclease permitted construction of nested deletions of
various lengths).  Alignment with rat TH
showed less than a full-length clone with ca. 150 bp missing from the 5'
end.
<p>To arrive at the missing 5' end, PCR amplification
of library DNA was done but no obvious bands were observed on agarose gels
after 30 cycles. 5% of the reaction mixture was subjected to additional
PCR step, but one of the two primers was changed to bring it inside more
and improve specificity.  The primers used
included synthetic oligos coding for sequences within the
&lambda;TH-1 region and which were oriented to extend into the
missing 5' region (primers A and C) and to primers to the missing region
(B, D, and E).  Primers A, B, and C were
identical to or complementary to mouse TH cDNA while D and E were derived
using human TH.  Of the 3 two-step PCRs done
using a different combination of primers, only one DNA species was
amplified and each was cloned into pUC119 (pTH-1, pTH-2, pTH-3) and
sequenced.  Overlaps of the different
inserts and the 1.7 kb cDNA obtained originally showed perfect
matches.  A full-length cDNA was constructed
by connecting pTH-3 and &lambda;TH-1 at the PstI
site.  The polyadenylation signal,
restriction site, translational start and stop codons are all
identifiable, and there is high homology with the rat protein.
<p>(Except for two amino acid substitutions which are
not functionally conserved, Pro to Ser at position 7 to form ASSP from 6
to 9, and Ala to Thr at position 23 to form DTKQ from 22 to 25, there are
no other changes in the first 45 or so amino acids in rat or mouse
sequence.  A Ser-Pro motifs are found at
Ser-7, -31, -127, -320, -322, and -472.
Only one Thr-Pro motif is found at Thr-3.)
<p>Total RNA from mouse adrenal was analyzed on a
Northern nylon blot using full-length probe.
An estimated 1.6 kb species was observed.
But multiple types as exist in monkeys and humans can
not be resolved by Northern, so cDNA from total RNA was produced with MMLV
reverse transcriptase, and ds-DNA synthesized and amplified using PCR with
primers D, E, and Taq polymerase.  Only one
cDNA appeared on agarose gels of mouse while two types appeared in monkey
controls.

In vitro and in vivo regulation of the expression of the
tyrosine hydroxylase gene
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Preganglionic nerve
stimulation has been shown to induce delayed or long term changes in the
neuron. Different models were used to study the trans-synaptic regulation
of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH): the rat adrenal medulla (AM) and the
superior cervical ganglia (SCG). Northern blot analysis, western blot and
enzymatic assays demonstrated that the TH mRNA paralleled both an increase
in the protein amount and its enzymatic activity. Results of in vitro
transcription on nuclei isolated from AM or from SCG after treatment with
reserpine suggest that this increase in TH expression is due to an effect
on the transcriptional activity of the TH gene. Other gene, cfos, is also
induced by reserpine indicating that the TH transcription in these neurons
may be mediated by "third messengers". Several putative regulatory
elements, in particular an octamer sequence AP1 has been localized in the
promoter of TH gene. Gel shift assays with nuclear extracts from untreated
and phorbol ester treated cells strongly suggest that a protein complex
binds to this AP1 like sequence. Comparative analysis of gel shift assays
with AM nuclear extracts exhibit a similar pattern suggesting that this
AP1 site could be involved in the trans-synaptic regulation of TH.

Four forms of tyrosine hydroxylase are present in human adrenal medulla

Antibodies to rat TH, one prepared to SDS-denatured
rat TH (R anti-RTH) in rabbit and affinity-purified to TH-Sepharose, and
another prepared as a mouse monoclonal to denatured TH (M anti-RTH) and
affinity-purified from ascites by protein G-agarose, were used along with
anti-hTH antibodies prepared in rabbit to certain synthetic octapeptides
predicted from the alternate splicing of the human TH mRNA (see table

The blot for both anti-rat TH antibodies showed
a reaction discernible in bands ranging from 62,000 to 66,000:
this antibody is not predicted to distinguish between
the various human forms.  Anti-hTH-1 reacted
with a protein that was the lowest in the range (although it was very
diffuse).  Anti-hTH-2 reacted (a nice strong
signal) with the next highest band in its strip, again consistent with a
protein predicted to have slightly increased.
Reaction to anti-hTH-3 and -4 were as predicted,
although the resolution between band on anti-TH-1 and -2 and that of
anti-TH-3 and -4.
<p>Idiotypic differences in adrenal glands were
examined in six different postmortem humans.
With either of the anti-rat TH antibodies,
immunoreactivity quantitatively differed across the first five
glands.  The mouse MAb anti-rat TH was
limited to reaction with a high MW TH product in the range of 60 kDa to 67
kDa.  On the other hand the polyclonal
anti-rat TH (R anti-RTH) recognized several bands of the clearly
proteolytic products of TH, although the proteolysis was not extensive in
five of the samples.  The type-specific
antisera specific to all four forms were present in five of the samples,
and the intensity of the signals was quite similar across the different
glands.  Thus not only are the four forms
present, but they are present in the same relative proportions.
Comparisons within one given panel are valid in
a semiquantitative sense, such comparisons about the immunoreactivities
across the different anti-hTH antibodies requires normalization of the
signal to known amounts of the different forms.
Using the results of the polyclonal anti-rat
TH/<sup>125</sup>I-protein A blots, combined
levels of hTH-3 and hTH-4 and of hTH-1 and -2 could be assessed in the
different glands, with a range of 15-23% of total hTH forms for hTH-3/4 in
the individual glands examined.  This
compares to values calculated from different mRNA quantitations of 0%
(LeBourdelles et al, 1988), 12% (type 3 only) (Grima et al, 1987), and
5.2% (Coker et al, 1990).  The importance of
being able to distinguish the actual amounts of the forms present as
opposed to inferring the amount present is demonstrated here.

Comparative studies on the structure of human tyrosine
hydroxylase with those of the enzyme of various mammals

REVIEW and ANALYSIS.
<p class="Para1">
Four enzymes are involved in catecholamine biosynthesis
to adrenaline: (1) tyrosine hydroxylase converts
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>-tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) using oxygen,
iron, and (<i>erythro</i>-tetrahydropterin, (2) aromatic

converts dopamine to norepinephrine, and (4)
phenylethanolamine <i>N</i>-methyltransferase causes
transmethylation of norepinephrine to adrenaline using
<i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor.
<p>
Four types of human TH mRNA have been identified
and sequenced by cDNA cloning.  Types 1 and
2 were sequenced by Grima et al. (1987), types 3 and 4 by Nagatsu &amp;
coworkers (1987).  Types 2 and 3
contain  12 bp and 81 bp insertions,
respectively, between the 90th and 91st nucleotides of type 1 while type 4
contains both insertions at that point.
Southern analysis of genomic DNA and cloning of genomic TH show only one
gene per haploid genome, so these types must result from alternate
splicing of the primary transcript.  Genomic
cloning of human TH by O'Malley et al. (1987), Le Bourdelles et al.
(1988), and Kobayashi et al. (1988) all show a 8.5 kb gene with 14 exons
(13 introns).  Analysis shows that the 81-bp
insert comes from one exon, but that the 12-bp insert comes from the last
part of the 1st exon.
<p>Expression of all four types has been shown
(unpublished) in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus of the human
brain and in the adrenal medulla.  Other
mammals show a TH cDNA homology only to human type 1, and express only one
form.  COS cells transfected with each of
the four types express immunoblotted bands at 61, 61, 65, and 65 kDa
respectively and also had TH activity.
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values were all similar, but type 1
had better overall activity.  DNA sequence
analysis shows that exons 1, 5, and 9 all had the highest amino acid
conservation, indicating their importance to the enzyme.
In fact, exon 9 of TH and exon 9 of human
phenylalanine hydroxylase had excellent homology, indicating its role in
forming part of the active site which does not necessarily involve
substrate binding.  Conservation of 8 of 9
Cys residues in the C-terminal domain between rat and human enzyme
indicates the importance intra- or interchain disulfide bonding.

Stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase gene transcription
rate by nicotine in rat adrenal medulla
<p class="Para1">
Materials used in these studies include plasmid pTH.4,
containing about 400 bp encoding the 3' end of rat TH mRNA.
A <i>Kpn</i>I fragment 280 bp long corresponds to bp 1240 to 1521
of rat TH cDNA.  pTHg6.3 is ~6300 bp encoding the TH gene, which
was constructed by utilizing genomic DNA was isolated from rat liver
library constructed in Charon 35 to obtain a KpnI-EcoRI segment starting
-800 bp upstream the transcription start site extending into exon 11 of
the coding region, then inserting into pGEM7Zf.  Restriction mapping
and Southern analysis indicate identity to clones used by others.
Plasmid pACT1.1 is a recombinant containing 1140 bp of the coding
region of mouse &alpha;-actin cDNA.
<p>
Nuclei isolated from adrenal medulla and cortex were tested for
transcriptional rate synthesis of TH and actin genes.  Re-initiation
of RNA pol II-dependent transcription is considered low in isolated
nuclei, so this is thought to measure "run-on" synthesis forming
initiation complexes with specific genes in the intact tissue.  Run-on
synthesis is therefore a measure of transcription rate since is provides
an estimate of the number of RNA polymerases bound to specific genes in
intact tissue.  Use of 200 &mu;Ci [&alpha;-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP provides a
sufficient signal for a pair of medullae from a single animal to measure
rates accurately.  The results show that the pmol UTP incorporated
incorporated into RNA in medullae was 40-50% of that incorporated
into cortical tissue.  Low yields of nuclei from medulla and
inability to detect DNA accurately at the small nuclear amounts
used did not allow determination of pmol UTP in RNA/mg DNA.
In other experiments outside of the run-on assay, this parameter
could be measured and was found to be identical for medulla and
cortex (15 pmol UTP/mg DNA in cortical nuclei; 19 pmol UTP/mg DNA
in medullary nuclei).  Nicotine treatment did not significantly
affect UTP incorporation into total RNA in either nuclei.
<p>
Hybridization of labeled nuclear RNA transcripts to
pGEM7Zf was relatively low, and background hybridization to bacterial
plasmid sequences to pBR322, pSP64, or pGEM3Zf was also low.
This indicates the usefulness of pGEM7Zf for these
studies.  Radioactivity hybridizing to
filters containing pTHg6.3 or pACT1.1 was twice that of the vector,
indicating an ability to quantitate specifically and reliably.
<p>
Transcription rates for actin in medullary or cortical nuclei
were similiar, and nicotine did not affect actin gene
transcription in either cortex or medulla.   TH gene transcription
was markedly affected in adrenal medulla compared to the
cortex as expected.  Differences were particularly apparent
when filters are RNase-treated to destroy hybrids not totally
complimentary, thus lowering levels to background.  The TH filters
were reduced only 30-40% (cf. to 50% to 2-3-fold reduction
for other filters), and hence the pTHg6.3 cDNA is perfectly
complimentary.  Filters of nicotine-treated cells indicated
a 2-3-fold increase in transcription rate in the medullary nuclei
(an increase observed with or without RNase treatment).
<p>
Rats were injected with nicotine (3.3 mg/kg) or
with saline and adrenals removed under anesthesia at different times after
treatment.  Saline-injected rats showed no
significant change in TH gene transcription over a 3 hr period, but
nicotine-injected rats showed an immediate increase, being maximal at the
first time point measured (10 min) and 2- and 3-fold greater than
controls.  The significantly high
transcription rate was sustained at least 1 hr after injection, declining
to normal levels at the 3 hr point (the next measured point).
<p>
The TH gene transcription rate was then measured
over a dose course of nicotine or saline, medullae taken 20 min after
single injections (only four doses tested).
2-3-fold increases were the maximally obtained rates, obtained with either
2.3 or 3.3 mg/kg nicotine.  Both doses
elicit convulsions in the animal beginning 1-2 min after injection,
persisting for 1 min, then followed by a sedate period.
The other doses tested (0.33 and 1.0 mg/kg) had no
such effect; the 1.0 mg/kg dose nonetheless stimulated a doubling of
transcription, the lower dose having no significant effect.
In another experiment to see the effect of repeated
injections, animals were dosed every 30 min for 3 hr (seven injections)
and transcription measured 20 min after the last injection.
Animals receiving the first injection of 2.3 or 3.3
mg/kg nicotine convulsed as expected, but not with subsequent
injections.  The basal gene transcription
rate fell in animals repeatedly injected with saline compared to singly
injected animals, an effect attributable to animals becoming accustomed to
handling and treatment.  Repeated injections
with 1.0 mg/kg produced the maximal response nonetheless, with 2-3-fold
increases in the rate.
<p>
TH mRNA levels were then measured both with single
and repeated nicotine injections.  High
doses of nicotine injected once had no effect on TH mRNA between 1 h and
48 h after injection.  Repeated injections
are observed to have an elevating effect within this time period
however.  Northern analysis revealed a large
increase in mRNA content with higher doses of nicotine.
Dot blot hybridization was used to quantitate the
increases, showing 2-3 fold increases with doses &ge;1.0 mg/kg.
This change in mRNA content agrees with the transcription rate changes for repeated
nicotine injections.  Nicotine-mediated
increases in mRNA are observed 3 h after initial injection and persist to
at least 6 hr after initial injection.  The
levels return to basal (levels of saline-injected rats) at the 24 and 48
hr time point.
<p>
A single injection of nicotine (3.3 mg/kg) also
produced a 2-fold increase in adrenal TH activity 1 hr postinjection, with
this activity identical to saline-treated controls at the 3, 6, 12, 24,
and 48 hr time points.  Hence, nicotine
induced a transient activation of pre-existing TH molecules which returns
to basal quickly.  Rats injected repeatedly
once every 30 min for 3 hr with 3.3 mg/kg nicotine produced 3-4-fold
increases in adrenal TH activity observed at the 1 and 3 hr time
points.  This had diminished at the 6 and 12
hr time points, but was again 2-fold at the 24 time point.
This returned to control levels at the 48 hr time
point.  Western analysis using immune serum
recognizing a 120 kDa and 60 kDa protein (the latter comigrates with
purified TH) indicate the fold increases in activity were parallel to fold
increases in protein.  Hence, the increase
in activity may represent an increase in the basal state according to
protein levels.  This protein synthesis is
equivalent to observed increases in TH gene transcription and TH mRNA
levels.
<p>
Are nicotine-induced increases of this sort due to
interactions with nicotine receptors?  Rats
were injected with hexamethonium (15 mg/kg) or mecamylamine (15 mg/kg)
which are specific blockers of nicotinic receptors.
Two injections were done both 60 min and 3-5 min prior
to a single injection of saline or nicotine (2.3 mg/kg).
TH gene transcription in the adrenal was measured as
usual 20 min after the last injection.  The
transcription rate of hexamethonium-treated animals also treated with
nicotine was not significantly affected relative to the nicotine-treated
animals alone, with a reduction of 30-40% observed; still nicotine in the
presence of hexamethonium stimulated transcription over 2-fold.
Although mecamylamine was only slightly more
effective in blocking nicotine-induced transcription (~50% decrease), an
increase in transcription rate was nonetheless observed.
Doses used in this work have been found to block
completely nicotine-mediated activation of adrenal TH in denervated
adrenal glands.  Lower doses have, in fact,
been shown to inhibit by &gt;90% any elevation of cAMP in adrenal medulla
induced by carbachol.
<p>
Other cholinergic agonists and antagonists were
tested for altering gene transcription rate.
30 mg/kg atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist)
was found to have no effect at all in blocking the effects of nicotine
(even at this high dose).  Carbachol is
similar to acetylcholine in that it stimulates both nicotinic and
muscarinic receptors. <i></i>
It elicited a 2-3-fold increase in gene transcription as did nicotine, an
elevation not blocked by hexamethonium, but in fact inhibited by
atropine.  Bethanecol is a specific
muscarinic agonist found to induce 2-3-fold increases in gene
transcription rate at a time point 20 min after injection.
<p>
Non-cholinergic drugs also tested include
reserpine, previously shown to induce increases in both TH enzyme and mRNA
levels in medulla.  Reserpine was shown here
to increase the transcription rate at the 3 hr time point (reserpine was
dissolved in a 20% ascorbic acid vehicle, and subcutaneous injection of
the vehicle showed no effect on transcription rate).
Picrotoxin (2 mg/kg intraperitoneally) is a convulsant
which induced convulsions in animals 3-5 min after injection and which
persisted for the entire 20 min period until rats were killed.
This treatment elicited a 2-fold increase in gene
transcription as well.
<p>
DISCUSSION.  Nicotine in a single dose, although able to enhance
gene transcription rates measured subsequently, does not
significantly affect the total TH mRNA or protein levels.
This can only occur with prolonged activation by nicotine
produced by repeated injections for a number of hours.  It is
observed that doses were sufficiently high to induce convulsions,
and this should be considered in light of the finding that
another group has shown
electroconvulsive shock similarly induces adrenal TH activity
increases.  It may be the convulsive effect
that causes changes in TH activity.  That
picrotoxin induced the same effect and does not stimulate cholinergic
receptors may be an additional clue.
However nonconvulsive doses of nicotine also induced increases in
transcription rate in either singly or repeatedly injected animals.
Also convulsive actions in the higher dose
nicotine-treated subjects were not observed after the first injection.
<p>
The nicotinic antagonists hexamethonium and
mecamylamine were used in doses that should have effected a complete
blockade on adrenal receptors.  But since
they were shown to be relatively ineffective in stopping nicotine-induced
transcription rate changes, nicotine may not only work directly on adrenal
receptors but may also act on CNS regions which in turn activate
splanchnic nerve pathways which release acetylcholine and other
neurotransmitters which act on other receptors.
Stimulation of muscarinic and noncholinergic receptors
is quite likely.  Nicotine has also been
shown to increase circulating corticosteroid levels in rats as well, and
it has been found that glucocorticoids increase TH in PC12 cells and in
rat SCG.  These steroids may have an effect
if released into the blood although gene transcription changes in adrenal
medulla may require higher levels of steroids than other tissues since
they are continually bathed in chemicals produced by the cortex.
If nicotine acts through the CNS, then the
inability of mecamylamine to negate this effect is surprising since it is
believed that this antagonist can act peripherally and centrally to
minimize the effect of nicotine;  it may be
nicotine acts on the CNS by mechanisms other than through receptors or
that the mecamylamine doses were not sufficient to block the CNS
receptors.
<p>
Carbachol was equally as effective as nicotine, and
similarly was not blocked by hexamethonium despite the fact that
hexamethonium can block carbachol-induced increases in cAMP and TH
activity in rat medulla (see Kurosawa et al, 1976).
The muscarinic antagonist atropine was dramatically
effective in blocking these carbachol-stimulated changes.
Combine this with the finding that bethanecol induces
induces increases in TH gene transcription and it is apparent that
muscarinic stimulation may be the factor controlling TH gene regulation.

Expression of mouse tyrosine hydroxylase in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p class="Para1">
The pET3a/BL21 (DE3) vector host system has been previously
described by Studier <i>et&nbsp;al.</i> (Meth. Enzymol. 185: 60, 1990) and
uses the T7 RNA polymerase and its promoter for expressing the cloned
gene.  The BL21 (DE3) <i>E coli</i> host is the lysogen for the
RNA polymerase and is under the control of the lac UV5 promoter.
The lac promoter is induced by IPTG (isopropylthiogalactose)
directs synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase which in turn is necessary
to express the cloned insert.  The plasmid pET-TH1 was constructed
using the native protein with the translation initiation site 8
nucleotides downstream from the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the
vector.  To construct the plasmid a 1.8 kb fragment of mouse TH cDNA
lacking 150 b from its 5' end was obtained from screening a library.
This was inserted into the 2.9 kb Blue Script KS vector and called
&lambda;TH-1.  Two primers synthesized by automated synthesizer
were used in a PCR amplification to produce a 170 nt fragment
coding for the 5' region of mouse TH cDNA.  One of the synthesized
primers contained the NdeI site for placing it on the 5' end of
the 170 nt fragment.  Amplified fragment was inserted into the
EcoRV site of Blue Script KS vector to form a clone selected
for its orientation and this was called pBS-TH1 (3.1 kb).  This
plasmid and &lambda;TH-1 are digested with PstI; the 1.8 kb mouse
insert is isolated and placed into the pBS-TH1 to produce a full
length cDNA; correctly oriented clones were selected and identified
as plasmid pBS-TH2 (4.9 kb).  Full length cDNA now produced is
excised from pBS-TH2 by digestion with a NdeI/BamHI mix and
inserted into the 4.6 kb long pET3a vector, also double-digested.
There would be no need for orientation check here.
<p>
Both the vector (pET3a) and vector+insert (pET-TH1) were used
to transform <i>E coli</i> BL21 (DE3).  Transformed cells were
grown at 37&deg; and either induced or not, and total cell lysates
analyzed using SDS-PAGE.  The gel showed an increase in a band at
approx 60 kDa in cells that had been transformed with pET-TH1
and which had been treated with inducing agent (IPTG) but not in
uninduced cells nor in cell transformed with vector only (both
induced and uninduced).  Cells were also treated with rifampicin
(an RNA polymerase inhibitor, which reduces background protein
synthesis), and the 60 kDa band was enhanced in induced cells
transformed with the vector+insert, but not in cells transformed
only with vector.  60 kDa bands were also observed in induced and
uninduced cultures grown at 30&deg;.
<p>
Lysates resolved on SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose
and the probed with a polyclonal antibody to rat TH.  Bands
corresponding to the 60 kDa band reacted with the antibody in
the lysates of IPTG-induced cells transformed with pET-TH1 and
in these cells treated with rifampicin.  There was no reaction in
cells tranfected with pET-TH1 whose cells were not induced.
<p>
Enzyme activities were assessed using a 6MPH<sub>4</sub> cofactor
at 30 and 37 &deg;, using an HPLC method with electrochemical detection.
There was no activity in lysates of cells transfected with
vector alone, whether induced or not.  In cells transfected with
pET-TH1, activity was comparable (in pmol DOPA/min/mg protein)
in IPTG-treated cells grown at 37&deg; to lysates of mouse adrenal
cells.  Activity in cells not induced was present at 20% of the level
of induced cells.   Activity in cells grown at 30&deg; was
much greater in the IPTG-treated and -untreated cells, and in fact
was greater in cells <em>not</em> induced with IPTG (nearly 4-fold
greater in uninduced vs. induced).  Activity was 6-fold greater
in the IPTG-treated cells grown at 30&deg; compared to cells
grown at 37&deg;.
<p>
Curiously the level of activity was lower than expected from
SDS-PAGE analysis.  It is well known that high expression levels
often produce insoluble (enzymatically inactive) protein, and that
this can be compensated for by altering the temperature of growth.
At 30&deg; extracts were 5-20 times more active than extracts in 37&deg;.
There is no understanding of why cultures at 30&deg; were IPTG-independent.
<p>
The kinetics of the cloned enzyme were characterized using natural
(6<i>R</i>)-BH<sub>4</sub> cofactor.  The presence of 0.1 mM Fe<sup>2+</sup>
activated the enzyme 2-fold.  Double reciprocal plots measured against
the substrate tyrosine, with a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> 7.2 &mu;M for tyrosine, assayed
with 420 &mu;M cofactor.  Tyrosine &gt; 60 &mu;M was inhibitory.
When measured against the inverse (6<i>R</i>-BH<sub>4</sub>) cofactor
concentration, the Lineweaver-Burk plot was not strictly linear as
for tyrosine, but biphasic:  the cofactor <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> was 19 &mu;M for cofactor
below 55 &mu;M cofactor, and the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> was 54 &mu;M for cofactor above
55 &mu;M, all measured in 20 &mu;M tyrosine.  Since the enzyme is
expected to be unphosphorylated and expected to be homogeneous, it
is not likely that this nonlinearity is because of two different forms
of the enzyme.

Phosphorylation of human recombinant tyrosine hydroxylase isoforms 1 and 2:

Extracts were analyzed on SDS gels and Coomassie
stains revealed 62 and 64 kDa bands present in the TH-1 and TH-2
constructs, resp., which agrees with apparent MWs of bands obtained from
isoforms expressed in Xenopus (see Horellou et al., <i>J. Neurochem.</i>
<b>51</b>: 652, 1988).  The proteins are about 5% of the total protein.
Antiserum to rat TH was positive on Westerns.  Purification to 90%
was achieved in three steps;  activity assays using
500 &mu;M BH<sub>4</sub> and 200 &mu;M tyrosine were used.
Final specific activities of 464 and 369 nmol DOPA/min/mg for
TH-1 and TH-2, resp.  Storage at 1 mg/ml at -80&deg; preserves activity.
<p>
Purified TH isoforms were incubated in PK-A and CaM&nbsp;MPK&nbsp;II for
30 min at 30&deg; in the presence of <sup>32</sup>P-ATP ranging
from 0.2 to 5 mM.  At 2 mM ATP, phosphate incorporation was maximal.
Optimal conditions resulted in 0.75 and 0.5 mol P/subunit TH-1 and
TH-2 resp.  For CaM&nbsp;MPK&nbsp;II, incorporation was as 1 and 2 mol P/subunit
TH-1 and TH-2, resp. This suggests that CaM&nbsp;MPK&nbsp;II phosphorylates
additional sites in TH-2 with respect to TH-1.
Site analysis using trypsin, reversed phase HPLC, and
Edman sequencing indicated that a peptide A from both isoforms had a
sequence of RQ<u>S</u>LIEDAR.  CaM&nbsp;MPK&nbsp;II
produced two and three phosphopeptides in TH-1 and TH-2, resp.
Two of the peptides are present in both isoforms and
correspond to peptide A and a new peptide B (AV<u>S</u>ELDA...).
The third peptide in TH-2 corresponds to a site
generated by alternate splicing, peptide C:
CQ<u>S</u>PR.  Peptides A, B, and C
correspond to Ser-40, -19, and -31, resp. in TH-1 amino acids.
<p>The pH dependence of the activity of both isoforms
was measured.  Maximal activity was found at
pH 7.0 for both isoenzymes, in agreement with other studies.
These pH studies employed 200 &mu;M BH<sub>4</sub>,
200 &mu;M tyrosine, and 100 &mu;M FeAmSO<sub>4</sub>.  Tyrosine
concentration was changed from 6 to 100 &mu;M with a BH<sub>4</sub>

Above 60 &mu;M tyrosine, substrate inhibition is apparent, which has been
reported for rat TH in the presence of natural cofactor.

With tyrosine constant at 50 &mu;M and BH<sub>4</sub> changed
from 10-300 &mu;M, <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for BH<sub>4</sub> are
similar for both TH forms (73-95 &mu;M) but the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>

Effects of second messenger system activation on functional expression
of tyrosine hydroxylase fusion gene constructs in neuronal and
nonneuronal cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: A genomic clone for rat
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was isolated and a fragment containing 503 bp
upstream of the transcription start site was sequenced. The BamHI/AluI
fragment was inserted into a plasmid carrying the coding sequence for
bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Another construct with
the 5' sequence truncated to -151 bp also was prepared. When these were
introduced into several mammalian cell lines, including C6 glioma, BE(2)
neuroblastoma, CV-1 or Ltk- fibroblasts, different basal levels of CAT
expression were observed. In the fibroblast lines, THCAT constructs were
not expressed unless the cells were treated with forskolin or TPA.
However, the low basal expression was not correlated to endogenous
expression as THCAT constructs expressed comparably in BE(2)C, HeLa, and
C6 glioma. Treatment of any of the cell lines with forskolin, TPA, or a
combination of the two agents stimulated the expression by at least
two-fold in all cell lines and the maximally induced levels were at least
10-fold over promoterless controls. These data indicate that the essential
promoter elements as well as those conferring responsivity to cyclic AMP
reside within 151 bp of the transcription start site. However, the array
of elements regulating cell-type expression lie, at least in part, beyond
the 500-bp region examined. Further, a role for phosphorylation in the
regulation of basal and induced transcription of TH is suggested.

Ethanol increases tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in
N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells
<p class="Para1">
INTRO.  Chronic ethanol
consumption leads to development of tolerance and physical dependence,
with withdrawal symptoms attendant upon removal of ethanol.
Catecholamines are implicated in producing these
physiological response, and agents interrupting adrenergic
neurotransmission by destroying adrenergic neurons, blocking catecholamine
synthesis, or preventing receptor activity prevent tolerance development
and aggravating ethanol-withdrawal-induced seizures.
Brain CA levels change with exposure to EtOH.
Transcerebral dialysis of rats administered
acute ethanol levels showed increased dopamine release in the nucleus
accumbens and dorsal caudate nucleus.  The
results from chronic ethanol administration show increased, decreased, and
unchanged CA levels, but these differences may be due to differences in
the experimental animals used, route of administration, and assay
conditions.  CA levels are affected by
changes in synthesis, release, or catabolism.
Acute ethanol treatment has been shown to effect
increases in TH in the locus coeruleus, striatum, and frontal cortex
(French, Masserano, Weiner), the medulla oblongata (Yamanaka &amp;
Egashira), and adrenal medulla (Cohen, Sellers, Sellers, Flattery) of the
rat.  Increased or unchanged TH activity or
protein levels have been reported for chronic EtOH treatment in animal
models.  Recent studies show that EtOH
alters several second messenger systems, wherein acute treatment increases
receptor-stimulated cAMP production, whereas chronic ethanol treatment has
the opposite effect.  This desensitization
has been found in laboratory-controlled tissue treatments and in cells and
tissues from alcoholics.  Mochly-Rosen et al
(<i>Nature</i> <b>333</b>:
848, 1988) show that ethanol-induced desensitization
of receptor-stimulated cAMP production in NG108-15 cells is because the
G<sub>&alpha;s</sub> subunit mRNA and protein product decreases.
Increases in G<sub>&alpha;i</sub> subunit with
chronic alcohol use in N1E-115 and other neural cell lines have been also
reported.
<p>
RESULTS.  Cultured neuronal cells are used in these studies since
<i>in vivo</i> studies are complicated in the interpretation of
results by such factors
as route of administration or the presence of heterogeneous populations of
neurons with multisynaptic inputs.  NE1-115
cells have a high level of endogenous TH expression, with ethanol having
been shown to disrupt receptor-activated cAMP production in this
line.  TH protein levels in cells treated 3
d with ethanol were assessed using quantitative immunoblotting with a
monoclonal, <sup>125</sup>I-protein A, and
autoradiography.  In the Western autorad
illustrated, different total protein loads using the control cell extracts
or extracts from cells treated 3 d with 50 or 100 mM EtOH clearly show
dose-dependent increases in TH immunoreactivity, with the computerized
densitometric reading indicating an averaged 140 and 175% increase in
specific TH protein in the 50 and 100 mM EtOH-treated cells, resp., above
the control.
<p>Slot-blot analysis to quantitate TH mRNA levels
revealed that the 100 mM EtOH mRNA caused an increase in the message
compared to control.  Probes used for
&beta;-tubulin indicate its expression in ethanol-treated
cells decreased slightly, while probes for actin and LDH indicated no
change in their expression.  This result
indicates a specific effect of ethanol on TH.
Total poly(A) RNA content was also assessed by
hybridization with <sup>35</sup>S-poly(T).
Northern analysis indicated that the probes for
TH, LDH, and actin hybridized to single species, while the
&beta;-tubulin probe hybridized to its characteristic 1.8 and 2.6
kb spp.  A dose course of EtOH from 25 to
200 mM for 3 d treatments show that while total poly(A) RNA levels did not
change appreciably, TH mRNA abundance increased 200, 238 and 240% in the
50, 100, and 200 mM treatments, resp.
<p>N1E-115 cells which had been stably transfected
with a plasmid containing 773 bp of the TH promoter fused to a CAT
reporter were treated 3 d with 50 and 100 mM EtOH, with CAT activity
present at 138 and 170% of control levels, resp.
Four independently isolated clones showed similar
responses.  The ethanol-induced increases
were observed as early as 8 h and reached a plateau by 24 h.
The clone was similar to its parent NE1-115 with
respect to growth rate, morphology, receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase,
ability of chronic ethanol to desensitize prostaglandin
E<sub>1</sub>-stimulated cAMP production, and induction of TH
expression by increases in cell density and cAMP.
<p>
The CAT-plasmid clone (N1E-C3) was treated 24 h
with PGE<sub>1</sub> (1 to 1000 nM) in the
presence or absence of 100 mM EtOH.  1000 nM
PGE<sub>1</sub> elicits a 2-3-fold increase in
cAMP in 30 min in these cells.  TH
promoter-directed CAT activity is shown to increase in a dose-dependent
manner with PGE<sub>1</sub> treatment.
Cells in combination with ethanol and
PGE<sub>1</sub> further enhanced the increased
expression at each point of the curve.  An
adenosine A<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist, (&#8209;)-<i>N</i><sup>
6</sup>-(R-phenylisopropyl)adenosine, which stimulates
increases in cAMP levels was used in place of PGE<sub>1</sub>
to see if the stimulated increase was confined to
PGE<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated events:
the increase in CAT activity in combination with
ethanol suggest that the effects of ethanol are not confined to the
PGE<sub>1</sub>-mediated pathway.
When 8-Br-cAMP was used concurrently with EtOH
treatments as well, increased promoter activity was also shown:
since use of the cAMP analogue circumvents the
need to increase its level through receptor-mediated coupling and
activation, this results shows that ethanol may not necessarily act
through enhancement of ligand-bound receptors to adenylyl cyclase via
G<sub>s</sub> complexes.

Expression in brain sensory neurons of the transgene in
transgenic mice carrying human tyrosine hydroxylase gene
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: We have recently reported the
production of transgenic (Tg) mice carrying the human tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) gene, and have described tissue-specific expression of the transgene
in catecholaminergic (CAergic) neurons and adrenal glands. This paper
describes the transgene expression in non-catecholaminergic (nCAergic)
neurons in the brain of Tg mice by immunocytochemistry and in situ
hybridization. In adult Tg mice, human TH was atypically expressed in the
olfactory (typically, the anterior olfactory nucleus and pyriform cortex)
and visual (typically, n. suprachiasmaticus and n. parabigeminalis)
systems, in addition to typical CAergic neuron-rich nuclei in the brain.
These results suggest the possibility that TH plays some novel roles in
sensory systems.

A tyrosine hydroxylase assay in microwells using coupled
nonenzymatic decarboxylation of DOPA
<p class="Para1">
In this assay hi-speed supernatants of adult rat striatal
tissue homogenates are prepared in Tris buffer containing 0.1% Triton
X-100.  Cultured ventral mesencephalon cell
from embryonic rat brains (14 d gestation) are put into DME containing
DNase, then into defined DME/F-12 containing insulin, transferrin,
putrescine, progesterone, selenium, glutamine, glutathione, T<sub>3</sub>
hormone, globulin-free BSA, galactose and
glucose, which is then placed in poly-L-Lys-washed and laminin-coated
microwells with ~2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well.
<p>
The assay is adapted from Waymire <i>et&nbsp;al.</i> and Okuno
and Fujisawa, which makes use of decarboxylation of
<sup>14</sup>C-DOPA to form <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>.
In general the reaction mixture (made fresh from stock
solutions daily) consists of an ice-cold 16.6 &mu;l of 0.45 M MES, pH 6.1,
2.3 mM DTT, 4.7 mM ascorbic acid, 2.3 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>,
2500 U catalase, and 45 &mu;M L-[<sup>14</sup>C]-tyrosine (50.2 mCi/mmol).
25 &mu;L of enzyme solution is added to the reaction
mixture and the plate is placed in a specially machined holder designed to
compress blotting paper against the top of the microwells and to be
airtight.  Incubation is for 20 min at
37&deg;.  The plate is placed upon ice and 41.6
&mu;l of 16.5 mM K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> and
10 mM p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid
in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 is added.  A 14 x 11 cm
blot paper sheet (Schleicher &amp; Schuell GB002) impregnated with
methylbenzethonium hydroxide and air-dried 5 min is immediately
applied.  With the holder latched,
incubation is at 60&deg; for 45 min.  <sup>
14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> evolved
during the reaction is recovered by its adsorption to methylbenzethonium
hydroxide impregnated paper.  The plate is
then cooled on ice and the paper removed and cut into 6.5 x 6.5 mm squares
corresponding to each position on the plate.
<p>Results.  A standard
of 5000 dpm <sup>14</sup>C-DOPA was placed in the
reaction well and decarboxylated.  90% of
the radioactivity was recovered and adsorbed to the filter.
Note ferricyanide catalyzes the decarboxylation while
pCMS is supposed to neutralize the inhibitory effect of DTT on the
reaction.  Without ferricyanide or pCMS,
recovery is only 0.3 or 55% of radioactivity, resp.
Endogenous DOPA decarboxylase is not a factor since
there was no radioactivity recovered during the reaction.
With <sup>14</sup>C-tyrosine
alone with ferricyanide and pCMS added, no <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>
is recovered indicating that decarboxylation of the tyrosine substrate
is not occurring.
<p>
As for kinetics, CO<sub>2</sub> production increases linearly up
to 25 min into the
reaction for the amount of total protein used and considering it that 25
min was the last time point taken., making it reliable up to that
time.  Boiling the extract prior to assay
reduced recovery of CO<sub>2</sub> to near blank
(no enzyme) values, showing the reaction to be heat-labile and therefore
enzymatic.  The apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 110 &mu;M for tyrosine
agrees with previous estimates.  The apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
was 1.24 pmol CO<sub>2</sub>/min/&mu;g.  As little as 2
&mu;g striatal homogenate protein produces detectable 3 pmol of
<sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>, corresponding to 0.15 x 10<sup>-6</sup>
units of enzyme if 1 U = 1 &mu;mol DOPA/min.  This assay
is 5-fold more sensitive than that of Reinhard et al., reflecting the
higher signal to background ratio of this method.
Cells can be grown in microwells and assayed in the
same well.  With the embryonic cells, TH
activity was measurable in 200,000 cells on the day of plating, increase
3.8-fold by day 6, and declined to initial levels by day 9.

High-level expression of rat PC12 tyrosine hydroxylase cDNA
in <i>Escherichia coli</i>: purification and characterization
of the cloned enzyme
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: A rat cDNA containing the
complete coding sequence for rat tyrosine hydroxylase (tyrosine
3-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.2) was isolated from a rat PC12 cDNA library
and subcloned in a bacterial expression plasmid, and large amounts of
functional enzyme were produced in Escherichia coli. The recombinant
enzyme was purified approximately 20-fold to a final specific activity of
1.8 mumol/min per mg of protein, with a yield of 30%. As much as 1 mg of
pure protein could be obtained from 1 g of wet bacterial cells. The
purified hydroxylase was shown to be homogeneous by denaturing
polyacrylamide electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Amino acid
analysis of the N terminus (25 residues) revealed 100% identity with rat
PC12 tyrosine hydroxylase, as deduced from its cDNA sequence. Several of
the kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme resembled those of the
native PC12 hydroxylase. However, in contrast to the native enzyme, the
purified recombinant hydroxylase was shown to be in an activated form.
Phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulted in
stoichiometric incorporation of phosphate, but the kinetic profile of the
recombinant enzyme was unaffected. Several clues to these differences are
considered that may provide insight into the structural features important
to the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase.

Tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent functional recovery in
6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats by intracerebral grafting of fibroblasts
transfected with tyrosine hydroxylase cDNA
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Fibroblasts (NRK-49F) were
transfected with human type 2 tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; EC 1.14.16.29)
cDNA, to clarify the mechanism involved in amelioration of parkinsonism by
intracerebral grafting of catecholaminergic neurons and to investigate its
possible use as a donor material. These genetically manipulated
fibroblasts did not develop into a mass of tissue, and survived well in
the host striatum. Expression of the TH minigene in the cells was
successful even when they were transplanted into the host brain.
Intracerebral microdialysis revealed that a measurable amount of
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) was not spontaneously released from
the implanted cells into the host striatum. However, release of a large
amount of L-DOPA from the cells was observed when
(6R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) was perfused through a
dialysis probe. Finally, we investigated whether these BH4-dependent
L-DOPA-secreting fibroblasts are able to ameliorate the abnormal behavior
of 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats. Apomorphine-induced rotating behavior
was not reversed by the grafting alone, whereas a marked reduction in
drug-induced circling was observed temporarily after BH4 was perfused
around the implanted cells. These findings indicate that TH
cDNA-transfected non-neuronal cells might be able to be used as donor
material for intracerebral grafting and ameliorate the abnormal behavior
of rats with experimental Parkinson's disease.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide stimulates catecholamine
biosynthesis in isolated adrenal chromaffin cells:
evidence for a cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation
and activation of tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Vasoactive intestinal peptide
(VIP) increased catecholamine biosynthesis in bovine adrenal chromaffin
cells by 50-200%. Six related peptides produced no effects. In addition,
VIP increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity measured in gel-filtered
supernatants prepared from homogenates of treated cells. The hypothesis
that cyclic AMP is the second messenger involved in these effects of VIP
was also evaluated. VIP led to an elevation of cyclic AMP levels, and this
increase occurred over a similar concentration range and time course as
the activation of TH and the increase in catecholamine biosynthesis. Each
measure reached maximal levels at 10-20 microM VIP within 1 min and
remained elevated for at least 16 min. These changes produced by VIP were
paralleled by enhanced phosphorylation of TH, and this phosphorylation
occurred on a single tryptic peptide that was the same peptide whose
phosphorylation has been previously shown to be stimulated by forskolin.
In contrast to VIP and forskolin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, a
phorbol ester known to activate protein kinase C, increased the
phosphorylation on a total of three tryptic peptides of TH. Our results
indicate that VIP stimulates catecholamine biosynthesis in chromaffin
cells through the phosphorylation and activation of TH and support the
conclusion that a cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of TH is
responsible for these effects.

Insulin-like growth factor I enhances tyrosine
hydroxylase activation in bovine chromaffin cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Previous studies have shown
that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) enhances secretagogue-stimulated
Ca2+ uptake and catecholamine release in bovine chromaffin cells. This
report describes the effect of IGF-I on the activity of tyrosine
hydroxylase (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.2), the major regulatory
enzyme in the pathway of catecholamine biosynthesis. Tyrosine hydroxylase
activity was assayed by measuring 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa)
accumulation in the presence of brocresine, an inhibitor of Dopa
decarboxylase. Chromaffin cells cultured in serum-free medium produced
approximately 40% less Dopa when stimulated by 55 mM K+ than did cells
that had been cultured in the presence of serum. Incubation of cells for 3
days in serum-free medium containing 10 nM IGF-I restored high
K(+)-stimulated Dopa accumulation to a level comparable to that seen in
cells cultured continuously in serum-containing medium. In eight
experiments, IGF-I increased high K(+)-stimulated Dopa accumulation
(expressed as picomoles per minute per milligram of protein) by 96 +/-
13%. IGF-I increased the protein content of chromaffin cells by
approximately 30%; consequently, its effect on tyrosine hydroxylase
activity was even greater when Dopa synthesis was expressed as picomoles
per minute per 10(7) cells. IGF-I also enhanced the rate of Dopa
accumulation in cells stimulated by dimethylphenylpiperazinium,
8-bromo-cyclic AMP, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, or Ba2+. The effect of IGF-I
on high K(+)-stimulated tyrosine hydroxylase activity was measurable when
enzyme activity was assayed in vitro, suggesting that this effect was due
to a stable modification of the enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

enhancement of acetylcholine release in vivo in the

<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Recently, we have reported
that 6R-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4), a natural cofactor for
hydroxylases of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan, has a dopamine
releasing action in the rat striatum independent of its cofactor role.
Here we studied the effects of 6R-BH4 on acetylcholine (ACh) release in
the rat hippocampus using brain microdialysis. Intracerebroventricular
injection of 6R-BH4 dose-dependently increased extracellular ACh levels
monitored by brain microdialysis. Biopterin, an oxidized form of 6R-BH4,
and 6S-BH4, an unnatural diastereoisomer of 6R-BH4, had little effect on
the ACh levels. The 6R-BH4-induced increase in ACh levels was eliminated
after inhibition of voltage-dependent Na+ channels by tetrodotoxin, but
not after depletion of catecholamines by reserpine. These results show
that 6R-BH4 has direct ACh releasing action in vivo.

Tyrosine hydroxylase purification from rat PC12 cells
<p class="Para1">
So far the published procedures indicate low yields of
purified enzyme which lose activity in a matter of hours.
The largest scale purification so far was that of the
bovine adrenal enzyme, in which 17 mg was obtained from 2.5 kg of adrenal
medulla (see Haavik et al., 1988).
<p>PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10%
heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% FCS, and 50 &mu;g/ml gentamicin in T-175
flasks (Nunc).  The cells adhere well to
these particular brand although they are not collagen-coated as
recommended.  Cells are fed 2 x weekly by
whole medium exchange.  Cells are harvested
by trituration, pelleted and frozen at -80&deg; until use.
Since cell-cell contact increases TH expression, it is
better to harvest cells at confluence.
After 100 flasks were harvested yielding approx. 1.5-2 g cells (30 ml
partially thawed, packed; ~10 billion cells), Polytron extraction was
performed in KP<sub>i</sub> buffer containing
2-mercaptoEtOH, EDTA, leupeptin and PMSF (last two added fresh), plus 0.27

40000 g for 1 h.  The 30-42% AmSO<sub>4</sub> saturated fraction

heparin-Sepharose chromatography.  TH is
eluted with a 100-500 mM KCl gradient, where it elutes with 250 mM

Activation of tyrosine hydroxylase by nicotine in rat adrenal gland
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The administration of
nicotine activates tyrosine hydroxylase in the rat adrenal gland. This
activation is apparently maximal 25 min after a single subcutaneous
injection of nicotine at 2.3 mg/kg. Repeated injections of nicotine (seven
injections once every 30 min) are associated with a persistent activation
of adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase for at least 3 h. The nicotinic receptor
antagonist hexamethonium does not significantly inhibit the
nicotine-mediated activation of tyrosine hydroxylase in innervated adrenal
glands. However, hexamethonium completely blocks the activation of adrenal
tyrosine hydroxylase by nicotine in denervated adrenal glands.
Furthermore, even though a single injection of nicotine activates tyrosine
hydroxylase in both innervated and denervated adrenal glands, repeated
injections of nicotine do not activate tyrosine hydroxylase in denervated
adrenal glands. Our results suggest that the systemic administration of
nicotine activates adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase by two mechanisms: (1) via
direct interaction with adrenal chromaffin cell nicotinic receptors; and
(2) via stimulation of the CNS leading to the release from the splanchnic
nerve of substances that interact with adrenal chromaffin cell receptors
other than the nicotinic receptor.

Enhanced expression of human tyrosine hydroxylase in the lower

<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: We have previously reported
the distribution of human tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) transgene expression
in dopaminergic neurons (ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra),
adrenal gland, and non-catecholaminergic neurons in the forebrain of
transgenic (Tg) mice. In this paper, we analysed the transgene expression
in catecholaminergic (CAergic) neurons in the lower brainstem of Tg mice,
by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry at the light and electron
microscopic levels. High-level hybridization signals of the human TH mRNA
were observed in the locus ceruleus and nucleus tractus solitarii of the
Tg brain. Intense TH immunoreactivity was expressed specifically in the Tg
brainstem, as was observed in non-Tg mice. These results reveal that the
human TH transgene contains the regulatory elements responsible for the
expression in three kinds of CAergic (dopaminergic, noradrenergic and
adrenergic) neurons of the mouse brain.

Activation and multiple-site phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase
in perfused rat adrenal glands
<p class="Para1">
It was previously reported by us that <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>-labeled
PC12 cells and rat corpus striatum incorporate label into a single
M<sub>r</sub> 60,000-62,000 protein which had been immunoprecipitated
with anti-TH.  Median incorporation into adrenal gland TH in these
studies (data was not shown) was ~10,000 cpm for untreated glands,
with a range of 17-21 &mu;g (median 19
&mu;g) of TH per gland.  Adrenal gland TH was
extracted from SDS gels of immunoprecipitates and trypsin-digested, and
then separated into 5 labeled peaks on HPLC, which were identical to
tryptic phosphopeptides of labeled PC12 TH and from rat corpus striatum
labeled in vivo or in intact synaptosomes.
Rechromatography of the adrenal peptides with peptides from PC12 or
striatum showed coincidental retention times, even when the elution
conditions were such that increasing acetonitrile (0.2% per min) was
halved to 0.1% per min.  Also 2-D peptide
mapping with pH 8.9 electrophoresis/chromatography produced the same
pattern of labeled spots no matter what the TH source.
Partial acid hydrolysis indicate that the only
phosphoamino acid present was serine.
Hence, from the previous data, we know that the RA-1 and RA-2 peptides (@
11 min and 14.5 min) are differentially cleaved Ser-19, RA-3 (@ 18.5 min)
is Ser-31, the RA-4 (@ 24.5 min) is Ser-8, the RA-5 (@ 35 min) is
Ser-40.  The relative distribution of
radioactivity was 39% in Ser-19, 26% in Ser-31, 8% in Ser-8, and 27% in
Ser-40.
<p>
Splanchnic nerves were field stimulated (300
pulses) at either 1 or 10 Hz and <sup>32</sup>P
incorporation was found to be 3-fold over controls.
With 1 Hz over a 5 min period, incorporation was
distributed over Ser-19, Ser-31, and Ser-40.
But with 10 Hz stimulation for only 30 s,
incorporation was limited to Ser-40 and Ser-19.
TH activity was also measured in vitro using 30 or 300
&mu;M tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>).
Activities were slightly larger at the lower
[BH<sub>4</sub>] overall, and the 1 Hz
stimulation had greater activation than the 10 Hz activation.
This might be attributed to the increase in Ser-31
phosphorylation or the greater incorporation into Ser-40.
<p>Malhotra et al. (1989) have shown that rat
chromaffin cell secretory response is elicited by a nicotinic, muscarinic,
and VIP component.  Indeed muscarine,
nicotine, and VIP were all used individually and shown to enhance TH
phosphorylation:  the nicotinic stimulation
increased phosphorylation 5- to 6-fold in Ser-19, but only 50-60% in
Ser-31 and Ser-40.  Muscarinic activation on
the other hand increased phosphorylation 4-fold in Ser-19 and -31 with a
smaller increase in Ser-40.  And VIP
selectively increased phosphorylation of Ser-40 by 8 times.
<p>TH activity appeared to be affected only by Ser-40
phosphorylation.  VIP selectively increased
Ser-40 phosphorylation and was the only agonist that activated TH.
Nicotine had no effect on TH activity.
Muscarine produced its largest effect on Ser-31
phosphorylation but had similarly no effect on TH activation.
<p>Plots of TH activity vs. pH (from 6.0 to 7.2 by 0.2
pH units) indicate a shift in the maximum of activation from the acidic to
the neutral for VIP-treated or field-stimulated TH.
There were no obvious differences in the nicotine- or
muscarine-treated tissues.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of two overlapping genomic clones showed that
this gene is split into 13 exons distributed about 7.5 kb in length. The
transcription initiation site was determined by primer extension analysis
with mouse adrenal gland poly(A)+RNA. The structure of the mouse TH gene
was similar to that of the human TH gene, but it contained neither the
alternative splice donor site around the 3'-end of the first exon nor an
independent exon corresponding to the second exon of the human TH gene.
There were the canonical TATA and GC boxes, cyclic AMP responsive element
(CRE), and AP1 binding site in the 5'-flanking region of the mouse TH
gene.

Membrane depolarization by isotonic or hypertonic
KCl.  Differential effects on messenger RNA
levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase messenger RNA
in PC12 cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Membrane depolarization is an
important and common manipulation used to study the result of enhanced
neuronal activity on adaptive changes, including alterations in gene
expression. In this study, the effect of elevated KCl, under isotonic and
hypertonic conditions, on the changes in mRNA levels of the catecholamine
biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine
beta-hydroxylase (DBH) was compared. Treatment of PC12 pheochromocytoma
cells for several hours with 50 mM KCl, under conditions where osmolarity
was maintained, induced TH mRNA levels several fold, without changing DBH
mRNA levels (Kilbourne and Sabban, 1990). In contrast, 50 mM KCl added to
culture media without adjusting the osmolarity did not alter TH mRNA
levels for up to 24 h. Longer continuous exposure to this hypertonic
depolarization condition reduced TH mRNA levels to about 10% of control
levels. DBH mRNA levels also declined when PC12 cells were treated from 12
h to 5 days with hypertonic 50 mM KCl. The effect appeared to be specific,
since actin mRNA levels were elevated about 2-fold with these same
hypertonic treatments. As a control for osmotic changes, 50 mM NaCl was
used and did not alter TH or DBH mRNA levels. Viability of the cells was
maintained and total protein synthesis was reduced somewhat after 12 h of
exposure to hypertonic 50 mM KCl, and remained relatively constant for as
long as 4 days. Thus, there appears to be an interaction between
osmolarity and elevated KCl since very different results of the effects of
membrane depolarization on the mRNA levels for the catecholamine
biosynthetic enzymes were obtained depending on the osmolarity of the
cultures. The extent of elevation of TH mRNA with isotonic KCl was also
dependent on cell density. At high cell densities, membrane depolarization
no longer induced TH mRNA levels. The results of this study indicate the
experimental parameters which can be crucial in studies of membrane
depolarization.

Regulated expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene by
membrane depolarization. Identification of the responsive element and
possible second messengers
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Prolonged depolarization has
been used as a model of adaptive changes in the expression of various
proteins, such as ion channels and neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes,
in response to increased trans-synaptic activity in the nervous system. In
depolarized PC12 cells, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA levels increased
severalfold (Kilbourne, E. J., and Sabban, E. L. (1990) Mol. Brain Res. 8,
121-127). In this study, membrane depolarization caused an increase in the
expression of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT),
under transcriptional control of the 5' region of the rat TH gene. These
results indicate that membrane depolarization leads to increased
transcription of the TH gene. Protein kinase C inhibitors had no effect on
the induction of TH mRNA by depolarization, as well as the increase in
formation of CAT under control of the upstream region of the TH gene. The
depolarization responsive element in the TH gene was mapped to the region
containing the cAMP responsive element. This region of the TH gene also
increased CAT activity in response to the calcium ionophore, ionomycin.
Interestingly, combined treatment with cAMP analogs and membrane
depolarization had a greater effect than either alone on TH mRNA levels,
as well as on CAT activity in PC12 cells transfected with the plasmid
containing the cAMP responsive element.

ERK1 and ERK2, two microtubule-associated protein 2
kinases, mediate the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase at serine-31
in situ
<p class="Para1">
3T3 cells were stimulated with EGF and extracted.
Extracts were prepared directly on Mono Q HR 5/5
with a gradient elution.  Assays for kinase
activity toward purified rat TH (from PC12 cells), MBP, and a peptide of
TH (24-33:  KQAEAVTSPR) were performed.
The whole TH molecule was phosphorylated by
kinase activities eluting at 50, 90 and 150 mM NaCl, MBP was
phosphorylated by the kinases eluting at 90 (ERK2) and 150 mM NaCl, while
the peptide (at 1 mM) was phosphorylated by the 90 and 150 mM peaks as
well.  Control extracts showed no
phosphorylating activity to all three substrates in any of the fractions
off Mono Q.
<p>PC12 cells stimulated with NGF or phorbol ester
have been shown to increase Ser-31 phosphorylation.
Bradykinin, muscarine, and ATP presence increased
phosphate incorporation into Ser-31 (extracted TH prepared on SDS gels,
the band excised and trypsin-digested and analyzed on HPLC).
The phosphorylation of Ser-40 was also increased by
ATP addition, acting apparently through cell surface adenosine
receptors.  Use of 100 &mu;M theophylline
inhibited this phosphorylation, known to be a specific antagonist of these
receptors.  Thapsigargin and t-Bu<sub>
2</sub>BHQ (which mobilizes intracellular calcium from
IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive pools) but not caffeine
(which acts upon different calcium pools) also increased Ser-31
phosphorylation.
<p>NGF- and bradykinin-treated PC12 cells were
extracted and prepared on Mono Q.  Two peaks
of MBP kinase activity were evident, with corresponding activity to the TH
peptide.  These activities comigrated on
Superose 12, and kinase from that column phosphorylated Ser-31 of purified
TH.
<p>Previous reports show that tyrosine and threonine
phosphorylation occurs in order to activate ERK, and other reports show
that NGF treatment of PC12 cells increases the phosphotyrosine content of
a 44- and 42-kDa polypeptide, representing ERK1 and ERK2, resp.
With NGF or bradykinin stimulation, the
[<sup>32</sup>P]phosphotyrosine content of a 44-
and 42-kDa band is observed to increase.
Lavendustin A, tyrphostin, methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate,
2-hydroxy-5-(2,5-dihydroxybenzyl)aminobenzoic acid, or genistein, all
tyrosine kinase inhibitors were checked for their ability to inhibit
agonist-stimulated TH-Ser<sup>31</sup>
phosphorylation:  genistein inhibited Ser-31
phosphorylation selectively, not influencing Ser-40 or Ser-19
phosphorylation.  Genistein inhibition was
concentration-dependent over a range of 10-360 &mu;M (2-15 min
pre-incubations) with the bradykinin-stimulated cells, but had little
effect on NGF-mediated TH phosphorylation.
<p>Cells cultured "in phase" were split and one-half
labeled.  After treating with either NGF or
bradykinin in the presence or absence of genistein, both MAP (MBP) kinase
activity and Ser-31 phosphorylation activity were measured.
The data show a perfect correlation between activation
of MAP kinase and Ser-31 phosphorylation, and that genistein inhibited the
bradykinin-stimulated activity in particular.
<p>Genistein also inhibited increases in Ser-31
phosphorylation seen with BaCl<sub>2</sub>,
phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, and muscarine.
Neither CAM-PKII-mediated increases in Ser-19 phosphorylation produced by
Ba<sup>2+</sup> or bradykinin nor the
PKA-mediated increase in Ser-40 phosphorylation produced by 8-Br-cAMP was
affected by genistein.  Small increases in
Ser-40 phosphorylation produced by Ba<sup>2+</sup> or PDBu were
inhibited by genistein, but these
increases may have occurred secondarily to ERK activation.
<p>
ERK1-purified from NGF-treated PC12 cells was used
to phosphorylated TH purified from PC12 cells.
The site of incorporation was clearly Ser-31.

Coordinate regulation of the cyclic AMP system with
firing rate and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the rat locus
coeruleus: effects of chronic stress and drug treatments
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Recent studies have
demonstrated that chronic stress increases the firing rate and expression
of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), the
major noradrenergic nucleus in brain. The present study was undertaken to
examine the influence of chronic stress and other treatments known to
influence the activity of LC neurons on the cyclic AMP (cAMP) second
messenger system in these neurons. Chronic (5 days) cold exposure
significantly increased levels of TH immunoreactivity in the LC, as
previously reported, but not in substantia nigra (SN) or ventral tegmentum
(VT), two dopaminergic nuclei studied for comparison. Chronic cold
exposure increased levels of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in
soluble, but not particulate, fractions of the LC, and increased basal and
GTP- and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in this brain
region. In contrast, levels of the protein kinase and adenylate cyclase in
VT, SN, and frontal cortex were not significantly influenced by cold
exposure. To study further the relationship between regulation of LC
firing rate, TH expression, and the cAMP system in the LC, other
treatments known to influence TH were examined. Reserpine treatment, shown
previously to increase levels of TH, was found to increase both LC firing
rate and levels of soluble cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in the
LC. 6-Hydroxydopamine, shown previously to increase levels of TH and
firing rate of LC neurons, also increased soluble levels of protein kinase
activity. Other treatments known to either increase (adrenalectomy) or
decrease (chronic imipramine) levels of TH in the LC were also found to
increase or decrease, respectively, levels of cAMP-dependent protein
kinase activity in this brain region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in the
rat carotid body by hypoxia
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The activity (<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) of
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; EC 1.14.16.2), the rate limiting enzyme in the
synthesis of catecholamines, is increased in carotid body, superior
cervical ganglion, and the adrenal medulla during hypoxia (i.e., reduced
PaO2). The present study was undertaken to determine if the increase in TH
activity in these tissues during hypoxia is regulated at the level of TH
mRNA. Adult rats were exposed to hypoxia (10% O2) or room air for periods
lasting from 1 to 48 h. The carotid bodies, superior cervical ganglia, and
adrenals were removed and processed for in situ hybridization using
35S-labeled oligonucleotide probes. The concentration of TH mRNA was
increased by hypoxia at all time points in carotid body type I cells, but
not in cells of either superior cervical ganglion or adrenal medulla. The
increase in TH mRNA in carotid body during hypoxia did not require
innervation of the carotid body or intact adrenal glands. In addition,
hypercapnia, another physiological stimulus of carotid body activity,
failed to induce an increase in TH mRNA in type I cells. Our findings
suggest that hypoxia stimulates TH gene expression in the carotid body by
a mechanism that is intrinsic to type I cells.

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide facilitates tyrosine
hydroxylase induction by cholinergic agonists in bovine adrenal chromaffin
cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract:</b>  The
possibility that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) may facilitate
the nicotine-mediated induction of adrenal medullary tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) was investigated with primary cultures (5-7 days in vitro) of bovine
adrenal chromaffin (BAC) cells. Exposure of BAC cells to 100 microM
nicotine led to only a marginal increase in the amount of TH mRNA, TH
protein, and TH activity. VIP alone or in the presence of a
phosphodiesterase inhibitor, produced a marked increase in TH mRNA, TH
protein, and TH activity. Moreover, VIP together with nicotine, at
concentrations that alone were devoid of effect, increased the amount of
TH mRNA and TH activity. A synergistic effect of VIP and nicotine on cAMP
accumulation in BAC cells was also apparent. The marginal effects of large
doses of nicotine on both cAMP accumulation and TH induction were blocked
completely by hexamethonium but were also partially inhibited by the VIP
antagonist [p-chloro-D-Phe6,Leu17]-VIP. Nicotine may, therefore, stimulate
the release of VIP from cultured BAC cells and VIP, in turn, by increasing
cAMP,  may synergize with nicotine to
enhance TH gene expression.

Sequences that direct rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene
expression
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Investigation of
neuroendocrine genes has revealed that transcription is regulated via
multiple DNA binding sites, including the cyclic AMP response element
(CRE). We show here that for the neuronal and chromaffin-specific gene
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a 70-bp region (-229 to -160) lacking the CRE
is sufficient, in either orientation, to confer levels of chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase reporter expression equivalent to or greater than that
conferred by 4.8 kb of the rat TH enhancer/promoter region. The 70-bp
region contains potential binding sites for AP2, AP1, E2A/MyoD, and POU
transcription factors, and functions when linked to the TH promoter, but
not when joined to a heterologous RSV promoter. This demonstrates that
promoter as well as enhancer elements are important for TH expression. In
gel-shift assays, the 70-bp fragment forms a cell type-specific complex
with nuclear extracts from TH-expressing cells. which is effectively
competed by an oligonucleotide containing AP2, AP1, and E2A/MyoD (E box)
sites, but not by one containing the POU site. These data suggest that the
AP2, AP1, and/or E box sites may be involved in forming the cell-specific
complex. Although it lacks an authentic CRE, the 70-bp region also
mediated a twofold transcriptional response to forskolin, equivalent to
that found with the endogenous gene. A different region (-60 to -29)
bearing a consensus CRE mediated a sixfold increase in transcription in
response to forskolin, but only minimally activated basal transcription
from the TH promoter in the absence of forskolin.

Inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase by R and S enantiomers
of salsolinol, 1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:
Salsolinol is one of the dopamine-derived
tetrahydroisoquinolines and is synthesized from pyruvate or acetaldehyde
and dopamine. As it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, salsolinol as
the R enantiomer in the brain is considered to be synthesized in situ in
dopaminergic neurons. Effects of R and S enantiomers of salsolinol on
kinetic properties of tyrosine hydroxylase [tyrosine,
tetrahydrobiopterin:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating); EC
1.14.16.2], the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, were
examined. The naturally occurring cofactor of tyrosine hydroxylase,
L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin, was found to induce allostery to
the enzyme polymers and to change the affinity to the biopterin itself.
Using L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin, tyrosine hydroxylase
recognized the stereochemical structures of the salsolinols differently.
The asymmetric center of salsolinol at C-1 played an important role in
changing the affinity to L-tyrosine. The allostery of tyrosine hydroxylase
toward biopterin cofactors disappeared, and at low concentrations of
biopterin such as in brain tissue, the affinity to the cofactor changed
markedly. A new type of inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase, by depleting
the allosteric effect of the endogenous biopterin, was found. It is
suggested that under physiological conditions, such a conformational
change may alter the regulation of DOPA biosynthesis in the brain.

Expression of the gene encoding tyrosine hydroxylase in a subpopulation

or chick embryo extract
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Avian sensory ganglia contain
a population of normally latent autonomic precursors with
catecholaminergic potentialities. The present study examines the
expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene in quail dorsal root
ganglia (DRG) by both in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) techniques. In situ hybridization using quail TH cDNA as a probe
demonstrated the presence in DRG cell cultures of TH mRNA in a
subpopulation of cells that never express the adrenergic phenotype in
vivo. Expression of the TH gene in autonomic precursor cells of DRG in
culture is totally dependent on the presence either of insulin or chick
embryo extract. The numbers of catecholaminergic cells expressing TH mRNA
and TH immunoreactivity evolve in a closely similar manner during the
culture period. Using two primers, specific for highly conserved 5'
regions of TH cDNA, it was possible to detect the same band of DNA
amplified by PCR in total RNA from DRG cultures grown in the presence of
insulin, sympathetic ganglia and adrenal gland. No amplified DNA was
detected in uncultured DRG cells. These data further indicate that, under
the influence either of insulin or a still unknown factor contained in the
CEE, the TH gene is induced in a subpopulation of DRG cells.

Site-directed mutagenesis of serine 40 of rat tyrosine hydroxylase.
Effects of dopamine and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation on enzyme activity

<b>Abstract</b>:
Rat tyrosine hydroxylase expressed with a baculovirus expression
system contains covalent phosphate and has kinetic parameters
consistent with those expected of phosphorylated enzyme (Fitzpatrick, P.
F., Chlumsky, L. J., Daubner, S. C., and O'Malley, K. L. (1990)
<i>J.&nbsp;Biol.&nbsp;Chem.</i> <b>265</b>, 2042-2047). The
phosphorylation site was identified as serine 40, by purifying the enzyme
from cells grown in the presence of [32P]phosphate. Replacement of serine
40 with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis prevented phosphorylation but
had little effect on the steady-state kinetic parameters at pH 7. Both
wild type and S40A tyrosine hydroxylase were expressed in Escherichia
coli; the kinetic parameters of the enzymes purified from bacteria were
nearly identical to those of the enzymes expressed with the baculovirus
system, although the bacterially expressed enzyme contained no covalent
phosphate. Treatment of this wild type enzyme with cAMP-dependent protein
kinase decreased the KBH4 value about 2-fold but had no effect on the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
value at pH 7. Treatment with a stoichiometric amount of dopamine
decreased the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> value 15-fold and increased the KBH4 value 2-3-fold.
Phosphorylation of the dopamine-bound enzyme increased the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> value
10-fold and decreased the KBH4 value 2-fold. The kinetic parameters of the
dopamine-bound recombinant enzyme were identical to those of enzyme
purified from PC12 cells. In contrast, the S40A enzyme was converted to a
less active form by treatment with dopamine but was not affected by
phosphorylating conditions. These results are consistent with a model in
which the major effect of phosphorylation of serine 40 is to relieve
tyrosine hydroxylase from the inhibitory effects of catecholamines.

only disrupted a DNA-protein complex unique to the two elements, but also
abolished expression in vivo. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction
between the AP-1 and the E box dyad motifs is responsible for
cell-specific TH expression.
<p class="Para1">
INTRO.  Previous
5'-deletion experiments to identify the necessary elements controlling rat
TH gene transcription pointed to a putative tissue-specific element
between 212 and 187 bp upstream of the start site.
Deletional analyses do not permit identification of additional factors;
site-directed mutagenesis is a better tool for analyzing the defined region.
<p>
RESULTS.  The
sequences within the 26 bp region (from -212 to -187) contain well-known
enhancer motifs which include the AP-1, octamer, and heptamer motifs,
which only differ by 1 bp from their consensus (AP-1 and octamer) or by
2 bp (heptamer).  The 26 bp region is shows 80% identity between the
rat and human TH genes.

Regulation of recombinant human tyrosine hydroxylase isozymes by
catecholamine binding and phosphorylation:  structure/activity
studies and mechanistic implications
<p class="Para1">
hTH1, hTH2, and hTH4 were all found to be inhibited by &mu;M
concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, as well as
several synthetic analogues of these compounds.  The more potent
inhibitors preserve the catechol functional group.  Inhibitors with COOH
groups on the aliphatic chain (including DOPA) or a -OH group on position
6 of the aromatic ring are weak.  These findings generally agree with
the results obtained working with rat and bovine TH.  Inhibition was
competitive with respect to tetrahydrobiopterin.  Equilibrium binding
studies show tetrahydrobiopterin induces dopamine dissociation
from hTH1.
<p>
It was previously reported that hTH forms a complex with iron and
catecholamines to produce a blue/green color resulting from
a charge-transfer band with a 700 nm maximum.  This color is
characteristic of bovine and rat TH obtained from catecholamine-rich
tissues.  This was used to follow the binding of dopamine to hTH1
reconstituted with Fe(II).  A plot of the change in absorbance
at 700 nm vs the mole fraction dopamine added per enzyme subunit shows an
inflection point at 1.0 mol dopamine /mol subunit.  In the absence
of Fe(II), no significant absorbance is observed in the 400-900 nm
range.  This stoichiometry of catecholamine binding was confirmed
with equilibrium binding of [<sup>14</sup>C]dopamine to hTH1 and
hTH2 which had been reconstituted with equimolar iron, the result being
1.1 mol dopamine bound/enzyme subunit for both isozymes, and a estimated
<i>K</i><sub>D</sub> of 2.3 &mu;M for hTH1 and 3.6 &mu;M for hTH2.
With 2-fold excess iron, the stoichiometry calculation was not
different, indicating a 1:1:1 dopamine/iron/subunit complex.
<p>
Equilibrium binding using [<sup>3</sup>H]dopamine was also performed
to measure the relative affinities of the other catecholamines.
(Free [<sup>3</sup>H]dopamine fraction was measured as a function
against unlabeled dopamine or tetrahydrobiopterin.)  Plot of bound
dopamine vs either [dopamine] or [tetrahydrobiopterin] indicate a stronger
affinity of dopamine itself.  Disagreement between IC<sub>50</sub> in the
activity inhibitor studies and the concentration of compound necessary
for half-maximal displacement of the labeled dopamine may result from
a lack of true equilibrium or that different enzyme concentrations were
used in the two analyses.
<p>
A previous report indicates that hTH1 and hTH2 are phosphorylated
to 1 mol P/mol subunit by cAMP-dependent protein kinase
catalytic subunit (shown on SDS gel as a labeled 60 kDa band).
It is shown that with 1 equivalent Fe(II) and dopamine
present during the phosphorylation, both the initial rate and
the final stoichiometry of incorporation were reduced.
Fe(II) added alone had no effect on phosphorylation, while
dopamine alone had a small effect on the incorporated amount.
Additions of larger amounts of protein kinase with long incubation
times did not change the result.  Changing the concentration of Fe(II)
with dopamine present indicated the effect was maximal at 1.0 mol Fe/mol
subunit.  Other experiments with bovine TH or a synthetic peptide showed
that iron in the presence or absence of dopamine does not affect (reduce)
their phosphorylation.
<p>

phosphorylated hTH2 follows.]

Cold-induced alterations in the binding of adrenomedullary nuclear
proteins to the promoter region of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene
<p class="Para1">
The 5'-flanking region of the TH gene across many species
contains select areas of highly conserved sequences and position.
Many of the conserved sequence areas correspond to well-known
transcriptional enhancer or control elements.  The 5'-flanking
region of TH gene from bovine adrenal gland was assembled into
the chimera p-246/+21 TH-CAT and transfected into
human neuroblastoma BE(2)-C, hepatoma HepG2, and PC12 cells.
The construct (named as it is because it encompasses
the 5'- and TH gene regions around the TH gene from -246 bp to +21 bp) is
obtained coupling a <i>Nae</i>I fragment composing the -246/+21
sequence into a polylinker of pGCAT-C, an expression vector for
the CAT reporter (see <i>Gene</i> <b>65</b>: 315, 1988).  Cells are
transiently transfected using the
Ca<sub>3</sub>(</span>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> precipitation
technique.
<p>
Transfected BE(2)-C cells demonstrated a clear CAT expression,
showing that the catecholaminergic cells contain the factors
necessary to drive TH expression.  Little promoter activity
could be observed in the HepG2 cells.  The fold-difference
in CAT expression was determined using cells transfected
with the expression vector pGCAT-C alone.  Cotransfection
of construct and pCMV-&beta;gal, which is a plasmid containing human
cytomegalovirus promoter coupled to a &beta;galactosidase
reporter, was used as an internal control, showed comparable
results measuring the efficiency of transfection for each cell line.
Transfection in PC12 cells resulted a significant in CAT expression.
<p>
Transfection with the -56/+21 relative deletion
mutant constructed in the CAT reporter plasmid resulted in a marked
diminution of CAT expression in all cell lines transfected.
Hence the elements between -57 and -246 are essential
for promoter activity.
<p>
The effects of cold stress were similarly studied.  5'-flanking
TH gene DNA was radiolabeled and incubated with nuclear protein
extracts prepared from non-stressed animals and rats exposed to
the cold for 1 hr.  A polyacrylamide gel mobility shift assay
is used to observe difference in unbound and protein-bound DNA
fragments.  Four fragments representing the parts of the region
-320 to +21 bp TH gene region were used.   Fragments T1 and T3
showed a cold-induced shifted mobility, whereas T2 and T4 did not.
<p>
The T3 fragment was further characterized over a
time course of cold exposure.  From 1-48
hours, the shift was evident in T3 and quantitatively equal at all times
tested.  Using nuclear protein extracts from
innervated and denervated glands of unilaterally splanchectomized animals
exposed to the cold for 60 min, results show that cold stress altered T3
fragment gel mobility in the innervated gland of cold-treated animals,
absent in the denervated gland, showing neurally mediated alterations.
<p>
Protein extracts from cold-stressed animals were
then pre-incubated with synthetic double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide
fragments containing the AP-1 consensus region, known to bind c-Fos/c-Jun
protein complexes (c-Fos and c-Jun expression is observed in phorbol ester
treatments) prior to incubation with labeled T3.
In the AP-1 preincubated samples, no T3 fragment gel
mobility shift was observed, indicating a clear competition.
Synthetic ds fragments containing an SP1 transcription
factor motif did not affect shifting of the T3 gel mobility.
When nuclear protein extracts were pre-incubated with
antiserum either to the leucine zipper region of c-Fos (c-Fos Ab1) or to
the DNA binding domain of c-Jun, the shifting of T3 was not evident.
Antiserum to the N-terminal domain of c-Fos
(c-Fos Ab2) had no effect on the shift of the T3 fragment.
When antiserum was heat-denatured prior to
pre-incubation or when antiserum was itself incubated with cognate
antigenic peptides, the inhibitory effects of T3 fragments shifting were
abolished.  Hence, cold-induced alterations
in TH activity appeared to be mediated by interaction of the c-Fos/c-Jun
protein complex with the AP1 binding site in the T3 frament of the
5'-flanking region in TH gene.

Purification and characterization of the blue-green rat phaeochromocytoma
(PC12) tyrosine hydroxylase with a dopamine-Fe(III) complex.
Reversal of the endogenous feedback inhibition by phosphorylation of
serine-40
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was purified from tumors
of rat phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells by a three-step
purification procedure giving 30 mg of pure enzyme in 3 days. The enzyme
sedimented with an S(eo),w value of 9.2 S and revealed an apparent subunit
molecular mass of 62 kDa with a minor 60 kDa component. Two-dimensional
gel isoelectric focusing/electrophoresis and tryptic digestion revealed
that the heterogeneity could be accounted for by limited proteolysis of
the 62 kDa component and the presence of covalently bound phosphate. The
enzyme had a strong blue-green color (epsilon 700 = 3.1 +/- 0.2
mM-iron-1.cm-1). The resonance Raman spectrum obtained with lambda
excitation = 605 nm revealed the presence of an Fe(III)-catecholamine
complex in the isolate enzyme, similar to that observed in the bovine
adrenal enzyme [Andersson, Cox, Que, Flatmark &amp; Haavik (1988)
<i>J.&nbsp;Biol.&nbsp;Chem.</i> <b>263</b>, 18621-18626]. In the
rat PC12 enzyme, all of the iron present (0.53 +/- 0.03 atom per subunit)
seems to be chelated by the feedback inhibitors (0.49 +/- 0.05 mol of
dopamine and 0.10 +/- 0.03 mol of noradrenaline per mol of subunit). The
e.p.r. spectra at 3.6 K show g-values at 7.0, 5.2 and 1.9 as observed for
other catecholate-complexed enzymes. After phosphorylation of serine-40
and addition of L-tyrosine a new rhombic (magnitude of E/D = 0.33) e.p.r.
species could be observed. Phosphorylation of serine-40 by cyclic
AMP-dependent protein kinase increased the catalytic activity; depending
on assay conditions, up to 80-110-fold activation could be observed when
measured at high TH (i.e. high endogenous catecholamine) concentration.

Phosphorylation and activation of tyrosine hydroxylase in
PC18 cells: a cell line derived from rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Treatment of rat pheochromocytoma PC18 cells
(a variant subclone of PC12 cells) with forskolin produced
increased activity and phosphorylation of tyrosine
hydroxylase. In contrast, treatment of the PC18 cells with 56 mM K+,
A23187, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate
(PDB) did not affect the activity and only slightly increased the
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. None of the treatments except
forskolin increased cyclic AMP levels in PC18 cells. Furthermore, 45Ca2+
uptake into PC18 cells was not affected by 56 mM K+, PDB or forskolin;
however, A23187 increased 45Ca2+ uptake 4-fold over basal uptake.
Nevertheless, no activation and little increase in phosphorylation of
tyrosine hydroxylase was observed in PC18 cells treated with A23187. When
tyrosine hydroxylase levels in PC18 cells were elevated by treatment with
dexamethasone, activation of tyrosine hydroxylase by 56 mM K+, PDB or
A23187 was still not observed. Both purified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed the
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase purified from PC18 cells in vitro.
Furthermore, crude cell extracts from PC12 cells and PC18 cells possessed
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity that catalyzed the
phosphorylation of purified tyrosine hydroxylase. These results suggest
that tyrosine hydroxylase activity in PC18 cells is regulated by a cyclic
AMP-dependent mechanism. However, due to a number of abnormalities the
Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms do not result in the activation of tyrosine
hydroxylase and only slightly increase the phosphorylation of the enzyme
in PC18 cells.

AP-1 complex and c-fos transcription are involved in TPA provoked
and trans-synaptic inductions of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene:
insights into long-term regulatory mechanisms
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: We have previously shown that
the phorbol ester, TPA, which activates protein kinase C, causes, in PC12
cells, a transcriptional activation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the key
enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. The study has now been extended to
examine the processes that underlie this transcriptional stimulation and,
in addition, to seek whether similar mechanisms are involved in long-term
trans-synaptic induction of the TH gene in adrenal medullae of rats that
have been given a single injection of reserpine. In both systems, it was
found that the induction of c-fos gene transcription was associated with
that of the TH gene but with different kinetics. The promoter of the TH
gene contains (at position -207/-200) a sequence (TGATTCA) which differs
from the consensus TRE or AP-1 site (TGACTCA) by one nucleotide.
Experiments were carried out to investigate whether the AP-1 protein
complex which is known to contain Fos and Jun binds to the putative TRE
region of the TH promoter. In the gel shift assays, the nuclear protein
extracts derived from TPA-treated PC12 cells and from AM of reserpine
injected rats displayed a higher magnitude of binding to a 25-mer TRE-TH
oligonucleotide as compared to controls. The results showed that the
behaviour of TRE-TH was atypical in that two retarded complexes (A and B)
were observed, which were displaced by specific competitors.
Trans-activation experiments with plasmids TRE-TH/TK/CAT and -754/-19
TH/pUC18-CAT in PC12 cells showed an increase in CAT activity in response
to TPA that correlates with the previously observed increase in TH
transcriptional activity by TPA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Co-expression of tyrosine hydroxylase messenger RNA 1 and
2 in human ventral mesencephalon revealed by digoxigenin- and
biotin-labelled oligodeoxyribonucleotides
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: In situ hybridization
experiments, using oligodeoxyribonucleotides specific for the two major
expressed human tyrosine hydroxylase mRNAs, were performed on human brain
sections at the level of the mesencephalon. The specificity of the probes
was ascertained by Northern blot experiments carried out with
independently in vitro synthesized human tyrosine hydroxylase mRNAs. For
in situ hybridization experiments, oligodeoxyribonucleotides were labelled
with nucleotides tagged with digoxigenin or biotin molecules. The
hybridized oligonucleotides were detected by antibodies coupled with
peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase enzymes, which yield, with appropriate
substrates, brown and purple products, respectively. The simultaneous
detection of the two mRNAs with digoxigeninated and biotinylated probes
revealed that these two mRNAs are co-expressed in single cells. The purple
product obtained with alkaline phosphatase exhibits a discrete
distribution within the dopaminergic cells suggesting these mRNAs are
associated with sub-cellular structures. Finally, a heterogeneity in the
intensity of the labelling of reactive cells with both probes was
visualized as well as the expression of the two mRNA species in neurites.

Is forskolin stimulation of rat striatal tyrosine hydroxylase
dependent on adenylate cyclase activation?
<p class="Para1">
Forskolin is a diterpene well-established in cAMP activating systems.
It has been postulated that the adenylate cyclase system must be present
in striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals if forskolin activates TH there.
Neurotransmitter-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated TH
activation appears to offer additional evidence of cAMP-mediated events.
However, it seems that forskolin may also have other effects which
include interactions with transport proteins and ion channel proteins,
and that this occurs independently of adenylate cyclase activity changes.
Some responses to forskolin, including inhibition of &gamma;-aminobutyric
acid-gate Cl<sup>-</sup> influx and of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
may be both cAMP-dependent and -independent.
<p>
To examine how forskolin works in synaptosomal TH activity, the
forskolin analog 1,9-dideoxyforskolin was tested to see what
effect it had on stimulating TH activity.   It has already been
shown to be unable to stimulate rat cortical adenylate
cyclase and has been implicated in many of the effects of cAMP-independent
forskolin treatment.
<p>
RESULTS.  A log dose (from 0.1 to 100 &mu;M) of 1,9-dideoxyforskolin (DDF)
was able to stimulate increase in cAMP level, but had no effect TH activity
at any dose.  Although at higher concentrations of DDF cAMP
levels were enhanced, they were clearly not above a threshold for TH to be
activated.  The maximal effect with DDF was not seen at the highest dose
tested.  Forskolin under the same conditions not only stimulated cAMP
levels, but also enhanced TH activity.  Forskolin was minimally effective
at even 0.1 &mu;M, the lowest dose tested, and had significantly increased
cAMP levels and TH.  The profiles showing increase were nearly identical
for TH and cAMP.  Indeed the EC<sub>50</sub> for TH activity
stimulation and cAMP level change were 0.52 and 0.60 &mu;M, resp.
<p>
Rp-cAMPS is an antagonist of cAMP which added to striatal membranes
does not affect basal or forskolin-stimulated adenylate
cyclase activites when included in the log forskolin dose curves at
(0.5 mM).  A concentration-dependent decrease in basal TH activity
could be obtained with Rp-cAMPS (measured from 50 &mu;M to 1 mM),
with a maximal effect (25% decrease) at 1 mM.  Forskolin-stimulated
activity was also inhibited if Rp-cAMPS was preincubated, but higher
forskolin concentrations could overcome the Rp-cAMPS-mediated inhibition.
Double reciprocal plots (1/v vs. 1/[forskolin]) show that the activation
constant was increased for forskolin and that there was no effect on the
maximal enzyme stimulation obtainable, a classic indication of competitive
inhibition.  The K<sub>i</sub> for Rp-cAMPS was calculated to be 0.43 mM.
Direct addition (1 mM) of Rp-cAMPS to TH does not affect enzyme activity.
<p>
These data appear to indicate that rat striatal TH activation is a
result of direct cause and effect cAMP-mediate activation.  The
inhibitor Rp-cAMPS is able to pass membranes, resists phospodiesterases
and inhibits cAMP stimulation of PK-A forms I and II.  It also inhibited
basal levels of TH, indicating that a basal cAMP level may be present to
stimulate TH.

Modulation of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in the rat adrenal
gland by exercise:  effects of age
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Both aging and exercise are
associated with alterations in circulating levels of catecholamines. To
determine the interactions of age and exercise on tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) activity and TH mRNA, Fischer-344 female rats aged 5 months (young)
and 25 months (old) were trained by treadmill running for 10 weeks. The
elevation in maximum oxygen consumption in both groups was equivalent
following exercise, indicating that training had occurred. In control
rats, both TH activity and TH mRNA were greater in the older groups when
compared with the younger animals. In young rats, exercise decreased TH
activity by 25% and TH mRNA by 27%. In older rats, exercise was not
associated with a decrease in TH activity and TH mRNA. Choline
acetyltransferase activity (ChAT) was decreased and glutamic acid
decarboxylase activity (GAD) was increased by exercise in young rats. The
decrease in ChAT activity and increase in GAD activity suggest that
trans-synaptic mechanisms play a role in the exercise-induced alteration
of TH gene expression. Neither ChAT nor GAD was altered by exercise in
older groups. Our data suggest that the previously reported diminution in
catecholamines associated with exercise may be due to a decrease in TH
mRNA and a resulting decrease in TH activity. There was no effect of
exercise in the old rats, supporting previous observations that the
plasticity of the sympathoadrenal system diminishes with age.

Molecular aspects of the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase by testosterone
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Previous studies have
demonstrated that the sympathetic hypogastric ganglia (HG) are dependent
upon the continued presence of testosterone for normal development and
maintenance of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity. The regulation of TH by
testosterone has been examined further to determine whether the reduction
in TH activity following castration is associated with changes in levels
of TH protein and mRNA. TH protein was measured by immunotitration of HG
homogenates using a TH-specific antibody, and TH-specific mRNA was
detected by hybridization of dot blots of total RNA isolated from HG with
a cDNA probe coding for TH. The results show that tyrosine hydroxylase
activity, protein and mRNA are coordinately reduced in a graded fashion at
1, 2 and 4 weeks following castration. Testosterone replacement therapy
immediately following castration prevents the decrease in TH levels. The
results indicate that gonadal steroids regulate the biosynthesis of TH in
the HG. Testosterone may control TH either directly by interacting with
neurons of the HG, or indirectly by altering levels of trophic factors in
the target tissues.

Analysis of the human tyrosine hydroxylase promoter-chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase chimeric gene expression in transgenic mice
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: To investigate cis-elements
responsible for catecholaminergic (CAnergic) neuron-specific expression of
the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene, we produced lines of transgenic mice
carrying 5.0-kb, 2.5-kb and 0.2-kb fragments from the 5'-flanking region
of the human TH gene fused to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase (CAT), and designated them as TC 50, TC 25, and TC 02,
respectively, and reporter gene expression in transgenic mice was analyzed
by CAT assay by immunocytochemistry with anti-CAT antibody. High-level CAT
expression was observed in the brain and adrenal gland using the 5.0-kb
promoter of the TC 50 mice, but ectopic expression was consistently
observed in several somatic tissues, e.g. thymus, colon, and testis. In
brain, expression was achieved in CAnergic neurons with the largest
construct (5.0 kb), but not with 2.5 kb or 0.2 kb of 5' flanking sequence.
However, TC 50 mice also expressed CAT immunoreactivity in non-CAnergic
neurons. In the TC 25 line CAT immunoreactivity was detected only in some
non-CAnergic neurons. In the TC 02 line no CAT immunoreactivity was
detected in any of the tissues examined. These results indicate that the
5.0-kb DNA fragment of the TH gene upstream region contains activity to
express CAT in CAnergic neurons and surprisingly, lacks some regulatory
elements attenuating ectopic expression, and that the 2.5-kb and 0.2-kb
fragment are not sufficient for the proper expression. We discuss the
presence of the tissue-specific regulatory elements in the structure
portion of the TH gene and/or 3'-flanking region.

Distribution of 4&alpha;-hydroxytetrahydropterin dehydratase in rat tissues.
Comparison with the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: A 4&alpha;-carbinolamine intermediate is generated stoichiometrically
during the tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent phenylalanine hydroxylation
reaction catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase. The dehydration of the
carbinolamine is catalyzed by the enzyme, 4&alpha;-hydroxytetrahydropterin dehydratase. We have now examined
the distribution of the dehydratase activity in various rat tissues by
activity measurements and by immunoblot analysis to explore the
possibility that the dehydratase may also play a role in tyrosine and
tryptophan hydroxylation. The only two tissues that express relatively
high dehydratase activity are liver and kidney, which are also the only
two tissues that express phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. The
dehydratase activity was generally very low in those tissues which contain
high levels of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activity, except for
the pineal gland. These results suggest that the dehydratase may not play
an important role in the regulation of the synthesis of those
neurotransmitters which are derived from the hydroxylated aromatic amino
acids.

5'-Flanking sequences of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase
gene target accurate tissue-specific, developmental, and transsynaptic
expression in transgenic mice
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Transgenic mice were
generated in which sequences that flank the rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
gene were linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)
gene. Mice bearing 4.8 kilobases (kb) of 5' flanking DNA exhibited correct
tissue-specific expression in the CNS and periphery. Expression was more
robust in the CNS than in the periphery, although CAT activity was clearly
detected in sympathetic ganglia (superior cervical ganglia) and the
adrenal, the two peripheral tissues that contain TH-positive cells. Within
the brain, CAT expression was seen in all the expected areas containing
TH-positive cell bodies, with little or no expression in other regions. In
the olfactory bulb, which contains the majority of the CNS TH cells,
developmental expression of CAT was quantifiable and was found to parallel
the postnatal rise in endogenous TH, with both TH and CAT reaching adult
levels by postnatal day 21. Since TH activity in the olfactory bulb
requires afferent input, the dependence of CAT activity on transsynaptic
input was also assayed in transgenic mice. Like the endogenous TH
activity, CAT levels were also reduced by deafferentation, in parallel
with loss in endogenous dopamine levels. While previous experiments
demonstrated that shorter 5' flanking regions (2.5 kb and 3.5 kb of 5'
upstream sequences of the human and mouse TH gene, respectively) failed to
direct accurate tissue-specific expression, our data demonstrate that 4.8
kb of 5' flanking sequence of the rat TH gene contains sufficient
regulatory information to mediate appropriate tissue-specific expression
in all CNS and PNS tissues, as well as to mediate developmental and
transsynaptic expression in the olfactory bulb.

Nicotinic cholinergic regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase
gene expression and catecholamine synthesis in isolated bovine adrenal
chromaffin cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Isolated bovine adrenal
chromaffin cells were used to study the nicotinic regulation of tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) gene expression. Continuous exposure of the cells to
carbachol or the nicotinic receptor agonist
1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP) produces a time- and
concentration-dependent increase in TH enzyme activity, whereas muscarine
has no effect. DMPP at 1 microM (EC50 = 0.3 microM) elicits a two- to
threefold elevation of both TH activity and TH immunoreactive protein
level after 3-5 days in the presence of 2.5 mM calcium; the increase in
enzyme levels is significantly less at lower extracellular calcium levels.
The rate of hydroxylation of tyrosine to dopamine (DA) in intact cells, an
index of endogenous TH activity, increases in parallel with the rise in TH
levels. The TH mRNA level is elevated before the increase in protein
levels. As determined by nuclear run-on assays, TH gene transcription is
stimulated two- to threefold within 30 min of addition of 1 microM DMPP to
the cells; transcription returns to basal levels by 2 h. Nitrendipine (20
microM) blocks the stimulation of transcription by DMPP. Pretreatment of
the cells with cycloheximide (5 microM) does not prevent the DMPP
stimulation of transcription. Forskolin (10 microM) also increases TH
transcription (fourfold in 15 min) by a mechanism that is not blocked by
cycloheximide. These results show that nicotinic receptor stimulation
increases TH mRNA synthesis, TH protein levels, and TH activity in a
calcium-dependent manner. Furthermore, the nicotinic influence on TH gene
expression does not appear to require the synthesis of a protein factor
for its effects. That in situ DA synthesis rates are elevated consequent
to the rise in TH levels demonstrates that TH induction serves as a
mechanism for enhancing the catecholamine-synthesizing capacity of the
chromaffin cell on a long-term basis.

Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase gene transcription
rate and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA stability by cyclic AMP and
glucocorticoid
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA is
induced in rat pheochromocytoma PC18 cells by cAMP analogs and
glucocorticoids. Previous studies have shown that these increases in
tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA are due at least in part to stimulation of the
tyrosine hydroxylase gene. However, the involvement of
post-transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase
mRNA by these inducing agents has not been investigated. In the present
study, using nuclear run-on assays we show that the relative transcription
rate of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene is stimulated 2-5-fold within 20 min
after treatment of PC18 cells with cAMP analogs or dexamethasone and that
the rate of transcription remains elevated 2-3-fold for at least 24 hr in
the continual presence of these inducing agents. Pulse-labeling
experiments using 4-thiouridine indicate that the rate of synthesis of
tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA is increased approximately 3-fold or 10-fold
after treatment with either a cyclic AMP analog or dexamethasone,
respectively. These increases in rates of synthesis agree well with the
fold increases in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels after treatment with
these inducers. Treatment of the cells with cycloheximide lowers the basal
relative transcription rate of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene 2-3-fold;
however, the relative transcription rate of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene
is still elevated in cells treated with either dexamethasone or cAMP
analogs in the presence of cycloheximide, compared with the transcription
rate of the gene in cells treated with cycloheximide alone. These results
indicate that protein synthesis is not required for the short term
regulation of the gene by these inducing agents. The apparent t1/2 for
tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA has been estimated by two different procedures,
approach to steady state kinetics and pulse-chase analysis. Both
procedures yield an estimated apparent t1/2 of approximately 6-9 hr for
tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA under basal culture conditions. Dexamethasone
does not substantially alter this apparent t1/2 value; however, cAMP
appears to lower this apparent t1/2 value transiently. Our results suggest
that cAMP and glucocorticoid regulate tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels
primarily by stimulating the transcription rate of the tyrosine
hydroxylase gene; however, cAMP may also regulate the stability of the
mRNA for a short period of time, such that it is induced more rapidly in
the cells.

The incorporation of divalent metal ions into recombinant
human tyrosine hydroxylase apoenzymes studied by intrinsic fluorescence
and 1H-NMR spectroscopy
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Three isoforms of human
tyrosine hydroxylase were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to
homogeneity as the apoenzymes (metal-free). The apoenzymes exhibit typical
tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra when excited at 250-300 nm. The
emission maximum (342 nm) was not shifted by the addition of metal ions,
but reconstitution of the apoenzymes with Fe(II) at pH 7-9 reduced the
fluorescence intensity by about 35%, with an end point at 1.0 iron
atom/enzyme subunit. The fluorescence intensity of purified bovine adrenal
tyrosine hydroxylase, containing 0.78 mol tightly bound iron/mol subunit,
was reduced by only 6% on addition of an excess amount of Fe(II). Other
divalent metal ions [Zn(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Cu(II) and Ni(II)] also
reduced the fluorescence intensity of the human enzyme by 12-30% when
added in stoichiometric amounts. The binding of Co(II) at pH 7.2 was also
found to affect its 1H-NMR spectrum and this effect was reversed by
lowering the pH to 6.1. The quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of the
human isoenzymes by Fe(II) was reversed by the addition of metal
chelators. However, the addition of stoichiometric amounts of
catecholamines, which are potent feedback inhibitors of tyrosine
hydroxylase, to the iron-reconstituted enzyme, prevented the release of
iron by the metal chelators. Fluorescence quenching, nuclear magnetic
relaxation measurements and EPR spectroscopy all indicate that the
reconstitution of an active holoenzyme from the isolated apoenzyme, with
stoichiometric amounts of Fe(II) at neutral pH, occurs without a
measurable change in the redox state of the metal. However, on addition of
dopamine or suprastoichiometric amounts of iron, the enzyme-bound iron is
oxidized to a high-spin Fe(III) (S = 5/2) form in an environment of nearly
axial symmetry, thus providing an explanation for the inhibitory action of
the catecholamines.

Regulation of recombinant rat tyrosine hydroxylase by
dopamine
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:
Recombinant rat PC12 tyrosine hydroxylase, also called
tyrosine 3-monooxygenase [L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine:oxygen
oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.16.2], purified from Escherichia
coli is in an activated form with a low <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the tetrahydrobiopterin
cofactor and a pH optimum of 6.5. Pretreatment with low levels of the
derived product, dopamine, inhibits catalytic activity, increases the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for the cofactor, and shifts the pH curve towards a more acidic pH
optimum. Labeled dopamine binds to tyrosine hydroxylase with high affinity
(Kd = 1 microM) but low stoichiometry (r = 0.08 mol/mol of enzyme
subunit). The binding of dopamine results in the appearance of a
blue-green chromophore with lambda max at approximately 660 nm, which is
consistent with the formation of a catecholamine-iron complex. In the
absence of dopamine, the recombinant enzyme cannot be further activated by
phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase, although as much as 1
mol of phosphate is incorporated per mol of subunit. In contrast, the
enzyme pretreated with dopamine is activated by phosphorylation in the
same fashion and to the same extent as the native hydroxylase. The results
suggest that the high-affinity binding of catecholamine products is a
pivotal post-translational modification that determines the state of
enzyme activation and the response to phosphorylation.

Site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine hydroxylase:
role of serine 40 in catalysis
<p class="Para1">
The plasmid pCDM8-TH is constructed by subcloning the 1.8
kb fragment obtained from <i>Xho</i>I digestion of pSP72-TH
into the CDM8 expression vector.  The
pSP72-TH construct had been obtained by insertion of rat TH cDNA into the
<i>Xho</i>I site of pSP72 (Promega).
The rat TH cDNA was itself generated from PCR
amplification of PC12 cell cDNA library for 40 cycles (1 min strand
separation @ 94&deg;/2 min primer anneal @ 37&deg;/3 min primer extension @
72&deg;).  Site-directed mutagenesis was at all
phosphorylation sites was achieved by PCR overlapping extension procedure
with primers containing the desired base substitutions.
In a first step, the fragment to be overlapped was
amplified in separate reactions in which the sense-mutated primer was
paired with a downstream unmutated antisense primer, and the antisense
mutated primer paired with an upstream wild-type sense primer.
In the second step, a small amount of each product
from the first reaction, together with wild-type flanking primers, is used
for the PCR.  PCR products obtained on gels
is double digested with HindIII and PstI and then ligated with T4 ligase
to CDM8-TH which has also been double-digested.
All sequences were confirmed by chain-termination
method using the GemSeq K/RT system.
<p>AtT-20 pituarty cells grown to 60% confluence in
DMEM+10% FCS are transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation and
cells extracted after 48 h.  The transiently
transfected cells showed detectable TH activity for all constructs of TH,
while untransfected cells show none.  The
Leu and Tyr substitutions of Ser-40 showed the greatest specific activity
of all TH mutants, a 5.4- and 6.4-fold increase in basal activity over the
wild-type (wild-type=1.45 nmol/h/mg).  The
Leu substitutions of Ser-8 and Ser-19 were equivalent to the wild-type,
while the Leu-31 mutant was lower in activity than the wild-type.
<p>Stably transfected cells were obtained by
cotransfection of CDM8-TH and pSV-Neo<sub>2</sub>
(containing a neomycin resistance gene) and then challenging cells with
600 &mu;g/ml G418 after 36 h.  Cells stably
transfected with the Leu-40 or Tyr-40 mutant showed TH activity levels
which were eventually 100-fold higher than when transiently
expressed.  Wild-type TH from AtT-20
extracts was immunochemically characterized using a polyclonal anti-rat TH
on Western blots:  a single band migrating
in the 58-60 kDa range along with PC12 and rat striatal TH was
observed.  The Leu-40 and Tyr-40 TH products
also were immunostained by the antibody.
Comparisons of the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> with respect to
cofactor and the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> were done at pH
6.0 and 7.2.  A table shows that the
wild-type product has an optimum of pH 6.0, which it shares with PC12 and
rat striatal TH.  Previous reports show that
PK-A-mediated phosphorylation of striatal and PC12 TH results in both a
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> decrease for cofactor and and
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> increase, in which both the
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> at both pH 6.0 and 7.2 are the same.
The Leu-40 and Tyr-40 mutants also both show decreased
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and increased <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values which are the same at both pH values.
Dixon plot analysis using varied dopamine at two
different cofactor concentrations shows that the Leu-40 mutant had a
K<sub>i</sub> over 3-fold higher than for the wild-type.
<p>
Comparison of the activities of wild-type TH
phosphorylated by PKA and those of the Leu-40 and Tyr-40 mutants show that
even the phosphorylated wt-TH, although activated 3-fold by PK-A action,
is nonetheless much less active than the Tyr- or Leu-40 mutants (the
mutants are about 3- to 3.3-fold higher than the activity of
PK-A-phosphorylated wt-TH).  Moreover,
Leu-31 mutant is about 2 times higher in activity than the wild-type; when
treated with PK-A, the Leu-31 mutant is activated itself 3-fold.
Leu-40 and Tyr-40 mutant treated with PK-A shows
no activation, but instead shows a small but insignficant loss of
activity.
<p>Homogenates of AtT-20 show an endogenous presence
of phosphorylating activity when ATP and cAMP are added to extracts with
corresponding addition of PK-A.  TH activity
is stimulated in these instances, and more so when PK-A is included.
<p>TH purification was necessary for some
experiments:  cells are sonicated in 20 mM
KP<sub>i</sub>, pH 6.5 and centrifuged.
80% saturation of the supernatant with
AmSO<sub>4</sub> pellets the enzyme, followed by
dialysis, then 40% saturation with AmSO<sub>4</sub> to obtain the pellet.
The pellet is resuspended in buffer containing 10% glycerol, DTT,
leupeptin, pepstatin, and PMSF.  This is
injected into a TSK 3000 SW column and highest activity collected.

Multiple signaling pathways in bovine chromaffin cells regulate
tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation at Ser<sup>19</sup>, Ser<sup>31</sup>,
and Ser<sup>40</sup>
<p class="Para1">
Chromaffin cells were obtained from glands by digesting
with 0.1-0.2% collagenase (Sigma C-0130) according to Livett, suspending
the initial cell fraction in DME-F12/OptiMEM I (50/50) with 5% FCS, 1/100
antimycotic-antibiotic, and 5 &mu;M cytosine arabinoside.
3-10 day-old cultures were used after selective
plating and use of collagen-coated dishes.
Labeling of cells was done by pre-equilibrating cells 5 min in a
phosphate-deficient medium:  25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>,
15 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 5 &mu;M
Tris<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.  Cells then incubated at 37&deg;
for 60-90 min (1 ml per well in 6-well size dish) with
0.25 to 1.0 mCi <sup>32</sup>PO<sub>4</sub> (NEN NEX-053).
Treatments are added as concentrated stocks into the incubation
solution;  termination of treatment involve
aspiration of the medium, addition of 1% SDS and 1 mM EDTA with Tris, pH
8, then heating the samples in boiling water for 2-5 min.
<p>
SDS gels were run, and the 60 kDa TH excised or transferred to
nitrocellulose for tryptic digestion.  Tryptic peptides are
resolved on C18 HPLC with a 0.1% TFA at 1 mL/min and developed
with acetonitrile using the following program:  5 min at 0.5%/min,
55 min at 0.15%/min, 5 min at 10%/min.  Using this program,
six peptides (CC1 to CC6) eluted at 21-22, 29, 43, 46, 50, and 53 min
with baseline resolution.  Rechromatography of each using a more shallow
gradient (0.1%/min) showed that CC1, CC3, CC5, and CC6 had single
symmetrical peaks.  The presence of CC4 was generally variable, and two
other peaks "a" at 40 min and "b" at 59 min were sometimes present when
phosphate incorporation was significant in CC2 and CC4.
Rechromatography of CC4 produced additional peaks at CC2 position
and at position "b."  Rechromatography of CC2 on the other hand
yielded an additional peak at "a."
<p>
It was known previously that the serine-31 peptide
from rat (QAEVTSPR) can be cyclized because of the N-terminal Gln.
The same should be true for bovine peptide (QAEAIMSPR).  Additionally
the presence of Met portends the possibility of oxidation.
The following tests were performed:
<p>
1.  CC4 is treated with CNBr.  A rapidly eluting labeled peak
comes out early in the program, later characterized as SPR, predicted from
the sequence.
<p>
2.  CC2 is treated with CNBr.  No change in its retention time.
<p>
3.  CC2 is treated with methylmercaptoacetamide according to
Houghten and Li (<i>Anal. Biochem.</i> <b>98</b>: 36-46, 1979).
Retention time is shifted to that of CC4.  CNBr treatment of this
peptide produces treatment 1 result.
<p>
4.  CC2 and CC4 are maintained at room temperature for ~24 h in 0.1% TFA,
with additional peaks produced at times "a" and "b," resp.
<p>
5.  Pyroglutamate aminopeptidase treatment causes shifts in the retention
times of "a" and "b" but not CC2 and CC4.
<p>
Hence CC2 and CC4 are the oxidized and reduced
forms of Ser-31 peptide, resp., while "a" and "b" are those forms
but with the N-terminal Gln cyclized.
<p>
When precautions are taken to minimize oxygen exposure and time
of handling, no CC2 peptide is observable in tryptic
digests of chromaffin cell TH.  Phosphoamino acid analysis
indicates that all modified sites are serines.  Two-dimensional thin-layer
electrophoresis/chromatography at pH 1.9 and 8.9 in the first dimension
shows separation of all six peptides observed.  Their electrophoretic
mobilities is consistent with predicted mobilities in view of
modification of tryptic sequences.  The presence of CC2 in the
plates (not loaded) indicates substantial oxidation occurring
during manipulation.
<p>
IEF separations show all peptide move to pI values &lt;6 no matter
the origin of loading (see table of peptides).  Because of band
distortion at the anode, IEF standards had to be placed within each lane.

The position of the labeled phosphate is assessed by substractive
analysis of peptide at pH 1.9 and 8.9 through 6 cycles of manual
Edman degradation as modified.  Release of phosphate label is
observed as a shift after so many cycles.  No release of
phosphate is observed in CC1 or CC4 after 6 cycles at either
electrophoretic pH.
<p>
Digestion with AspN or GluC endopeptidases from B-M
decreased the retention time of CC3 and CC5.
AspN but not GluC affected the retention of CC6.
GluC but not AspN affected the retention time of
CC4, and neither protease was effective on CC1.
<p>
If chromaffin cells are treated with 100 &mu;M
acetylcholine at 37&deg;, it is reported that transient increases occur in
Ser-19 and Ser-40 phosphorylation, followed by a slower increase in
Ser-31.  The first phosphorylation may be
indicative of the action of CaM-MPK II.
Acetylcholine did induce these phased increases in phosphorylation at the
different sites, but at room temperature, the phosphorylation of Ser-31
increased at the same time as did Ser-19 and -40.
This weakens the kinetic arguments that a common
kinase is involved in the signaling pathway and suggests different protein
kinases may be involved in all phases.
<p>
High frequency (10 Hz) activation of splanchnic
nerves has been reported to affect both the nicotinic and muscarinic
receptors of the rat adrenal.  This
mechanism is not well understood in the bovine chromaffin cell.
TH phosphate label incorporation was measured
for a variety of secretagogues and other signal activators, all at
37&deg;.  Total TH phosphorylation and
distribution into the four sites (as % control) is presented.
With 5 min treatment with either 10 &mu;M nicotine or 20
&mu;m acetylcholine, the effect is the same:
nearly 2-fold increase in total TH phosphate, 4-fold into Ser-31, with
some increase in Ser-19 and -40 as well.  On
the other hand, 100 &mu;M muscarine for 5 min, with Ser-19 actually decreased
significantly, but Ser-31 3-fold increased, and no overall significant
change in total TH phosphate (at shorter times, Ser-19 is high relative to
Ser-31).  With 5 min of 40 mM KCl, 50 &mu;M
veratridine, or 2 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub>, which are
non-receptor depolarizing agents, the effect is much like that of the
nicotine/acetylcholine agonist, indicating that cholinergic receptor
activation is not required itself for this effect.
<p>
Low frequency (1 Hz) activation of rat adrenal
medulla has the effect of mediating secretion by noncholinergic systems,
namely by vasoactive intestinal peptide-like activators.
VIP has been reported to increase Ser-40
phosphorylation in suspension cultures.  In
this report, 200 nM VIP for 5 min has some effect on Ser-31 and -40
phosphorylation, a much larger (4-fold) effect on both sites at a higher
concentration (1 &mu;M).  If PK-C activation
can be said to effect Ser-31 incorporation while PK-A results in direct
phosphorylation of Ser-40, it may be inferred that VIP mediates
coordinated activation of both PK-C and -A.
There are differences in cell preparations (fresh vs. cultured, suspension
vs. monolayer) which could account for the observed different
effects.  The table also shows that 10 &mu;M
forskolin (30 min) and 2 mM 8-Br-cAMP (10 min) effected changes only in
Ser-40 (7-fold in the case of forskolin).   50 &mu;M PDBu and
2 &mu;M PMA, both for 10 min, had virtually the same effect in
increasing both Ser-31 and -40 4- to 5-fold.  200 nM 4-&alpha;-PDBu
and 1 &mu;M 4-&alpha;-PMA, which are nonactivating analogues,
had no effect on phosphorylation.  And okadaic acid (1 &mu;M, 30 min)
generally increased phosphate content significantly in
all three sites, but not Ser-8.  Note that Ser-8 phosphorylation
appears not to be significant in nonmitotic cells or tissues such
as dopaminergic neurons and chromaffin cells of both rat and bovine spp.
<p>
Many other agents tested. Adult chromaffin cells were treated with
200 ng/ml NGF for 15 and 30 min, but phosphorylation increases in
serines-19, -31, and -40 were not significantly altered.  In calf
chromaffin cells however, 200 ng/ml NGF for 30 min did result in a
marginal increase in the Ser-31 site alone.
More significantly, phorbol esters (PDBu, 1 &mu;M, 30 min) resulted in a
Ser-31 (4.2-fold) and Ser-40 (6.1-fold) increase.
Forskolin (10 &mu;M, 30 min) was powerful in its effect
on Ser-40 (18-fold), but had no effect on Ser-19 or -31.
<p>
Other test agents known to be physiological signals
were checked as well.  Labeled cells were treated with
1&mu;M bradykinin, which after two minutes had significant
effects on all three serines, but after 5 min, the largest effect (8-fold)
was on Ser-31.  1 &mu;M histamine largely reflected the same result,
with Ser-19 being important initially, but falling off.
Angiotensin II was tried at two doses (0.1 and 1 &mu;M) for 5 min,
and only Ser-31 phosphorylation was significant and increasing.
Endothelin III at both doses for the same treatment time showed
identical results with angiotensin II.  Prostaglandin E1 (1 &mu;M),
GABA (20 &mu;M), and ATP (30 &mu;M), all for 5 min stimulated only
Ser-31 phosphorylation.  Other compounds, atriopeptide III
(1 &mu;M, 20 min), nitroprusside (100 &mu;M, 20 min),
adenosine (10 &mu;M, 10 min), <i>N</i>-ethylcarboxyamidoadenosine
(10 &mu;M, 10 min), theophylline (100 &mu;M, alone or in combination

indomethacin (10 &mu;M, alone or in combination with ACh,
elevated K<sup>+</sup>, or PDBu) were without effect.
<p>
<u>Discussion</u>.  Multiple site phosphorylation of TH was initially
described in labeled bovine chromaffin cells.  Site identification
has been slowed by differences in the tissues/cells available as
different species with different structures.  The use of neoplastic
tissues has brought some confusion to the process, since it shows
phosphorylation of one site which may not be important physiologically.
<p>
In vitro work shows that TH is phosphorylated by CaM PK-II and
ERKs on the Ser-19 and -31 sites, resp.  Ser-40 is the target of
number of protein kinases, namely CaM MPK-II, PK-A, PK-C, PK-N,
and the S6 protein kinase.  In particular agents that elevate PK-C are
associated with increases in Ser-31 phosphorylation, which contradicts the
in vitro result assoicated with it.  Hence the direct phosphorylation
of TH in differentiated tissue may be controlled by CaM-MPK, ERK, and
PK-A at the three respective sites.

&#147;7-tetrahydrobiopterin,&#148; a naturally occurring analogue
of tetrahydrobiopterin, is a cofactor for and a potential inhibitor of the
aromatic amino acid hydroxylases
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The ability of
2-amino-4-hydroxy-7-[dihydroxylpropyl-(L-erythro)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin]
("7-tetrahydrobiopterin" or 7-BH4) to substitute for the natural
cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) has been studied in vitro in the
reactions of the three mammalian aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. With
rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase, the apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for 7-BH4 is 160
microM, a value that is approximately 60-fold greater than that for the
natural cofactor. In contrast, the hydroxylase reaction is severely
inhibited by as little as 1 microM 7-BH4 when assayed in the presence of
physiological concentrations of BH4. This inhibition can be overcome
either by an increase in the concentration of BH4 or a decrease in the
concentration of phenylalanine. With both rat brain tryptophan hydroxylase
and rat pheochromocytoma tyrosine hydroxylase, the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value for 7-BH4 is
about one order of magnitude greater than the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for BH4. Accordingly,
7-BH4 is a poor competitive inhibitor of both tryptophan and tyrosine
hydroxylase. Thus, our results suggest that the observed
hyperphenylalaninemia in patients who excrete 7-BH4 in their urine may
arise directly from the inhibition of phenylalanine hydroxylase by low
levels of this pterin. On the other hand, it is less likely that low
levels of 7-BH4 would affect the activity of tyrosine or tryptophan
hydroxylase in vivo.

Retinoic acid induces cholinergic differentiation of
cultured newborn rat sympathetic neurons
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Many studies provide evidence
that retinoic acid (RA), an endogenous derivative of vitamin A, plays a
role in the development of the nervous system. We now report that RA
controls the neurotransmitter phenotype of post-mitotic rat sympathetic
neurons in cell culture. RA added to the culture medium increased the
specific activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the level of
acetylcholine (ACh). Concomitantly, RA reduced the specific activities of
two catecholamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and
dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and the level of norepinephrine (NE).
After a 2 week treatment with 5 microM RA, ChAT was increased by 5-10
fold, whereas TH and DBH were decreased by 10-15 fold and 2-3 fold,
respectively, as compared to sympathetic neurons grown in the absence of
RA. The modulation of the activity of the three enzymes was dose-dependent
and followed a similar time course. The decrease of TH expression was
demonstrated to be due to a decreased number of TH molecules.

Influence of thyrotropin-releasing hormone and catecholaminergic
interactions on CNS ethanol sensitivity
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The role of catecholamine
neuronal systems in mediating the analeptic and thermogenic effects of
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was examined in long-sleep (LS) and
short-sleep (SS) mice. TRH [0.1 to 40 micrograms,
intracerebroventricularly (icv)] was associated with a reduction in the
sleep times of LS mice, but no dose of TRH had any effect on sleep times
of SS mice. However, TRH (20 micrograms, icv) produced a 1.0 degree to 1.5
degrees C attenuation of the ethanol-induced hypothermia in both LS and SS
mice. TRH did not change the rate of ethanol elimination in either line of
mice, suggesting that the reduction in LS sleep times and attenuation of
LS and SS hypothermia were due to decreased CNS ethanol sensitivity rather
than an increase in the rate of ethanol metabolism. TRH (20 micrograms,
icv) given alone produced an activation of central and peripheral
catecholamine systems in LS, but not SS mice, as reflected by an increase
in the in vivo tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity in the brain and adrenal
gland. TRH, given with ethanol, prevented or attenuated ethanol-induced
decreases in the brain and adrenal gland in vivo TH activity in LS mice
but not SS mice. Thus, there was an association between the ability of TRH
to produce an activation of catecholamine neuronal systems (increased rate
of catecholamine biosynthesis) and the analeptic action of TRH to reduce
the CNS depressant effects of ethanol (decreased sleep times).(ABSTRACT

Regulation of the quail tyrosine hydroxylase gene in
neural crest cells by cAMP and beta-adrenergic ligands
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the
rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine (CA)
synthesis, was studied in quail neural crest (NC) cultures to investigate
the role of environmental factors in the development of the adrenergic
phenotype. First, the activity of the quail TH gene promoter was analyzed
in immortalized quail NC cells by transient transfection assay. We found
that chick embryo extract (CEE), which is known to trigger adrenergic
differentiation of NC cells in vitro, strongly enhanced reporter gene
transcription. A sequence of only 77 nucleotides, including a
cAMP-responsive element, was sufficient to elicit this response.
Implication of cAMP in the CEE effect was further supported by the fact
that CEE produced a stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity that was
sensitive to beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists. Moreover, stimulation of TH
gene expression by CEE could be reduced by beta-adrenergic antagonists or
CA-depleted extract. We have subsequently investigated the possibility
that TH expression during differentiation of nontransformed NC cells could
also be influenced by CA via the cAMP pathway. In dissociated cultures of
3-day-old quail sclerotomes and of 2-day-old quail trunk NC,
differentiation of TH+ cells was induced in the presence of forskolin, an
activator of adenylate cyclase, and modulated by beta-adrenoreceptor
ligands. In particular, the adrenergic-promoting effect of 10% CEE on
trunk NC cultures was inhibited by beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists or by
eliminating CA from the extract. In conclusion, these data suggest that CA
(through activation of beta-adrenergic receptors and cAMP production) can
stimulate the initial expression of TH in cultured NC cells and enhance TH
transcription in immortalized NC cells. This supports the notion that
exogenous CA, which is present in the early embryo, may promote the
differentiation of sympathoadrenal precursors in vivo by stimulating TH
gene activity.

Electroconvulsive shock increases tyrosine hydroxylase
and neuropeptide Y gene expression in the locus coeruleus
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Electroconvulsive seizures
(ECS) increase tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity in the locus coeruleus
(LC) but not in the substantia nigra (SN). To determine whether new enzyme
synthesis contributes to the increase in TH activity, we carried out in
situ hybridization histochemistry to determine the effect of ECS on TH
mRNA levels in the LC and SN. The effect of ECS on neuropeptide Y (NPY)
mRNA levels in the LC was also studied because NPY coexists with
norepinephrine in the LC neurons and has been implicated in depressive
disorders. A significant increase was observed in TH mRNA and NPY mRNA
levels in LC neurons in the ECS group. There was no difference between TH
or NPY mRNA levels in the left and right LC. No change was observed in TH
mRNA expression in the SN compacta or SN reticulata. We conclude that the
regionally selective increase in TH activity after ECS is at least partly
due to increased gene expression and that NPY gene expression is regulated
in a similar fashion following ECS.

A dual role for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in tyrosine
hydroxylase gene expression
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine,
the first and rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis. The
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates and activates the TH
enzyme and is thought to mediate transcriptional induction of the TH gene.
To better understand the functional role of PKA in TH gene regulation, we
studied TH gene expression at the transcriptional, translational, and
post-translational levels in several PKA-deficient cell lines derived from
rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Strikingly, all PKA-deficient cell lines
analyzed in this study showed substantial deficits in basal TH expression
as measured by TH enzymatic activity, level of TH immunoreactivity, TH
protein level, and steady-state mRNA level. Interestingly, the
steady-state level of mRNA correlated well with levels of TH activity,
immunoreactivity, and protein. In addition, PKA-deficient cell lines
lacked transcriptional induction of the TH gene following treatment with
dibutyryl cAMP. Cotransfection of PKA-deficient cells with an expression
plasmid for the catalytic subunit of PKA fully reversed transcriptional
defect, as indicated by robust transcriptional induction of a reporter
construct containing 2400 bp of TH upstream sequence in all PC12 cells
tested. These data indicate that the PKA system regulates both the basal
and the cAMP-inducible expression of the TH gene primarily at the
transcriptional level in PC12 cells.

Conformation and interaction of phenylalanine with the
divalent cation at the active site of human recombinant tyrosine
hydroxylase as determined by proton NMR
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Recombinant human tyrosine
hydroxylase has been purified as a metal-free apoenzyme (apo-hTH1) which
tightly binds one Fe2+, Co2+, or Zn2+ per subunit with activation only by
Fe2+ and competitive inhibition by the other cations. L-tyrosine and
L-phenylalanine are alternative substrates for this enzyme, giving similar
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values, although the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value for phenylalanine is about 8-fold
greater than for tyrosine. Apo-hTH1 enhances the paramagnetic effects of
Co2+ on 1/T1 and 1/T2 values of the protons of enzyme-bound phenylalanine
both in the presence and in the absence of the oxidized form of the
cofactor L-erythro-7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), which was used as an
inactive analog of the natural cofactor (6R)-1-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH4). No effects of hTH1-Zn2+ on 1/T1 or 1/T2 are found. From
paramagnetic effects of hTH1-Co2+ on 1/T1 of phenylalanine protons at 250
and 600 MHz, in the presence of BH2, a correlation time (tau c) of 1.8 +/-
0.1 ps was found. Using this tau c value, and assuming that only one
proton of the pairs H3,H5, and H2,H6 is experiencing the total
paramagnetic effect (asymmetric limiting case), distances from
enzyme-bound Co2+ to phenylalanine (+/- 1.2 A) of 6.1 A (H3 or H5), 6.3 A
(H2 or H6), 7.0 A (H4), 7.3 A (H alpha), &gt; or = 7.4 A (H beta-pro-S),
and &gt; or = 7.6 A (H beta-pro-R) were calculated. The distances to H3 or
H5 and to H2 or H6 are slightly increased to 6.8 and 7.0 A, respectively,
if each proton of both degenerate pairs equally experiences the
paramagnetic effect of Co2+ (symmetric limiting case). These distances
place the aromatic ring of phenylalanine in the second coordination sphere
of the metal, which would permit an Fe-bound oxy or peroxy species to
approach molecular contact with C3/C4, suggesting a direct role of Fe2+ in
the hydroxylation reaction. The same correlation time and similar
distances were found in the absence of BH2 with H4 of phenylalanine
slightly closer to the metal. In the ternary hTH1-Zn(2+).BH2.phenylalanine
complex, eight interproton distances in the enzyme-bound phenylalanine
were determined by NOESY spectra at 600 MHz at 35-, 50-, and 75-ms mixing
times. The conformation of enzyme-bound phenylalanine, consistent with the
six Co(2+)-proton distances and the eight interproton distances, is
partially extended with torsional angles chi 1 = 97 degrees +/- 3 degrees
and chi 2 = -78 degrees +/- 2 degrees.

The quail tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter contains an active

<p class="Para1">
TH cDNA from quail has been reported and was used to screen quail
genomic libraries in &lambda; phage. From 10<sup>6</sup>
plaques, seven clones were positive.   Restriction mapping
employing Southern analysis and using either
full-length cDNA, the 235-bp of the 5'-end of cDNA, or a synthetic oligo
around the site of translation initiation was done.
One of the genomic clones has a 2 kb PstI fragment
which hybridizes with the oligo.  This
fragment was subcloned and sequenced;  a
restriction map is deduced from the sequence data as well.
<p>
Transcriptional start was found by RNase mapping
analysis.  The <i>Hae</i>III fragment encompasses the -76 to +195 region and was
used to prepare a single stranded RNA probe.
This 270 base probe is hybridized to quail adrenal
medulla RNA, then digested by RNase.  The
protected band corresponded to a series of 8 bands which were 103 to 111
bases long, the most abundant being 105-base long fragment.
There was no higher MW band even after longer
exposure.  Comparing these results with cDNA
shows transcription start is at a C base 15 bp upstream of the translation
initiation codon.
<p>
Two canonical TATA boxes are present between -42 and -37 and
between -302 and -297.  No AP-1 (Lee et al, <i>Cell</i> <b>51</b>:
251, 1987) are detected.  No CCAAT or GC boxes are found in the
5' end (Benoist et al, <i>NAR</i> <b>8</b>: 127, 1980; Gidoni et al
<i>Nature</i> <b>312</b>: 409, 1984).  A partly conserved
POU-Oct sequence (5'-TGGCGATT-3') is found at -192 (Parslow et al,
<i>Cell</i> <b>56</b>: 335, 1989) at positions -1487, -1329, and -1268.
A CRE site (5'-TGACGTCA-3') was found at -53 (Montminy et al,
PNAS 83: 6682, 1986), and a negative regulatory element
(NRE) (5'-TGAGCCCCACAGG-3') was found between -723 and -735 (Barrett et
al, PNAS 89: 885, 1992).
<p>
Comparison of the quail TH gene elements to rat,
bovine, and human show conservation of the length of exon 1 and of the 3'
position of the intron-exon junction.  The
proximal 5' flanking region between -320 and the TATA box is also quite
highly conserved between the quail and mammals.
More distal elements are less conserved.
Certain stretches show near 100% identity is specific
stretches of this region, the most highly conserved being a 10-base region
spanning the CRE.  An AT-rich region between
-190 and -177 is found on and downstream of the POU-Oct site.
<p>
To find the precise promoter elements, segments of
the 5'-flanker were inserted in front of a CAT reporter gene, and the
hybrid constructs transfected into mammalian (LTK<sup>-</sup>
fibroblasts or PC12) or avian (MQTNC) cell lines.  CAT activities
are assessed after 48 h.
<p>
No CAT activities are found in the LTK<sup>-</sup> cells.  CAT
activities were however shown in the two neural crest cell lines, PC12 and
MQTNC, which had been transfected with TH3-CAT, which spans the PstI-SstI
fragment (most of the 5' flanking region which includes the CRE box).
Transcriptional activity was particularly high
in PC12 cells.  Another construct, TH3&Delta;-<i>Sph</i>, which
is a SphI-SstI construct removing most of the upstream 5' flanking
region, had even greater transcriptional activity.
<p>
The MQTNC transfected neural crest cell line was
tested then for responses to forskolin (10 &mu;M) and 8-Br-cAMP (1 &mu;M).
In addition to the TH3-CAT and TH3 &Delta;-<i>Hind</i>,
which virtually has only the CRE site spanning a very tiny
sequence making up the HindIII-SstI fragment, was also transfected
into these cells.  Results show that both agents enhance transcription
in all cells with the three constructs.  In every case, 8-Br-cAMP
was a better activator than forskolin.  In every case transcription
was greater in constructs having the longer sequences:  TH3-CAT &gt; TH3
&Delta;-<i>Hind</i>.  In the case of TH3 CAT, forskolin and
8-Br-cAMP enhanced transcription 6.2- and 15-fold, resp.
<p>
To see if binding proteins were adhering to the CRE
site, a gel mobility shift assay was done in which MQTNC nuclear extracts
were incubated with wild-type putative quail TH CRE
(5'-AATCTT<u>TGACGTCA</u>GCCT-3').  Two
bands were detected on the 6% polyacrylamide gels (in half TBE buffer),
and a third appeared as a result of forskolin treatment.
In a competition test, when an excess of unlabeled
wild-type CRE was added, the bands disappeared.
When mutated quail TH CRE
(5'-AATCTT<u>TGATATCA</u>GCCT-3') or the serum-responsive element were
used, none of the bands disappeared.
<p>
DISCUSSION.  GRE not tested.  Was tested in rat, but found not to
be responsive.  Bovine has no GRE by comparison.  Greater
transcription of the more deleted 5'-flanking region, which
eliminates the NRE found, could signal the importance of NRE
in these activities; a similar NRE consensus is located in
the rat gene as well.  The fact that increases in cAMP
up-regulate TH expression, combined with the finding in rat gene as well
and that transcription is retained when all but the CRE is deleted shows
the importance of this physiological mechanism.
However, the attenuation of the response with the
greater deletions show other elements upstream of CRE are necessary for
activity.  That a protein is involved in
these activities is shown in the gel retardation systems.

Regulatory mechanism of dopamine biosynthesis in the

<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: We investigated the regulatory mechanism of
dopamine biosynthesis in the striatum of transgenic mice carrying
multiple copies of human tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The in vitro
TH activity of transgenic striatum at pH 7.0 was
approximately 2.8-fold higher than that of non-transgenic striatum. This
augmentation is similar to that of the in vitro TH activity at pH 6.0,
indicating that the expression of human TH in transgenic striatum induced
little change in the phosphorylation level of TH.
L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) formation in striatal slices of
transgenic mice was approximately 2.7-fold higher than that of
non-transgenic mice. The addition of 0.5 mM
(6R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4) to the incubation
medium brought a negligible increase in DOPA formation in both cases.
These results suggest that 6R-BH4 is not the limiting factor of TH in situ
both in the transgenic and non-transgenic mice.

abundant dopamine and norepinephrine and express the appropriate
catecholaminergic biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and
dopamine beta-hydroxylase. The lines were derived from TH-positive tumors
in transgenic mice carrying the SV40 T antigen oncogene under the
transcriptional control of 773 base pairs of 5' flanking sequences from
the rat TH gene. Although the lines continue to express T antigen, they
exhibit neuronal properties such as neurofilaments and synaptophysin and
lack glial intermediate filaments. Although in vivo TH is only expressed
in postmitotic neurons in the CNS, the CATH.a line demonstrates that TH
expression and continued cell division are not incompatible after
oncogenic transformation.

Increased heterogeneity of tyrosine hydroxylase in humans
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Humans produce four different
forms of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA via alternative splicing of the
gene. Here we demonstrate that New- and Old-World monkeys and the gorilla
produce only two of the TH isoforms. Comparison among the genomic DNA
sequences of various primates revealed that mutations that had accumulated
in the genomic DNA created a new exon, resulting in the appearance of two
new TH isoforms in man. These findings offer new insight into the sequence
of events leading to the evolution of the higher primates into separate
species. They also represent what may be the first evidence of a genetic
difference between man and primates with respect to a specific brain
function.

Expression and characterization of catalytic and regulatory domains
of rat tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Phenylalanine hydroxylase,
tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylase constitute a family of
tetrahydropterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Comparison of
the amino acid sequences of these three proteins shows that the C-terminal
two-thirds are homologous, while the N-terminal thirds are not. This is
consistent with a model in which the C-terminal two-thirds constitute a
conserved catalytic domain to which has been appended discrete regulatory
domains. To test such a model, two mutant proteins have been constructed,
expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. One protein
contains the first 158 amino acids of rat tyrosine hydroxylase. The second
lacks the first 155 amino acid residues of this enzyme. The spectral
properties of the two domains suggest that their three-dimensional
structures are changed only slightly from intact tyrosine hydroxylase. The
N-terminal domain mutant binds to heparin and is phosphorylated by
cAMP-dependent protein kinase at the same rate as the holoenzyme but lacks
any catalytic activity. The C-terminal domain mutant is fully active, with
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values identical to the holoenzyme; these results establish
that all of the catalytic residues of tyrosine hydroxylase are located in
the C-terminal 330 amino acids. The results with the two mutant proteins
are consistent with these two segments of tyrosine hydroxylase being two
separate domains, one regulatory and one catalytic.

Both the basal and inducible transcription of the
tyrosine hydroxylase gene are dependent upon a cAMP response element
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The cAMP response element
(CRE) mediates cAMP responsiveness in many eukaryotic genes (Roesler, W.
J., Vandenbark, G. R., and Hansen, R. W. (1988) J.&nbsp;Biol.&nbsp;Chem. 263,
9063-9066). The tyrosine hydroxylase gene (TH) contains a single copy of a
consensus CRE at -45 to -38 base pair (bp) upstream of the transcription
initiation site. Deletional and mutational analyses of the upstream
2400-base pair region of the rat TH gene using transient transfection
assay demonstrated that the CRE was essential for both cAMP-mediated
induction and basal transcription of the TH gene. Another domain between
-365 and -151 bp, containing the AP1 site, contributed to transcription to
a smaller degree. Thus, the CRE appears to play an important dual role as
a basal promoter element and an inducible enhancer for TH transcription.
Interactions between the DNA binding factors in nuclear extract and
CRE-containing oligonucleotides were investigated by gel retardation and
competition assays. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the CRE regions of
the TH or somatostatin gene gave rise to a pair of distinct protein-DNA
complexes with identical mobilities in the gel retardation assay,
suggesting that similar nuclear factor(s) might bind to the CREs of the TH
and somatostatin genes. This study emphasizes a fundamental role of the
CRE in transcriptional activation of the TH gene in catecholaminergic
cells.

Multiple forms of tyrosine hydroxylase in human
neuroblastoma cells:  quantitation with
isoform-specific antibodies
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Human tyrosine hydroxylase
(HTH) RNA undergoes alternative splicing, and four different forms of HTH
mRNA have been previously identified. Rabbit antibodies were raised
against octapeptides unique to each of the four isoforms of HTH predicted
from these mRNAs. Blot immunolabeling of human adrenal medulla,
pheochromocytoma, and several neuroblastoma cell lines with
affinity-purified anti-HTH peptide antibodies demonstrated the presence of
all four HTH isoforms in each of these tissues. Quantitative
immunolabeling assays for HTH-1, -2, and -4 were established, and HTH
isoform levels were determined in several human neuroblastoma cell lines.
Whereas total HTH levels differed up to fourfold among the HTH-positive
neuroblastoma cell lines studied [LA-N-1, LA-N-5, CHP-234, BE(2)-C, and
BE(2)-M17], the relative abundances of HTH isoforms in each of the cell
lines were similar. Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that HTH
immunoreactivity was distributed unequally among the cells in each of
these neuroblastoma lines, and morphological interconversion did not
account for this heterogeneity. A direct relationship between the
percentage of HTH-positive cells and overall HTH levels was also observed.
This relationship, in the absence of an apparent clonal basis for the
heterogeneity, suggests that HTH expression in neuroblastoma cells may be
controlled in a relatively "all-or-none" (bimodal) fashion.

Identification of the intersubunit binding region in rat tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
We previously expressed a recombinant of the catalytic
domain of the rat TH polypeptide subunit (the last 343 of its 498 amino
acids; MW 39,200) and found it to be fully active and to form a
tetramer.  If this holoprotein is now
treated with trypsin in a limited fashion, we find a species retaining
activity and slightly smaller subunit on SDS-PAGE.
Elastase and chymotrypsin were also tried but produced
no active species.
<p>
This smaller active TH species was purified over a
Q High Trap FPLC column (anion-exchange) and the active fragment on
SDS-PAGE was 34,000.  Gel filtration on
Superdex 75 HR under nondenaturing conditions showed an apparent MW of
37,500 and there was no evidence of a higher MW.
The non-denaturing purification indicates that a
single monomer with activity is present and that trypsinolysis removes the
domain needed for intersubunit binding.
<p>
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass
spectrometry was performed on the 37 kDa fragment.
[4-nitroaniline was the matrix; 2 &mu;l of 0.5 mg/ml TH
in 5 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, 2 &mu;l of 1 mg/ml lysozyme in water, and 1
&mu;l of 50 mg/ml 4-nitroaniline in methanol is dried and placed in mass
spec;  ionization is with pulsed laser (&lambda;=337 nm;
potential difference of 20 kV between sample plate and detector; the
M<sup>+</sup> and M<sup>2+</sup> peaks from several runs are averaged.)
The molecular mass determination 36,627 &plusmn; 87.
Amino terminal analysis shows EDKVPWFPR.
Comparison to the original catalytic domain
shows that cleavage at an Arg five residues from the N terminus accounts
for this.  This indicates cleavage must also
be occurring at the C terminus, and two possible sites are within 40
residues of the terminus.  Cleavage at an
Arg 323 residues in would produce a species of MW 36,850 while cleavage at
a Lys 304 residues down would produce a species of 34,396.
The former is in good agreement with the mass spectral
analysis and represents a 20 residue excision of the C-terminus.
<p>Kinetic analysis at pH 7 (used 50 mM HEPES) of the
tryptic 37 kDa active fragment compared with the catalytic domain shows a
sharply lowered <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>:
59 min<sup>-1</sup> for the fragment compared to 220 min<sup>-1</sup>
for the catalytic domain (specific activity of 0.9 &mu;mol
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>-DOPA/min/mg
protein for fragment;  2 &mu;mol DOPA/min/mg protein for catalytic domain).
The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values for both substrates were decreased:
K<sub>tyr</sub> 9.8 &mu;M for fragment and 25.2 &mu;M
for catalytic domain;  K<sub>cofactor</sub> 8.3 &mu;M for fragment
and 20.6 for catalytic domain (cofactor=6MPH<sub>4</sub>).
The decreases are small enough to show that catalytic
residues have not been removed.
<p>
DISCUSSION.  The mammalians TH have been shown to be tetramers whereas a bacterial
phenylalanine hydroxylase is a monomer.  Our
results are in contrast with Kiuchi <i>et&nbsp;al.</i> who indicated that the
intersubunit binding domain was in the N-terminus after analyzing
calpain-digested TH and our results showing catalytic domain forming a
tetramer.  The leucine zippers identified by
Liu and Vrana in the catalytic domain of all hydroxylases as potential
intersubunit binding sequences may be on the mark inasmuch as the
20-residue fragment removed corresponds to one of the zippers.
Comparison of the three mammalian subunits shows
conservation of 6 hydrophobic residues in the 20-residue fragment which
are properly located for a coiled coil.
This is not the case of the bacterial enzyme monomer, with 4 of the 6
replaced by aspartate (3 of them) and glycine (1 of them).
We suggest that a coiled coil forms at the C-terminus
to create the intersubunit binding.

Metrazole induces the sequential activation of <i>fos</i>, proenkephalin, and tyrosine
hydroxylase gene expression in the rat adrenal gland: modulation by
glucocorticoid and adrenocorticotropic hormone
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The immediate-early gene
c-fos (a nuclear transcription factor) has been viewed as a nuclear "third
messenger" or cellular "master switch." Both in vitro and in vivo studies
have suggested that the proenkephalin (Penk) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
genes are potential targets of this immediate-early gene. We investigated
the relationships between the activation of the c-fos gene and the
activation of the Penk and TH genes in both rat hippocampus and adrenal
using a commonly used model, metrazole (MTZ)-induced convulsions. The
administration of MTZ produced a sequential elevation in c-fos,
preproenkephalin (PPenk), and TH mRNAs. One hour after MTZ administration,
c-fos mRNA was increased about 10-fold in rat hippocampus and about 5-fold
in rat adrenal, without a significant change in spinal cord levels.
Immunocytochemistry revealed that Fos-like immunoreactivity was greatly
increased in both hippocampus and adrenal medulla at 3 hr after MTZ
administration. The levels of PPenk and TH mRNAs were significantly
increased (5-fold and 3-fold, respectively) in the adrenal 6 hr after MTZ
treatment. The effects of MTZ on c-fos, PPenk, and TH mRNAs were dose
dependent in both adrenal and hippocampus. In the adrenal, both the basal
levels and the MTZ induction of PPenk mRNA were significantly attenuated
by hypophysectomy (hypox) and were partially reinstated by
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) replacement. In contrast, the basal
levels of c-fos and TH mRNAs were not altered in hypox rat adrenal. ACTH
treatment completely blocked the MTZ induction of adrenal c-fos mRNA and
the subsequent induction of Fos-like immunoreactivity, whereas MTZ
increased PPenk and TH mRNAs nearly 3-fold. Thus, in hypox rats MTZ can
increase adrenal c-fos and TH mRNA levels without a corresponding increase
in PPenk mRNA, whereas in ACTH-treated rats PPenk and TH mRNA levels in
adrenal can be increased by MTZ without a preceding increase in c-fos
mRNA. The MTZ induction of c-fos appears neither sufficient nor always
necessary for the subsequent MTZ induction of Penk and TH gene expression.
We conclude that c-fos, Penk, and TH genes can be differentially regulated
in the adrenal of hypox rats or animals treated with ACTH, although they
are co-localized in the same medullary cells.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide and secretin produce long-term increases
in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the rat superior cervical ganglion
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Electrical stimulation of the
preganglionic fibers innervating the rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG)
produces both short-term and long-term increases in tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) activity that are not completely blocked by nicotinic antagonists.
Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and secretin, two neuropeptides known
to produce short-term increases in TH activity, were examined for their
ability to produce long-term increases in this enzyme activity. Culturing
the SCG in the presence of either peptide produced a 30-50% increase in TH
activity measured 2 days later. The results raise the possibility that one
of these peptides or a related molecule participates in the transsynaptic
induction of ganglionic TH.

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-related peptides
modulate tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in PC12 cells through
multiple adenylate cyclase-coupled receptors
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: We investigated the receptor
mechanisms by which vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and related
peptides exert their effects on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression.
VIP, secretin, and peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) each produced
increases in TH gene expression, as measured by increases in TH mRNA
levels and TH activity. The concentrations at which the effects of these
peptides were maximal differed for TH activity and TH mRNA. Moreover,
maximal increases in TH activity were 130-140% of control, whereas maximal
increases in TH mRNA were 250% of control. The concentration dependence of
the increases in TH mRNA in response to the three peptides was analyzed by
fitting the data to nonlinear regression models that assume either one or
two components to the response. The data for secretin fit best to a model
that assumes a single component to the increase in TH mRNA levels. The
data derived for PHI and VIP fit best to models that assumed two
components to the TH mRNA response. These data suggested that there may be
more than one receptor or signal transduction mechanism involved in the
response to the various peptides. We examined whether the peptides exerted
their effects through common or multiple second messenger systems. The
ability of maximally active concentrations of these peptides to stimulate
increases in TH mRNA was not additive, indicating that the peptides work
through a common receptor or signal transduction pathway. Each peptide
stimulated increases in protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Secretin and VIP
were ineffective in increasing TH mRNA levels in a PKA-deficient mutant
PC12 cell line (A126-1B2). Moreover, the adenylate cyclase antagonist
2',5'-dideoxyadenosine prevented the increase in TH mRNA produced by each
peptide. Thus, each peptide requires an intact cyclic AMP second messenger
pathway to produce changes in TH gene expression, suggesting that the
complex pattern of response to VIP and PHI revealed by
concentration-response analysis was due to the actions of these peptides
at multiple receptors. To evaluate this possibility, we examined the
effect of several peptide receptor antagonists on the increase in TH gene
expression elicited by VIP, PHI, and secretin. The secretin antagonist
secretin (5-27) (20 microM) had no significant effect on VIP or PHI
stimulation of TH gene expression, but reduced the effect of secretin. The
VIP antagonist VIP (10-28) (20 microM) reduced the effect of VIP on
increasing TH mRNA, but had no significant effect on the response of TH
mRNA to secretin or PHI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Inactivation of phosphorylated rat tyrosine hydroxylase by ascorbate in vitro
<p class="Para1">
Purified PC12 TH was treated with PK-A (1 &mu;M or 40 &mu;g/ml bovine
heart catalytic subunit) and produced a 32-fold activation using the
assay system of Reinhard et al. (15 min at 30&deg; in 25 &mu;M tyrosine,
125 &mu;M BH<sub>4</sub>, 1500 U/ml catalase, 5 mM DTT, 50 mM PIPES
pH 7.2).  When 40 &mu;M ascorbate was included in the phosphorylated
preparation and the pre-incubation timed and then assay begun, the activity
of TH declines rapidly to less than half of its original in only 15 min,
and to nearly 10% by 30 min.  Previous experiments using pH 6.0
found an optimal concentration of 5.9 &mu;M ascorbate
for the inhibition/inactivation of TH activity; this had been done
using impure rat brain enzyme.  These studies extend the results to include
pH 7.2 and use of a pure PC12 enzyme.  Because the inhibition is irreversible,
loss of TH activity is an inactivation.  Prolonged dialysis;
incubation with <i>E coli</i> alkaline phosphatase and potato acid
phosphatase; incubation with 1, 10, 100 &mu;M ferrous ammonium chloride,
ferric chloride, or oxidized glutathione; had no effect on reversing
the action.  TH was incubated with <sup>14</sup>C-ascorbate
and gel-filtered (Sephadex G-50), and the recovered enzyme was 95%
inactivated but had no radioactivity.
<p>
Ascorbate can react with dissolved oxygen to form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
and dehydroascorbate, a process catalyzed by transition metals like
the iron in TH.  In previous work, SOD, catalase, and peroxidase did
not guard against pH 6 ascorbate inactivation of TH.  Our results now
include failure to prevent inactivation at pH 7.2 as well.  It is possible
that free radicals can still be generated and immediately inactivate
the enzyme.  Use of free radical scavengers such as 250 mM mannitol,
1 mM butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 30 mM ethanol, and 1 &mu;M
&alpha;-tocopherol acetate (Vitamin E) were without effect.  30 mM DMSO,
32 mM <i>t</i>-butanol, 30 mM benzoate, and 10 mM <i>p</i>-aminobenzoate
are effective hydroxyl radical scavengers but had no effect in preventing
inactivation.
<p>
A near-oxygen free atmosphere (a residual 100 ppm oximetric reading was
found) was provided for the reaction in a nitrogen atmosphere.  The 100
ppm reading indicates a 0.107 &mu;M dissolved oxygen reading (according
to Dalton's law of partial pressures) with the known equilibrium value.
Since buffers and salts reduce dissolved oxygen even more, that represents
an upper limit.  Ascorbate inactivation of TH was the same under either
aerobic or anaerobic conditions.  The oxygen present could have inactivated
only 5-10% of the enzyme if the reaction was stoichiometric.
<p>
When tyrosine is included in the reaction, the ascorbate inactivation
is prevented. 3-iodotyrosine (10 &mu;M) provided excellent protection.
D-tyrosine had no effect in preventing inactivation, and is neither a
substrate or inhibitor; the same was true for tyrosinol, tyramine,
tyrosinamide, and tyrosine hydrazide.  This suggests that the carboxyl
group of tyrosine may be necessary.  Ortho- and meta-tyrosines had
no effect in preventing inactivation, indicating that a para-position
is important for the action of tyrosine; however it does not seem to be
required, since phenyalanine also prevented inactivation.  Other
compounds understood to prevent ascorbate-induced inactivation in other
enzymes (histidine) were ineffective in preventing inactivation.
<p>
While the product DOPA itself did <em>not</em> prevent inactivation,
all catecholamines downstream (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine)
did prevent inactivation.  Catechol derivatives (<i>N</i>-methyldopamine,
3,4-dihydroxynorepinephrine) reduced the effect of inactivation.
Isoproterenol (with ortho-hydroxy group) prevented inactivation, but
metaproterenol (with a meta-hydroxy group) did not.  If the catecholamine
was missing an amino group or contained a modified aromatic hydroxyl
group (homovanillic acid, vanillylmandelic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate,
3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenylethylamine), then there was no protection.
<p>
1,8-ANS is 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid and binds noncovalently
to hydrophobic areas of proteins, with characteristic changes in its
fluorescence.  At pH 6, the emission maximum decreased from 495 to 455 nm
when it bound TH.  Additionally there was an enhancement in fluorescence.
Both the change in intensity and the blue shift indicates the movement
from a polar to apolar environment.  The extrinsic fluorescence of the
native and phosphorylated enzyme showed that modification produces a 10%
decrease in fluorescence.  When the phosphoenzyme is treated with ascorbate,
there is an additional 10% decrease.  All these data suggest that
a change in conformatin occurs with phosphorylation (that results in
activation), and that ascorbate action causes an additional change in
conformation (resulting in inactivation).
<p>
Because conformational changes occur, a CD spectrum should be informative.
Native enzyme at 25&deg; in 20 mM phosphate, pH 7.2 was analyzed.
The spectrum was read between 185 and 250 nm (note that dilute phosphate
was necessary since buffer salts interfere in the far UV).  The spectrum
suggested 55% &alpha; helix, 20% &beta; sheet, 2% &beta; turn, and
23% random coil (known for TH).  Grima et al. (1985) had used Chou &amp; Fasman
indicated 18% &alpha; helix and 3% &beta; sheet.  When phosphorylation
by PK-A followed by ascorbate inactivation were done, CD spectra were
unchanged.  TH was then denatured with 10 mM HCl and its spectrum
re-evaluated:  there was significant loss of &alpha;-helix but increases
in &beta; sheet and random coil (9% &alpha; helix, 49% &beta; sheet, 1%
&beta; turn, and 41% random coil).  Hence, CD spectra cannot be relied
upon entirely to provide information regarding secondary structure changes,
especially when alpha helical content dominates the signal, and slight
changes in it cannot be discriminated using this analytical method.

Tyrosine hydroxylase activity and extrinsic fluorescence changes
produced by polyaninons
<p class="Para1">
Purified PC12 TH was treated with bovine liver RNA or salmon sperm DNA,
resulting in an increase in activity at pH 6.0 (BH<sub>4</sub> =
125 &mu;M).  The minimum level required to activate TH was 1 &mu;g/ml
bovine liver mRNA (EC<sub>50</sub> = 3 &mu;g/ml) and 0.1 &mu;g/ml
salmon sperm DNA (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1 &mu;g/ml).  EC<sub>50</sub>
of heparin is 0.3 &mu;g/ml, and 1 mg/ml heparin produces 8-fold
activation, while RNA and DNA produce 6- and 7-fold activation, resp.
Both rRNA and tRNA are also activating.  TH was mixed with ribosomes
with an RNA = 20 &mu;g/ml and increased TH activity by 3-fold;  much
of the RNA is found on the surface of the ribosomes.
<p>
The kinetic parameters of TH on the effects of liver RNA and sperm DNA
show changes in both the apparent Vmax and the Km with respect to the two
substrates.  Km for BH4 was decreased 10- and 18-fold for RNA and DNA,
resp. (from 3100 &mu;M to 300 &mu;M for RNA and 170 &mu;M for DNA).
Vmax fell 50% and 60%, resp.  The Km for tyrosine was unchanged
(at 125 &mu;M BH4), but the increase in Vmax would be expected
if the Km for BH4 was changed by polyanion treatment.  All data
indicate that the principal effect of the polyanion interaction is
to alter the binding (Km) of the pterin cofactor.
<p>
It was shown earlier (Kuczenski and Mandell) that TH activity can
be affected by salts (ionic strength?).  Liver RNA in the presence
of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> resulted in less activation, an effect also
seen with CaCl<sub>2</sub> and ferrous ammonium sulfate
[Fe(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>].
In 10 mM CoCl<sub>2</sub>, NiCl<sub>2</sub>, CuCl<sub>2</sub>,
and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, TH was inactive.  10 mM KCl and other univalent
salts had little to no effect, but higher concentrations (100 mM) decreased
activity.
<p>
Because contaminating proteases in the RNA/DNA preparations
could have activated TH through limited proteolysis, ribonucleases
were used to see if activation could be inhibited.  60 &mu;g/ml
liver RNA was incubated with a mixture of <i>Aspergillus clavatus</i>
ribonuclease (30 &mu;g/ml), bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A
(25 &mu;g/ml), ribonuclease T1 of <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i> (14 &mu;g/ml),
and <i>Phaseolus aureus</i> mung bean nuclease (5 &mu;g/ml) in
5 mM MOPS, pH 7.2 overnight at room temp (controls are buffer alone,
RNA in buffer, and enzymes in buffer).  Preps that involved preincubation
of RNA with enzymes did not activate TH.  Ribosomes incubated with enzymes
had a significantly reduced but measurable activation.  SDS-PAGE of TH
incubated with the liver RNA (1 mg/ml for 1 h) also did not show evidence
of proteolysis, indicating that TH might be activated by this mechanism.
<p>
TH was incubated with ATP and PK-A to phosphorylate it, then treated
with liver RNA.  Results show that there was no additional activation
caused by the RNA, so phosphorylation and polyanions activate in the same
way.
<p>
Polyanion activation was clearly pH-dependent.   Maximal activation
of 100 &mu;g/ml RNA is seen at pH 6.0-6.4 (4-fold), while this activation
decreases at pH 6.8.  At pH 7.2, there is only a 20% increase in activity.
These same finding are seen with heparin.
<p>
8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (1,8-ANS) can be used to assess
changes in protein conformation by its altered fluorescence spectrum
in or out of the hydrophobic core of the protein.  The intensity of
fluorescence of 1,8-ANS was almost double at pH 6 than at pH 7.2
and the &lambda;<sub>max</sub> shifts from 495 nm in buffer alone to 455 nm
when TH is added, indicating that 1,8-ANS goes from a polar to apolar
environment.
<p>
Binding stoichiometry was determined (according to Horowitz and Criscimagna,
1985) by measuring fluorescence at different concentrations of TH
and 1,8-ANS, using &lambda;<sub>exc</sub>=380 nm and
&lambda;<sub>em</sub>=470 nm.  30, 80, and 200 &mu;g/ml TH was incubated
with 20-100 &mu;M 1,8-ANS, and 15, 40, 80, and 150 &mu;M 1,8-ANS
were incubated with 10-50 &mu;g/ml TH.  Mean value of maximum binding
was 212 molecules 1,8-ANS per tetrameric enzyme at pH 6.0 and
116 molecules at pH 7.2.  This accounts for the major changes in
fluorescence intensity.  There are no differences in the Kd for 1,8-ANS
however (60 &mu;M); because these experiments used 40 &mu;M (close to
the Kd), that means that the enzyme was half-saturated.
<p>
1.0 MAT buffer, pH 8.0, was added to 0.25 mg/ml TH in 0.1 M MAT buffer
to make a pH 7.2 solution.  1.0 M MAT, pH 5.0, was then added to bring
the solution to pH 6.0.  Final concentration was 0.38 M MAT after
manipulations.  Increasing to pH 7.2 decreased fluorescence while
restoring it to pH 6.0 returned the fluorescence to within 10% of the
value of enzyme kept at pH 6.0.  This indicates that change in conformation
was reversible, as was the changes in activity.  This transition was
also true for enzyme at pH 7.2 changed to pH 6.0 then back to pH 7.2.
<p>
At pH 7.2 DNA and heparin are less effective activators than at pH 6.0.
DNA decreases extrinsic fluorescence by 30% at pH 6.0 without a shift
in the emission maximum.  Fluorescence was decreased less at pH 7.2.
The results with heparin or other polyanion were similar to those
of the DNA treatment.

Chicken tyrosine hydroxylase gene: isolation and functional
characterization of the 5' flanking region
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is
the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines. We
describe here the isolation of the chicken TH gene and the analysis of 3
kb of its 5' flanking region. The chicken TH transcription unit spans 19
kb. The 60-bp proximal promoter contains a TATA box and a cyclic AMP
response element (CRE) sequence. The 5' flanking region contains several
AP1-, AP2-, and octamer-like sequences as well as a glucocorticoid
response element at position -1.4 kb. A construct containing the 3-kb 5'
flanking DNA fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was
transiently transfected into PC12 cells, and the effect of various
effectors was tested. Only forskolin increased the CAT activity, likely
owing to the presence of the CRE sequence. Constructs prepared by
progressively deleting the 5' flanking DNA were transfected into PC12 and
QT6 (quail transformed fibroblasts) cells. In both cell types, the
transcriptional activity increased with deletion of the 5' flanking
region. These results show that the 60-bp region containing the TATA box
and the CRE is sufficient to act as a constitutive promoter for the
chicken TH gene and that this region appears to be negatively controlled
by upstream sequences.

Lysine241 of tyrosine hydroxylase is not required for
binding of tetrahydrobiopterin substrate
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The lysine residues at
positions 194 and 198 in phenylalanine hydroxylase have been shown to
react with a photoaffinity label which is an analog of
phenyltetrahydropterin (Gibbs, B. S., and Benkovic, S. J. (1991)
Biochemistry 30, 6795-6802), in a manner suggesting that these lysine
residues are involved in tetrahydrobiopterin binding. The related enzyme
tyrosine hydroxylase has a lysine at position 241 which, given the 75%
identity between its C-terminal 330 amino acids and those of phenylalanine
hydroxylase, corresponds to lysine194 of phenylalanine hydroxylase.
Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter lysine241 of tyrosine
hydroxylase to alanine. Steady-state kinetic parameters were measured for
wild-type and K241A tyrosine hydroxylase. No kinetic parameter differed
between the wild-type and K241A enzymes, including <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values, Michaelis
constants for tetrahydrobiopterin, 6-methyl-tetrahydropterin, and
tyrosine, and the inhibition constants for norepinephrine. These results
show that lysine241 is not required for tetrahydrobiopterin binding to
tyrosine hydroxylase.

Mutation in the 4&alpha;-carbinolamine
dehydratase gene leads to mild hyperphenylalaninemia with defective
cofactor metabolism
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Hyperphenylalaninemias
represent a major class of inherited metabolic disorders. They are most
often caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and, less
frequently but with usually more serious consequences, in genes necessary
for the synthesis and regeneration of the cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin.
This cofactor is absolutely required for all aromatic amino acid
hydroxylations, and, recently, nitric oxide production from L-arginine has
also been found to be dependent on tetrahydrobiopterin. Phenylalanine
hydroxylase catalyzes a coupled reaction in which phenylalanine is
converted to tyrosine and in which tetrahydrobiopterin is converted to the
unstable carbinolamine, 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin. The enzyme,
carbinolamine dehydratase, catalyzes the dehydration of the carbinolamine
to quinonoid dihydropterin. A decreased rate of dehydration of this
compound has been hypothesized to be responsible for the production of
7-biopterin found in certain mildly hyperphenylalaninemic individuals. We
have now identified nonsense and missense mutations in the
4a-carbinolamine dehydratase gene in a hyperphenylalaninemic child who
excretes large amounts of 7-biopterin. This finding is consistent with the
role of the carbinolamine dehydratase in the phenylalanine hydroxylation
reaction. Together with previously identified inherited disorders in
phenylalanine hydroxylase and dihydropteridine reductase, there are now
identified mutations in the three enzymes involved in the phenylalanine
hydroxylation system. In addition, the genetics of this system may have
broader implications, since the product of the dehydratase gene has
previously been shown to play an additional role (as dimerization cofactor
for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha) in the regulation of transcription,
through interaction with hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha.

Phosphorylation and activation of human tyrosine

<b>Abstract</b>:
Mitogen-activated protein-kinase (MAP)
kinase-activated protein  kinases 1 and 2
(MAPKAP kinase-1, MAPKAP kinase-2), were found to phosphorylate
bacterially expressed human tyrosine hydroxylase in vitro at comparable
rates to other proteins thought to be physiological substrates of these

plateau values at 1 mol/mol subunit and 2 mol/mol subunit, respectively;
the sites of phosphorylation were identified as Ser40 (MAPKAP kinase-1)

protein kinase-II, which phosphorylates Ser19 faster than Ser40, MAPKAP
kinase-2 phosphorylated Ser40 about twice as fast as Ser19. The maximal
activation of tyrosine hydroxylase by MAPKAP kinase-1 or-2 was about
3-fold, and activation by MAPKAP kinases-1 and -2 or calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase-II correlated with the extent of phosphorylation of Ser40.
The four alternatively spliced forms of human tyrosine hydroxylase were
phosphorylated at Ser31 by MAP kinase, but at markedly different rates (3
= 4 &gt; 1 &gt;&gt; 2). Forms 3 and 4 were phosphorylated rapidly and
stoichiometrically by MAP kinase doubling the activity, while
phosphorylation of form 1 by MAP kinase to 0.4 mol/mol subunit increased
activity by 40%. The effect on activity of phosphorylating both Ser31 and
Ser40 was not additive. The possible roles of MAPKAP kinase-1, MAPKAP
kinase-2 and MAP kinase in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase in vivo
are discussed.

Four isoforms of tyrosine hydroxylase are expressed in human brain
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: In contrast to nonprimate
species, the RNA for human tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme
in catecholamine biosynthesis, can undergo alternative splicing to produce
four different types of mRNA. Although types 1 and 2 of these human
tyrosine hydroxylase mRNAs have been identified in human brain, whether
types 3 and 4 human tyrosine hydroxylase mRNAs are present in the central
nervous system remains controversial. Furthermore, little is known about
the expression of the protein products of these mRNAs in human brain. In
this study we used antibodies raised against different octapeptide
sequences from each of the predicted human tyrosine hydroxylase protein
forms to determine the presence and distribution of each human tyrosine
hydroxylase isoforms in several regions of human brain. Control
immunocytochemical and blot immunolabeling experiments demonstrated that
each antibody selectively recognized the human tyrosine hydroxylase
isoform against which it was directed. In immunocytochemical studies, all
four human tyrosine hydroxylase isoforms were clearly detectable in
neurons of both the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. The presence of
all four isoforms in these nuclei was confirmed with blot immunolabeling
studies. Single-label immunocytochemical studies of adjacent sections as
well as dual-label comparisons of immunoreactivity for human tyrosine
hydroxylase type 1 with type 2, type 3, or type 4 suggested that at least
some neurons in these brain regions contain all four human tyrosine
hydroxylase isoforms. In contrast, some neurons of the mesencephalon
appeared to be selectively immunoreactive with the antibodies against type
1. In the caudate nucleus and putamen, the terminal zones of the
dopaminergic projection from the substantia nigra, all four isoforms were
detected, although in immunocytochemical studies type 1 appeared to be the
predominant isoform present in axons and terminals. These findings
demonstrate that human brain contains four distinct isoforms of human
tyrosine hydroxylase and that the presence or relative amount of each
isoform may differ among catecholaminergic cell populations and between
catecholaminergic neurons and terminal fields. These patterns of
expression may have important implications for understanding the
regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis in human brain both in normal and
pathological states.

Deletion mutagenesis of rat PC12 tyrosine hydroxylase regulatory and
catalytic domains
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The functional organization
of rat tyrosine hydroxylase was investigated by deletion mutagenesis of
the regulatory and catalytic domains. A series of tyrosine hydroxylase
cDNA deletion mutants were amplified by PCR, cloned into the pET3C
prokaryotic expression vector, and the mutant proteins were partially
purified from E. coli. The results show that the deletion of up to 157
N-terminal amino acids activated the enzyme, but further deletion to
position 184 completely destroyed catalytic activity. On the carboxyl end,
the removal of 43 amino acids decreased but did not eliminate activity,
suggesting that this region may play a different role in the regulation of
the enzyme. These findings place the amino end of the catalytic domain
between residues 158 and 184 and the carboxyl end at or prior to position
455. Deletions within the first 157 amino acids in the N-terminus caused
an increase in hydroxylating activity, a decrease in the apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for
tyrosine and phenylalanine substrates, and a substantial increase in the
Ki for dopamine inhibition. The results define this region of the
N-terminus as the regulatory domain of tyrosine hydroxylase, whose primary
functions are to restrict the binding of amino acid substrates and to
facilitate catecholamine inhibition. The results also suggest that the
well-established role of the regulatory domain in restricting cofactor
binding may be secondary to an increase in catecholamine binding, which in
turn lowers the affinity for the cofactor. These findings provide new
insight into the functional organization and mechanisms of regulation of
tyrosine hydroxylase.

Tyrosine hydroxylase regulation in neurotransmission and neuroplasticity
<p class="Para1">
<b>Abstract</b>: The modulation of
neurotransmitter synthesis is a fundamental mechanism influencing
neurotransmission and neuronal plasticity during development. The
regulation of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) has been used to elucidate
specific adaptative responses in neurons. Trans-synaptic impulse activity
elicits sort- and long-term changes in the activity of TH. Acute
regulation involves the activation of preexisting TH molecules via
phosphorylation and possibly through alternative splicing events in
humans, whereas long-term regulation results from an increased synthesis
of the enzyme due in part to the transcriptional stimulation of the TH
gene. The long-term increase of TH activity was addressed using the drug
reserpine known to modify the secretion of neurotransmitters and the
tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA). Inductions of TH expression by
reserpine in vivo as well as by TPA in vitro seem to be mediated by an
AP-1 complex acting on a TPA responsive element (TRE) of the rat TH
promoter indicating that the TRE-TH site plays a critical role in
trans-synaptic induction. Our results also demonstrate a degree of
adaption by sympathetic neurons to their environment by conversion from
adrenergic to cholinergic phenotype.

Second Messenger and Protein Phosphorylation Mechanisms Underlying
Opiate Addiction:  Studies in the Rat Locus Coeruleus
<p class="Para1">
<b>Mini-Review</b>.  Greengard and coworkers have established over
25 years of research that receptors of neurotransmitters and of
neuromodulators, such as opiates, are produced by a complex cascade
of intracellular messengers.  These include G-proteins mediating
coupling of receptors to effector systems, and the effector systems
being second messengers, protein kinases, and phosphoproteins.
<p>
Studies on the locus coeruleus provide the best model of opiate
action.  This contains the largest noradrenergic nucleus in the brain,
a bilateral region on the floor of the fourth ventricle in the anterior
pons in the rat brain.
<p>
The model of acute action in the LC involves opiate binding to its
receptor to couple with pertussis toxin-sensitive G<sub>i</sub> and
or G<sub>o</sub> proteins.  There are two possible actions that occur
with the bound opiate receptor G-protein complex:
<ul>
<li>the receptor G-protein complex binds directly to
a K<sup>+</sup> channel protein, which it activates, serving to
hyperpolarize the LC neuron
<li>there is an inhibition of the action of a slowly depolarizing
non-specific cation channel, whose activity is dependent upon
uninhibited adenyl cyclase activity, increases in cAMP, and on PK-A
activity
</ul>
The activity of the depolaring channel may be related to direct PK-A
phosphorylation or association with a phosphoprotein which is a product
of PK-A action.
<p>
Morphine administered to rats results in a decrease in adenyl cyclase
activity in the LC in vivo, an effect persisting in vitro in the absence
of opiates.  The in vivo effect is not reversed by the opiate receptor
antagonist naloxone pre-incubation.  A desensitization to opiates
occurred with use of a &mu; opiate agonist in vitro short-term.
The decline in adenyl cyclase responsiveness has been attributed to
mechanisms explaining addiction.
<p>
The chronic model of action describes the development of tolerance in
that neurons recover in their ability to fire at a natural rate.
Neurons now become dependent upon the presence of opiates such that
abrupt cessation leads to manifold increases in LC neuron firing well
above natural/control levels.  Levels of G<sub>i&alpha;</sub>
and G<sub>o&alpha;</sub> are dramatically increased, as are adenylate
cyclase and PK-A and MARPPs (<i>M</i>orphine- and cyclic
<i>A</i>MP-<i>R</i>egulated <i>P</i>hospho<i>P</i>roteins).  One of the
MARPPs is TH.
<p>
This effect of opiate addiction shows that upregulation of the cyclic
AMP system increases LC neuronal excitability, and that withdrawal of
the drug leads to hyperexcitation causing withdrawal symptoms.
LC neurons normally spontaneously fire as part of the physiological
purpose of the nonspecific cation channel regulated by the cAMP system.
The time course of recovery from withdrawal is correlated to
a time course of quantitative changes in levels of enzymes
responsible for cAMP system activation, and also of the firing
rate of LC neurons followed electrophysiologically.

<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Nicotine, a major component
of tobacco smoke, stimulates catecholamine secretion and activates
catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and
dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) in adrenal medullary cells. We
investigated the effect of long term treatment with nicotine on TH and DBH
gene expression in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Nicotine treatment for
1-2 days increased both the TH and DBH mRNA levels. The effect of nicotine
on TH mRNA seems to be transcriptionally mediated. Deletion analysis of
the 5' promoter region of the TH gene showed that the region containing a
cyclic AMP/calcium regulatory element is sufficient for the nicotinic
induction of TH. Nicotine did not induce TH mRNA or chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase reporter activity in mutant PC12 cells deficient in
protein kinase A activity. However, the deficiency in protein kinase A
activity did not affect the elevation in intracellular calcium
concentration caused by nicotine, indicating normal receptor function.
These results suggest that a cAMP-mediated pathway plays a crucial role in
the long term nicotine-induced activation of the TH gene.

<i>Fos</i> family members successively occupy the tyrosinse hydroxylase
AP-1 site after nerve growth factor or epidermal growth factor
stimulation and can repress transcription
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Nerve growth factor induces
the neuronal-like differentiation of PC12 cells, and epidermal growth
factor promotes PC12 viability and is weakly mitogenic. Despite these
differences, both growth factors induce indistinguishable patterns of
transient delayed transcription of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene and
the expression of proteins encoded by Fos gene family members. Thus, TH
expression is sensitive to signaling pathways common to these two growth
factors. We show that c-fos and fosB successively occupy an AP-1 site-like
element of the TH promoter after nerve growth factor treatment.
Furthermore, under conditions of transient transfection, Fos family
proteins may synergize with c-jun to transrepress TH gene transcription
through the TH-fat-specific element. We show that the target of repression
is the AP-1 site-like element that lies within the TH-fat-specific
element. We demonstrate that this site is also a major positive acting
site for TH control. These results suggest a model in which the long term
effect of c-fos family protein expression is to limit the expression of
the TH gene. We consider the novel properties of this element in providing
temporal and cell type-specific regulation of TH transcription.

Long-term alteration in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels
in rat locus coeruleus after intraventricular injection of
5,6-dihydroxytryptamine
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The time course variations in
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and specific mRNA were measured in the
rat locus coeruleus (LC) and substantia nigra after an
intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine
(5,6-DHT), a neurotoxin known to selectively destroy serotoninergic
neurons. In this study, the TH activity and TH mRNA were both analyzed
from homogenates of single tissue samples (micropunches). TH mRNA was
extracted and quantified by densitometry using a northern blot method and
an artificial TH RNA as an external standard. 5,6-DHT injection led to a
long-lasting increase in TH activity and TH mRNA in LC but not in
substantia nigra. The elevation in LC was progressive and reached its
maximum value (+75%) at day 4 and day 8 after 5,6-DHT. This effect on TH
activity was accompanied by a parallel change in TH mRNA whose amplitude
was +57%, +81% and +45% at day 2, 4, and 8 respectively after the
neurotoxin injection. Return to normal values was observed at day 16.
Variations in TH activity and TH mRNA in LC were of similar amplitude.
These results suggest that serotonin could be a potent modulator of TH
gene expression within noradrenergic LC neurons.

Haloperidol activates tyrosine hydroxylase
gene-expression in the rat substantia nigra, pars reticulata
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The cellular distribution of
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and TH mRNA in the rat substantia nigra (SN) was
investigated using immunohistochemistry (IMHC) and non-radioactive in situ
hybridization histochemistry (ISH), respectively. Number and density of
both TH immunoreactive and TH cRNA labeled cells were increased in the
pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNr) 8 h after single
administration of a dopamine antagonist haloperidol. At the same time
number and density of TH positive cells remained unchanged in a
ventro-medial, dorso-medial or lateral part of the pars compacta (SNc) and
in the pars lateralis (SNl) of the substantia nigra. A D2
receptor-specific agonist, quinpirole, was without effect on either ISH or
IMHC in any of these areas, including the SNr. These results reveal the
existence of a population of TH-negative neurons in the SNr, in which TH
gene-expression can be activated through a dopamine receptor-mediated
mechanism, leading to detectable levels of both TH and TH mRNA.
Furthermore they suggest that TH gene-expression in these neurons normally
is inhibited by dopamine released from somata and dendrites in the SNr.

Electrostatic activation of rat phenylalanine hydroxylase
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The conversion of
phenylalanine to tyrosine is accelerated approximately five fold by
phosphorylation of the enzyme which catalyzes this step, phenylalanine
hydroxylase. To gain a clearer understanding of the mechanism of this
activation, we have applied site-directed mutagenesis to specifically
modify a clone of the hydroxylase at the phosphorylation site, the serine
at position 16. We converted this serine residue to alanine and to
glutamic acid. The wild-type and mutant proteins were purified and the
activation states of the enzymes were examined with respect to the single
phosphorylation site at position 16. Substitution of Ser16 with a
negatively charged Glu residue resulted in activation of the enzyme,
whereas substitution with an uncharged Ala residue did not. These results
indicate that activation of the native enzyme by phosphorylation is due to
the introduction of a negative charge, and suggest involvement of
electrostatic interactions.

Kinetic isotope effects on hydroxylation of ring-deuterated phenylalanines
by tyrosine hydroxylase provide evidence against partitioning of an arene
oxide intermediate
<p class="Para1">
Early studies with tyrosine or phenylalanine hydroxylase
using a [4-<sup>3</sup>H]phenylalanine substrate
showed a tyrosine product in which 84% and 70% of label is retained at the
3-position for TH and PAH, resp.  This
result and what is known about the Fe-containing cytochrome P450 system
suggested that an arene oxide is an intermediate in the reaction (as also
proposed years ago).  Miller and Benkovic
have shown that PAH produces an epoxide product using
2,5-dihydrophenylalanine, but as this is not the normal substrate for the
enzyme, this epoxide does not confirm beyond doubt the formation of an
intermediate.
<p>
TH used to oxidize Phe will produce both Tyr and 3-hydroxyPhe.
An arene oxide proposed intermediate is consistent with this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./TH_Lit_Drawings/TyrHydroxylationMech.gif"
  alt="Mechanism of tyrosine hydroxylation">

<p>
If this scheme is accurate, then proof of it should be direct in
isotopic substitution tests.  Opening of the arene epoxide (arene oxide)
must involve a 1,2-hydrogen shift, subject to isotope effects.
If both hydroxylated products form from the intermediate,
we expect that 4-[<sup>2</sup>H]Phe would cause a decrease in Tyr
formation and an increase in 3-hydroxyPhe formation.
[4-<sup>2</sup>H]-, [3,5-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]-, and
[2,3,4,5,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]Phe were tested as substrates
for recombinant rat TH using 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>.  Isotope effects
are evident by determination of <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> for Tyr and 3-hydroxyPhe
formation and were determined noncompetitively.
<p>
Results show that where the deuterated label is,
hydroxylation occurs in the greater ratio at that position.
No significant &beta;-secondary isotope effects are observed in the
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values for tyrosine formed from
[3,5-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]Phe or from formation of
3-hydroxyPhe from [4-<sup>2</sup>H]Phe.  For the fully
deuterated substrate, the isotope effects were equal to effects seen for
the individually deuterated positions, both consistent with the lack of
&beta;-secondary isotope effects and the independence
of effect at the individual positions on the ring.
<p>
With nondeuterated Phe, tyrosine formation is favored over
3-hydroxyPhe formation by 25.5 to 1 at 30&deg;, a value which is
temperature-dependent and decreases with increasing temperature.
Plots of this ratio vs. temperature reveal a difference in the
<i>E</i><sub>act</sub> for the two products of 2.2 kcal/mole.
<p>
It is known that cofactor (6-MPH<sub>4</sub>) oxidation and
formation of hydroxylated Phe compounds is not stoichiometric,
with cofactor oxidation occurring at a greater rate and resulting
in a waste of the cofactor.  With normal nondeuterated Phe substrate,
only 21% of 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> used by rat TH results in
hydroxylated products.  Isotopic substitution effects on this
value are identical with rates of Tyr formation and on the ratio
of the two products.  Deuteration at the 4-position results in
a decrease in Tyr formation but is not observed as an increase
in the 3-hydroxyPhe product.
<p>
Although the results show no partititoning of an
arene oxide intermediate, the data do show that whatever intermediate is
formed, there are isotopic effects affecting the formation of the
intermediate or a partitioning involving the initial attack by an
activated oxygen species.  Although
formation of an arene oxide may be evident in some cases of cytochrome
P-450 action, there is evidence as well that hydroxylation of substituted
benzenes can similarly proceed without an arene oxide intermediate.
<p>
The qualitative interpretation appears clear but
not consistent with quantitative expectations.
Initial attack of an oxygenated species on the ring
would be expected to produce inverse secondary isotope effects with a
value as low as 0.8.  Normal primary
isotope effects would be expected to result in a 1,2-hydride shift and
rearomatization.  These effects would be
reflected in the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values since
that kinetic parameter has the rates of all first-order steps.
The ratio of hydroxylation at the two positions would
depend on the relative rates of oxygen addition (the state of the enzyme
is not a factor, ie, the enzyme is not in a state to prefer hydroxylation
of the 3- or 4-position, nor does expression in baculovirus or bacteria
affect this, nor if the enzyme is phosphorylated).
If oxygen attack depends on a C-H bond cleavage,
isotope effects should be observed and would occur whenever transfer of
hydrogen is necessary or if the attack of activated oxygen is reversible
(note that reactions conducted in [<sup>3</sup>H]H<sub>2</sub>O
showed no exchange of label with unreacted substrate at the end of the
reaction).  In either case a small inverse
secondary effect would be masked by a larger primary effect.
Formation of a metalloxetane intermediate would
account for the results, even though formation of these intermediates in
hydroxylation reactions remains controversial.

Expression of tyrosine hydroxylase gene in cultured hypothalamic cells.
Role of protein kinases A and C
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: In hypothalamic cells
cultured in serum-free medium, the quantity of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA
increases after treatment with an activator of the protein kinase A
pathway (8-bromoadenosine cyclic AMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, or
forskolin) or an activator of protein kinase C (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol
13-acetate or sn-1,2-diacylglycerol). The tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA level
decreases in the cells after inhibition of protein kinase C with
calphostin C or after depletion of protein kinase C by extended phorbol
ester treatment. These data suggest that both protein kinase pathways
regulate tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in hypothalamic cells. As
simultaneous activation of both pathways has less than an additive effect
on the tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA level, they appear to be interrelated.
Compared with the rapid and dramatic increase of the tyrosine hydroxylase
mRNA level in pheochromocytoma cells, activation of the protein kinase A
or protein kinase C pathway in the cultured hypothalamic cells induces
slow changes of a small magnitude in the amount of tyrosine hydroxylase
mRNA. The slow regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in
hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons corresponds to the relatively high
stability of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA (half-life = 14 +/- 1 h) in these
cells.

Elevated tyrosine hydroxylase in the locus coeruleus of suicide victims
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The amounts of tyrosine
hydroxylase protein in locus coeruleus from nine pairs of
antidepressant-free suicide victims and age-matched, sudden-death control
cases were determined by quantitative blot immunolabeling of cryostat-cut
sections from the caudal portion of the nucleus. In each of the nine
age-matched pairs, the concentration of tyrosine hydroxylase was greater
in the sample from the suicide victim, with values ranging from 108 to
172% of the matched control value (mean = 136%). By contrast, there were
no differences in the concentrations of neuron-specific enolase protein in
the same set of samples. Similarly, the number of neuromelanin-containing
cells, counted in sections of locus coeruleus adjacent to those taken for
blot immunolabeling analyses, did not differ between the two groups. These
data indicate that locus coeruleus neurons from suicide victims contain
higher than normal concentrations of tyrosine hydroxylase, thus raising
the possibility that the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in locus
coeruleus may be relevant in the pathophysiology of suicide.

Hypoxia increases rate of transcription and stability of
tyrosine hydroxylase messenger RNA in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells
<p class="Para1">
PC12 exposed to 5% O<sub>2</sub>
causes increases in TH mRNA over controls and is seen within the first
hour of change.  This reaches a 3-fold
maximum at 6 hr, remaining elevated above controls for the entire hypoxic
period (24 hr).  A Northern blot shows the
1.78 kb message of TH mRNA increasing with a 1.75 message of
'c58'>b</span>-actin does not change.  Five
such experiments are consistent.
<p>Changes in TH mRNA can result from increased
transcription, increased message stability, or both.
Nuclear runoff assays were done on isolated PC12
nuclei previously exposed to hypoxic conditions for a period varying from
1-12 hr (the in vitro transcription assays involve addition of RNA
nucleotide precursors for 30 min at appropriate temperature, then lysing
nuclei with SDS/EDTA, digesting with proteinase K, extracting RNA with
phenol-chloroform, EtOH-precipitating, purifying of G-50; hybridization is
on filters with labeled material mixed with constant excess of TH or
b-actin DNA from plasmid).  The averaged
transcription rates of the TH mRNA were above controls throughout the 12
hr period.  Transcription rates were shows
to have 4.5-fold maximum at the 6 hr point, the point at which message is
seen to reach a maximum.  A slight decrease
in transcription is observed after this time, but still remains above
controls.
<p>PC12 cells were transfected with TH gene-containing
plasmids in which the gene segments were taken from suspected cis-acting
regions of TH gene control.  Plasmids
contained regions from -4800, -773, and -272 to +27 bases and were fused
to a CAT reporter.  The highest expression
was in the -272 to +27 fragment during the hypoxic period and apparently
suppressed in cells transfected with the longer promoter fragments.
The results indicate that cis elements mediating
increases in TH gene transcription are between -272 and +27 while
repressor elements are upstream of -272.
COS-7 cells transfected with the -272 to +27 construct and then subjected
to hypoxic or normal conditions showed no changes in CAT reporter
transcription in either case, indicating that PC12 cells contain the
elements specific for TH gene transcription.
<p>Half-life measurements were done for TH mRNA using
two different methods.  In one method,
transcription is blocked by use of the nonspecific RNA polymerase blocker,
3 &mu;g/ml actinomycin D (Perry &amp; Kelly, J Cell Physiol 76: 127, 1970),
or of a RNA synthesis initiation blocker, 100 &mu;M 5,6-dichloro-1-
'c82'>b</span>-<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">d</span>-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole
(DRB) (Tamm &amp; Seghal, Adv Virus Res 22:
187, 1978).  Drugs are added 15 min before
hypoxic treatments, then total RNA of treated cells at the various
intervals taken for Northern analysis.  The
second method involves pulse-chase using 4-thiouridine:
growing cells are pulsed with 0.2 mM 4-thiouridine for
1.5 h then chased with 10 mM cytidine and 10 mM uridine in fresh
media.  Pulsing was done in some cases 12 hr
after the hypoxic treatment had begun, in others at the same time hypoxia
was started.  The thiolabeled RNA can be
isolated from total cellular RNA by an organomercury affinity
chromatography gel (AffiGel 501); it is glycosylated, then analyzed on
Northern.  Plots were constructed for both
methods plotting log fraction remaining against treatment exposure
time.  Results of both plots agree that
normally treated cells show a message half-life of about 10 hr.
They also agree on the hypoxic treatments (in
the pulse experiments, the plot lines are virtually coincident), in which
message stability drops at the most 10-20% during the 30 hr period that
was assessed (plot data being about every 6 hr).
Since a 50% reduction was never seen in TH message in
the hypoxic cells, any estimation of half-life would have to be obtained
by extrapolation.
<p>DISCUSSION.  Hypoxic
treatments of PC12 cells clearly influence changes in TH expression by
increasing transcription and by altering message stability.
There is a similarity to gene expression in PC12 cells
with the carotid body type I cells which are sensitive to changes in
O<sub>2</sub> and must translate these changes in
a signal transduction scheme.
<p>The control elements for the greatest transcription
of TH under hypoxic conditions are in the -272 to +27 promoter
fragment.  This fragment was selected since
it contains the many control elements (eg., CRE, AP1, AP2, Oct/POU, MyoD,
and SP1) found involved with TH gene expression.
The CRE is thought to respond to increases in cAMP and
to membrane depolarization.  cAMP increases
in hypoxia in both PC12 cells and the type I cells and so may affect the
transcription observed here, although prior treatment with forskolin over
a dose course by us failed to stop any observed increases in CAT reporter
in the -272 to +27 construct induced by hypoxia (showing additive
effects).  And any increases in TH
transcription by increased cAMP were weak, indicating that hypoxia may
work partially through cAMP, but not mainly.
In a related finding, induction of erythropoietin mRNA
in kidney by hypoxia does not involve cAMP.
<p>
As for the message stability studies, use of
transcription-blocking drugs has been criticized since they have other
effects altering metabolism;  however, cells
in normoxic conditions treated with drugs show a TH message half life in
PC12 cells which is comparable to previous reports showing the same half
life but using other methods.  Nevertheless
the more acceptable pulse chase studies showed the same result as
well.  This is the first report showing an
enhanced message stability since reports assessing the effects of
glucocorticoids or stimulated adenylate cyclase tested stability and found
no change accounting for why TH mRNA was enhanced.
Protein kinase C has been found to increase
transcription and to cause posttranscriptional effects but message
stability was not studied.  Craviso et al
have reported (in abstracts) that nicotinic activation affects TH mRNA at
the post-transcriptional level.  Preliminary
work in our lab suggests the binding of a protein to the 3'-untranslated
region of the message.

Hypoxia stimulates binding of a cytoplasmic protein to a
pyrimidine-rich sequence in the 3'-untranslated region of rat tyrosine
hydroxylase mRNA
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:
Reduced oxygen tension (hypoxia) induces a 3-fold
increase in stability of mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the
rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, in the pheochromocytoma
(PC12) clonal cell line. To investigate the possibility that RNA-protein
interactions are involved in mediating this increase in stability, RNA gel
shift assays were performed using different fragments of labeled TH mRNA
and the S-100 fraction of PC12 cytoplasmic protein extracts. We identified
a sequence within the 3'-untranslated region of TH mRNA that binds
cytoplasmic protein. RNase T1 mapping revealed that the protein was bound
to a 28 nucleotide long sequence that is located between bases 1551-1579
of TH mRNA. Moreover, protein binding to this fragment was prevented with
an antisense oligonucleotide directed against bases 1551-1579 and
subsequent RNase H digestion. This fragment of the 3'-untranslated region
of TH mRNA is rich in pyrimidine nucleotides, and the binding of
cytoplasmic protein to this fragment was reduced by competition with other
polypyrimidine sequences including poly(C) but not poly(U) polymers. The
binding of the protein to TH mRNA was increased when cytoplasmic proteins
were extracted from PC12 cells exposed to hypoxia (5% O<sub>2</sub>) for
24 h. Electrophoresis of the UV cross-linked RNA-protein complex on
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a complex of 74 kDa. The
potential role of this protein-TH mRNA interaction in regulation of TH
mRNA stability during hypoxia is discussed.

Sequences distal to the AP1/E box motif are involved in
the cell type-specific expression of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:
In order to define cell type-specific elements
associated with the catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme, tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH), transient transfections of promoter deletion constructs
were used to test relative reporter-gene activities in TH-expressing and
-nonexpressing cell lines. Such assays demonstrated that a region between
-503 and -578 contributed to rat TH promoter activity in the
pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. Deletion of these sequences resulted in a
66% loss in cell type-specific activity. Mutations within the E box/dyad
symmetry element (CAGGTGCCTGTGACAGTG) did not affect the basal and cell
type-specific pattern of expression exhibited by the rat TH promoter.
Promoter fusion constructs between the rat TH promoter (-741 and -197) and
the human TH promoter (-197 and +1) exhibited reporter-gene activities
equivalent to that of wild-type -741 rat TH constructs, further
demonstrating that sequence elements upstream of the rat E box/dyad
symmetry are important for cell type-specific expression. Gel-shift
experiments indicated that a PC12 nuclear factor could bind to a 39-bp
sequence within this region in a cell type-specific manner. The size of
this factor was 52 kDa as determined by UV cross-linking experiments.

cells differs from that expressed in mouse fibroblasts by gene transfer
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:
Previous studies have used recombinant retroviruses
encoding the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene to transduce various cell
lines, including fibroblasts (NIH-3T3), a pituitary tumor cell line
(AtT20), and a pancreatic endocrine line (RIN). These genetically modified
cells, synthesizing either 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, dopamine, or both,
are potential donors for treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the
levels of TH protein in such transduced cells have been low and
heterogeneous. Using several modified versions of retrovirus vectors
encoding TH, we demonstrated that protein stability is an important factor
governing levels of TH in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Whereas low levels of TH
protein were observed in infected NIH-3T3 cells, high levels of a TH-beta
gal fusion protein were found. This difference was due to a significantly
longer half-life of the TH-beta gal fusion protein relative to TH alone.
However, the TH-beta gal fusion protein was found to be enzymatically
inactive. We also found that the half-life of the endogenous TH protein in
PC-12 cells is sevenfold longer than the TH protein in transduced
fibroblasts, implying that a cell-type specific regulator or mechanism may
stabilize TH in catecholaminergic cells.

Increased cell-cell contact stimulates the transcription
rate of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene in rat pheochromocytoma PC18 cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Cell aggregation is one of
several environmental cues that influence the expression of
neurotransmitter phenotype during development. The expression of the
catecholaminergic phenotype is increased in rat pheochromocytoma cells
cultured at high density. In the present study we have investigated
whether this cell density-mediated effect on the catecholaminergic
phenotype is due to the stimulation of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene. When
rat pheochromocytoma PC18 cells are cultured at high density (2 x 10(5)
cells/cm2), tyrosine hydroxylase enzymatic activity and tyrosine
hydroxylase protein increase two- to threefold over that observed in cells
cultured at low density (1 x 10(4) cells/cm2). This increase in tyrosine
hydroxylase protein observed in high-density cultures is fully accounted
for by a preceding increase in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels. The
relative transcription rate of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene, measured
using a nuclear run on assay, is two- to threefold greater in PC18 cells
cultured at high density than in cells cultured at low density. Using flow
cytometry, we have determined that in high-density cultures, there are
approximately twice as many cells in the G0-G1 phases of the cell cycle
compared with the number of G0-G1 cells observed in low-density cultures.
However, when G0-G1 cells are isolated by cellular elutriation, tyrosine
hydroxylase gene transcription rate remains two- to threefold greater in
G0-G1 cells from high-density cultures than in G0-G1 cells from
low-density cultures. These results indicate that increased cell-cell
contact stimulates the transcription rate of the tyrosine hydroxylase
gene, resulting in the subsequent increased expression of tyrosine
hydroxylase mRNA and protein.

Cholinergic differentiation of cultured sympathetic
neurons induced by retinoic acid. Induction of choline
acetyltransferase-mRNA and suppression of tyrosine hydroxylase-mRNA levels
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Here we show that retinoic
acid (RA) has the ability to alter the transmitter phenotype of cultured
sympathetic neurons from newborn rats superior cervical ganglia (SCG). In
the presence of RA, the level of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA was
increased, while the level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA was reduced
in the cultured SCG neurons. Selective PCR amplification of different
upstream regions of the ChAT-mRNA indicates that RA promotes the
transcription of ChAT gene from R and M exons. The RA-induced upregulation
of ChAT-mRNA level was significantly diminished by the chronic treatment
with phorbol ester, suggesting that PKC has an important role in the
induction of ChAT-mRNA in this system.

Bovine tyrosine hydroxylase gene-promoter regions
involved in basal and angiotensin II-stimulated expression in
nontransformed adrenal medullary cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:
The tyrosine hydroxylase gene is expressed
specifically in catecholaminergic cells, and its activity is regulated by
afferent stimuli. To characterize molecular mechanisms underlying those
regulations, we have constructed chimeric genes consisting of bovine
tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoters (wild-type or deletion mutants) and a
luciferase reporter gene. The basal expression of these genes and their
regulation by angiotensin II were examined in cultured bovine adrenal
medullary cells. Luciferase activity was normalized to the amount of
transfected plasmid DNA. A pTHgoodLUC plasmid containing the -428/+21-bp
fragment of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter expressed luciferase
activity at severalfold higher levels than the promoterless pOLUC plasmid.
Deletion of the -194/-54-bp promoter fragment containing POU/Oct, SP1, and
other putative regulatory elements increased luciferase expression
fivefold. An additional deletion further upstream (-269/-194 bp),
including a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-responsive element
(TRE)-like site, reduced promoter activity. These results indicate the
presence of negatively and positively acting regions in the bovine
tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter controlling basal promoter activity in
adrenal medullary cells. Angiotensin II stimulated the expression of
endogenous tyrosine hydroxylase gene and pTHgood-LUC approximately
threefold without affecting the expression of pOLUC. A comparable
threefold stimulation was observed following the deletion of the
-194/-54-bp promoter region, despite the increase in basal promoter
activity. Additional deletion of the -269/-194-bp promoter fragment
reduced stimulation by angiotensin II to 1.5-fold. These results indicate
that the angiotensin II receptor-responsive element is located in the
-269/-194-bp promoter region containing the TRE-like site. Additional
angiotensin II-responsive site(s) may be present outside this region. Gel
mobility shift assays demonstrated constitutive and angiotensin II-induced
protein binding to the tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter. Some
DNA-protein complexes were displaced with c-Fos antibodies. The results
suggest that c-Fos-related antigens support basal promoter activity and
mediate activation of tyrosine hydroxylase by angiotensin II receptor.

Evidence for protein kinase C involvement in the
short-term activation by prolactin of tyrosine hydroxylase in
tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The mechanism of the
short-term activation by prolactin (PRL) of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in
tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons was examined in vitro on
hypothalamic slices from ovariectomized rats. TH activity (determined by
3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation in the median eminence after
blockade of decarboxylase with NSD 1055) showed a dose-dependent increase
within 2 h of incubation of the hypothalamic slices with PRL. To determine
whether a phosphorylation process was involved in this increase in TH
activity, we studied the sensitivity of the enzyme to dopamine (DA)
feedback inhibition. In control median eminences, two kinetically
different forms of TH coexisted, one exhibiting a Ki(DA) value of 29.92
+/- 0.49 microM, the other being approximately 15-fold more sensitive to
DA inhibition with a Ki(DA) of 1.96 +/- 0.09 microM, likely corresponding
to a phosphorylated and active form and to a nonphosphorylated and less
active form, respectively. After PRL treatment, the TH form of low Ki(DA)
remained unaffected, whereas the Ki(DA) of the purported active form of TH
increased to 62.6 +/- 0.8 microM, suggesting an increase in the enzyme
phosphorylation. This increase in the Ki(DA) of TH was selectively
prevented by GF 109203X, a potent and selective inhibitor of protein
kinase C, but not by a specific inhibitor of protein kinase A or
calmodulin. Finally, this action of PRL could be mimicked by
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (a direct activator of protein kinase
C). These results suggest that PRL, at the median eminence level,
activates TH by increasing the enzyme phosphorylation and that this action
may involve an activation of protein kinase C.

The Oct-2 transcription factor represses tyrosine hydroxylase
expression via a heptamer TAATGARAT-like motif in the gene promoter
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
gene promoter contains adjacent octamer and heptamer motifs which act as
target sites for octamer binding transcription factors. Mutation of the
heptamer motif but not the octamer motif enhances TH promoter activity in
neuronal cells expressing Oct-2 but not in non-expressing fibroblasts.
Similarly addition of the heptamer motif to a minimal TH promoter
represses gene expression in neuronal cells but not in fibroblasts. These
effects can be reproduced by the artificial expression of neuronal
isoforms of Oct-2 in fibroblasts which results in the repression of
transfected TH promoters containing an intact heptamer motif but not those
in which this motif has been mutated or deleted. The TH promoter thus
represents the first example of a cellular promoter which is repressed by
Oct-2. The significance of this effect is discussed in terms of the cell
type specificity of the TH promoter and its induction by different
physiological stimuli.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide
(PACAP) potently enhances tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in adrenal
chromaffin cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:
In primary cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells
(BACC), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1-38 (PACAP)
produced a dose related increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> when
measured 48 hours after the beginning of the treatment; a significant
increase was observed with 0.5 nM and the maximal induction of close to
2.5-fold was found with 0.1 microM PACAP. The potency of PACAP was nearly
3 orders of magnitude greater than forskolin and VIP in inducing TH
activity. These effects were preceded by an increase in TH mRNA levels,
that started 2 hours after treatment and peaked 12 hours later. The
presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor HL 725 further increased the
stimulation of TH activity by PACAP, indicating that this activation was
mediated via a cascade of events initiated by cAMP. Nicotine (1 microM)
failed to increase TH activity significantly, however, when added in
association with PACAP, a statistically significant increase of TH was
elicited with peptide concentrations 5 times lower (0.1 nM) than the
threshold dose of the peptide. The stimulation of nicotinic receptors
facilitates the TH induction elicited by PACAP.

Inhibitory effect of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on the in vitro activity
of tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is found to be costored with
norepinephrine (NE) in vesicles of the nerve terminals. Tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH), the synthetic enzyme of NE, has been mentioned to be a
rate-limiting step. In an attempt to understand the effect of NPY on TH
activities, an in vitro assay is carried out using chromatographic
analysis of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) formation from tyrosine. NPY
(40-120 pmol/ml) produced a dose-dependent depression of DOPA formation
catalysed by the adrenal TH of rats. Lineweaver-Burk plot (<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 156
microM, <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> = 1.05 nmol/h/mg protein) showed a non-competitive inhibition
in NPY (80 pmol/ml, IC50)-treated samples. Moreover, failure of denatured
NPY even at maximum concentration to influence the TH activities suggested
the essential of nature form for NPY. Participation of pterine cofactor
seems also negligible, because increase of
2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyltetrahydropteridine did not overcome the
effect of NPY. These results indicate that NPY has the ability to inhibit
the catalytic action of TH in the adrenal gland of rats.

Dephosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase by brain protein phosphatases:
a predominant role for type 2A
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Extracts from rat corpus
striatum, or striatal proteins resolved by chromatography on DE-52, were
tested for protein phosphatase activity using tyrosine hydroxylase,
phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, as substrate. The
predominant dephosphorylating activity was independent of divalent cations
and was inhibited by low concentrations (100 nM) of okadaic acid, defining
the phosphatase as type 2A. Phosphatase type 2C (Mg2+ and Mn2+ stimulated)
was evident in the presence of okadaic acid but at a level of
approximately 10% of type 2A activity. Phosphatase 2B (Ca2+ and calmodulin
dependent) mediated dephosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase was not
apparent. The dephosphorylation of [32P]-tyrosine hydroxylase was not
modulated by tetrahydrobiopterin, ATP, or GTP. These results indicate that
tyrosine hydroxylase which has been phosphorylated by cAMP dependent
protein kinase is dephosphorylated predominantly by phosphatase type 2A in
brain, and the activity of this phosphatase is not modulated by pteridines
or nucleotides.

Nicotine-induced regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase
activity in adrenal gland of transgenic mouse carrying human tyrosine

<b>Abstract</b>:
We investigated the effect of subcutaneous injection
of nicotine on in vitro tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity in adrenal
gland and brain of the transgenic mice carrying an 11-kb fragment
containing the entire human TH gene. Injection of 5 mg nicotine/kg (as
free base) for 3 days caused a statistically significant increase in vitro
TH activity in the adrenal gland, whereas brain TH activity was not
affected at all. The adrenal gland of non-transgenic C57BL/6J mice treated
in the same way as for transgenic mice tended to enhance TH activity,
although not to a significant level. This observation might indicate the
possibility that the machinery used by nicotine in regulating the
properties or expression of TH in the adrenal gland should be similar
between transgenic and non-transgenic mice.

Catalytic core of rat tyrosine hydroxylase: terminal deletion
analysis of bacterially expressed enzyme
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
catalyzes the rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis. This
enzyme is hypothesized to consist of an amino-terminal regulatory domain
and a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain. In the present studies, we have
utilized recombinant DNA techniques to map the boundaries of the
regulatory and catalytic domains of TH. We have isolated a full-length
cDNA clone for rat pheochromocytoma TH and have expressed the enzyme in
bacteria. Utilizing this bacterial expression system and polymerase chain
reaction technology, we have constructed and subcloned genes for five
amino-terminal deletion mutants (N delta 40, N delta 155, N delta 165, N
delta 175 and N delta 200; N delta denotes amino-terminal deletion and the
numerical value denotes the number of amino acids deleted) and two
carboxy-terminal deletion mutants (C delta 19 and C delta 50). The
catalytic core of rat tyrosine hydroxylase has been identified to include
the region from amino acid #165 to amino acid #479. The amino-terminal
deletion mutants, N delta 40, N delta 155 and N delta 165 are from 1.85 to
2.5-fold more active than unmodified recombinant TH, while the removal of
19 amino acids from the C-terminus (C delta 19) results in a 70% reduction
in enzyme activity. Removal of additional sequences (ten more residues
from the N-terminus [N delta 175]; or an additional 31 amino acids from
the C-terminus [C delta 50]) results in protein that is totally without
enzyme activity. As expected, removal of 40 (or more) N-terminal amino
acids abolishes the ability of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent
protein kinase to phosphorylate the recombinant enzyme; serine-40 is the
phosphorylation site on TH for PKA. We conclude that the N-terminal
boundary for the TH catalytic domain resides between residues 165 and 175
and that removal of this N-terminal domain (totally or partially)
increases the activity of the enzyme. These findings confirm previous
reports that proteolytic cleavage at amino acid #158 produces an active
(and activated) catalytic fragment.

Neuroblastoma cell detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) for tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The presence of tumour cells
in peripheral blood of neuroblastoma patients is of considerable clinical
importance. Nucleic acid amplification offers an opportunity to detect
very small numbers of such cells, but in neuroblastoma a frequent specific
abnormality in the tumour DNA suitable for this purpose has yet to be
identified. To facilitate the detection of such cells we have developed
RT-PCR using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as a tissue-specific target gene.
TH mRNA was detected in 3 neuroblastoma cell lines and in all
neuroblastoma tumours examined, but was undetectable in peripheral blood
from children without neuroblastoma. The method was highly sensitive,
detecting 1-10 neuroblastoma cells per 10(7) blood cells. Thirty blood
samples from 24 patients were analysed and results were compared with
known disease status. At diagnosis 4/7 patient blood specimens were
positive; the four positive samples were from stage-4 patients. In blood
samples from these patients 6-8 weeks after the initiation of treatment,
TH mRNA was undetectable. Of 7 samples taken at the time of clinical
relapse, 5 were positive; 4 of these were from patients with evidence of
disseminating disease. Of 16 blood samples from disease-free patients, 14
were negative and 2 were positive. One positive patient in this group
subsequently had a clinical relapse. These results show that this
technique is of value for detecting neuroblastoma cells in peripheral
blood. The significance of these cells at diagnosis, during treatment or
on follow-up requires further evaluation.

Deficits in the activation and phosphorylation of
hippocampal tyrosine hydroxylase in the aged Fischer 344 rat following
intraventricular administration of 6-hydroxydopamine
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tyrosine hydroxylase activity
was measured under optimal and suboptimal assay conditions in hippocampal
extracts from young (2 month), mature (12 month), and old (24 month)
Fischer 344 male rats 72 h after the infusion of 200 micrograms of the
neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine or vehicle into the lateral ventricle. The
lesion resulted in a 45-55% decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase activity
measured under optimal conditions (pH 6.1, 3.0 mM
6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin) and an approximately 35% decrease in
the relative concentration of immunoreactive tyrosine hydroxylase. When
measured under suboptimal conditions (pH 6.6, 0.7 mM
6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin), tyrosine hydroxylase activity in 2-
and 12-month-old lesioned animals was twice that measured in
vehicle-treated animals. However, in the old lesioned animals, tyrosine
hydroxylase activity measured under suboptimal conditions was not
different from that measured in age-matched vehicle-treated animals.
Isoforms of tyrosine hydroxylase were identified on immunoblots after
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using enhanced chemiluminescence. The
relative proportion of lower pI isoforms of tyrosine hydroxylase in the
2-month-old lesioned animals was greater than srat observed in
vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, no difference was seen in the
relative proportion of tyrosine hydroxylase isoforms in the 24-month-old
lesioned versus control animals. These data indicate that the ability of
locus ceruleus neurons to rapidly respond to and compensate for insult is
attenuated in 24-month-old Fischer 344 rats due to a deficit in
stimulus-evoked enzyme phosphorylation.

The effect of tetrahydrobiopterin on the in situ
phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in rat striatal synaptosomes
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4),
the obligatory cofactor of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, decreased
the in situ 32P-phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in rat
striatal synaptosomes. Incubation of pre-32P-labeled synaptosomes with BH4
in the presence of a permeant analogue of cAMP decreased the
cAMP-stimulated level of 32P label incorporation into TH by about 50%, as
determined by immunoprecipitation and autoradiography of
SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The extent of inhibition mirrored changes in
intrasynaptosomal BH4 levels and varied both as a function of BH4
concentration and length of incubation. A similar decrease in the amount
of TH 32P-labeling was observed with the precursor of BH4, sepiapterin.
This effect, in turn, was reversed by the inhibitor of sepiapterin
reductase, N-acetyl-serotonin. Finally, exposure of pre-32P-labeled
synaptosomes to the inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, okadaic acid,
blocked the response to BH4. Collectively, the data suggest that BH4
stimulates the dephosphorylation of TH in situ and thus may play a dual
role both as a cofactor for catalysis and a regulator of hydroxylase
activity.

Some of acute symptoms caused by MPP+ may be attributed to the inhibition

Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in
depolarized non-transformed bovine adrenal medullary cells: second
messenger systems and promoter mechanisms
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: Activation of the tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) gene in the adrenal medulla during stress is mediated by
trans-synaptic mechanisms and may involve cholinergic receptors.
Stimulation of nicotinic receptors in adrenal medullary cells induces cell
depolarization, influx of Ca2+ ions and increases levels of cAMP. We have
shown that both cAMP and membrane depolarization produce an increase in
the expression of the TH gene in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells
(BAMC). Others have proposed that transcriptional activation of the TH
gene by cAMP is mediated through the sequence homologous to a cAMP
responsive element (CRE) located in the proximal region of the TH gene
promoter. In the present study we have examined the mechanisms by which
membrane depolarization increases the TH gene activity. Treatment of
serum-free BAMC cultures with the depolarizing agent, veratridine,
increased the extracellular concentration of catecholamines,
Met5-enkephalin, and the relative abundance of TH mRNA. Veratridine
treatment also increased the levels of mRNAs for the catecholamine
biosynthetic enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), and
proenkephalin A (PEK). Treatment for longer than 3 h was required to
increase TH mRNA levels. By contrast, our previous studies indicated that
cAMP stimulation for 2 h produces a maximal increase in TH mRNA levels in
BAMC. The effects of veratridine and forskolin on TH mRNA levels were
additive, further indicating that depolarization and cAMP activate TH gene
expression via different pathways. Calmidazolium, an antagonist of
calmodulin, had no effect on the veratridine-induced increase in TH mRNA
levels. Similarly sphingosine treatment or preincubation with PMA, which
reduce protein kinase C (PKC) activity and attenuate the induction of TH
mRNA by PMA or the hormone, angiotensin II, did not affect the induction
by veratridine. To identify promoter mechanisms of TH gene activation in
depolarized cells we transfected BAMC with a plasmid pTHgoodLuc and
treated with veratridine for 24 h. pTHgoodLUC contains a luciferase
reporter gene linked to a -428/+21 bp fragment of the bovine TH gene
promoter (relative to the transcription start site). Veratridine increased
the expression of luciferase from the TH promoter 2.5-fold. Deletion of
the -194/-54 bp promoter region containing SP-1 and POU/Oct sites reduced
veratridine stimulation by 40%. Additional deletion of the -269 to -190 bp
promoter segment, including an AP-1 element, further reduced veratridine
stimulation to a statistically non-significant level. In conclusion,
activation of TH gene expression upon depolarization is not mediated by
calmodulin and PKC. Promoter sequences involved in this activation are
located upstream from the CRE. Depolarization may activate TH gene
transcription by acting on more than one regulatory region.

Induction of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression by a
nonneuronal nonpituitary-mediated mechanism in immobilization stress
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:
Stress stimulates the sympathoadrenal system, causing
activation of the catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes. Here we examine the
changes of gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; EC 1.14.16.2), the
initial enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, with stress. A single
immobilization of rats led to a large transient elevation in TH mRNA and a
small elevation in TH immunoreactive protein and activity. Repeated daily
immobilizations triggered more sustained changes in TH mRNA levels. After
two immobilizations, the levels remained elevated even 3 days later. The
rise in TH mRNA was followed by increased immunoreactive protein but only
a small elevation in activity. With seven repeated immobilizations, the
animals did not appear to adapt and still manifested a further rise in TH
mRNA. TH activity was markedly elevated and returned to control levels 7
days after the immobilization. The rise in TH mRNA with a single
immobilization occurred even in adrenals of hypophysectomized rats that
underwent splanchnic nerve section. Immobilization for 30 min was
sufficient to increase TH mRNA. The effect was abolished by the
transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Mobility gel-shift assays
revealed increased binding of c-Fos and c-Jun to the AP-1 transcription
factor site after a single immobilization, and the binding was not further
elevated with repeated stress. This study shows that a single
immobilization can activate TH gene expression by a nonneuronal
nonpituitary-mediated pathway associated with increased binding of AP-1
transcription factors.

Isolation of two E-box binding factors that interact with
the rat tyrosine hydroxylase enhancer
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The enhancer of the rat
tyrosine hydroxylase gene (TH) in PC8b cells is composed of the AP1 motif
(TCATTCA, -205 to -199) and an overlapping 20-base pair dyad symmetry
element (TCAGAGGCAGGTGCCTGTGA, -201 to -182) whose core is an E-box. We
have isolated two partial cDNA clones that encode factors which bind the
TH-dyad. One is rITF2 with a basic helix-loop-helix motif and the other is
CDP2 with a homeodomain. rITF2 is a rat homolog of human ITF2 (or E2-2),
and CDP2 is a member of a new family of homeoproteins defined by histidine
as the 9th residue of the recognition helix and by unique 64 amino acid
repeats related to those of the Drosophila <i>cut</i> gene.
The binding affinity of CDP2 alone is relatively weak, but it enhances the
binding of rITF2 to the TH-dyad. In transfected F9 cells, activation of a
TH-driven reporter requires both rITF2 and CDP2, suggesting that the
proteins may functionally interact. However, rITF2 and CDP2 are not
restricted to TH-expressing tissues; hence they may not be involved in the
tissue-specific expression of TH. In addition, CDP2 is phosphorylated in
vitro and in vivo.

Coordinate regulation of choline acetyltransferase,

<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>: The neurotransmitter
phenotype switch that occurs in cultures of rat superior cervical ganglion
neurons after treatment with leukemia inhibitory factor or ciliary
neurotrophic factor is a useful model permitting investigation of the
mechanisms of cytokine-mediated differentiation. Recently the actions of
leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor have been
linked through their interactions with related receptor complexes. Here we
compare the effects of these two cytokines on gene expression in
sympathetic neuronal cultures and begin to investigate their mechanisms.
We report that, as has been shown for leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary
neurotrophic factor regulates peptides and classical transmitters in these
cultures at the mRNA level. In addition, we find that the induction of
substance P mRNA by these cytokines is rapid, dependent on protein
synthesis, and occurs in 40-50% of superior cervical ganglion neurons in

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase regulates basal and cyclic
AMP-stimulated but not phorbol ester-stimulated transcription of
the tyrosine hydroxylase gene
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:  To define the precise role of cyclic AMP
(cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in transcriptional regulation of the
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene, we performed transient cotransfection
analyses of a reporter construct containing the upstream 2,400 bp sequence
of the rat TH gene with expression plasmids encoding a heat-stable
specific inhibitor of PKA (PKI), a mutant regulatory subunit of PKA, or
the catalytic subunit of PKA. Inhibition of PKA activity by expression of
either PKI or mutant regulatory subunit blocked cAMP-stimulated induction
and reduced basal transcription of the TH-reporter construct. Expression
of the catalytic subunit of PKA induced the expression of the TH-reporter
construct up to 50-fold in a dose-dependent manner. Primer extension
analysis confirmed that PKA-mediated induction of TH-reporter expression
occurred at the correct transcription initiation site. Expression of PKI
did not affect induction following phorbol ester treatment, suggesting
that PKA and protein kinase C (PKC) induce TH transcription by independent
mechanisms. Finally, a double mutation within the cAMP response element
(CRE) of TH2400-CAT diminished its basal and forskolin-stimulated
transcription to the level of the promoterless plasmid, pBLCAT3, but did
not alter the induction following treatment with phorbol ester, indicating
that the CRE is not required for PKC-mediated transcriptional induction.
Our results indicate that PKA, via the CRE, plays a crucial role for basal
and cAMP-inducible transcription of the TH gene.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) potently
enhances tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in adrenal chromaffin cells
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>:  In primary cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells
(BACC), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1-38 (PACAP)
produced a dose related increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> when
measured 48 hours after the beginning of the treatment; a significant
increase was observed with 0.5 nM and the maximal induction of close
to 2.5-fold was found with 0.1 microM PACAP. The potency of PACAP was
nearly 3 orders of magnitude
greater than forskolin and VIP in inducing TH activity. These effects were
preceded by an increase in TH mRNA levels, that started 2 hours after
treatment and peaked 12 hours later. The presence of the phosphodiesterase
inhibitor HL 725 further increased the stimulation of TH activity by
PACAP, indicating that this activation was mediated via a cascade of
events initiated by cAMP. Nicotine (1 microM) failed to increase TH
activity significantly, however, when added in association with PACAP, a
statistically significant increase of TH was elicited with peptide
concentrations 5 times lower (0.1 nM) than the threshold dose of the
peptide.  The stimulation of nicotinic
receptors facilitates the TH induction elicited by PACAP.

  Tyrosine Hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
First proposed in 1939 that biosynthesis of norepinephrine and
epinephrine occurs through conversion of tyrosine to DOPA.
In 1964, two laboratories independently show that particles from
adrenal medulla, brain, and sympathetically innervated tissue
convert tyrosine to DOPA.  The enzyme is distinguished from
<i>tyrosinase</i>, which also converts tyrosine to DOPA, in
that it requires tetrahydropterin (BH<sub>4</sub>).  Moreover, the product
DOPA actually stimulates tyrosinase whereas it strongly
inhibits the adrenal enzyme.  Coincubations of TyrH with
NADPH and dihydropteridine reductase to restore enzyme activity
further shows its dependence on BH<sub>4</sub>.
<p>
The stoichiometry of enzyme, substrate, and coenzyme are demonstrated
in 1971.  L-Tyrosine is mono-oxygenated with BH<sub>4</sub> and
oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to produce L-DOPA, one water molecule,
and a quinonoid dihydrobiopterin.  From a study of phenylalanine
hydroxylase, it is understood that the intermediate is a
4&alpha;-hydroxytetrahydropterin, and verified for TyrH.
<p>
<b>Subcellular location</b>.  Udenfriend and workers reported that
guinea pig and beef adrenal TyrH was particle-bound.  However there
is a belief that this particle-bonding is an artifact of homogenization
conditions:  inclusion of isotonic KCl during extraction yields a TyrH
partitioning to the soluble fraction as opposed to using isotonic
sucrose (see Wurzberger &amp; Mussachio).  In the brain, TyrH may
exist as both a soluble and particulate form.  The soluble form is
found mostly in the perikaryon of neurons, while the particulate
appears largely in the axon and nerve terminals.  There is belief
that TyrH becomes particle-bound during association with vesicles
that are transported axonally (McGeer et al., 1971).  Supporting
immunocytochemical evidence has been offered to show tissues that
are made up of noradrenergic or dopaminergic axons and terminals
have TyrH on particles, and those brain regions being cell bodies show
it as soluble.
<p>
The particulate TyrH form is also more sensitive/reactive:  its
<i>K</i></sub>m</sub> to DMPH<sub>4</sub> is one-fifth and
its <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is twice that of the soluble form.
This may represent the more &#147;mature&#148; form of the enzyme.
<p>
<b>Tissue/Regional Distribution</b>.  The more detailed studies
involve the rat brain.  The <i>substantia nigra</i> is composed of
dopaminergic cell bodies and the <i>striatum</i> of nerve terminals,
and these tissues show the highest TyrH activity.  The <i>locus
coeruleus</i> and the <i>pons medulla</i> are composed of noradrenergic
cell bodies whose activities fall to a second level, while the cortex
cerebellum and hippocampus also are noradrenergic nerve terminals with
the lowest activities.  The <i>hypothalamus</i> has the highest
density of noradrenergic nerve terminals and relatively high TyrH
activity.
<p>
BH<sub>4</sub> availability, and not enzyme concentration, may play a role
in regulation of TyrH.  Neural NOS is also a BH<sub>4</sub>-dependent
enzyme and enriched in the cerebellum with a low <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for the cofactor.
<p>
<b>Assay Methods</b>.  The ability of catechols to adsorb to alumina
and be eluted with acid was the first manner in which TyrH activity could
be measured;  radiolabeled substrate was used to improve sensitivity.
Usually it is necessary to add MAO and DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors
to prevent conversion of the product DOPA.  Nagatsu et al used
excess cofactor and Fe<sup>2+</sup> while Kaufman and coworkers
preferred a cofactor regeneration system using catalytic levels
of cofactor and pyridine dinucleotide and dihydropteridine reductase.
<p>
3,5-[<sup>3</sup>H]Tyr was used later since either position is involved
in the hydroxylation process, releasing a tritium;  Dowex-50 traps
the DOPA and unconverted Tyr (both labeled), and the tritiated water
can then be counted.  Note that this method is okay for partially
purified enzyme, but the labeled substrate can also be converted
other things by other enzymes in more crude preps, and so it is wise
to pass serially through Dowex-50 and -1 to trap both acidic and
basic products before counting the water when working with extracts.
Alternatives to serial mixed-bed exchange include lyophilization
and use of a charcoal phase to trap products (Reinhard et al, 1986).
<p>
A coupled system originally designed for measuring tryptophan
hydroxylase, using [1-<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr, depends on the
DOPA decarboxylase action subsequent to TyrH to produce
alkaline-trappable <sup>14</sup>C.
<p>
Several HPLC methods using electrochemical detection have been
described.
<p>
<b>Substrate specificity</b>.  TyrH will not accept any reducing cofactors
known to participate in mono-oxygenation reactions.  Ascorbate, cysteine,
glutathione, FeCl<sub>2</sub>, FMN, and FAD at 100 &mu;M are all without
effect.  Among pterins, unconjugated tetrahydropterins are more active
than tetrahydrofolate.  The most data is for the adrenal enzyme, and TyrH
resemble phenylalanine hydroxylase in its preference for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>
as opposed to DMPH<sub>4</sub>.  The pterin cofactor must have
an unsubstituted N5 position, a 2-amino group, and a 4-hydroxy moiety.
<p>
The natural pterin BH<sub>4</sub> is more active than the analogs
6-MPH<sub>4</sub> or DMPH<sub>4</sub>, but the difference for TyrH
between the substrates is not nearly so large as it is for PheH.
The relative maximal velocities are in this order BH<sub>4</sub>,
6-MPH<sub>4</sub> and DMPH<sub>4</sub> for all aromatic amino acid
hydroxylases.  The 6-dihydroxylpropyl side chain is also signficant
for activity, since the (6<i>R</i>)-BH<sub>4</sub> natural isomer
has lower <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> than the 6<i>S</i> isomer.  It has been
shown that the 6MPH<sub>4</sub> isomer has a higher <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
than L-<i>erythro</i>-BH<sub>4</sub>:  this indicates the large importance
of the dihydroxypropyl side chain.
<p>
Activity is optimal for bovine striatal TyrH at pH 6.0.
Compared to pH 7.3, <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
values are nearly 40-fold higher with BH<sub>4</sub> as substrate,
10-fold higher with 6MPH<sub>4</sub>.  This despite <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
values being 20-fold higher for BH<sub>4</sub> at pH 6.0 than pH 7.3,
and 11-fold higher for 6MPH<sub>4</sub>.  Similar values were seen
for rat striatum.  For rat adrenal TyrH, pH may not be very important:
the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values for 6MPH<sub>4</sub> does not vary
between pH 5.2-8.0.  The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values are in fact much
larger for the higher pH in rat pheochromocytoma:  0.92 mM at 7.3
vs. 0.20 mM at 6.0.
<p>
Side-chain at the 6-position was altered: hydroxymethyl, methyl,
methoxy, ethyl, pheny, cyclohexyl, and the pterin <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values
decreased as hydrophobicity increased.  Relative <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
also decreased, but not so much such that <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
was 6-10 times greater than for (6<i>R</i>)-BH<sub>4</sub>.

Functional consequences of retrograde axonal transport of receptor-bound
neurotensin
<p class="Para1">
Axonal transport is critical to deliver components to the nerve terminal
machinery since no protein synthesis or gene expression occurs there.
The transport (2-5 mm/h) is microtubule- and vesicle-dependent.  Secretory
materials move unidirectionally, but integral proteins move bidirectionally.
A slow anterograde axonal flow (1-2 mm/day) involves displacement of
the whole cytoplasmic column.  Neurotransmitters are synthesized at
the nerve terminal, while neuromodulators are more likely affected by
axonal transport.
<p>
Axonal transport of receptors was demonstrated by constrictions resulting
from ligations, which showed muscarinic receptors accumulating on
both sides of a ligature on dog splenic nerve.  This showed a bilateral
fast axonal transport of mAChR in noradrenergic axons.
<p>
There is evidence that retrograde transport occurs for many receptor-bound
complexes, including G proteins and the ligands of receptors.  NGF-R
may be so mobilized when bound by NGF, and it may also be true for
endogenous ligands such as BDNF, CNTF, and LIF, for both motor
and sensory neurons.  Lofentanil (an opioid receptor agonist) and
reserpine (labeling a vesicular amine transporter) are also transported,
showing exogenous ligands are similarly affected.  However, fentanyl,
alfentanil, and sufentanil (opioid ligands), and ketanserin and tetrabenazine
(amine transporter binders) do not move by retrograde motion:  this
may be because these are reversibly binding ligands with rapid equilibrium
dissocation-association binding kinetics, whereas the others are so slow
as to be essentially irreversibly bound.
<p>
Study of retrograde transport in peripheral nerves can be done by
ligatures in the PNS, but not in the CNS.  Here radiolabeled
ligands are required.  Neurotensin receptors are in the highest density in
dopaminergic nerve terminals of the brain.  Noradrenergic and serintonergic
terminals are too disperse in the cortex to allow study of them.
The substantia nigra are the cell bodies of dopaminergic neurons,
and the striatum represents axons that lead to terminals in the caudate
nucleus. [<sup>125</sup>I]neurotensin injected in the striatum results
in accumulation of the labeled neurotensin in the substantia nigra ipsilateral
to the injection site.

Thermal stability and CD analysis of rat tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
TH was purified from rat PC12 cells to high degree.  A CD spectrum
from 185-250 nm was conducted on native TH at pH 6.0.  Secondary
structure calculations show 55% &alpha;-helix and 22% &beta;-sheet.
TH was incubated at 65&deg; for 80 min at pH 6.0, and there was a complete
loss of signal at 220 nm.  A good fit of the data was not possible,
and secondary structure was therefore ill-defined; this enzyme
also lost all enzymatic activity.  The loss of signal at 220 nm
also indicates loss of &alpha;-helix and &beta;-sheet.
<p>
TH at pH 6.0 (0.1 M KPi buffer) was incubated at 55&deg; and the
loss of signal (negative value) was observed to be complete by 2 h.
The plot of the loss of signal was best fit to a biphasic
curve with two exponential components with half-lives of 2 and 14 min.
There was no well-defined <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> for spectra taken
and plotted against increasing temperature.  Measuring spectra vs.
time at a single temperature gives more information about stability.
Activity loss over time at 55&deg; was also measured:  this is done
by sampling buffer with and without enzyme in the theromstate CD cell
and diluting in ice-cold PIPES buffer (10 &mu;l into 190 &mu;l)
and doing an activity assay according to Reinhard.  Activity loss
fit an exponential curve with single component and showing a 15 min
half-life, similar to the second phase of the CD spectrum half-life,
and indicating that this phase involves loss of secondary structure
required for catalysis.
<p>
The thermal stability at 50&deg; was then tested for pH dependence.
TH was incubated at pH 6.0 and 7.2.  The rate of CD loss was slower
at pH 7.2, with both half-lives of the biphasic curve increased.
This rate at pH 7.2 was always slower (higher half-lives) at higher
and lower temperatures.  Hence structural differences affecting
activity and thermal stability exist between the two pH values.
<p>
The 50&deg; thermal stability of PK-A phosphorylated TH was tested
at pH 6.0 and pH 7.2.  The first half-life at pH 6.0 fell 75%, and
the second half-life fell by 50%.  Nonphosphorylated TH at pH 7.2
was also more stable than phosphorylated TH (consistent with reports
of Lazar et al., 1981).
<p>
The CD signal loss at 55&deg; was found to decrease as TH (pH 6.0)
and the amount of potassium phosphate buffer salt was increased from
50 to 150 mM.  Decreasing to 25 mM decreases the signal loss markedly,
and at 10 mM the CD loss is prevented.  At 65&deg; and pH 7.2, CD
signal loss is rapid at 150 mM, slow at 50 mM, and very slow at 25 mM.
When the buffer was kept at 20 mM and the ionic strength was instead
altered with KCl at the two different pH values (with two
different temperatures), it was found that the CD signal loss
had an increased rate at both pH.
<p>
All experiments showed that the greater the activity, the more prone
TH was to increased thermal lability (the less stable the enzyme).
The polyanions heparin and DNA, known to activate TH, had the opposite
effect.  Instead of decreasing stability, they decreased the rate
of CD signal loss at pH 6.0.  Heparin was more effective than DNA
on a concentration basis, and this is consistent with heparin's ability
to activate TH at a lower concentrations.  At pH 7.2 polyanions had
less of an effect on activity, and DNA had less of an effect on signal
loss.
<p>
Because there are changes in stability between pH 6.0 and pH 7.2, there
is a suggestion that histidine residues are involved.  Increases in
salt concentration reduced TH stability, although typically they increase
thermal stability, although such studies use much higher ionic strengths.

A Mechanism for Hydroxylation of Tyrosine Hydroxylase Based on
Partitioning of Substituted Phenylalanines
<p class="Para1">
Several 4-substituted Phe species were presented as substrates to
recomb rTH (MW 56 kDa with &epsilon;<sub>280</sub><sup>1%</sup> of
10.4), using 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> cofactor, which was held at 30 &mu;M
below its <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> so that the background rate from
cofactor auto-oxidation was decreased (because not all parameters
saturating, the parameters are apparent).  The substitutions were
the methoxy, methyl, and halo (F, Cl, Br) forms, and Phe and Tyr
were included (as controls).  All were substrates for TyrH since
measurable <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values
were obtained.  All <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values were within
a single order of magnitude, ranging from 9.2 min<sup>&minus;1</sup>
for 4-Br-Phe to 48.2 min<sup>&minus;1</sup> for 4-F-Phe (<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> for
Tyr was 2nd highest at 36.9 min<sup>&minus;1</sup>).  The slow
step in catalysis is therefore probably not the hydroxylation of
the amino acid.  There is a significant fold-difference in range of
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values however, with increases in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> dependent largely upon size
of the 4-substituent, a finding shown for bov TyrH.
<p>
Products from these reactions were determined by HPLC against standards
synthesized for the purpose.  4-F-Phen and 4-Cl-Phe both produced DOPA,
but the product vs time curve lagged compared to the curves for
Tyr or 4-Cl-3-OH-Phe, an indication that DOPA is not the initial
product.  DOPA could form from an intermdiate Tyr which itself
forms from halogen elimination, or from a 4-halo-3-OH-Phe or
3-halo-4-OH intermediate (the latter from a halo shift).
To test whether a halo-hydroxy-intermediate was involved, various
halo-hydroxy-Phe were used as substrates directly, and DOPA formed
only from a 3-halo-4-OH-Phe if the 3-halo was fluorine, and only
from 4-halo-3-OH-Phe if the 4-halo was chlorine or bromine.
<p>
When reactions are kept to within 60 s and initial substrate concentration
is high, the intermediates formed can be analyzed.  4-Br-Phe produces
tyrosine, 4-Br-3-OH-Phe, and 3-Br-4-OH-Phe.  The same isomers are
formed for the 4-chloro substrate, but only tyrosine forms with the
4-fluoro compound.  With 4-methyl-Phe, 4-Me-3-OH-Phe, 3-Me-4-OH-Phe
and 4-(hydroxymethyl)Phe are the three products; there is no tyrosine.
Tyr and 3-OH-Phe form from Phe oxidation.  With 4-methoxy-Phe,
only 4-methoxy-3-OH-Phe is formed.
The quantitative distribution of products formed shows a trend as
well.  In general, hydroxylation at the 3-position is more likely
when the size of the 4-substituent increases.
<p>
With the normal substrate tyrosine, each mole of substrate often
involves the oxidation of each mole of BH<sub>4</sub> cofactor.
When substrates are not physiological, cofactor can become oxidized
without amino acid hydroxylation.  In these experiments, a limited
amount of cofactor was added and the reactions allowed to run to
completion, with product measured.  Results show that the coupling
ratio (hydroxylation to cofactor oxidation) was very high with
4-methyoxy-Phe and very low with 4-Br-Phe.
<p>
The rate of productive coupling (hydroxylation) can be expressed
as <i>k</i><sub>hyd</sub>, and unproductive coupling as
<i>k</i><sub>un</sub>.  The rate constant <i>k</i><sub>un</sub>
would not depend on the structure of the bound amino acid, since
the <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values are very similar, and <sup>18</sup>O
isotope effects are identical for coupled and uncoupled substrates.
If <i>C</i> is the moles hydroxylated substrate per mol oxidized
cofactor, then

<table class="eqn" align="center">
<tr>
 <td rowspan="2"><i>C</i> =

<p class="eqn">

     log(<i>k</i><sub>un</sub>)
<p style="text-indent:0;">
Lines can be fit with the generalized equation:
<p class="eqn" style="margin:1em 0;">
  &minus;log(1/<i>C</i> &minus; 1) = &rho;&sigma; + <i>b</i>
<p>
The &minus;log(1/<i>C</i> &minus; 1) quantity can be plotted against
&sigma; values for substituents on aromatic ring of the amino acid substrates;
&sigma; accounts for the ability of the substituent to activate the
aromatic ring.  The plots are called Hammett plots.  Good fits are found
with &sigma; and &sigma;<sup>+</sup>, and &rho; values of BH<sub>4</sub>
differ slightly from 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>, but both are large and negative.
&rho; of about &minus;5 are consistent with a very electron-deficient
transition state.  This might be explained by a hydroxylating intermediate
generating a cation.  Another possibility is formation of a neutral
radical by attack of extremely electrophilic hydroxylating species, but
&rho; should be in range of &minus;1.0 to +0.5.
<p>
These data show that a cationic intermediate is most likely.  The oxygen
bond is split and the oxygen reacting at the 4 position has a strong
cationic character that is easily delocalized by the aromatic ring.
The other substituent at 4 is either eliminated (flourine totally,
and bromine and chlorine partially) or shifted to the 3-position (Cl
and Br, but also methyl and hydrogen).  Hydroxylation at the 3-position
remains possible for the enzyme and reactive species if size and
chemistry do not favor 4-hydroxylation.

Conformational Properties and Stability of Tyrosine Hydroxylse Studied
By Infrared Spectroscopy:  Effect of Iron/Catecholamine Binding and
Phosphorylation
<p class="Para1">
A recombinant human TH-1 isoform was purified from <i>E. coli</i>.
Iron contaminants in buffer salts was eliminated by passing salts
through Chelex-100.  Enzyme preps contained 0.02 Fe atoms/subunit
(shown by AAS).  Holoenzyme was made with equimolar incubation in
ferrous ammonium sulfate for 5 min at room temp.  For IR spectroscopy,
lyophilized protein samples are dissolved in 20 mM HEPES sodium containing
150 nM NaCl at pH (or pD, for deuterated solvents) 7.4.  These are
centrifuged 10 min at 14,000 &times; <i>g</i> and supernatants recorded
in Nicolet 520 (for D<sub>2</sub>O samples) or Magna 550 (H<sub>2</sub>O
samples) spectrometers with MCT detectors.  The samples are 12-14 mg
protein/ml in thermostated cells with CaF<sub>2</sub> windows, 50 &mu;m
spacers for deuterated, 6 &mu;m for protonated solvents.  Spectrum
analysis involved solvent subtraction, deconvolution, band-position
determination, and curve fitting of the original amide I band
<p>
The region between 1800 and 1500 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> of the original
and amide I band of deconvoluted spectra were recorded for
apo-hTH1 and dopamine-Fe(III)-hTH1 complex in deuterated solvent.
Deconvolution involves a Fourier analysis (self-deconvolution) using
a Lorentzian line shape of 18 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> half-width and
resolution enhancement factor of 3.  Several components are resolved
in this process in the amide I band for both protonated and deuterated
solvents.  These can be assigned to different types of secondary
structure.  Bands at 1654 and 1635 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> are assigned
to &alpha;-helical and &beta;-sheet conformations, resp.  Minor components
are seen in both solvents at 1668 and 1677 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
involving &beta;-turns.  At 1625 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> is weak component
assigned to &beta;-strands, extended chains not forming sheets,
and involve protein-protein contacts of oligomeric proteins.
<p>
Secondary structure was quantified using a method developed by us.
Spectra of phosphorylated and unmodified Fe(II)-hTH1 were analyzed to
band-fit the original amide I band in protonated and deuterated solvents.
The isotopic shifts improve the analysis by altering the band areas
by 8-10% (at band 1655 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) between apo-hTH1 and
Fe(II)-hTH1.  A band at 1640 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> in deuterated
solvents disappears, which is expected for unordered structures
acquiring backbone deuteration. The 1636 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>
band area increases between apo-hTH1 and Fe(II)-hTH1 in deuterated solvents;
this band is due to &beta;-sheet, and the &beta; and unordered structures
will overlap in this solvent.
<p>
Phosphorylated Fe(II)-hTH1 (on Ser-40 by PK-A) band analysis in both
solvents is presented in the table data as well.  The presence of
dopamine between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated apo-hTH1 and
Fe(II)-hTH1, and unmodified Fe(II)-hTH1 did not affect spectra between
the species.  Dopamine is unable to bind to phosphorylated forms anyway.
The secondary structure of apo-hTH1 and phospho-apo-hTH1 is not
signficantly different from one another.  Addition of Fe(II) increases
&alpha;-helical content of apo-hTH1 by about 10%, balanced by a loss
of unordered structure.  Dopamine has no effect on this.
<p>
IR spectra of apo-hTH1 were obtained at different temperatures from
25&deg; to 79&deg; in deuterated solvent, and the amide bands analyzed
(by deconvolution Fourier) in detail.  Major changes occurred in the
amide I (1700-1610 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and amide II (1550
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) modes at transition temperatures of 44 and 52&deg;.
The amide I band was broadened and sharp components at 1618
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> and 1685 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> became evident.
These suggest thermal denaturation, as these are extended structures
that form with aggregation of unfolded proteins.  A residual band around
1550 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> was lost, and this indicates that the
thermal denaturation exposes the protein core to deuterium exchange.
<p>
A plot of the ratio of the intensites of 1618 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>
and 1650 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>
(<i>I</i><sub>1618</sub>:<i>I</i><sub>1650</sub>)
against the temperature reveals very well the thermal unfolding point.
The plots for apo-hTH1 show a lower midpoint denaturation temperature
(<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>) than for iron-plus-dopamine bound hTH1.
Phosphorylation of apo-hTH1 does not change thermal stability.
Iron binding to phosphorylated apo-hTH1 improved its resistance to
denaturation.  Phosphorylated Fe(II)-hTH1 shows a slight increase
in stability over unphosphorylated form.
<p>
A large excess (50:1) of dopamine to nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated
Fe(II)-hTH1 was tested for its thermal stability, compared to the stability
of dopamine present in equimolar amounts with holozenzyme.  Phosphorylated
holoenzyme showed similar denaturation properties as the phophorylated
apoprotein.  The large excess of free dopamine binds to both free and
enzyme-bound iron, and can extract the iron from phosphorylated protein.
<p>
Apo-hTH1 was incubated 20 min at 25&deg; with trypsin, and showed a
maximal activation of 40% when trypsin:hTH1 was 0.005:1 (&mu;g/&mu;g).
SDS-PAGE reveals that trypsinolysis of the nonphosphorylated apo-hTH1
produces a 47 kDa fragment, a result also seen with dopamine-bound
enzyme, whether or not it was phosphorylated.  When higher amounts of
trypsin (trypsin:protein 0.1:1) were present, the 47 kDa fragment was
digested further.  Reconstituting the enzyme with Fe(II) of both
nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated apo-hTH1 increases the resistance
of TH to proteolysis.  The phospho form of the holoenzyme was more
resistant than the nonphospho form, and this agrees with thermal
denaturation studies.  Addition of dopamine further stabilized the
nonphosphorylated form, with no effect seen when equimolar amounts were
present in the phosphorylated form.

Regulation of Tyrosine Hydroxylase mRNA Stability by Oxygen in PC12 Cells

Mammals have type I glomus cells within the carotid body which
are sensitive to tensions of oxygen in the bloodstream.  The most minor

TyrH activity is stimulated, and gene expression (TyrH mRNA) is upregulated

Characterization of The Active Site Iron in Tyrosine Hydroxylase:
Redox States of Iron
<p class="Para1">
TH was expressed as a recombinant in <i>E. coli</i> and purified.
Pure enzyme was treated with 2.0 M HNO<sub>3</sub> to release iron
which was evaluated with graphite furnace AAS.  There were 0.5-0.65 Fe
atoms per monomer.  An absorption spectrum in the visible range revealed
no peaks, but rather a broad increasing absorption into the blue and
near UV; the enzyme has a greenish tint.
<p>
2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) is a Fe(III) chelator.  In the presence
of DHN (0.4 &mu;M), TH (0.5 &mu;M) was excited with 324 nm light and the
emission spectrum read from 330-425 nm.  The effect of DHN was to quench
fluorescence in the blue region.  The enzyme was incubated also with
bathophenanthroline, a chelator specific for Fe(II), and its emission
spectrum showed no quenching of any kind at all wavelengths.
<p>
An EPR spectrum at 5 K (9.43 GHz in 2530 G field, width=5000 G, 0.2 mW
power, 25 G modulation amplitude, gain 100,000, with 167 sec scan time,
0.3 s time constant) was done with a major derivative showing
<i>g</i>= 4.2.  The spectrum of enzyme shows key features at 1500 and
3300 G, which disappear with dithionite treatment, and which are
restored after 13.5 h exposed to air on ice.  The pre-reduction
spectrum indicates high spin Fe(III) with <i>S</i> = 5/2, and supports
the chelator-fluorescence quenching experiments.
<p>
Another EPR spectrum was taken, with addition of 0.56 mM 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>
(under argon) rather than dithionite, and the spectrum showed
loss of high-spin Fe(III) features to that of the ferrous state.
Dithionite is a one-electron reductant, while tetrahydropterins are
not.  Using HPLC and standards of 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> and oxidized
products, 6-methyl-7,8-dihydropterin and quinonoid 6-methyldihydropterin
(q6-MPH<sub>2</sub>), the rate of 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> consumption was
found to be 0.070&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.01&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
An equivalent rate of q6-MPH<sub>2</sub> formation was seen at
0.064&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.008&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
A small (&lt;2% of the q6-MPH<sub>2</sub>) amount of product was
6-methyl-7,8-dihydropterin, which is a tautomeric form of q6-MPH<sub>2</sub>.
The stoichiometric determination of 0.54 nmol pterin consumed
per nmol iron reduced indicates one-electron transfer reaction.
<p>
Enzyme was reduced anaerobically with 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> and then
treated with tyrosine while exposed to oxygen.  An EPR spectrum
before tyrosine/oxygen showed loss of signals consistent with
iron reduction.  A sample was then frozen after exposure to tyrosine/oxygen
and a spectrum obtained:  there was no change in spectrum (no
oxidation).  Warming to 4&deg; for 15 min, sample was again frozen
and the spectrum obtained.  The spectrum was entirely different
however.  It revealed a ferric species, showing 50% oxidation of
the material.
<p>
Catechols form interesting paramagnetic complexes with TH, and so
the spectrum seen with slow oxidation of TH in tyrosine/oxygen
may have been DOPA-bound TH.  DOPA was then added to purified
enzyme and a spectrum obtained:  it showed features identical
to ferrous TH incubated with tyrosine/oxygen, indicating that
the spectrum was a DOPA-bound ferric TH complex.
<p>
A coupled assay was designed such that TH could make use of
catalytic amounts of tetrahydropterin with the availability of
dihydropterin reductase and NADH to reduce dihydropterin formed.
This permits monitoring at 340 nm.  Phenyalanine was the substrate,
since DOPA formation inhibits TH.  When 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> oxidation
was at a steady state, either a Fe(II) or Fe(III) chelator or water
was added.  The chelators were bathophenanthroline and DHN, resp.
Addition of Fe(II) chelator caused an immediate decrease in the rate
of about 30%, showing competitive inhibition.  Addition of
Fe(III) chelator showed little initial inhibition, but the rate
decreased continuously until after 150 s, inhibition was complete.

Characterization of Chimeric Pterin-Dependent Hydroxylases:
Contributions of the Regulatory Domains of Tyrosine and Phenylalanine
Hydroxylase to Substrate Specificity
<p class="Para1">
Several different recombinant protein forms of TyrH and PheH were constructed
on plasmids and expressed in bacteria.  Complete rat TyrH and PheH
were constructed as controls.  nP-TYH was constructed as a chimeric
of the regulatory portion of PheH (first 122 amino acids) and the
catalytic domain of TyrH, while nT-PheH is the regulatory domain of
TyrH fused to the catalytic domain of PheH. &Delta;155TYH and
&Delta;117PheH are essentially all but the last COOH end residues of
the regulatory domains cut out of TyrH and PheH, resp.  The sequence
VPWFPR is conserved in the hydroxylases and is considered to start
the catalytic domains (in TyrH, the starting valine is at 164, while
it is at 118 in PheH).
<p>
The recombinants were purified from extracts and total protein yield
and specific activities are respectable.  Expression was done using
the pET system in strain BL21(DE3).  Large losses of protein were
found in recombinants expressing the R domain of PheH (wtPheH and nP-TYH),
although recovery was increased only a little by growing at a lower
temperature.  These two proteins were also the least stable, losing
activity particularly with freeze-thaw cycles.  In contrast the R domain
of wtTH and nT-PheH made proteins easy to overexpress with pET, and
there was good stability in storage and freeze-thawing.
<p>
The N-terminal domain is known to be heparin binding, and wtTH and
nT-PheH were able to bind and be purified on heparin-Sepharose.
<p>
The R domain-deletion forms, &Delta;155TYH and &Delta;117PheH, are
composed of largely homologous C domains, and so it is thought that
their chemistry (chromatography) should be similar.  This was not
the case however, and this indicates that TyrH and PheH may be distinctly
different.  Purity of all preps was well above 90%, typical for
recombinant expressions.
<p>
Previous work shows that wtPheH shows nonlinear rates and sigmoidal
kinetics unless first activated with substrate (Phe).  All six
forms were incubated in 1 mM Phe at 25&deg;, and then assays done using
BH<sub>4</sub> and 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>.  Only wtPheH was found to undergo
signficant (11-fold) activation, and only when BH<sub>4</sub> was the
cofactor.  When not activated, wtPheH had the same <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> as for BH<sub>4</sub>.
<p>
Kinetic parameters were tested with 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> as cofactor (to
obviate need for preincubation).  All <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values for
the cofactor were similar (in the range 10-30 &mu;M).  6-MPH<sub>4</sub>
was kept saturating (8 &times; <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) while amino acids
were varied.  Initial rates determined, and with Phe as substrate, Tyr
product was followed by OD275 nm.  The rate of 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> oxidation
was also followed using dihydropterin reductase. When Tyr was the substrate,
DOPA was determined directly along with the coupled assay to follow
6-MPH<sub>4</sub> oxidation.  The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values were
highest for wtPheH and &Delta;117PheH, lowest for &Delta;155TYH.
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values were highest for the product tyrosine
for the C domain of PheH.  Rates of 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> oxidation were
several fold greater than tyrosine formation, indicating an uncoupling
process.  However, among all 6 forms, <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>
oxidation fell within a 4-fold range; they were highest for TyrH
and C domain of PheH, while nP-TYH and &Delta;155TYH had lower values.
As for coupling ratios (mol oxidation cofactor per mol hydroxylated
substrate), they were 1 for proteins containing C domain of PheH, while
proteins with C domain of TyrH show a high uncoupling between oxidation
and hydroxylation.  Determination of parameters using Tyr as a substrate
was difficult for wtPheH, since it does not prefer it as a substrate.
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values for other proteins ranged from 4 to 80 &mu;M, and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>
values for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> were highest for enzymes with TyrH
catalytic domain.

Neuropeptide Y Inhibits Chromaffin Cell Nicotinic Receptor-Stimulated
Tyrosine Hydroxylase Activity through a Receptor-Linked
G Protein-Mediated Process
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>.
Acetylcholine stimulation of bovine chromaffin cells results in
increased norepinephrine and epinephrine secretion accompanied
by a corresponding increase in synthesis. The addition of
neuropeptide Y (NPY) to the culture medium prevents the increase
in catecholamine synthesis but not secretion. Treatment
of chromaffin cells with nicotine produces a concentrationdependent
increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.2
mM) that is reduced if NPY is present during stimulation. Tyrosine
hydroxylase activity decreases in a concentration-dependent
fashion if increasing amounts of NPY are included in
the culture medium, IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.2 nM. Treatment with pertussis
toxin completely prevents the effect of NPY. The rank order of
potency for inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity is NPY $
[Leu<sup>31</sup>,Pro<sup>34</sup>]NPY &ge; peptide YY &gt;
NPY2-36 &gt; NPY13-36 &gt; NPY18-36 &ge; NPY26-36 &gt;&gt; NPY1-30,
suggesting a NPY-Y1
receptor subtype. Examination of the effect of NPY on nicotine
stimulation of chromaffin cell protein phosphorylation
showed that NPY produces a concentration-dependent decrease
in a 60-kDa protein, IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.4 nM. The effect of NPY
is pertussis toxin-sensitive. The rank order of potency is
[Leu31,Pro34]NPY &ge; NPY &gt;&gt; NPY18-36. Immunoprecipitation
confirmed the identity of the 60-kDa protein as tyrosine hydroxylase.

Crystal structure of tyrosine hydroxylase at 2.3 A and its implications
for inherited neurodegenerative diseases
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract:</b> Tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOH) catalyzes the
conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA, the rate-limiting step in
the biosynthesis of the catecholamines dopamine, adrenaline, and
noradrenaline. TyrOH is highly homologous in terms of both protein
sequence and catalytic mechanism to phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheOH) and
tryptophan hydroxylase (TrpOH). The crystal structure of the catalytic and
tetramerization domains of TyrOH reveals a novel alpha-helical basket
holding the catalytic iron and a 40 A long anti-parallel coiled coil which
forms the core of the tetramer. The catalytic iron is located 10 A below
the enzyme surface in a 17 A deep active site pocket and is coordinated by
the conserved residues His 331, His 336 and Glu 376. The structure
provides a rationale for the effect of point mutations in TyrOH that cause
L-DOPA responsive parkinsonism and Segawa's syndrome. The location of 112
different point mutations in PheOH that lead to phenylketonuria (PKU) are
predicted based on the TyrOH structure.

Sodium Nitroprusside Inhibits the Tyrosine Hydroxylase Activity
of the Median Eminence in the Rat
<p class="Para1">
Sprague-Dawley adult male rats with 23-gauge stainelss steel guide cannulae
implanted in the third ventricle were treated with injections of
1, 5, or 10 &mu;g sodium nitroprusside [SNP] (in 2 &mu;l saline; prepared
as solution before use, and protected from light exposure).  After
15 or 30 min, animals were decapitated, brains removed quickly
and median eminences dissected, stored at &minus;70&deg; until TyrH
activity could be determined.  Homogenization of tissue was by
sonication (100 W, 10 s) in 0.25 M sucrose, and TyrH activity was measured
by HPLC using aperometric detection.  Serum prolactin of trunk blood
was also measured by an EIA (Milenia Rat Prolactin, DPC, LA Calif).
<p>
After 15 min SNP was observed dose dependently to inhibit
TyrH activity signficantly at the 10 &mu;g level;  1 &mu;g
dose did not vary from the control, and the difference
between 5 &mu;g and control was not signif.
<p>
SNP did cause a dose-dependent elevation in prolactin:  the 1, 5, and 10

were seen at the 15 min post-i.c.v. injection.  By the time 30 min
passed, they returned to control levels.  This effect, understood
together with the published finding that injection of methylene blue,
a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, also reduces prolactin secretion, strongly
indicates the role of NO in prolactin secretion.

An iron-free unphosphorylated enzyme is made by the bacterial expression
system.  Bovine heart PK-A catalytic subunit (Sigma) and rat brain
CaM-PKII (from J. A. Girault) were protein kinases in phosphorylation

phosphorylated Ser-19 and Ser-40.  hTH-3 therefore possesses all the

Hypoxia-Mediated Regulation of Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Review</b>.  Three classes of genes are affected (induced) by
cellular hypoxia.  The first class involves increasing the capacity
for anaerobic metabolism:  glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters (GLUT),
and transcriptional regulators such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)
and activator protein 1 (AP-1).  Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&kappa;B)
is also important.  The second class are factors that enhance tissue
oxygenation and vascularization, such as vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF, a/k/a vascular permeability factor).  The third class
involves enzymes that restore oxygen-carrying capacity, such as
erythropoietin (Epo), and also tyrosine hydroxylase, stimulating
catecholamine synthesis.
<p>
Typically when cellular hypoxia occurs, electron transport carriers
fill up in a reduced state (no available oxygen acceptor), and often
any oxygen-like acceptor is a substitute.  This usually involves an
increase in reactive oxygen intermediates (superoxides and peroxides).
Such free radicals and changes in redox state directly activate
nuclear transcription factors HIF-1, AP-1, and NF-&kappa;B.  These
enhance expression of hypoxia-related genes.  Whether increasing
mitochondrial superoxide levels affect this transcription is doubtful
since cyanide or azide show no effect on hypoxia-related genes.
Carbon monoxide and the iron chelator desferrioxamine also block
hypoxia-induced expression.  The current hypothesis is that a
heme-containing protein is the oxygen sensor.
<p>
HIF-1 is an &alpha;&beta; heterodimer, with 120 kDa alpha subunit and
94 kDa beta subunit.  A basic helix-loop-helix represents the DNA-binding
domain, the consensus being 5'-TACGTGGCT-3'.  There is a Per and Sime
(PAS) protein-protein interaction domain.  The half-life of DNA association
and dissociation is &lt; 1 min (very rapid);  binding appears mediate
by protein phosphorylation since the kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine can
inhibit binding.  Treatment with phosphatase also inhibits binding.
HIF-1 expression is tightly coupled to oxygen status:  this expression
is mainly of the &alpha; subunit, since the &beta; subunit is identical
to the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT), which is constitutively
expressed.  HIF-1 binds to the end of 3' end of an enhancer of the Epo
gene, activating its expression.  HIF-1 induces transcription of a
many hypoxia-sensitive genes such as glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters,
TyrH, and VEGF.   Many experiments show that HIF-1 is a global regulator
of hypoxia:  reporters under the control of HIF-1 are induced
by hypoxia in cells not producing Epo; hypoxia, CoCl<sub>2</sub>,
and desferrioxamine induce HIF-1 DNA-binding and gene transcription;
mutations in HIF-1 binding site eliminate hypoxia-inducible enhancer
activity in responsive gene reporter constructs; inhibitors of
transcription and protein synthesis (cycloheximide, actinomycin D,
and 2-aminopurine) block both HIF-1 and hypoxia-responsive gene
transcription.  Some glycolytic enzyme genes completely require HIF-1 &beta;
subunit expression (LDH A, phosphoglycerate kinase 1), whereas GLUT
and VEGF expression drop off only a little.
<p>
The AP-1 responsive cis element is generally involved in regulation of both 
cellular and viral genes affecting growth and differentiation. AP-1 is actually 
a complex of dimers of the c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogene products which bind a 
consensus GA(C/G)TCA sequence.  The Fos and Jun proteins bind through leucine 
zipper domains present on both, which can then interact with DNA.  Also required 
is the reduction of a Cys residue, and the redox state of the cell could 
therefore affect the action of this dimer as a transcription factor.  Within 
minutes, c-fos and c-jun transcription occur, the mRNA stable for up to 4 hours. 
Expression is a function of both transcription and message stabilization. 
Curiously, the c-jun promoter features an AP-1 binding site, which means that 
c-jun acts to enhance its own expression.  Simultaneous hypoxia and glucose 
deprivation causes superinduction of c-jun. Induction can be blocked by 
pre-incubating cells with reducing agents and with the PK-C activator PMA, 
indicating that redox state and PK-C regulate expression.  AP-1 is likely 
involved in upregulating genes involved in detoxifying products of oxidative 
metabolism (catalase, SOD, cytochromes, etc).
<p>
NF-&kappa;B is a DNA-binding heterodimer of p50 and p65 subunits, these having 
structural homology with c-rel protooncogene.  It is normally complexed in an 
inactive state with I&kappa;B<sub>&alpha;</sub>, the complex cytoplasmically 
bound.   I&kappa;B gets phosphorylated and no longer binds NF-&kappa;B, which 
then translocates to the nucleus to bind &kappa;B sequences.  Hypoxia, 
especially prolonged, not only activates protein kinases that phosphorylated 
I&kappa;B, but also induces the degradation of I&kappa;B.  Phosphorylation of 
I&kappa;B is mediated first through Src activation leading to Ras activation, 
and then the signal to the I&kappa;B kinase.  Fos and Jun can interact with 
NF-&kappa;B p65 through the Rel homology domain.  The NF-&kappa;B and Fos/Jun 
complex can enhance both AP-1 and &kappa;B response elements.
<p>
Expression is affected not only by transcription but also by message stability. 
Half-lives of mRNA vary from several minutes (proto-oncogenes, cytokines) to 
days (globin).  The 5'-methyl-7-G cap and its binding proteins protects 
eukaryotic mRNAs against 5'-exonucleases, which poly(A)-binding proteins protect 
against 3'-exonucleases.  Regulation of message stability apparently involves 
reducing the poly(A) tail to 12 nt, which is followed by 5' decapping;  hence 
there is an interaction between 5' and 3' tails.  Most cis elements in the mRNA 
are in the 3' UTR, which contains protective protein binding sites that cover 
attack by endonucleases (action of endonucleases rapid leads to message 
degradation). An AU-rich element (ARE) may be present in several places in the 
3' UTR. These range from 50-150 nt in size, but are composed of 5 nts of AUUUA 
or contiguous AUUUA repeats, or of a 9-nt motif UUAUUUAUU. They may also be 
AU-rich stretches or U-rich without any apparent motif. The AUUUA motif 
facilitates mRNA body degradation, and U-rich sequences promotes de-adenylation 
and enhances the effect of AUUUA motifs. A dramatic increase in stabilization is 
achieved when ARE sequences are removed from the messages;  AREs were first 
demonstrated in the genes that regulate transcription, c-fos, c-myc and GM-CSF. 
Moreover inserting the c-fos ARE into the 3' UTR of the globin gene reduced its 
message half-life from 8 h to 30 min.  Proteins that bind to the AREs with very 
high affinity include hnRNP A1 and C, Hel-N1, and AUF1; it is not known how 
these proteins destabilize the messages.  The binding of these proteins 
regulated by redox state, phorbol esters, calcium ionophores, and transcription 
inhibitors.

<p>
Transferrin receptor genes contain 5 stem-loop structure in the 3' UTR
which are iron-responsive elements (IREs), binding to IRP-1 and IRP-2
when cellular iron is depleted.  This protects TRF mRNA from endonucleolytic
attack.  Lastly pyrimidine-rich cis elements in the 3' UTR provide stability
in globulin mRNAs for as long as 60 h.  A ribonucleoprotein complex
composed of an &alpha;-complex protein-1 and -2 which are both
poly(C)-binding, and then there is a nonpoly(C)-binding protein.
<p>
<i>Glucose transporters</i>.  When no oxygen is available to the cell,
it can make only 5% of the ATP it normally produces.  To compensate
it can call forth glucose transporters to increase uptake of available
glucose.   Five isoforms exist:  GLUT-1 is expressed at low levels and
widely distributed and is responsible for constitutive transport.
GLUT-4 is insulin-activated and primarily in muscle and fat cells.
In hypoxia, GLUT-1 and -3 are up-regulated, GLUT-4 is not affected,
and GLUT-2 down-regulated.  GLUT-5 is induced by HIF-1 mediated
transcriptional activation and by message stabilization.  L6 muscle
cells cultured in hypoxic conditions (3% oxygen for 48 h) increased
GLUT-1 expression 14-fold.  Note that the upregulation can be substituted
by cobalt and iron chelators, indicating a hemoprotein is the oxygen sensor.
GLUT-1 message stability increases from 30 min to 8 h half-life;
it contains a AUUUA motif and AU-rich sequences.
<p>
<i>Glycolytic enzymes</i>.  These genes are generally regulated
by HIF-1 in their promoters.  They include phosphoglycerate kinase 1
(PGK-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), LDH-A,
aldolase A, pyruvate kinase, and enolase 1.  Intervening sequences
of phosphofructokinase L in mice also have HIF-1 binding sites.
GADPH is induced 2- to 5-fold in hypoxic endothelial cells,
a result primarily by activated transcription.  Hypoxic induction
is mimicked by cobalt and iron chelators but not by cyanide, and
is blocked by cycloheximide.
<p>
<i>Vascular endothelial growth factor</i> (VEGF/VPF).  This is an
angiogenic cytokine mitogenic for endothelial cells.  Four isoforms
are expressed through alternative splicing (121, 165, 189, and 206 aa).
VEGF165 is the predominant form, existing as a 45 kDa glycosylated
homodimer binding to heparin;  it is 18-24% homologous to PDGF A and B
chains.  Tumors express VEGF at high levels in situ, their cell lines
high levels in vitro.  VEGF mRNA is increased in hypoxia, through
both upregulated transcription and message stability.  The promoter
contains an HIF-1, AP-1, AP-2, and a cluster of SP1 binding sites.
AP-1 factor binding has been shown to be redox-sensitive.  VEGF
expression is also favored by phorbol esters, calcium ionophores,
growth factors, and cAMP analogues in many cell types.  Human VEGF165
mRNA is a 3.7 kb transcript with 2.2 kb coding region and 1.5 kb 3' UTR.
Half-life increases 2- to 3-fold in hypoxia.  The 3' UTR contains
AREs whose deletions stabilizes the message; these AREs are multiple
AUUUA.  Polypyrimidine sequences are also present.  Induction of
expression can be mimicked by cobalt and iron chelators, blocked by
carbon monoxide and nitric oxide.  PKC is a factor in inducing expression.
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocks hypoxic induction of
VEGF mRNA by affecting Src and reducing message stabilization.
<p>
<i>Erythropoietin</i> (EPO).  This 30 kDa glycoprotein stimulates
proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in bone
marrow.  Two cell lines Hep3B and HepG2 have been studied for their
ability to produce Epo in an oxygen-regulated manner.  The promoter
region between -118 and -65 and an HIF-1 enhancer element in the 3'
flanking region control hypoxia-mediated influences.  The Epo
promoter attached to reporter shows 6-fold increase in hypoxia;
the 3' enhancer shows a 14-fold increase.  When promoter and
enhancer are combined, the increase is 50-fold.  Hepatic nuclear
factor-1 (HNF-1) can similarly enhance transcription of Epo.
Induction by hypoxia can be blocked with IL-1, TNF, and TGF&beta;,
and by PKC activators PMA and by calcium ionophore.
<p>
<i>Tyrosine Hydroxylase</i> (TyrH).  The type I cells of the carotid
body are central to the regulation of neurohormonal systems affecting
cardiovascular and respiratory function.  Reduced arterial oxygen
tension induces synthesis and release of dopamine.  After 6 h
levels of TyrH mRNA reach a peak as a result of enhanced transcription.
Increased message stability is also a factor, but the onset is slower
(longer than 12 h).  The TyrH gene between -272 and +27 relative to
transcription start site is essential.  Several elements (HIF-1,
AP-1, AP-2, CRE, MyoD, and SP1) are present in the promoter.
Mutations in the AP-1 site abolish this hypoxic induction;  nuclear
extracts of hypoxia-treated PC12 cells contain Fos/JunB heterodimers
able to bind to the AP-1 DNA oligo.  cAMP levels increase as well,
so there may be an effect of the CRE.   In PC12 cells TyrH mRNA stability
increases 3-fold (from 10 to 30 h) in hypoxia;  this appears to be
do to a 50 kDa hypoxia-inducible protein (HIP) binding a
pyrimidine-rich (U/C)(C/U>CCCU motif in the 3' UTR.  This element
is present in Epo and VEGF messages as well.

Effects of Phosphorylation of Serine 40 of Tyrosine Hydroxylase
on Binding of Catecholamines:  Evidence for a Novel Regulatory Mechanism
<p class="Para1">
BH<sub>4</sub> is the first substrate to bind TyrH in its catalytic
cycle (see Fitzpatrick, Biochemistry 30:3658, 1991;  Almas et al.,
Eur J Biochem 209:249, 1992).  Determination of the <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>
value of catecholamines (DOPA) as competitive inhibitors to BH<sub>4</sub>
is equivalent to determining the <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> for binding of
product to the ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) form of the enzyme.  End-point
assays are usually used to measure inhibition constants.
Iron is oxidized to the ferric state during the catalytic cycle, and
is reduced to the ferrous state by the cofactor.  Catechols trap the
ferric atom, and end-point methods can show artificially low rates of
catalysis.  Better initial rates are available when 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>
(cofactor) consumption is measured with a coupled assay involving
dihydropterin reductase.  To minimize DOPA (catechol) production,
Phe is used as a substrate.  Measured in this way, product vs. time
curves are linear for several minutes, but when DOPA is present, rates
are constant for only 10-20 seconds.  When this continuous assay is
used, Ki values are significantly different from previously reported
end-point methods.  For TyrH not treated with PK-A, Ki values of DOPA
are 60 and 33 &mu;M for DOPA and dopamine, resp., while for TyrH treated
with enzyme the Ki values are 37 and 44 &mu;M, for DOPA and dopamine,
resp.  Importantly, there are no changes in Ki upon phosphorylation.
<p>
Purified TyrH is typically ferric.  2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene is a catechol
which fluoresces, and when bound to ferric TyrH, its fluorescence is
completely quenched.  Fluorescence vs. time curves can be plotted to
measure the rate of quenching when DHN is added to different levels
of TyrH.  The curves show an exponential decrease in fluorescence typical
of a pseudo-first order reaction for the non-phosphorylated enzyme.
Rate constants for the different nonphospho-TyrH levels can be determined
and these plotted against TyrH concentration (<i>k</i><sub>obs</sub> vs.
[tyrosine hydroxylase]).  The plot falls along a straight line.
The slope of the rate constants against phosphoTH levels compared to
k vs. nonphosphoTH levels is significantly higher, meaning that quenching
is faster with the phosphoTH, and that DHN binds faster.
<p>
Dissociation rates can be determined either by evaluating the intercept
of the k vs. [TyrH] plots, although this method is inaccurate.  Better
is to add DHN in substoichiometric amounts to the ferric enzyme,
then add an overwhelming excess of another catechol (DOPA) so that
dissociated DHN remains dissociated and can be measured as an increase
in fluorescence.  The increase did show simple first order kinetics
(<i>k</i> = 6.3 &times; 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup>).
The association rate constant determined from the quenching study
can then be used to determine the equilibrium constant of DHN dissociation
from nonphosphoTH, <i>K</i> = 13.5 nM; for the phosphoTH form,
<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 17.5 nM.
<p>
A broad absorbance band is seen at about 700 nm because of charge transfer
between catechol and Fe<sup>3+</sup>.  Changes in absorbance at 690 nm
vs. time can be followed at different levels of enzyme to show binding
of enzyme with catechol.  From each plot, a rate constant is determined,
and the plot of rate constants against enzyme for different forms can
used to obtain association data and equilibrium constants.  These
data are comparable to the DHN fluorescence quenching and increase
data.
<p>
Alternative approaches also include measuring the absorbance spectrum
of DHN-TyrH binding, with a &lambda;<sub>max</sub> = 550 nm instead
of 690 nm.  DHN binds strongly to both phospho and nonphospho TyrH forms,
at 15 nM, and is therefore useful in looking at DOPA or dopamine dissocation.
<p>
Another approach is the use of tritiated (radiolabeled) DOPA or dopamine,
using unlabeled ligand as the displacer;  aliquots can be filtered to
recover radiolabeled ligand-bound enzyme.  For what experiments that
did work (sometimes dissociation/association is too rapid), all results
for dissociation and association rates were comparable.

Inactivation of tyrosine hydroxylase by nitration following exposure
to peroxynitrite and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
<p class="Para1">
Peroxynitrite (PON) is formed by reacting nitrite with hydrogen peroxide;
its &epsilon;<sub>302 nm</sub> = 1700 M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>
in 1.2 M NaOH.  Drops of PON can be added to suspensions of cultured PC12
cells without changing pH.  Cells are washed with Earle&#146;s balanced
salt solution, scraped off plates, spun at 800 &times; <i>g</i> for 5 min,
and solubilized in 20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol,
1% Triton X-100.  TH is immunopptd. from protein G-Sepharose pre-cleared
PC12 lysates (1 h, 4&deg;, 1 min at 10,000 rpm for the pre-clearing) using
a mAb incubated 12 h at 4&deg; (5 &mu;l of 1 mg/ml mAb per 0.5 ml lysate
dilution containing 1 mM PMSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 M
Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin).  Immune complexes
are ppted with 30 &mu;l 25% w/v protein G-Sepharose (mix by rotation
90 min, 4&deg;), spin and wash 3 &times; with lysis buffer.
<p>
The lysates were treated with different concentrations of PON and the
TH immunoprecipitated.  The immunopptd TH was run on SDS-PAGE and then
transferred to blot.  One blot reacted uniformly with anti-TH mAb on the
western (all bands staining identically), while another blot was
stained with anti-nitrotyrosine rabbit polyclonal.  The staining showed
a gradual increase that was related with the increasing dose of PON
to in vitro TH.  TH enzyme activity was also measured, and there was
a corresponding decrease in TH activity with increasing PON concentration:
0.125 mM PON showed 90% of activity relative to control (0 mM PON), while
2 mM PON treatment showed 10% relative to control (not mean values).
<p>
Several amino acid side chains can be modified by PON (Trp, Cys, Met).
The indole ring of Trp fluoresces (&lambda;<sub>exc</sub> = 325 nm,
&lambda;<sub>em</sub> = 410 nm) and with three Trp residues in
rat and human TH, any change in fluorescence would indicate modification:
up to 1 mM PON, there was no change in fluorescene.  Amino acid
analysis was done and showed no other modified residues.  Nitrotyrosine (NTyr)
was always found in TH treated with PON at 0.32 mol NTyr/mol TH, no matter
what the PON concentration;  this corresponds to nitration of a single
Tyr residue in a TH subunit.
<p>
PC12 cells were treated 60 min with different doses of MPTP<sub>+</sub>.
This treatment was analyzed using anti-NTyr antibodies on blots, and
this revealed that MPTP<sup>+</sup> nitrated TH as well.  PC12 cells
contain nitric oxide synthase neuronal form (nNOS) shown by Western blotting
and by presenced of nitrate and nitrite (nitric oxide metabolites).
Cells exposed 60 min to MPTP<sup>+</sup> are viable and can reduce
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to
formazan.  MTT reduction in control cells is A<sub>570</sub>=0.800 and
for cell treated with MPP<sup>+</sup> A<sub>570</sub>=0.979. Note that
MTT reduction requires NADH and therefore depends on pyridine nucleotide
availability and cell redox state.
<p>
Adult C57/bl mice were injected with either MPTP or saline vehicle
(four times in a day @ 2 h intervals; 20 mg/kg MPTP, 4-6 per group) for
time intervals of 0, 3 and 6 h postinjection.  Striata from right and left
side were dissected on ice, frozen immediately on dry ice and stored
until analysis.  From striatum and ventral midbrain, Tyr nitration was
evident by 3 h in the MPTP group.  Striatal lysates were run on 2D gels
then stained with anti-NTyr antibody.  Several proteins were stained,
but on with <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 58,000 and pI of 5.8 was spotted,
a protein that has properties of TH.  The same Western blotting procedure
extended confirmation in which anti-TH was reacted with striatal lysates
and then blot detected with anti-NTyr.
<p>
MPTP was injected into transgenic mice with an enhanced superoxide
dismutase (SOD1) activity.  This enzyme converts cytosolic superoxide to
hydrogen peroxide.  Examination of striatal lysates from these mice
shows no nitration of the TH, consistent with the finding that dopamine
deficit is not caused by MPTP treatment of these transgenic mice, but
does cause it in wild-type mice.  Dopamine levels of the striatum were
measured during these experiments, and the MPTP group had levels 20%
of the saline vehicle controls at both 3 and 6 hours after injection.
The loss in TH activity with MPTP treatment paralleled the reduction
in dopamine levels in the wild-type mice.  The loss of striatal TH
protein content was insignificant, meaning that TH activity loss was
due to inactivation of extant protein.

Mutation of Phenylalanine of Tyrosine 371 in Tyrosine Hydroxylase
Increases the Affinity for Phenylalanine
<p class="Para1">
The recombinant rat TyrH expressed in <i>E. coli</i> has been previously
reported, and here its Y371F mutant is produced using the pET expression
system.  15% of soluble protein in cell extracts was the recombinant.
6.6 mg pure enzyme (specific activity of 2.9 &mu;mol mg<sup>&minus;1</sup>
min<sup>&minus;1</sup>) could be recovered from 1 L culture for 50% yield.
55 mg pure wtTH per liter with spec. act. of 2.1 &mu;mol mg<sup>&minus;1</sup>
min<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  Since there is clearly no loss of activity,
and the specific activity is even greater, this shows that Tyr-371
is not essential to catalysis.
<p>
Steady state kinetic parameters were determined using tyrosine substrate
at saturating (500 &mu;M) levels of 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> cofactor
(with ferrous ammonium sulfate, DTT, catalase present).  <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine
was 65 and 71 &mu;M at pH 7.1 and 6.0, resp., for the mutant Y371F TyrH,
while <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine was 51 and 32 at pH 7.1 and 6.0 for the wild-type.
Cofactor <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values also did not change much with creation of the mutant,
and the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> and BH<sub>4</sub> (measured
only at pH 7.1) were nearly identical.  When Phe is used as a substrate
(measured in HEPES at pH 7.1), the mutant form is actually more reactive,
with a 10-fold lower <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value compared to wild-type (10 &mu;M vs.
109 &mu;M).
<p>
The level of uncoupling (hydroxylation of amino acid per mol
oxidized cofactor) was also measured using HPLC, and both the wild type
and mutant showed coupling of nearly equal to 1 mol DOPA formed per
mol 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> oxidized.  Phe as a substrate shows lower coupling,
in agreement with previous work;  the mutant is better at coupling,
with 1.3 mol 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> oxidized per mol product (the wild type
value is 1.9).
<p>
Use of substrates other than Tyr for wtTH often results in multiple
products, and so different substrates for the mutant were tested to
see its effect on regiospecificity.  With a Phe substrate, wt TyrH
produces 93% tyrosine and 7% 3-OH-Phe;  the mutant generates 94% tyrosine
and 6% 3-OH-Phe.  With 4-methyl-Phe, wt TyrH produces
30%&nbsp;4-HOCH<sub>2</sub>-Phe, 15%&nbsp;4-hydroxy-3-methyl-Phe,
and 55%&nbsp;3-hydroxy-4-methyl-Phe.  The mutant respectively produces
these as 28%, 17%, and 55%.  In other words, the mutant and
wild type are indistinguishable.
<p>
Tyr-371 has no effect on substrate binding:  the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values for the substrates
do not vary from the wild-type, and more importantly neither do the
<i>V</i>/<i>K</i> values.  The absence of a change in the coupling
factor also shows that it does affect or alter proximity of target
substrate to hydroxylating intermediate.  However, because the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
for Phe is 10-fold lower than the wild type, there is a suggestion
that conversion to Phe from Tyr provides a more hydrophobic environment
more amenable to a hydrophobic substrate.  While this residue therefore
does not mediate or involve itself in catalysis or transition state
stabiliziation or cofactor binding, it does provide minor selectivity
to substrate in the active site.

Role of nitric oxide in the regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
and tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in the male rat brain
<p class="Para1">
<b>Methods</b>. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (225-250 g) were castrated
and fitted with stainless steel cannula to the left lateral ventricle
of the brain.  After 5 days animals were given a 5 &mu;l injection of
200 mg/ml <i>N</i><sup>G</sup>-monomethyl-<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>-arginine
(NMMA) or 5 &mu;l of 0.2 mg/ml HP-228 four hours before sacrifice.
Controls are injected with saline, and there are sham-operated controls
too (not castrated).  Brains are fixed by vascular perfusion with
phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde.  10 &mu;m coronal sections are
obtained serial starting from medial preoptic area (MPOA) to anterior
hypothalamus.  In situ hybridization is done using <sup>35</sup>S-labeled
48-mer complementing the rat GnRH coding region (nt 102-149), with drying
then coating with Kodak NTB-2 photoemulsion.  Exposure was for 7 days.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  Autoradiograms were visualized by light microscopy.
The cells that were illuminated by the autoradiogram were also the same
cells positive for immunochemical staining with anti-GnRH.  Moreover
attempts to hybridize with a sense strand were negative.  GnRH mRNA
was detected in decreasing order from MPOA, anterior hypothalamus,
diagonal band of Broca, and ventral septal area.
<p>
For sham-castrated animals, the use of the two inhibitors of NO synthase,
NMMA and HP-228 caused a decrease of 18.8% and 19.9%, resp., of GnRH mRNA.
Castration increases GnRH mRNA by 28% after 5 days following the surgery.
<p>
TH mRNA was also probed for expression in arcuate nucleus, which was
found after 10 d exposure.  In sham-operated animals uUse of the NOS inhibitors showed and increase
number of grains in TH-positive neurons, and HP-228 treatment produced
a greater stimulation than did NMMA.
<p>
NMMA is a competitive inhibitor of NOS, while HP-228 prevents in vivo
induction of NOS by lipopolysaccharide.  Castration induces increases
in GnRH mRNA, an effect prevented by administration of estradiol or
dihydrotestosterone.  Injection of NMMA into the 3rd ventricle has
been shown to inhibit release of LH.  It has been shown in continuous
cell lines derived from the cells of hypothalamus that release and biosynthesis
GnRH is under the control of an NOS pathway.

Role of serine-19 phosphorylation in regulating tyrosine hydroxylase
studied with site- and phosphospecific antibodies and site-directed
mutagenesis
<p class="Abstract">
The effects of depolarization by elevated potassium concentrations
were studied in PC12 cells and in stably transfected AtT-20 cells
expressing wild-type or [Leu19]-recombinant tyrosine hydroxylase
(rTH). Changes in the phosphorylation states of Ser19 and Ser40
in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were determined immunochemically
using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated state of each
site and compared with changes in TH activity in PC12 cell lysates
and with changes in L-DOPA biosynthesis rates in intact AtT-20 cells.
Treatment of either PC12 cells or AtT-20 cells expressing wild-type
rTH with elevated potassium produced a transient increase in the
phosphorylation state of Ser19 (up to 0.7 mol of phosphate/mol of
subunit) in concert with a more gradual and sustained increase in
Ser40 phosphorylation. Elevated potassium treatment also increased
TH activity in PC12 cell lysates, but these increases paralleled
the temporal course of Ser40, as opposed to Ser19, phosphorylation.
Similarly, increases in DOPA accumulation produced by elevated
potassium in AtT-20 cells expressing wild-type rTH paralleled
the increases in the phosphorylation state of Ser40 but not Ser19.
Moreover, elevated potassium produced comparable increases in DOPA
accumulation in AtT-20 cells expressing rTH in which Ser19
phosphorylation had been eliminated (by substitution of Leu for
Ser19). Thus, depolarization-induced increases in the stoichiometry
of Ser19 phosphorylation do not appear to influence directly the
activity of TH in situ.

A Human Tyrosine Hydroxylase Isoform Associated with
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Shows Altered Enzymatic Activity
<p class="Para1">
An antiserum to exon 3 of hTH was produced and tested against
hTH&Delta;3 (deletion mutant exon 3) and hTH-1 (which makes a form
of TH that includes exon 3 but not exon 2).  Both these forms of TH
are expressed in <i>E. coli</i> by the PET-3a expression system.
The anti-hTH-exon3 antibody recognized hTH-1, and a control antibody to rTH
recognized both hTH-1 and the exon-3 deletion.
<p>
Total protein extracts from adrenal medullae of humans both normal and
those with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) were probed using
Western blots.  The polyclonal anti-rTH showed several bands.  The two
slowest migrating (largest) bands were hTH-3 and -4, and hTH-1 and -2.
50 and 55 kDa isoforms were also found, also found in extracts of
ST14A, a non-catecholaminergic cell line stably transfected with hTH-1
cDNA.  This indicates that the 50 and 55 kDa isoforms do not result
from alternative splicing.
<p>
The anti-rTH antibody also detected a novel protein with the same size
as hTH-&Delta;3 in the PSP adrenal medulla.  When the membrane is
stripped to remove bound antibody and the blot incubated with anti-exon3
antibody, there is no recognition.  This indicates that the protein
is hTH missing exon 3.
<p>
cDNAs that encode hTH-&Delta;3 and hTH-3 (a form containing exon 3) were
inserted into PGEX-2T, a system designed for expressing glutathione
<i>S</i>-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (see methods).
<p>
<b>Methods</b>.  hTH3 complete sequence was excised from PET3a using
<i>Nde</i>I-<i>Bam</i>HI digestion, and the fragment treated with Klenow
polymerase (to blunt it) and ligated to the <i>Sma</i>I site in PGEX-2T.
A similar fragment lacking exon 3 was made by use of two amplified sequences
of hTH exons 1 + 2 and 4 + 5 which are joined by PCR and this amplified
product used in replacement of the <i>Bam</i>HI-<i>Xho</i>I fragment of
PGEX-2T-HTH3.  The primers used were ccataat<b>ggatcc</b>ATGCCCACCCCCGACGCC
(hTH sequence with initiator codon starts with capital letters; bold is
<i>Bam</i>HI site) and GCTTCAAACGT-CTTGGGGTGGG (junction between exon 2
and 4, antisense), and CCACCCCAAG-ACGTTTGAAGC (junction exon 2 and 4, sense)
and CGGGTGGTCCAAGTCCAG (within exon 5).
<p>
GST-hTH fusion proteins are purified from extracts of IPTG-induced
<i>E coli</i> AX90 electrocompetent cells using GST-agarose beads
(AP Biotech).  Purity was tested on SDS-PAGE, and the GST-hTH and
GST-hTH&Delta;3 fusion both produced one band, the latter with a faster
<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> than the former.
<p>
Activity assays were done.  Product (pmol DOPA) vs. time plots were done
for different levels of enzyme.  All curves for both proteins showed
linearity even after 10 min at 25, 50, 75, and 100 ng protein
(further experiments used 50 ng for 5 min time), although the amount of
product for the deletion mutant formed was about 40-50% less than for
hTH-3 fusion protein.  Velocity vs. enzyme amount plots showed a
linear dependence for both fusion proteins, with the velocity of the deletion
mutant about 40% of the normal form.
<p>
A Lineweaver-Burk plot for the BH<sub>4</sub> subtrate revealed a biphasic
curve for both fusion proteins.  This is typical of an enzyme sensitive to
substrate inhibition.  The only difference in the curves was that the
initial velocity of the deletion mutant was always 40% of that of the
hTH-3 fusion.  <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of GST-hTH-3 and -HTH&Delta;3 were
1400 and 450 pmol DOPA/min/&mu;g enzyme, resp.  There was no significant
difference in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for BH<sub>4</sub> cofactor
(174 &mu;M for GST-hTH3 vs. 180 &mu;M for GST-hTH&Delta;3), nor in the
inhibition constant for BH<sub>4</sub> (4100 &mu;M for GST-hTH3 vs.
2800 &mu;M for GST-hTH&Delta;3).
<p>
GST-hTH3 and GST-hTH&Delta;3 activities were analyzed in the presence
of dopamine from 10-100 &mu;M.  GST-hTH3 could be more strongly inhibited:
50% reduced in 10 &mu;M dopamine while GST-hTH&Delta;3 was reduced by only
10%.  These inhibition assays were also performed at three different
levels of BH<sub>4</sub>.  The Dixon plot was used to estimate the
<i>K</i><sub>i</sub>, and was shown to increase from 1 to 10 &mu;M when
exon 3 was not included.
<p>
A heparin activation study was also done.  While there was no change
in the activity of the deletion mutant with increasing heparin, there
was a maximal 20% increase.

Site-Directed Mutants of Charged Residues in the Active Site of
Tyrosine Hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
<i>E. coli</i> cell strain C41(DE3) was used in preference to BL21(DE3)
for gene expression because longer periods of growth conditions produced
10 times the count  (A<sub>600</sub> of 6.0-7.0).  60 mg wild-type TyrH
per liter of culture is obtainable. R-316, E-326, E-332 and D-328
are conserved residues and were all replaced with Ala using site-directed
mutagenesis.  25% of total soluble protein is the recombinant, making
50% of the protein with rpaid ammonium sulfate precipitation.
<p>
Soluble protein was obtained for mutant E332A from cells grown at 18&deg;.
D328A expression was complicated by insolubility at every incubation
temperature and time.  D328S and D328N mutants produced a small amount
of soluble enzyme for cells grown at 12 or 15&deg;; a DEAE purification
step was necessary to obtain cleaner sample against a background of low
expression. R316A mutant also produced insoluble protein although
expression was good at 37&deg;.  R316S and R316Q mutants showed similar
results.  A conserved mutation R316K gave better results in producing
soluble protein, with cells grown at 22&deg;.
<p>
For each purified mutant protein, the rates of DOPA and BH<sub>2</sub>
formation were measured.  R316K mutant, although conserved, was nearly
inactive:  micromolar enzyme amounts were required to get measurable
rates of DOPA and dihydropterin formation.  DOPA was generally dependent
on [Tyr] all the way up to the point where tyrosine becomes insoluble
(near 3 mM);  this mutant showed no saturable kinetics with this substrate.
Interestingly the <i>K</i><sub>6-MPH<sub>4</sub></sub> value for R316K is
about 0.6 mM, slightly higher than the wild type, and DOPA formation is
reduced about one-third to the rate of cofactor oxidation.
<p>
While the <i>K</i><sub>tyr</sub> for E326A mutant is about the same as the wild
type, the <i>K</i><sub>6-MPH<sub>4</sub></sub> is about 2-fold higher.
There is a 9-fold drop-off in DOPA formation and a 4-fold decrease in
cofactor oxidation.  This mutant clearly contributes to pterin cofactor
binding  affecting both its ability to hold proximity to oxygen and
the iron center as well as bring the hydroxylated intermediate close
to the substrate.
<p>
The D328S has <i>K</i><sub>tyr</sub> 26 times higher than the wild-type
while <i>K</i><sub>6-MPH<sub>4</sub></sub> is actually slightly lower.
For both DOPA production and cofactor oxidation, <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values are reduced
by 13 and 8 times, resp.
<p>
E322A is a mutant with <i>K</i><sub>tyr</sub> similar to wild type and 10-fold
increased <i>K</i><sub>6-MPH<sub>4</sub></sub>.  DOPA formation <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> is
reduced 125-fold, and 5-fold for cofactor oxidation.
<p>
Crystal structures are now available for the catalytic domains of TyrH
and PheH, and the active sites of these enzymes are virtually structurally
identical.  Active sites are hydrophobic clefts framed by four helices
with an iron center at bottom.  Residues likely to be charged at pH 7.1 and
conserved in the active site include R-316, E-326, E-328, H-331, E-332,
H-336, and E-376.  H-331 and -336 and E-376 coordinate the iron center;
mutants of H-331 and -336 were inactive (an inactive E-376 mutant was
inferred based on these findings).
<p>
The E-316 mutant had the most dramatic effect on TyrH activity.  Most
substitutions were insoluble, and only conserved charge substitution
restored solubility but without activity.  The
<i>K</i><sub>6-MPH<sub>4</sub></sub> value is only apparent since
tyrosine could not be saturable.  The <i>V</i>/<i>K</i><sub>tyr</sub>
is 3700-fold lower than wild-type, and this could either be due to
an effect of the mutation on tyrosine binding or on its requirement
in the formation of a hydroxylating intermediate.  Since DOPA formation
and cofactor oxidation were determined independently, and the latter
was not seriously affected, it could be concluded that R-316 is quite
critical to target substrate binding:  the gaunidino group on the side
chain may interact strongly with the carboxylate of tyrosine.
Note that the guanidino nitrogens are 9.7 and 11.6 &Aring; from the
iron center, and it is predicted that a tyrosine molecule fits well
in the span that would bring the iron-oxo group to the ring and the
alpha-carboxyl group to R-316.
<p>
E-326 <i>K</i> values did not differ from the wild type significantly,
and so it is probably not essential for binding of either cofactor
or substrate.  A combined 3-fold reduction in V/K<sub>tyr</sub> and
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> for cofactor oxidation suggests it is important in formation
of hydroxyalting intermediate.  Instead of being key to electron
or protein transfer, it may be important to active site conformation.
<p>
Where D-328 mutants could be made soluble, the 26-fold increase in
K<sub>tyr</sub> indicates its importance in tyrosine binding.  It is
likely this group holds on to the amino moiety of tyrosine.

Iron Coordination Geometry in Full-Length, Truncated, and Dehydrated
Forms of Human Tyrosine Hydroxylase Studied by M&ouml;ssbauer and
X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy
<p class="Para1">
hTyrH1 recombinant was expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS <i>E. coli</i>,
along with His-tagged full length hTyrH1 and a truncated form lacking
the first 150 aa of the amino terminus (C domain form).  Mossbauer
spectra were taken on a conventional spectrometer in constant acceleration
mode.  Isomer shifts are relative to &alpha;-Fe at room temperature.
Spectra were measured in a bath cryostat (Oxford Instruments MD306),
analyzed with least-square fits using Lorentzian line shape.
X-ray absoprtion spectroscopy (XAS) was at a special facility;  study
was limited to near-edge region (i.e., pre-edge peak intensity, sensitive
to coordination symmetry of iron atom).  Pre-edge peak intensities
are extracted from measured spectra by subtracting a Lorentzian type
function plus first-order polynomial for fine adjustment from normalized
data.
<p>
His-tagged TH was produced as the fusion protein since it makes purification
trivial using a metal affinity column.  The details of affinity purification
and solved problems are given in the report here.  Purity is achieved
with one step, as shown by SDS gels.  (Caution:  His-tagging to produce
proteins with strong nickel affinity is complicated by a reaction that
can oligomerize proteins so tagged, causing them to become inactive
or lose function; tests need to be done to rule this out.)  After
purification, the His tag is removed by a proteolysis involving a
sensitive site inserted in a linker.
<p>
Kinetic data was obtained on all enzymes both before and after removal
of His tagging.  Iron(II) sulfate incubation increased activities 5-fold
(apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for iron is 5 &mu;M at pH 7 for all proteins); this
is consistent with the finding that purification processes deplete
the enzyme of iron.  Only 9% of enzymes retain iron at the end.  0.9
equivalents of <sup>57</sup>FeCl<sub>2</sub>.  Specific activities
were 718, 362, and 75 nmol min<sup>&minus;1</sup> min<sup>&minus;1</sup>
for His-tagged C domain TH, C domain TH with His tag removed,
and full-length His-tagged TH, resp.  These are about 65%, 33%, and
7% of full-length enzyme activity.
<p>
Previous reports show that iron in catalytic domain of rat TH is
coordinated by 5 ligands as determined by crystal structure,
while spectroscopy of the full-length human equivalent (hTH1) shows there
are 6-ligands.  The difference is said to be due to the existence
of sixth coordination site in the regulatory domain (first 150 or so
amino terminal residues) or that they provide the necessary folding
to produce the 6th ligand.  The N-terminal deletion hTH1 mutant here
now approximates the rat catalytic domain, and analysis of the iron
coordinate system should produce the expected 5 ligands.  The high
specific activity suggests that its metal binding site is not altered
though.
<p>
It was previously reported that hTH1 in the temperature range of
1.8-77 K give Mossbauer spectra which exhibit a quadrupole doublet
with isomer shift &delta;(1.8-77K) = 1.26-1.24&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>
and temperature-independent quadrupole splitting &Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q</sub>
= 2.68&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  96% of the spectrum corresponds to
ferrous high-spin iron, and 4% is nonspecifically bound iron.  Isomer
shifts of &gt;1.2&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup> is characteristic of 6-ligand
iron with only oxygen and/or nitrogen and no sulfur ligands.  This
means that Fe<sup>2+</sup> in native enzyme is coordinated to six
oxygen and/or nitrogen, in agreement with XAS data.
<p>
Enzyme lyophilization and rehydration does not significantly affect
hTH1 activity.  The enzyme was lyophilized and Mossbauer spectra obtained.
63% of absorption area was now in a new quadrupole doublet
(&delta;=1.07&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup> and &Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q</sub>=2.89 mm
s<sup>&minus;1</sup> at 77 K), and 28% of the iron showed an unaltered
isomer shift but slightly increased quadrupole splitting
(&delta;=1.24&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup> and &Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q</sub>=2.87 mm
s<sup>&minus;1</sup> at 77 K).  The isomer shift measures the charge
density &rho;(0) of <i>s</i>-electrons in the <sup>57</sup>Fe nucleus.
Shorter bond lengths in the 5-ligand system increase the density of <i>s</i>
electrons in the nucleus with respect to 6-ligand system, and reduce the
isomer shift.  Isomer shifts expected for high-spin Fe(II) with 5-ligands
of nitrogen or oxygen would be &lt;1.1&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup> in the
temp range 4.2 to 120 K.  The drop at 77 K from 1.24 to 1.07&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>
is interpreted as 6- to 5-ligand coordination in the transition from
a native to lyophilized state.  Proton NMR of hTH1 and PAH show a loss
of coordinating water in dehydration.  A reduced isomer shift could also
result from the presence of a covalent sulfur ligand, but replacement
of a histidine with cysteine ligand is unlikely.  Rehydration restores
the spectral characteristics to the native state;  enzyme activity is
recovered to 90%.  These data show that there is a very mobile water
molecule that coordinates with iron, something suggested in the crystal
structure analysis.
<p>
Truncated His-tagged hTH1 with its regulatory domain missing (first 150 amino acids
deleted) shows two major species at 120 K (39% and 45%) with
&delta;<sub>1</sub> = 1.23&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q1</sub> = 2.92&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&delta;<sub>2</sub> = 1.20&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q2</sub> = 2.24&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
The isomer shifts are characteristic of 6-coordinate high-spin Fe(II).
There are also two minor components (each ~8%),
&delta;<sub>3</sub> = 0.43&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q3</sub> = 1.73&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&delta;<sub>4</sub> = 0.50&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q4</sub> = 0.60&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
With dehydration, the isomer shift of the major components (1) and (2)
is decreased to 1.11&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>, characteristic
of 5-coordinate high-spin Fe(II).
<p>
There was some question as to whether the His tagging affected the
spectroscopy, and so truncated hTH1 without the tagging was also
checked.  Two major species (42% and 46%) with
&delta;<sub>1</sub> = 1.25&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q1</sub> = 2.58&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&delta;<sub>2</sub> = 1.28&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q2</sub> = 3.23&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
One minor component (11%) with
&delta;<sub>3</sub> = 0.46&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
&Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q1</sub> = 0.68&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>
is characteristic of high-spin Fe(III), and is probably nonspecific
iron, an impurity.  The spectrum of the dehydrated TH-N&Delta;150
had two components with decreased isomer shift, showing 5-ligand
high-spin Fe(II).  There is also an additional doublet (38% of
total area) with &delta; = 0.48&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>
and &Delta;<i>E</i><sub>Q</sub> = 0.75&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
and is characteristic of Fe(III).  Hence there is a large susceptibility
of truncated TH iron to oxidize.
<p>
Evaluation of line width in the Mossbauer spectra show values take
up to ~0.6&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and in the case of
subspectrum 2 of lyophilized His-tagged truncated hTH1, even
~0.7&nbsp;mm&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  These widths are larger than
reported for Fe(II) in myoglobin but smaller than studies of
the rat liver PAH.  Similar line widths were seen with hTH2 at 1.6 K
as for hTH1 at 77K.  These wider line widths are therefore due to
different conformational substates in the protein matrix.  These
line widths do not interfere with isomer shift changes observed with
dehydration and rehydration.
<p>
Near-edge region of normalized XAS spectra of full-length hTH1 in solution
and after dehydration are taken.  Pre-edge peak intensities provide
a quantitative estimate of the iron coordination.  The intensity
of 0.069 eV derived for hTH1 is consistent with 6-coordinate iron,
and of 0.091 eV in the dehydrated hTH1 for 5-coordinate.  Pre-edge
peak intensities of 5-coordinate high-spin Fe(II) model compounds
range from 0.08 to 0.13 eV.  The Mossbauer spectra showed that
one-third of remaining metal in dehydrated hTH1 is 6-coordinate
high-spin Fe(II), and this shows as an asymmetry in the pre-edge
peak as well as low intensity of 0.091 eV.   No XAS data for the
truncated TH is given because of the structural ambiguity resulting
from heterogeneity in the enzyme.  Oxidation of Fe(II)-hTH1 to
Fe(III)-hTH1 causes ligand bond lengths to decrease without alterations
in geometry as shown by XAS.  In this case the iron is more exposed
to solvent, and accepts monodentate ligands such as phenol and
bidentate ligands such as catechols.  The binding geometry is not
changed, and so it is assumed that mono- and bidentate ligands
displace solvent molecules coordinated about the iron.

Differential Regulation of Drosophila Tyrosine Hydroxylase
Isoforms by Dopamine Binding and cAMP-dependent Phosphorylation
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>.
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the first step in
dopamine biosynthesis in Drosophila as in vertebrates.
We have previously reported that tissue-specific alternative
splicing of the TH primary transcript generates
two distinct TH isoforms in Drosophila, DTH I and DTH
II (Birman, S., Morgan, B., Anzivino, M., and Hirsh, J.
(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26559-26567). Expression of
DTH I is restricted to the central nervous system,
whereas DTH II is expressed in non-nervous tissues like
the epidermis. The two enzymes present a single structural
difference; DTH II specifically contains a very
acidic segment of 71 amino acids inserted in the regulatory
domain. We show here that the enzymatic and regulatory
properties of vertebrate TH are generally conserved
in insect TH and that the isoform DTH II presents
unique characteristics. The two DTH isoforms were expressed
as apoenzymes in Escherichia coli and purified
by fast protein liquid chromatography. The recombinant
DTH isoforms are enzymatically active in the presence
of ferrous iron and a tetrahydropteridine co-substrate.
However, the two enzymes differ in many of their
properties. DTH II has a lower <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value for the cosubstrate
(6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin and requires a lower
level of ferrous ion than DTH I to be activated. The two
isoforms also have a different pH profile. As for mammalian
TH, enzymatic activity of the Drosophila enzymes
is decreased by dopamine binding, and this effect
is dependent on ferrous iron levels. However, DTH II
appears comparatively less sensitive than DTH I to dopamine
inhibition. The central nervous system isoform
DTH I is activated through phosphorylation by cAMPdependent
protein kinase (PKA) in the absence of dopamine.
In contrast, activation of DTH II by PKA is only
manifest in the presence of dopamine. Site-directed mutagenesis
of Ser32, a serine residue occurring in a PKA
site conserved in all known TH proteins, abolishes phosphorylation
of both isoforms and activation by PKA. We
propose that tissue-specific alternative splicing of TH
has a functional role for differential regulation of dopamine
biosynthesis in the nervous and non-nervous
tissues of insects.

Peroxynitrite inactivation of tyrosine hydroxylase:  Mediation by
sulfhydryl oxidation, not tyrosine nitration
<p class="Para1">
TH in these studies was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR and
fused to glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase (as done for Trp hydroxylase).
Recombinant was purified using glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography,
and thrombin used to cleave off the GST fusion portion (&gt;95% pure TH).
ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup> was made by quenched-flow method and
hydrogen peroxide removed from it by MnO<sub>2</sub> filtration.
This was added to TH with vigorous mixing for 15 min at 30&deg;
in phosphate pH 7.4 with 0.1 mM DTPA.  ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup> was
found to cause concentration-dependent inactivation of TH.  Relative
to 0 mM controls, 0.1 mM ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup> reduced activity by
50%, 0.5 mM ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup> by 75%, and 2.0 mM ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup>
by more than 95%.  The IC<sub>50</sub> was ~160 &mu;M and concentrations
&gt; 500 &mu;M inhibit &gt; 80%.  Order of addition was not a factor.
Inclusion of reducing agents (glutathione, Cys, DTT, Met, uric acid)
exerted a protection against the inactivation.  Inclusion of antioxidant
enzymes catalase, SOD, and DMSO (scavenges hydroxyl radical) did NOT
protect TH from ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup> inactivation.
<p>
TH nitrated by ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup> was reactive to commercial
anti-nitrotyrosine (NTyr) mAb, as shown by running the treated pure
TH on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A 60 kDa band is shown to be
increasingly stained up to 0.5 mM ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup> and the
immunoreactivity appears to drop off above this level.  There was
also a second band at 120 kDa.
The same blots were stripped and re-stained with a commercial
anti-TH mAb (illuminated by enhanced chemiluminescence with
goat anti-mouse HRP-conj. secondary).  Two bands at 60 and 120 kDa
appear as well in the immunoblot, showing them both to be TH.
Spectrophotometry indicated that 3.8 tyrosines were maximally nitrated
per TH monomer at a cumulative 2.5 mM concentration.  The 120 kDa
band is apparently a TH dimer formed by dityrosine cross-linking.
<p>
A dithionitrobenzene (DTNB) assay was used to measure the sulfhydryl
content of TH treated with increasing doses of ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup>.
The hyperbolic curve decrease in sulfhydryl content per monomer TH
paralleled the decrease in TH activity measured.  Untreated TH
was found to have 7 sulfhydryls per monomer in agreement with the known
number of Cys residues.  At 200 &mu;M ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup> (the
approximate IC<sub>50</sub>), sulfhydryl content drops 50%.
Note the correlation between drop in activity and sulfhydryl content
was <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.98 (<i>p</i> < 0.05).  Since neither
Na<sub>2</sub>AsO<sub>3</sub> nor NaBH<sub>4</sub> could reduce
the ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup>-treated TH, they had been oxidized beyond
sulfenic acid.
<p>
Tetranitromethane (TNM) is a powerful nitrating agent of tyrosine at
pH 8, and oxidizes sulfhydryls at pH 6 and 8.  TNM causes a
concentration-dependent loss of TH activity at either pH 6 or 8.
DTNB-reactive thiol groups were also lost with TNM reaction, and this
was independent of pH.  Both the loss of activity and sulfhydryl groups
were correlated highly to TNM concentration.  Western blot analysis
using anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies shows that nitration of tyrosine
in TH was highly concentration- and pH-dependent.  Little nitration
occurs at pH 6.0 (and only when using the highest concentration of 1 mM
TNM), but nitration is seen at 0.1 mM TNM at pH 8.0 (to the same level
as 1 mM at pH 6.0) and significant nitration occurs at 10-fold higher
at that pH.  There was no dityrosine formation at pH 8.
<p>
Is loss of TH activity the result of thiol modification or nitration
of tyrosine?  Bicarbonate will react with ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup> to
form ONOOCOO<sup>&minus;</sup>, which is an agent that is better at
nitration and less effective as a thiol oxidant.  With 10 mM
HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> incubated with TH in 0.5 mM
ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup>, the enzyme was protected from loss of
catalytic activity and of sulfhydryl oxidation
according to DTNB assay (activity was 41% of untreated control,
and sulfhydryl content was 57% of control),
but nitration of TH actually increased.  0.5 mM ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup>
alone results in TH activity 13% of control (sulfhydryl content is
18% of control).
The reagent PNU-101033 is able to block nitration of tyrosine without
affecting sulfhydryl oxidation:  when used at 100 &mu;M with
0.5 mM ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup>, there was no nitration, and sulfhydryl
content was 37% of control, while TH activity was 31% of control.
The results of the TNM, bicarbonate, and PNU-101033 experiments together
do not indicate an important role of tyrosine nitration in TH activity.
Hence any reductions in TH activity in vivo in dopaminergic neurons
may likely result from thiol modifications of oxidants formed in these
cells, and not of tyrosine nitration.

Positive Charge Intrinsic to Arg37-Arg38 Is Critical for Dopamine Inhibition
of The Catalytic Activity of Human Tyrosine Hydroxylase Type 1
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>.
Abstract Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which converts L-tyrosine
to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, is a rate-limiting enzyme in the
biosynthesis of catecholamines; its activity is regulated by the
feedback inhibition of the catecholamine products including
dopamine. To rationalize the significant role of the N-terminal
sequence Arg37-Arg38 of human TH type 1 (hTH1) in determining
the efficiency of feedback inhibition, we produced mutants of
which the positively charged Arg37-Arg38 site was replaced by
electrically neutral Gly and/or negatively charged Glu and
analyzed the degree of inhibition of these mutant enzymes by
dopamine. The replacement of Arg by Gly reduced the inhibitory
effect of dopamine on the catalytic activity measured in the basic
pH range and the replacement of Arg by Glu was enough to
abolish the inhibitory effect, although these mutations brought no
significant changes to the circular dichroism spectrum. The
prediction of the secondary structure of N-terminal residues 1^60
by computer software specified the location of the Arg37-Arg38
sequence in the turn intervening between the two K-helices
(residues 16^29 and residues 41^59). These results suggest that
the positive charge of the amino acid residues at positions 37 and
38 is one of the main factors that maintains the characteristic of
the turn and is responsible for the enzyme inhibition by
dopamine.

Effects of Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitor on Tyrosine
Hydroxylase mRNA in the Adrenal Medulla of Spontaneously Hypertensive
and Wistar Kyoto Rats
<p class="Para1">
15 wk old male rats, one strain spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and
the other used as control (WKY: Wistar Kyoto) were given either
100 mg/l L-NAME (NO synthase inhibitor) or 10 mg/l atropine sulfate over
a two week period.  Animals were sacrificed and tissues homogenized
to analyze for epinephrine and norepinephrine (50 mM perchloric acid
homogenization, extraction with alum, then analysis on HPLC with
electrochemical detection), TyrH activity (using Nagatsu et al method
for measuring DOPA: alum extraction and Amberlite CG-50 extraction followed
by HPLC-ECD), TyrH mRNA by Northern blot and dot-blot (using a TyrH cDNA
probe produced through RT-PCR, NO<sub>x</sub> (nitrate/nitrite using
autoanalyzer), and NOS (using tritiated arginine to measure its citrulline
product after sepping on DOWEX-50).
<p>
Adrenal tissue in L-NAME-treated WKY was lower than in untreated
(1097 nmol/g tissue vs. 1389 nmol/g).  In SHR animals there was
no difference in epinephrine levels between L-NAME-treated and controls
(2992 vs 3128 nmol/g), although it is clear that SHR were significantly
higher than WKY.  For norepinephrine, the findings were similar in
that its levels were lower in L-NAME-treated than controls (278 vs.
365 nmol/g) of WKY;  there was no difference in treated vs control SHR,
and norepi was much higher in SHR than WKY (2- to 3-fold).
<p>
As catecholamines were significantly lower in L-NAME-treated WKY than
controls, so TyrH activity was also lower [2.06 vs. 2.96 &mu;mol/(hr * g tissue].
TyrH activity did not differ in L-NAME vs control SHR [4.39 vs 4.48
&mu;mol/(hr * g)], and SHR TyrH activity was higher than in WKY.
<p>
Northern blots were illuminated for a band at 1.8 kb (TyrH mRNA).
From the blots it was clear that TyrH mRNA expression was higher
in SHR than WKY (&beta;-actin was used as a control to prove constant
loading).  A dot-blot was performed and the ratio of the TyrH mRNA
signal to &beta;-actin mRNA signal showed that SHR expression
was elevated in SHR compared to WKY.  L-NAME-treated WKY also
had significanly lower TyrH mRNA than control WKY.
<p>
NO<sub>x</sub> levels were also lower in L-NAME vs controls in WKY
(7.34 vs 9.90 mmol/g tissue).  As with other parameters, there was
no difference between treated and control SHR (6.87 vs 7.24 mmol/g).
And NO<sub>x</sub> levels were significantly lower in SHR than WKY.
<p>
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent NOS activity was found to be significantly
lower in control SHR than control WKY (13 vs 16 nmol/min/g tissue).
There was no detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent activity in
tissue of either rat strain.

Phenylalaline Residues in the Active Site of Tyrosine Hydroxylase:
Mutagenesis of Phe300 and Phe309 to Alanine and Metal Ion-Catalyzed
Hydroxylation of Phe300
<p class="Para1">
Three dimensional structures for TyrH bound to and free of the BH<sub>2</sub>
cofactor have been reported.  The active site is a 17 &Aring; deep cleft
in the center of an &alpha;-helical basket, formed by four helices and
with the iron center 10 &Aring; within the cleft and below the surface.
Several resides which form the active site are conserved, among them
are Phe300 and Phe309 on the active site margin and side chains directed
toward the iron atom.  With BH<sub>2</sub> bound to TyrH, unexpected
area of electron density was found on carbon-3 of the ring in Phe300,
something interpreted to be a hydroxyl group.  Purified TyrH has been
shown by mass spectrometry (Goodwill et al., <i>Biochemistry</i>
<b>37</b>: 13437, 1998) to have a mass 11-16 units greater than
would be predicted from the cDNA sequence.  This OH group is inside
hydrogen bonding distance of the carbonyl on the chain of Gln310, and
has been proposed as bringing the position of Phe300 for proper pterin
binding.
<p align="center">
<img src="./TH_Lit_Drawings/ActiveSite-rTH.gif"
alt="3D spatial representation of amino acids forming active site
of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase subunit">
<p>
Alanine mutants of Phe300 and Phe309 (F300A-TyrH and F309A-TyrH) were
constructed and transfected to BL21(DE3).  Expression of soluble
protein required growth of cells at lower temperature.  The enzymes
did bind to heparin-Sepharose and eluted at 0.35 M NaCl, similar to
wild type.  Steady-state kinetic parameters showed that identical
rates for wild-type and F300A-TyrH were found, but the pterin oxidation
was 3-fold higher than DOPA formation, indicating a greater degree
of uncoupling.  The <i>K</i><sub>tyr</sub> values were similar among
both mutants and wild-type, indicating that the mutants do not exert
affects on amino acid binding.  The <i>K</i><sub>6-MPH<sub>4</sub></sub>
value for F300A-TyrH is twice that of the wild-type but for F309A-TyrH
it was the same as wild type.  The <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values for both cofactor oxidation
and DOPA formation dropped off 2.5-fold for F300A-TyrH, while for F309A-TyrH,
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> for DOPA formation was 40% of wild-type but near 100% for cofactor
oxidation.
<p>
Purified catalytic domain and full-length protein were treated with
TPCK-treated trypsin for exhaustive digestion.  The expected peptide
containing Phe300 spans Asp299 to Arg307 (DFLASLAFK), and the peptides
separated by HPLC.  MALDI-TOF spectrometry was then used to determine
the mass of each separated peptide.  A peptide at 51.8 min was found
to have a molecular mass of 1039.55, close to the mass for the predicted
peptide (of 1039.56).  Peptide sequencing for 5 cycles gave Asp,
Phe, Leu, Ala, and Ser in yields of 29.0, 24.2, 15.7, 21.8, and 5.4
pmol.  Hydroxylation of Phe300, if it occurs, does not occur within
the bacterial expression system or under conditions in the laboratory.
Protein was therefore treated as for crystallization preparation, since
the electron dense group is seen in protein crystals.  Catalytic
subunit and full-length protein were treated with 4 mM ferrous iron,
4 mM 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH<sub>2</sub>) and 2.0 mM DTT for 48 h
at 4&deg; (crystallization conditions).  Activity fell 2-fold as a result
of the treatment.  Digestion with TPCK-trypsin was followed by separation
of peptides on HPLC.  In addition to the 51.8 min peptide previously seen,
a peptide at 50.6 min with MALDI-TOF mass of 1055.89 was found.  The expected
mass of a hydroxylated Phe-containin peptide is 1055.56.  Amino
acid sequencing of the 50.6 min peptide showed that at cycle 2, where
Phe is predicted, a peak eluted at time 16.0 min, which does not correspond
to any standard amino acid.  3-Hydroxyphenylalanine and 2-hydroxyphenylalanine
were added to the standards.  2-OH-Phe had an elution time of 16.0 min
compared to tyrosine of 12.1 min and Phe of 18.2 min, and 3-OH-Phe
had a time of 13.5 min.  Hence 2-OH-Phe is found in the catalytic subunit.
This could not be found with the full-length TyrH however (no peptide at
50.6 min).  Incubation of catalytic subunit with excess iron and DTT
alone was not sufficient to produce the change.
<p>
The conservation of Phe300 and Phe309 and their importance in pterin binding
is consistent with 3-D structures indicating that the pterin is involved
in &pi;-stacking interactions between aromatic rings.  Phe300 in this
work was hydroxylated at the 3-position.  It was supposed that the hydroxyl
made contact with Gln310, and that this brought Phe300 and the stacked
cofactor into proper orientation.  Curiously, there is no such hydroxylation
of Phe in PheH, accounting for different specificities.
<p>
The kinetic data showing F300A-TyrH shows losses in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of either cofactor
oxidation or hydroxylation of amino acid is consistent with the proposal
that the cofactor is not tightly held or constrained (no aromatic stacking)
and therefore not as well oriented.  Calculations show a reduced affinity
for BH<sub>4</sub> of 1 kcal/mol (based on V/K data), an interaction
strength between aromatic amino acids and pyrimidines reported by others.
Nonetheless since E332A  and E286A mutations cause a much greater dropoff
in activity and altered substrate and cofactor binding, the contribution
of Phe300 and Phe309 may be more in providing the architecture of the
active site.  Curiously, no single base mutation at Phe that could result
in amino acid changes such as Cys, Ser, Tyr, or Leu have been found,
all of which might reasonably substitute and provide needed structure
and/or function.

Intersubunit Binding Domains Within Tyrosine Hydroxylase and
Tryptophan Hydroxylase
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>.
Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme
in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin
(5-HT) belongs to the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase
superfamily, which includes phenylalanine hydroxylase
(PAH) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The crystal structures
for both PAH and TH have been reported, but a
crystallographic model of TPH remains elusive. For this
reason, we have utilized the information presented in the
TH crystal structure in combination with primary sequence
alignments to design point mutations in potential
structural domains of the TPH protein. Mutation of a TH
salt bridge (K170E) was sufficient to alter enzyme macromolecular
assembly. We found that the disruption of
the cognate intersubunit dimerization salt bridge (K111-
E223) in TPH, however, did not affect the macromolecular
assembly of TPH. Enzyme peaks representing only
tetramers were observed with size exclusion chromatography.
By contrast, a single-point mutation within the
tetramerization domain of TPH (L435A) was sufficient to
disrupt the normal homotetrameric assembly of TPH.
These studies indicate that, although the proposed salt
bridge dimerization interface of TH is conserved in TPH,
this hypothetical TPH intersubunit binding domain,
K111-E223, is not required for the proper macromolecular
assembly of the protein. However, leucine 435 within
the tetramerization domain is necessary for the proper
macromolecular assembly of TPH.

Effects of Phosphorylation on Binding of Catecholamines to
Tyrosine Hydroxylase:  Specificity and Thermodynamics
<p class="Para1">
Most studies on the interaction of phosphorylated TyrH with catecholamines
have studied on DOPA and dopamine, which have different rates of
binding and effects of phosphorylation. Recombinant rat TyrH was expressed
in E coli and purified, and its iron center restored.  A portion
of this enzyme was then stoichiometrically phosphorylated (at Ser40)
using PK-A, which was purified using a Q-Sepharose column.  Activity
was determined using a tritium release assay.  Protein was determined
using OD280 (1% = 10.4) and the iron content was also analyzed using
a Perkin-Elmer 2380 AAS with graphite furnace.  UV/light spectra
were also determined with HP 8452A diode array spectrophotometer.
<p>
Catecholamines binding to ferric atom of TyrH form a complex with
a broad absorbance band at 700 nm and extinction of 2 mM<sup>&minus;1</sup>
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  Hence the &Delta;690 nm per unit time can be
used to find rates of formation of complex.  These are first-order rates.
At different levels of catechol, the rates will differ.  The plotted
<i>k</i><sub>obs</sub> vs. [catechol] is straight line with positive slope.
Second-order rate constants for catecholamine binding to TyrH can be
determined from the slope values.
<p>
These experiments measure association rates only.  Dissociation rates
could be assessed from the y-intercept of association plots, but
the precision is low and confidence not good.  Better is to measure
dissociation experimentally.  The binary complex whose dissociation is
to be measured is incubated with enzyme such that the ligand level
is 100 &times; <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>, and then 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene
is added to 1 mM;  it is used because of its very high affinity
(<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 15 nM) and because its complex absorbs
at 550 nm, this is used to monitor the dissociation.  The table below
shows the results:

  Dual Influence of Nitric Oxide on Gene Regulation During Hypoxia
<p class="Para1">
PC12 cells, cultured in DMEM + 10% horse serum + 5% FCS in 10% carbon
dioxide atmosphere and grown to 70% confluence, were placed in
0.5% FCS for 18 h and then treated to hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen).
In some experiments, spermine nitric oxide (SNO) was added at 30, 100,
300, and 600 &micro;M for 30 min before the atmosphere change to
1% O<sub>2</sub> for 6 h.  Northern blot assays were done using
probes for TyrH, <i>c-fos</i>, and &beta;-actin.  A reporter system
using ChAT with TyrH promoter and Luc with <i>c-fos</i> promoter was
available and transient transfections also included &beta;-galactosidase
with a constitutive promoter to monitor transfection efficiency.
Transcription factor binding of AP-1 and HIF was monitored by
electrophoretic mobility shift using 5'-GCTGAGGGTGATTCAGAGG-3' and
5'-CAGCCAGCCCCTGCCCTACGTCGTGCCTCGGC-3' representing the AP-1 and HIF
sequence portions of the TyrH promoter, resp.  Mutant forms were used as
well within the consensus sequence:  the AP-1 sequence GATTC was changed
to TATTG, and the HIF seq CGTCGTGCC was changed to CGTAAAGCC.
<p>
Results show that hypoxia stimulated a 5-fold increase in <i>c-fos</i>
mRNA.  Addition of SNO magnified the hypoxic response (15-fold to
control in 600 &micro;M SNO).  The reporter gene assay showed a 2.5-fold
increase with hypoxia alone, 9-fold when combined with the SNO treatment.
Hence the mRNA level increase appears to be in part due to de novo
transcription rather than improved mRNA stability.
<p>
The hypoxic treatment also stimulates by 3.5-fold TyrH mRNA levels.
In contrast to the <i>c-fos</i> synergism, SNO treatment has a negative
effect on TyrH mRNA levels:  hypoxia + SNO results in only a 1.5-fold
increase in TyrH mRNA.  Transfection studies show a 4.5-fold increase in
ChAT activity under the TyrH promoter with hypoxia, and only 2-fold
with hypoxia and SNO.
<p>
Nuclear extracts from treated cells were mixed with labeled oligos
and then run on gels to assess mobility shifts.  Hypoxia increased
oligo to AP-1 binding, but inclusion of SNO blocked formation of complex.
TyrH also has a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) located in its promoter
and the gel assay shows an increased oligo to HIF-1 binding, while
inclusion of SNO abolished the appearance of the complex.

Bond Cleavage and Tyrosine Hydroxylation
<p class="Para1">
Ser395 and Ser396 are conserved in the TyrH active site, and alanine
substitution serves to define their roles in catalysis.  Because
Ser&rarr;Ala substitution is considered conservative, there should be
no significant structural changes that depend strictly on steric
interactions.  CD spectra would reveal major changes in secondary
structure, and CD spectra for both S395A and S396A mutants were similar
to the spectrum for wild type.
<p>
Hydrogen bonding occurs between His331 and Ser395, and disruption
this could alter iron binding.  0.3-0.6 Fe/subunit is found in
purified wild-type, with addition of ferrous ammonium sulfate restoring
it to 0.8-1.0.  This iron salt was added to wild-type and both mutants
and then iron measured by AAS;  the stoichiometries of 0.85, 0.90, and
0.92 for S395A, S396A, and wild-type.
<p>
EPR spectroscopy was used to examine mutants for changes in the iron 
environment.  Ferrous atom has no signal in EPR, but ferric enzyme does at 
liquid helium temptatures and with <i>g</i> between 10 and 2 consistent with an 
<i>S</i> = 5/2 system.  The EPR specta were indistinguishable, so iron is not 
perturbed by mutation.
<p>
Another means to measure changes is a charge-transfer complex that is
formed when catecholamines interact, and a broad band at 700 nm emerges.
However, addition of dopamine to enzyme showed nothing on spectra of mutants
that varied from wild-type.
<p>
Kinetic data show that specific activity of S396A did not differ from
wild-type, but that S395A was 70-fold lower.  The S395T mutant, which
should be very conservative, showed only a 3-fold drop-off in DOPA
formation.  In addition to DOPA formation, cofactor oxidation rates
were determined.  <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values for tyrosine, BH<sub>4</sub>,
and 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>, and Vmax values for both mutants were nearly
identical to wild-type.  Because S395A therefore shows poor coupling,
its function is not in the formation of hydroxylating intermediate,
but probably in substrate binding.  Note that the assay to determine
pterin oxidation is a coupled assay which monitors the decrease in
OD<sub>340</sub> as the quinoid BH<sub>2</sub> is reduced back to
BH<sub>4</sub>.  Oxidation of cofactor can proceed to the quinoid
BH<sub>2</sub> or first to a hydroxypterin, which dehydrates to
quinoid BH<sub>2</sub>.  This cannot be distinguished spectrophotometrically
during continuous assay, so a stopped reaction must be used.
20 second after start of the reaction, an aliquot is separated on
HPLC column with detection at 246 and 300 nm, and each peak then
analyzed spectrally on a diode array detector in column.  Only two
products were found using this method, 4&alpha;-hydroxypterin and the
quinoid BH<sub>2</sub>.  Quantitative determinations are not possible
for 4&alpha;-hydroxypterin on HPLC because it rapidly dehydrates.
However the hydroxypterin has a distinctive spectrum from quinoid
BH<sub>2</sub>, with an absorption maximum at 246 nm.  TyrH mutant
and wild-type (at 10 &micro;M, high to prevent cofactor auto-oxidation)
was mixed with 100 &micro;M 6-MPH<sub>4</sub> at pH 8 (to slow the
rate of dehydration of hydroxypterin to quinoid BH<sub>2</sub> and
a spectrum scanned at various time points.  The increase in a peak
at 246 nm is quite evident.  The SPECFIT program can be used to
plot the extinction coefficient spectrum of individual components
within a mixture, being able to analyze the changes over time
in scanned spectra.  The calculated spectra can be compared to
experimentally determined spectra working under ideal conditions,
and the spectra for the 4a-hydroxypterin and quinoid dihydropterin
agree well.  From these, rate constants for the conversion of
the reduced cofactor to its intermediates and then to the fully
oxidized cofactor are determined.  With the exception of the
values for rate constant <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, which represents
conversion of BH<sub>4</sub> to the 4a-hydroxypterin and whose
wild-type value is twice those of both mutants, the rate constants
<i>k</i><sub>2</sub> (4a-hydroxypterin &rarr; quinoid BH<sub>2</sub>),
<i>k</i><sub>3</sub> (BH<sub>4</sub> &rarr; quinoid BH<sub>2</sub>),
and <i>k</i><sub>4</sub> (quinoid BH<sub>2</sub> &rarr; BH<sub>2</sub>)
are all nearly identical.
<p>
All these data show that Ser396 is not important to catalysis or
binding at all, and that slight mutations are tolerable.  Ser395
is critical however.  While <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values are relatively
unchanged and indicate that the residue does not mediate any binding,
it is clear that hydroxylation is very much uncoupled.  The side
chain hydroxyl is important, since S395T does not cause dramatic
alterations.  Kinetic data show that formation of the hydroxylation
intermediate (4a-hydroxypterin) occurs comparable to wild-type,
and so it does not control early events in catalysis.  It has been
proposed a concerted cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond occurs when
the amino acid substrate, cofactor, and iron atom are brought into
proximity.  The big question has always been whether the cofactor
itself generates hydroxyl group that becomes then the oxidized
amino acid.  The data instead show that the hydroxylation of the
cofactor is necessary to activate the oxygen such that the iron
center forms a ferryl-oxo species that is then reactive with the
substrate.  The cofactor forms the peroxypterin, and then the iron
atom can form the ferryl-oxo species.  Indeed, bacterial PheH can
oxidize cofactor easily without the presence of metal, but the metal
is required to form the reactive species for attacking the aromatic
ring.  Because the Fe=O species is so reactive, it possesses
special stabilizing influences provided (in part) by Ser395 to
permit reaction with the aromatic ring.
<p>
The iron within the catalytic domain of TyrH is coordinated in
a square pyramidal structure: His336, Glu376, and two H<sub>2</sub>
molecules serves as the equatorial ligands, and His331 is an
axial ligand.  The better resolved PheH structure shows that
iron is in an octahedral arrangement:  an additional water
molecule forms a second axial ligand.  M&ouml;ssbauer and
X-ray absorbance spectroscopy of catalytic and intact TyrH show
that 6-coordinate iron is converted to 5-coordinate in dehydration.
The oxygen atom is most likely to occupy the position of the labile
water, and CD and magnetic CD spectral analyses of PheH show that
the Fe atom is 5-coordinate when Phe substrate and cofactor are
bound, indicating loss of axial water.  If Ser395 no longer forms
a hydrogen bond with His331 because it is unavailable, this
may alter the distance of Fe atom to its oxygen atom.

Catecholamine Biosynthesis and Physiological Regulation in Neuroendocrine Cells
<p class="Para1">
<b>Review</b>.  Elliot first outlined the basis of chemical neurotransmission
in 1904-5.  Loewi then showed that adrenaline in frog was involved in
this neurotransmission in 1921.  Von Euler (1946) showed noradrenaline
in splenic nerves, and that it was the sympathetic neurotransmitter.
In 1971 he later showed that vascular smooth muscle requires noradrenaline.
<p>
Goldstein et al. (1995) have proposed that DOPA circulating in plasma
may be converted by cells that can convert it to dopamine, and that
it can be a local autocrine/paracrine regulator of organ function.
Activity of the sympathoadrenal sytem can be determined by measuring
plasma catecholamine levels (microneurography is possible by recording
impulses to skin and muscle; see Christensen 1991 and Hjemdahl 1991).

Positive charge intrinsic to Arg<sup>37</sup>-Arg<sup>38</sup> is
critical for dopamine inhibition of the catalytic activity of
human tyrosine hydroxylase type 1
<p class="Para1">
Five different methods (Chou-Fasman, Robson-Garnier, modified
Robson-Garnier, the Heidelberg profile-fed neural network, and
a 3D-1D compatibility algorithm) were used to evaluate the predicted
secondary structure of hTH-1.  All of these methods predicted for
residues 1-60 two alpha helices (residues 16-29, and 41-59)
connected by a turn.
<p>
A wild-type hTH1 and four mutants substituted at positions 37 and 38
were prepared (see methods).  The wild type is RR, but the mutants
were RG, GR, GG, and EE.  Ammonium sulfate pptn, Superose 6HR 10/30,
and heparin-Sepharose were steps in the purification scheme.  From
the last column using a decreasing KCl gradient for elution,
wild-type, RG, GR, GG, and EE eluted in that order (0.36, 0.35, 0.35,
0.31, and 0.28 M KCl).  SDS-PAGE showed a major band at 59 kDa for
all fractions.  All had major specific activities of 600 nmol
DOPA/min/mg protein in a system containing pH 7.7 buffer with 200 &micro;M
L-tyrosine and 1 mM (6<i>R</i>)-BH<sub>4</sub>.
<p>
pH activity profiles were done using various buffers at pH 6.2, 6.7, 7.2,
7.7, and 8.2.  The wild-type hTH-1 was maximal over this broad alkaline
range.  If pre-incubated with 1, 10, or 100 &micro;M dopamine, the activity
was lowered, and especially in the alkaline range.  A strong inhibition
was not observed in the acidic range however, for either the wild-type
or mutants.  Singly-substituted Arg mutants (GR or RG) were inhibited
at 100 &micro;M, but not at all by lower dopamine concentrations.
The GG mutant was not inhibited at all by dopamine in the acidic region,
as well as the EE mutant.
<p>
CD spectra were performed on the wild-type hTH-1 and the mutants.
There were slight differences in signal strength, but the overall shape
did not change.
<p>
The secondary structural analysis and determination of mutants and wild-type
suggest that the effect of inhibition of dopamine is related strictly to
the ionic charge of select amino acids, and that they do not exert their
effect through changes in the secondary structure, but by direct
electrostatic interaction.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>.  Full-length hTH1 cDNA was cloned into pET-3c and
then digested with <i>Nde</i>I and <i>Bam</i>HI.  The fragment was
inserted into pKF18k.  Site-directed mutagenesis was by the dual amber
method using the following primers and the mutants they generate in
parentheses: 5'-CTCGATGAGGCTCTGCCTGCCCCCAATGAACCGCGG-3' (RR&rarr;GR),
5'-CTCGATGAGGCTCTGCCCGCGCCCAATGAACCGCGG (RR&rarr;RG),
5'-CTCGATGAGGCTCTGCCCGCCCCCAATGAACCGCGG (RR&rarr;GG), and
5'-CTCGATGAGGCTCTGCTCCTCCCCAATGAACCGCGG (RR&rarr;EE).  Confirmation
of mutagenesis was by sequencing.  The pKF18k vector is then
digested with <i>Nde</i>I and <i>Bam</i>HI, and the fragment inserted
once again into pET-3c.  <i>E coli</i> BL21(DE3) was used
as host for the expression.

Nitric oxide inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase of
rat median eminence
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>.

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme
in the biosynthesis of catecholamines. In a previous report
we found that intracerebroventricular administration
of nitric oxide (NO) generator sodium nitroprusside (SNP)
to conscious male rats inhibited dose-dependently
the TH activity of the median eminence (ME). In the
present study we have tested the in vitro effects of
SNP on TH activity, its possible mediator and action
mechanism. Exposure of the ME TH to SNP
(50, 100 and 500 &micro;M) caused concentration-dependent
inhibition of its enzyme activity. Addition of
reduced hemoglobin Hb (10 &micro;M), a NO scavenger,
superoxide dismutase SOD (1000 units/ml),
a superoxide scavenger enzyme, or uric acid UA
(300 &micro;M), a peroxynitrite scavenger, did not affect
the enzyme activity by themselves, but prevented
the inhibitory effect of SNP 500 &micro;M.
However, the presence of methylene blue MB
(100 &micro;M), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, did not
alter either basal enzyme activity or the inhibitory
action of SNP 500 &micro;M. These results suggest that
this action of SNP on TH of the ME would be mediated
by peroxynitrite generated by the reaction of NO
with superoxide.

Gene Therapy of Parkinson's Disease Using Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Vectors
<p class="Para1">
<b>Review</b>.  Several thousand attempts have been made to use gene
therapy in treatment of inherited disorders.  Parkinson's disease is an
appropriate target for somatic gene therapy, with an onset between ages
40-70 (peak onset in 50s).  Dopaminergic cells bodies make up the substantia
nigra, their axons radiating to striatum.  Orally administered DOPA has
limited period of benefit.  Transplantation of fetal mesencephalic cell
has been done, but the success comes at a high ethical price.
<p>
Gene therapy attempts have included TyrH gene transfer targeted to fibroblasts,
astrocytes, and neurons.  The adeno-associated virus (AAV) is not
pathogenic to humans and can be used for delivering genes.  One group
has already used it to deliver TyrH gene following direct injection into
rat striatum.

Reversing the Substrate Specificities of Phenylalanine and Tyrosine
Hydroxylase:  Aspartate 425 of Tyrosine Hydroxylase Is Essential
for <span class="small-caps">l</span>-DOPA Formation
<p class="Para1">
PheH cannot form DOPA although TyrH can hydroxylate its substrate as well
as its own as well as many other substrates.   Several mutants
of the PheH catalytic domain were produced by directed mutagenesis;
the full-length PheH is not used because the catalytic domain is
just as active and does not require pre-activation with its substrate
or lipids.  Each mutant was screened for its ability to produce DOPA.
All cells expressed sufficient protein levels (shown by gel analysis),
so any difference is not due to expression.  Many mutants were not
single mutants, but from 1 to 7 mutants were introduced.  It did
appear that any mutant that contained the V379D conversion showed
a degree of DOPA-forming activity.  Other mutations did enhance the
ability to form DOPA, including Y277H and H264Q.
<p>
These mutations were then tested in full-length PheH and TyrH.  For TyrH,
the corresponding conversions were Q310H, H323Y and D425V, which
makes TyrH more like PheH and should eliminate its ability to form DOPA,
yet convert Phe to Tyr.  Expression was not difficult, since the mutations
represent models of wild-type enzymes that are soluble proteins.
Kinetic parameters were determined for the PheH after its pre-incubation
(activation) using either its substrate or lysophosphatidylcholine.
Cofactor is 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>, although BH<sub>4</sub> gives 10-fold
better response.
<p>
D425V TyrH mutants showed a 120-fold reduction in Vmax for the ability
to form DOPA, and V/Ktyr decreased 300 times (meaning the Ktyr
was increased relative to the wild-type).  Q310H and H323Y TyrH mutants
did not affect Vmax values although the V/Ktyr decreased 4- and 5-fold,
resp.  There were no changes in Km for 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>.  The mutants
had a greater ability to hydroxylate Phe than did wild-type TyrH,
with moderate increases in Vmax (1.3- to 4.5-fold).  Q310TH showed
14-fold and D425V showed a 225-fold increase in V/Kphe, and there were
decreases in Kphe for the mutants, with D425V TyrH mutant 80-fold lower
than wild-type (a good PheH but now poor TyrH).  Wild-type PheH will hydroxylate
Tyr to form DOPA, but the [tyrosine] must be high (2.2 mM) and so must
the enzyme (1 &micro;M) to produce detectable amounts.  An D425V TyrH mutant
becomes a good PheH, but a V379D PheH mutant did not make a good TyrH.
A V379D + H264Q PheH mutant did improve Tyr hydroxylating ability however,
and inclusion of Y277H produced even higher specific activity.
<p>
The PheH catalytic domain was fused with R domain of TyrH, with mutations
inserted into the active site to make the protein TyrH-like  (V379D nT-PheH,
H264Q/V379 nT-PheH, Y277H/V379D nT-PheH, and a triple mutant nT-PheH).
High [Tyr] levels were used, but still all mutants were poor tyrosine
hydroxylases, although the triple mutant had 10-fold higher activity
than the nT-PheH chimera.  Kinetic data were such that the possibility
of mutating the active site prohibits changing substrate specificity
of C domain or action of R domain in PheH is eliminated.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>.  A bacterial PheH about 335 amino acids shows the first
means to deal with catabolism of Phe.  There are 74 residues in the
C domains of TyrH and PheH that are not conserved, and some or all of
them are factors in determining substrate specificity.  The TyrH
gene probably duplicated from an ancestral hydroxylase 750 M years
ago while TrpH came along 600 M years ago.  TyrH alone has the ability
to hydroxylate tyrosine, but can hydroxylate the other aromatic amino
acids as well.  PheH and TrpH catalyze their substrates very well,
but are unable to catalyze Tyr, whose ring is more easily subject to
attack.  A single (D425V) mutation in TyrH had more severe effects on
the ability of TyrH to form DOPA than a single mutation had on the ability
of PheH to convert.  A single base change at position 425 (from Val
to Asp) could have very well altered the substrate specificity sufficiently
to permit Tyr to be a preferred substrate.
<p>
Part of the reactivity of various hydroxylases depends
on the physiological role of the enzyme.  Liver PheH exists to guard
against excess serum Phe levels, the reason why the Kphe is high and
why Phe is itself both substrate and activator of the enzyme.
Certain TyrH mutations were found to improve reactivity to Phe
without loss of Tyr reactivity.

nitration of tyrosine hydroxylase and neurotoxicity by EUK-134,
a superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic, in cultured dopaminergic
neurons
<p class="Para1">
The brains of embryonic E15 Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses are removed
and tissue from the ventral mesencephalic dopaminergic (DAergic) is
dissected free into ice-cold PBS.  These are pooled together into
cell dissociation medium (0.2% trypsin in Earle's BSS) for 15 min
at 37&deg;.  Additional mechanical trituration with fire-polished
Pasteur pipet in complete medium (MEM:F-12 1:1 with 0.1 mg/ml
apotransferrin and 25 &micro;g/ml insulin) with 2000 IU/ml DNase.
DAergic neurons are about 5% of all cells.  Depending on the experiment,
culture in 96-well plates coated with poly-L-Orn or laminin is done
at 30,000 cells/well.
<p>
On the 9th day in culture, cytotoxicity studies were done with a dose
response to MPP<sup>+</sup> (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, an active
metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine [MPTP])
and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA).  Cells were treated for an hour with
the dose, then medium changed 3 &times; after exposure, and 24 h later,
high-affinity DA uptake and TH immunochemistry measured.  Both DA
uptake and TH immunoreactive neurons declined in parallel to the
dose used, with an EC<sub>50</sub> close to 10 &micro;M for MPP<sup>+</sup>
and 30 &micro;M for 6-OHDA.  A dose response curve was also done with
EUK-134 (Eukarion, Inc., Bedford MA) and there were no toxic or
trophic effects in the tested doses from 1 nM to 1 &micro;M.  Toxicity
was observed at &gt;10 &micro;M, EUK-134, and severe toxicity above
50 &micro;M, but this was not specific to DAergic neurons.
<p>
On day 7 in vitro, cultures were treated with a dose course of EUK-134.
Two days later, cultures were then exposed either to 10 &micro;M MPP<sup>+</sup>
or 30 &micro;M 6-OHDA for 1 h, and then h-a DA uptake measured 24 h later.
MPP<sup>+</sup> reduced both DA uptake and TH-immunoreactive neurons
in controls, while there was a protective effect by EUK-134 in
a concentration-dependent manner.  At 0.5 &micro;M EUK-134, complete protection
was observed.  The identical results were also seen for 6-OHDA-induced
toxicity and protection against, including the same concentration
of EUK-134 to protect against the effects.
<p>
Cultures treated with 10 &micro;M MPP<sup>+</sup> show significant loss
of the count of cell bodies and neurites staining with anti-TH Ab.
When pre-treated with 0.5 &micro;M EUK-134, both a qualitative and quantitative
measure of protection against the loss is seen.  All these are seen
whether 10 &micro;M MPP<sup>+</sup> or 30 &micro;M 6-OHDA is used.
<p>
Cultures were prepared in 100 mm dishes and treated with EUK-134 or
control on day 6 in vitro.  Two days later culture are treated for
3 h with MPP<sup>+</sup>, 6-OHDA, or control medium.  Cell lysates are
then prepared for immunoblotting using anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies
for TH immunoprecipitated and run on SDS-PAGE.  Lanes show absence
of TH nitration in cells not treated at all or with only EUK-134.
Nitration is seen with the MPP<sup>+</sup> treatment, but not if
MPP<sup>+</sup> was used on EUK-134 pre-treated cells.  There were
no differences in the level of TH.

of phosphorylation over a dose course of forskolin indicated maximal effect at 
100 &micro;M forskolin, the maximum tested since greater concentrations might 
cause toxicity or nonspecific effects.  The time course maximum of forskolin was 
reached by 5 min (with 10 &micro;M).  This also persisted for 20 min.  Combined 
100 &micro;M NMDA and 10 &micro;M forskolin significantly reduced Ser40 
phosphorylation although TH protein levels remained unchanged.  TH activity was 
also assessed by measuring DOPA accumulation (NSD-1015 inhibits AAA

NMDA was without effect. Combined forskolin-NMDA treatment limited the

Effects of Substitution at Serine 40 of Tyrosine Hydroxylase on
Catecholamine Binding
<p class="Para1">
TyrH mutants were constructed such that Ser40 was replaced by different
residues:  Ala, Thr, Val, Glu, or Asp.  Expression of soluble protein
was seen and purifications were as for wild-type recombinants.  Mutants
required reconstitution steps with ferrous ion, and stoichiometries of
0.9-1.0 iron atom per subunit were found by AAS.  Tyr and 6-MPH<sub>4</sub>
were used to acquire kinetic data for mutants and phospho- and nonphospho-
wildtype.
<p>
Phosphorylation is reported to decrease cofactor Km by 2-fold, slightly
increase Vmax, and not change Km for tyrosine, and the properties of the
mutants were similar.  Mutants, including S40T, showed very slight
decreases in Kbh4.
<p>
The more significant effect of Ser40 phosphorylation is a change in
the affinity of Fe3+ atom to catecholamines.  Dopamine, Epi,
and NorEpi affinities fall by 3 orders of magnitude, while for DOPA
the affinity falls by 20-fold.  For the wild-type recombinant, dissociation
of dopamine was difficult to measure for the nonphospho wildtype since
the rate is quite slow.  With DOPA, the rate is faster and measurable,
whether for phospho or nonphospho enzyme.  Binding affinities of catecholamines
to mutants were determined by measuring association and dissociation rates
separately.  Fe(III)-TyrH is mixed with DOPA or dopamine and a 690 nm
absorbing peak is followed (it has known extinction coefficient).
The second order association rate constant of CAmines and protein is
determined from pseudo first-order rate constants found by plotting
A690 vs. time at various CAmine levels; the data are fit to the
equation <i>A<sub>t</sub></i> = <i>A</i><sub>&infin;</sub> +
(<i>A</i><sub>0</sub> &minus;
<i>A</i><sub>&infin;</sub>)<i>e<sup>&minus;kt</sup></i>, where <i>A<sub>t</sub></i>
is the total observed absorbance at time <i>t</i>, <i>A</i><sub>&infin;</sub>
is absorbance after the reaction is complete, and <i>A</i><sub>0</sub>
is absorbance at time zero.  The <i>k</i><sub>obs</sub> vs. [catecholamine]
plot reveals binding of catecholamine to enzyme, and second order constants
are derived.  The data show that changes in the constant are increases
less than 2-fold compared to phosphorylation.
<p>
Dissociation rate constants
can be derived from the pseudo-first order rate data replots, but when
dissociation is slow, the differences between proteins can be obscured.
It is therefore better to measure dissociation directly.  In this case
2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene is a catechol with very high affinity for TH
(Kd = 15 nM) and the increased absorbance at 550 nm means it can be used
to determine dissociation.  20-40 &micro;M enzyme is incubated with CAmine
(100-150 &micro;M DOPA or 45 &micro;M dopamine) until equilibrium is seen
at 690 nm, and then DHN is added to 1 mM.  The data reveal that
dopamine and DOPA were not different in terms of their ability to
dissociate from each mutant.  S40T was, not surprisingly, indistinguishable
from wild-type.  The largest dissociation rates were seen with
S40D and S40E, which is also not surprising, since these substitutions
mimic phosphorylated Ser40, and the effect of phosphorylating Ser40
is to increase the dissociation of catechols.  The S40A and S40V
mutants had more intermediate dissociation rates.  The structural basis
of increased activation and reduced catecholamine affinity is not addressed
in the discussion in detail.

Interaction of Phosphorylated Tyrosine Hydroxylase with 14-3-3
Proteins:  Evidence for a Phosphoserine 40-Dependent Association
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>.
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) has been reported to require binding of 14-3-3 
proteins for optimal activation by phosphorylation. We examined the effects of 
phosphorylation at Ser19, Ser31 and Ser40 of bovine TH and human TH isoforms on 
their binding to the 14-3-3 proteins BMH1/BMH2, as well as 14-3-3 &zeta; and a 
mixture of sheep brain 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of Ser31 did not result 
in 14-3-3 binding, however, phosphorylation of TH on Ser40 increased its 
affinity towards the yeast 14-3-3 isoforms BMH1/BMH2 and sheep brain 14-3-3, but 
not for 14-3-3 &zeta;. On phosphorylation of both Ser19 and Ser40, binding to 
the 14-3-3 &zeta; isoform also occurred, and the binding affinity to BMH1 and 
sheep brain 14-3-3 increased. Both phosphoserine-specific antibodies directed 
against the 10 amino acids surrounding Ser19 or Ser40 of TH, and the 
phosphorylated peptides themselves, inhibited the association between 
phosphorylated TH and 14-3-3 proteins. This was also found when heparin was 
added, or after proteolytic removal of the N-terminal 37 amino acids of 
Ser40-phosphorylated TH. Binding of BMH1 to phosphorylated TH decreased the rate 
of dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A, but no significant change in 
enzymatic activity was observed in the presence of BMH1. These findings further 
support a role for 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of catecholamine 
biosynthesis and demonstrate isoform specificity for both TH and 14-3-3 
proteins.
<p class="Para1">
The Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-K2) targets 
Ser19 of TH (as does mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein 
kinase-2, MAPKAP-K2).  It also targets Ser31 of hTH-2, which is an isoform 
altered so that it is not a target of MAPK (also called MAP-2K and ERK1). 
Activation of TH phosphorylated by CaM-K2 requires an <q>activator 
protein</q> identified as the conserved family of eukaryotic acidic proteins 
14-3-3.  The crystal structures of the &zeta; and &tau; isoforms, and the &eta;, 
&beta; and &theta; forms bind to CaM-K2-phosphorylated TH, and this depends on 
Ser19 phosphorylation.
<p>
Protein-protein interactions can be studied using surface plasmon resonance with 
a BIAcore X instrument.  14-3-3 at 0.10 mg/ml is immobilized by amine coupling 
to CM5 sensor chips according to the manufacturer.  Binding studies are at 
25&deg; in a standard 10 mM HEPES buffer, which includes saline, EDTA, and 
polysorbate 20 (50 ppm), with a flow of 20 &micro;l/min.  Sensograms are 
analyzed by the BIA evaluation v2.2 program with non-linear curve fitting.
<p>
Recombinant hTH forms 1-4 were tested by SPR for their interaction with yeast 
forms of 14-3-3, BMH1 and BMH2.  Nonphosphorylated forms showed very low 
interaction-binding.  Ser40-phosphorylated (by PKA) hTH showed an enhanced 
interaction with the yeast 14-3-3 proteins however, and the interaction was 
correlated with stoichiometry of phosphorylation. This interaction was true 
whether the 14-3-3 proteins were flowed past immobilized TH or vice-versa. 
Maximal response for mobile 14-3-3 to immobile TH was lower because of the 
larger mass of tetrameric TH, compared with dimeric 14-3-3.  Also demonstrated 
was binding of PSer-40 hTH1 to sheep brain 14-3-3, but the association was not 
as great as for BMH1.  The bovine &zeta; 14-3-3 did not bind to phosphoTH. (Note 
that in SPR, a resonance diagram is response units vs. time.)

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Activation of Tyrosine Hydroxylase Involves MEK1
<p class="Abstract">
<b>Abstract</b>.
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TOH) activity is regulated acutely by
phosphorylation of serines 8, 19, 31 and 40. The only kinases
known to phosphorylate Ser31 are the mitogen-activated
protein kinases MAPK-1 and 2. The involvement of these
kinases in TOH activation in situ was therefore investigated
using intact bovine chromaffin cells. Nicotine, K<sup>+</sup> and A23187
increased TOH activity over 10 min in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent
manner. The response to all three was reduced by PD098059,
a selective inhibitor of the upstream activator of MAPK, MEK1.
In contrast, TOH activation by forskolin and phorbol dibutyrate
were unaffected by PD098059. The results support a key
role for MEK1/MAPK in the acute activation of TOH by
nicotinic receptors and by other agonists that increase
cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Free 3-nitrotyrosine causes striatal neurodegeneration <i>in vivo</i>
<p class="Para1">
30-35 g CF-1 mice were injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (64 nmol
in 4 &micro;l saline) using a stereotaxic device.  Also injected in separate
experiments were 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and tyrosine.  (3-NT was
re-crystallized and shown &gt;98% pure by CZE.)  Animals were then
kept for 2 weeks in 12 h light/dark cycles and recovered normally.
At 2 weeks, the animals were challenged with 4 mg/kg D-amphetamine
i.p., which stimulates presynaptic striatal dopamine release, or with
1.5 mg/kg apomorphine s.c., which is a postsynaptic dopamine receptor
agonist.  They were placed in a 13.5 cm dia. jar to evaluate turning
behavior.  After amphetamine challenge, any net ipsilateral (toward
injected hemisphere) turning behavior indicates unilateral degeneration
of presynaptic striatal dopamine neurons.  Any net contralateral
(away from injected hemisphere) turning behavior after apomorphine
challenge indicates unilateral postsynaptic dopamine receptor
supersensitivity;  receptor supersensitivity response is probably related
to extent of dopamine depletion.  Mice were then sacrificed by
carbon dioxide and brains formalin-fixed.  5 &micro;m coronal sections
from the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (two regions along
the nigrostriatal axis) were assessed at 150 &micro;m intervals along the
entire striatal region.  Staining was with cresyl violet and immunostaining
was with anti-TH polyclonal or anti-3-NT.  Controls included non-immune
rabbit IgG as a replacement for anti-TH, and of pre-incubation of
anti-3NT with 3-NT to pre-adsorb when anti-3NT immunohistochemistry was
done.
<p>
When free tyrosine was injected into the brains of mice, there was
no net turning behavior in any direction (within error), either by
challenge with amphetamine or apomorphine.  With amphetamine challenge,
3-NT- and 6-OHDA-treated mice showed net turning behavior to the
ipsilateral side.  With apomorphine challenge, only 6-OHDA-treated
mice showed net turning behavior to the contralateral side.  Rotarod
testing showed that locomotive capacity was not impaired in any treatment
group.
<p>
Histology showed that striatal cell density was not perturbed grossly
by treatment with Tyr, 3-NT, or 6-OHDA, as shown by cresyl violet staining
density.  Staining for 3-NT by IHC showed no evident protein nitration.
Striatal TH was decreased unilaterally in the 3-NT and 6-OHDA treatment
groups according to anti-TH IHC staining however.  An optical density
analysis was done to compare the injected striatal side against the
contralateral (uninjected) side.  Normally one expects a 0% reduction
if the treatment does not affect TH content.  However 3-NT and 6-OHDA
reduced TH content by 51 and 77%, resp.  A plot of the ratio of
injected side striatal TH to control side striatal TH vs.
amphetamine-induced turning differential (ipsilateral &minus; contralateral)
is negatively correlated to significant degree (<i>r</i> = &minus;0.72,
<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).
<p>
Photomicrographs of anti-TH IHC staining of the substantia nigra pars
compacta can be quantitated for TH-positive cell bodies.  The density
of cell bodies on the injected and control side were equivalent in the
free Tyr-treated mice, but reductions in cell bodies counts were significant
on the injected vs. control sides of free 3-NT and 6-OHDA by 41 and 60%,
resp.  A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between
striatal TH content ratio and the count of TH cell bodies in the substantia
nigra.

Nitration and Inactivation of Tyrosine Hydroxylase by Peroxynitrite
<p class="Para1">
Recombinant TH is purified from BL21(DE3)pLysS <i>E. coli</i> which express a 
full-length cDNA clone from rat pheochromocytoma;  expression is induced by 
IPTG.  The purified TH is treated with a dose course of peroxynitrite (PON). 
These show a concentration-dependent inactivation of TH (some data points:  at 
100 &micro;M PON, activity is 57% of control, at 250 &micro;M, 38%, and at 500 
&micro;M, 25%).  Cysteine sulfhydryls were evaluated by three different methods: 
(1) ThioGlo-1, a maleimide-derivatized naphthopyranone (2) 
5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzene) (DTNB), and (3) 
4-(dimethylamino)phenylazophenyl-4'-maleimide (DAMBI). There are seven Cys 
residues in the rat TH sequence, and the untreated TH shows an average 6.8 in 
good agreement.  Results shows that not a single residue of Cys is oxidized 
until PON is 250 &micro;M, where activity is nearly inhibited by 50%.  At 500 
&micro;M PON, only one of the Cys residues is oxidized. Methane sulfonic acid 
hydrolysis and determination of methionine sulfoxide showed no oxidation of 
tryptophan or methionine. Amino acid analysis using PTH amino acids also showed 
that PON did not modify these amino acids.
<p>
TH was partially denatured in 7 M urea or 6 M guanidinium HCl (GnHCl) for 1 h at 
room temp before PON treatment.  Three Cys residues could be oxidized with 0.5 
mM PON of partially denatured TH (4.1 &plusmn; 1 and 3.2 &plusmn; 0.4 Cys 
residues for urea and GnHCl, resp.). Western analysis with anti-TH revealed 
formation of TH polymers stable to SDS and heat.  Polymerized TH was hydrolyzed 
and the hydrolysates measured for fluorescence specific for dityrosine 
(&lambda;<sub>ex</sub> = 283 nm, &lambda;<sub>em</sub>=410 nm). For 6 M GnHCl + 
0.5 mM PON, one dityrosine is formed from a holoenzyme molecule.  Cys and Tyr 
oxidation was proportional to the concentration of PON for unfolded protein.  CD 
spectra show big differences in native TH and 1 M GnHCl-denatured TH:  computer 
algorithm analysis shows 58% &alpha;-helix in native TH and only 11% in 
denatured TH (random structure increases from 30 to 54%).
<p>
TH was exposed to a dose course of PON and shown to be nitrated by
anti-3NT westerns in increasing fashion (anti-TH confirms that the
change in staining is NOT due to changes in the TH itself).  If
one Tyr is nitrated per TH molecule, then a 100 &micro;M PON treatment
of 1, 2, and 3 mg TH/ml  theoretically gives nitration of 59, 22,
and 20% of molecules, in close agreement with the observed nitration
by 52, 29, and 18% of TH molecules loss of TH activity.
<p>
TH was digested with endoproteinase AspN or trypsin and the digest
prepared on reversed-phase HPLC with detector set at 210, 275, and
365 nm.  Two major peaks at 275 and 365 nm eluted at 29.1 and 47.7
min.  The first 20 amino acids of each were sequenced.  From the 29.1 min
peak, a sequence of DTAAVQPXP (where X is an unknown amino acid).
This corresponds well to residues 416-424, DTAAVQPYP, where Tyr is residue
423.  The peak at 47.7 min was actually two sequences, with the major
sequence being residues 44-77, having no tyrosine residues.  The minor
sequence (less than 10%) was XQTXQPVXFVSESF, corresponding to residues
425 to 439:  DQTYQPVYFVSESFN, including two tyrosines at 428 and 432.
Trypsin digests were also resolved and sequenced:  the 73 min peak
was AFDPDTAAVQPXQDQ corresponding to peptides between 412 and 442 and
including tyrosines at 423, 428, 432.  Hence the primary nitration site
is Tyr-423, and to a lesser extent residues 428 and 432.  A mutant
construct was created to change Tyr-423 to Phe, and then treat mutant
with PON.  It was clear that there was less nitration of TH in the mutant
compared to wild-type.  The Y423F mutant showed decreased activity
(&gt;99%) after heat inactivation (45&deg; for 10 min) or removal
of ferrous ion, similar to the wild-type.  Both the wild-type and mutant
showed loss of activity with N-ethylmaleimide (alkylator of Cys side
chains).  But with 0.5 mM PON, there was a 44% inhibition of wild-type
TH, but only a 3% inhibition of Y423F TH.  All these experiments show
that PON does not modify Cys residues but nitrates Tyr-423, and that nitration
results in loss of activity.
<p>
TH was treated with either ferrous ammonium sulfate or 1,10-phenanthroline.
Then the TH holo or apoenzyme were treated in stopped-flow experiments
with PON at 75 &micro;M (TH was 20 &micro;M).  PON decomposition was followed
kinetically at 302 nm.  A second-order rate constant for the holoenzyme
was 3.8 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>&minus;1</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
and for the apoenzyme 1.6 &times; 10<sup>3</sup>
M<sup>&minus;1</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup>, at pH 7.45 and 25&deg;.
There were no differences in rate constants for TH treated with
mercaptoethanol (having 5.3 Cys residues per monomer) or TH treated with
NEM (1.06 Cys residues per monomer).  These show that the contribution
of Cys residues in PON reaction is small, and that PON reacts with the
metal centers.

Reduced Nicotinamide Nucleotides Prevent Nitration of Tyrosine
Hyxdroxylase by Peroxynitrite
<p class="Para1">
TH cloned and expressed as a GST-tagged fusion protein has been reported
by us previously.  TH was treated with peroxynitrite (PON) in the presence
and absence of nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cofactors and the
run on 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted for Western using anti-nitrotyrosine mAb.
With PON treatment in the absence of NAD cofactors, TH activity is about
45% of control.  A dose course of NADH or NADPH addition shows a protective
effective, in which protected TH is inhibited only to 65-70% of value;
NADH provided more protection than did NADPH but only at lower concentrations
(5-20 &micro;M).  Maximal protection was
found in the 50-100 &micro;M NADH and NADPH range, where 80-85% of control
activity was attained.  TH activity was unchanged in the presence of
NADH or NADPH in TH not treated with PON.
<p>
Western analysis shows a concentration-dependent reduction in nitration
of TH protein only with reduced cofactors (NADH and NADPH) but not with
oxidized cofactor (NAD).  A concentration of 20-50 &micro;M of either NADH
or NADPH was sufficient to completely block PON-induced nitration, with
NADH having the greater potency, which agrees with the activity results.

Comparison analysis of distributions of tyrosine hydroxylase,
calmodulin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in
a triple stained slice of rat brain
<p class="Para1">
A quantitative immunohistochemical technique was performed using the
Yamato Scientific Co. MapAnalyzer.  This instrument requires tissue
slices stained by immunofluorescent antibodies, and illuminates with
fine excitation (420-490 nm, emission 530 nm), the specimen illumination
passing through a photometry diaphragm (80 &micro;m dia) and objective lens
(20 x, NA 0.75) to a photometer (voltage 850 V) to record the microarea
(20 &micro;m dia. measured in 20 &micro;m intervals).  An adjacent microarea
is scanned quantitatively in this way, and all data collected by the
controlling software. Scan speed is 100 microareas/second.  Maximum
stage movement is 140 mm<sup>2</sup> with minimum step of 0.25 &micro;m.
Illumination at
each point is 10 ms, making bleaching negligible, with 50 measurements
possible; 250,000-310,000 data points ea slice, requiring 30 min total
analysis time.  All fluorescent intensities for each antigen were
classed into eight categories.  When comparing the overlap between two
antigens, the 8 classes of intensities of one are color coded against
the 8 classes of the second, requiring 64 color-coded intensities.
<p>
For this study ten
male Wistar about 275 g and brains were fixed by circulatory perfusion.
Brain was sliced at 5 mm coronal blocks,
which were post-fixed with same fixative.  Blocks were soaked in 5% sucrose
then frozen on dry ice and sectioned serially at 20 &micro;m in cryostat.
Immunohistochemistry was for TH (rabbit anti-rat adrenal TH PAb xreactive
with mice, monkeys, rats, and humans, but not to DBH or DDC), CaMKII
(anti-CaMKII MAb specific for &alpha; subunit and xreactive to rat
and most other mammals),  and CaM (sheep anti-bovine testes anti-CaM
PAb xreactive with brain CaM from mice, rat, bovine, and humans).
Later treatment for AChE and Nissl staining was done.
<p style="font:normal 83% Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<b>Note on immunohistochemical procedure</b>.  Tissue slices are rinsed
in PBS, pretreated with normal goat and rabbit sera diluted 1:100 at
4&deg; for 2 h, rinsed with PBS 1 h, treated with anti-TH (1:200),
reacted at 4&deg; 12 h, rinsed 3 &times; with PBS total 1 h, treated
with FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG goat serum (1:100) for 3 h RT, rinsed
3 times again with PBS, embedded in 10% glycerol PBS, then scanned with
the analyzer.  Following TH distribution analysis, staining is with 1:100
anti-CaMKII and anti-mouse IgG goat serum with FITC (1:40), followed
by scanning.  Differences in intensities between anti-TH and anti-CaMKII
scan are measured to quantitate the level of CaMKII.
<p>
<b>RESULTS</b>.  TH distribution in rat brain shows high levels in
neostriatum, hypothalamus (arcuate and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei),
olfactory tubercle, and nucleus accumbens.  Moderate levels in hippocampus,
amydala, globus pallidus, diagonal band, lateral septal nucleus, and
cerebral cortex.  Low levels in internal capsule, medial septal nucleus,
fimbria, and dentate gyrus.  Within the neostriatum, the anterior part
shows dorsolateral to ventromedial gradient from high (by 70%) to low.
<p>
CaMKII is found throughout the brain, but is particularly rich in
the hippocampus (the highest level), pyriform cortex, insular cortex,
motor cortex, neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle,
lateral septal nucleus, and amygdala.  Moderate levels in the
globus pallidus, primary somatosensory cortex, and low levels in
internal capsule, medial septal nucleus, and diagonal band.
<p>
CaM was more uniformly distributed relative to TH and CaMKII.
Still the higher levels were found in the cortical areas (motor,
insular, piriform), in the hypothalamus (arcuate and ventromedial
nuclei), olfactory tubercle, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and
neostriatum.  Moderate levels were found in the primary somatosensory
cortex, amygdala, diagonal band, globus pallidus, lateral septal nucleus,
and thalamus.  Low levels were found in internal capsule and medial
septal nucleus.  CaM levels in anterior neostriatum varied depending
upon region, and the level in dorsolateral and ventral areas were higher
than in central area.
<p>
It is noteworthy that the highest levels of all three were in the anterior
dorsolateral and posterior areas of the neostriatum.  Staining was
poor (pale) in zones also corresponding to AChE-poor striosomes.
The level of the kinase was higher in the hippocampus than in other
regions, which was not the case for TH and CaM, although levels
were judged moderate and high, resp., in the hippocampus.  Strong
staining in the hypothalamus, particularly the arcuate nucleus,
was found for TH and CaM.  These were only weakly stained for CaMKII.
In the thalamus, TH and CaMKII were low to moderate in the anterodorsal
and anteroventral thalamic nuclei, relatively higher in the mediodorsal
and submedius thalamic nuclei.  CaM was distributed all over the thalamus.
CaMKII was relatively high in the lateral septal nucleus, but low in the
diagonal band.

Differentiation of tyrosine hydroxylase-synthesizing and/or

decarboxylase-synthesizing neurons in the rat mediobasal
hypothalamus:  quantitative double-immunofluorescence study
<p class="Para1">
Brains of male and female Wistar rats at various stages of development (embryonic
day 21, E21; postnatal day 9, P9; adulthood at P80-90) were fixed and
frozen in isopentane (&minus;40&deg;) before serial coronal 30 &micro;m
sections were cut.  Antibodies were to TH (1:2000, Sigma MAb) and
AADC (1:2000, rabbit PAb).  Controls included omission of primary Ab
as well as pre-absorbing 1&deg; Ab to its own antigens before incubation.
<p>
The double staining revealed the arcuate nucleus to have 3 neuronal
populations in E21 fetal rats, with nuclei of neurons round or oval.
More neurons stained for either TH or AADC, and fewer for both.
These neurons were largely in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial regions
of the arcuate, but no sharp zone was seen.
<p>
At P9, the same pattern in E21 was observed.  Dramatic increases in
the number and proportion of neurons that were positive for TH and for
both TH and AADC were seen in the dorsomedial region of the arcuate nucleus.
<p>
In the adult the proportion and number of TH-positive neurons per
nucleus fell in the ventrolateral region of both males and females, and
in the dorsomedial region of males.  There were no numerical or proportional
changes for AADC-positive cells in the dorsomedial and ventrolateral
arcuate regions.  Neurons positive for TH and AADC increased in
number and proportion in dorsomedial and ventrolateral regions of the
females, only in the ventrolateral region of males.

Peroxynitrite-Induced Nitration of Tyrosine Hydroxylase:  Identification
of Tyrosines 423, 428, and 432 as Sites of Modification by Matrix-Assisted
Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry and
Tyrosine-Scanning Mutagenesis
<p class="Para1">
TH was cloned by RT-PCR and fused downstream of glutathione S-transferase,
which was used in an affinity chromatography step to purify the protein.
Rat TH has 17 Tyr residues, and single substitution Tyr&rarr;Phe mutants
were created for each through splicing by overlap extension (see Horton
et al., <i>Methods Enzymol.</i> 217: 270, 1993).  In some cases, double
and triple mutants were also created.  Changes were confirmed by DNA
sequencing.  For MALDI-TOF mass spec, treated and untreated TH is
purified by reversed-phase HPLC (&lambda; = 214 nm), then recovered
protein digested with V8 protease in 6 M guandine HCl, and peptides from
the digest resolved in HPLC again.  Microbore HPLC was used to get better
resolution of nitrated species.  Specimens are spotted to MALDI gold plates
and spectra acquired with Voyager DE-STR TOF MS (Perkin-Elmer) with 337 nm
nitrogen laser (in linear mode, accelerating voltage = 20 kV, grid voltage
= 95%, guide wire is off, and extraction delay time = 400 ns; in reflector
mode, accel V = 20 kV, grid V = 76%, mirror voltage ratio = 1.12, guide
wire = 0.05%, and extraction delay time = 310 ns).  External standards of
bradykinin and bovine pancreatic insulin were used in the TOF to mass conversion.
<p>
A V8 partial cleavage fragment corresponding to residues 410-436
(VRAFDPDTAAVQPYQDQTYQPVYFVSE) has a calculated average mass
[M + H]<sup>+</sup> of 3136.40 for native peptide.  In linear
mode, this was found to be <i>m/z</i> 3136.0 and in reflector mode
<i>m/z</i> 3136.46.  TH was treated with peroxynitrite (PON) and
there were 0-3 nitration events per molecule:  peaks of <i>m/z</i>
3181.48, 3226.88, and 3271.85 are seen, adding approximately 45 Da to
each, indicating one, two, and three nitrations.  There are peaks in
the spectrum that are 16 and 32 units lower, indicating loss of oxygen
atoms, probably because one oxygen is lost to form a nitroso species,
and another oxygen is lost to form a nitrene or dehydroazepine species.
With untreated TH, no peaks are observed in the region where peaks occur
with PON-treated TH.  A peak at <i>m/z</i> 3289 is a V8 partial cleavage
fragment from Leu<sup>333</sup>-Glu<sup>363</sup>, and there is also
an unidentified peak at <i>m/z</i> 3307 that is not nitrated since it
is present in untreated TH.  A triply nitrated V8 cleavage fragment
at <i>m/z</i> 3271.4 was examined more closely and showed 16-unit
multiples at <i>m/z</i> 3255.4 and 3239.8, indicating photodecomposition.
<p>
All tyrosines (at 423, 428, and 432) in the 3135.4-Da peptide of
TH were substituted to Phe by site-directed mutagenesis, and then
whole protein treated with PON.  Tyr<sup>225</sup> was also changed
since it was implicated in a prior report to be nitrated.
Anti-nitroTyr antibodies were used to assess (quantiate) nitration
compared to control.  The Y423F, Y428F, and Y432F mutations resulted
in 27, 32, and 39%, resp., of the nitration that occurred for wild-type.
Double mutants Y423F/Y432F, Y428F/Y432F, and Y423F/Y428F were 6, 16,
and 27% of wild-type.  The triple mutant was not nitrated at all.
The Y225F mutant resulted actually in a 20% increase in nitration.
Single and double mutations did not eliminate TH activity:  they were
all within 20% of the activity of the wild type, except for Y423F/Y432F
and Y428F/Y432F, which had 60 and 69% of wild type activity.  The triple
mutant had only about 20% of the wild type activity, indicating significant
disruption.  PON treatment had significant effects on the mutants.
Although the single mutants Y423F and Y428F were affected to the same
degreee as the wild type, Y432F was more sensitive to PON, reduced to
20% of control activity, and double mutants lost 80-85% of their activity
whereas wild type lost 50% with PON.
<p>
There are 14 other tyrosines in TH and single mutants were made of those.
All retained catalytic activity although mutation did show effects.
The Y200F and Y314F mutants had 40-45% of the activity of wild type,
and Y448F and Y463F actually had higher activity by 35-40%.  PON
reduced their activities significantly  Y214F was most sensitive
(15% of control), and Y225F and Y317F were 20% of wild type after
PON.
<p>
Wild types and the combinations of single/double/triple mutants
of Tyr-423/428/432 (with Tyr-225 always substituted), were treated
with 0.1 mM PON and probed with PMAB and BIAM thiol reagents, which
are biotinylated compounds reactive only with cysteine sulfhydryls.
All mutants and wild-type were extensively labeled with PMAB.  After
PON, there was an extensive reduction in labeling, 60-80% reduction
in comparison with respective controls (these were shown on SDS-PAGE
gels transferred to blots and the incubated with peroxidase-conjugated
avidin).  Results using BIAM were the same.  Quantitation done using
an ELISA format produced the same results.
<p>
PON reduced labeling with the sulfhydryl reagent PMAB equally among
the single mutants of Tyr 423, 428, and 432, which did not differ from
reaction with wild type.  500 &micro;M DTNB reduces TH activity to 20% of
control, and 500 &micro;M pCMB reduced TH activity to 50% of control.
These concentrations of pCMB and DTNB inhibiting TH activity also reduced
PMAB labeling.  The percentage reduction in PMAB labeling was identical
to the extend of inhibition of TH activity.

Species differences in the expression of multiple tyrosine hydroxylase
protein isoforms
<p class="Para1">
Medullae were excised from previously frozen whole adrenal glands.
The MW range of TH subunits in adrenal medullae from various species
is 58-64 kDa.  Immunoblotting of medullary extracts was done using
three polyclonals from rabbit against rat TH holoenzyme, hTH-1
peptide sequence EAIMSPRF, hTH-2 peptide sequence IMVRGQSP.  As an
additional control, a mouse monoclonal against rat TH holoenzyme was
also used.  The anti-hTH1-peptide failed to cross-react with any of the
the rodent TH except for guinea pig:  no bands were observed for
purified rat TH (two lanes); rat, mouse, and hamster extract; nor
for a recombinant hTH2 isoform expressed in 3T3 cells.  Strong reactions
were seen for recombinant hTH1 in 3T3 cells; human, galago (bushbaby)
primate, cow, sheep, dog TH in medullary extracts, and weakly reacting
with rhesus.  The VT dipeptide occurs only in rodent, whereas IM occurs
in all other mammalian species.  Because the guinea pig does react, this
argues against guinea pig descending from the rodent line.
<p>
hTH2 isoform immunoreactivity showed only three bands, in the human
and rhesus medullary extracts, and in the hTH2 recombinants in 3T3.
Because hTH2 was not detected in subprimates but in anthropoid
but not prosimian primates, with no cross-reactivity with hTH1.
<p>
Mouse anti-rat TH was used to examine the rat adrenal extracts with
over a 50-fold range of protein concentration (from 0.5 to 32 &micro;g
in successive lanes).  The presence of only one band demonstrates that
only one protein isoform is present in adrenals of rat.  This puts to
rest speculation that more than one isoform is produced in rat based
on a finding of more than one alternatively spliced variant of TH mRNA.

Mass Mapping Sites of Nitration in Tyrosine Hydroxylase:  Random
vs Selective Nitration of Three Tyrosine Residues
<p class="Para1">
Singly, doubly, and triply nitrated forms of peptide with residues V410-E436 
were obtained by endoproteinase Glu-C (Glu-C) digestion of peroxynitrite 
(PON)-treated recombinant TH.  130 &micro;g TH was first cleaned on a Waters 
Alliance 2695 (with 2487 dual wavelength detection set at 214 nm) in 20-65% ACN 
gradient in 0.1% TFA solvent (in-house dist. water used) over a 60 min time 
using Vydac C<sub>18</sub> with 5 &micro;m particle size.  It was recovered and 
then digested.
<p>
These nitrated forms were separated on microbore reversed-phase HPLC with 50 
&micro;l/min flow in a 1 &times; 150 mm ODS column.  Peptides were followed over a 
complex elution protocol at 214 and 350 nm (the latter wavelength look for 
nitrotyrosine-containing peptides).  Glu-C digestion is known to cut TH at E409 
and E436, which contains Y423, Y428, and Y432.  Measurement of 214 nm peak areas 
indicate that most of the peptide of PON-treated TH is unmodified.  The 
mononitrated peptide elutes at 51 min in the program (~37.5% ACN).  This is 
followed a minute or so later by dinitrated (38.2% ACN) and then by trinitrated 
peptide (39% ACN).
<p>
MALDI MS analysis showed that the mononitro peptide contained trace amounts of 
unmodified peptide but no dinitro forms.  The mononitrated V410-E436 peptide was 
digested with Asp-N to cleave at D425, and the digest run on RP-HPLC.  Two 350 
nm peaks were resolved in the 40-50 min period.  The peak eluting first was 
mononitrated V410-Q424 and a mononitro D425-E436 was also obtained as the later 
peak;  the later peak was twice as abundant at the first, based on peak heights. 
MALDI MS of the V410-Q424 fragment showed a peak at <i>m/z</i> 1723.8, which was 
promptly fragmented with a loss of 16 Da (indicating breakdown of the nitro 
group with a lost oxygen atom).  Hence Y423 is present.  MALDI MS of the second 
peak revealed a set of peaks consistent with a copper adduct of nitrated 
D425-E436 (i.e., [M<sub>NO<sub>2</sub></sub> + Cu]<sup>+</sup>.  This peptide 
was treated with 200 &micro;M bicinchoninic acid, which chelates Cu[I] ion. 
Re-analysis shows a set of peaks with the largest at <i>m/z</i> 1521.8 Da, 
indicating a mononitro form.
<p>
D425-E436 was then subjected to an LC-MS tandem analysis (LC/MS/MS). A singly 
charged peptide with monoisotopic mass of 1520.5 Da (calculated 1520.7 Da) was 
isolated and subjected to collision-induced dissociation (CID). and then the 
MS<sup>2</sup> analysis, but no ions above the minimal detectable threshold of 
<i>m/z</i> 405 were obtained.  The base of the full scan spectrum was at 
<i>m/z</i> 787.2 for the component of interest. This represents a doubly charged 
ion [M + Fe<sup>3+</sup> &ndash; H]<sup>2+</sup>.  A peak with 15% relative 
intensity was found at <i>m/z</i> 1573.2 and represents [M + Fe<sup>3+</sup> 
&ndash; 2H]<sup>+</sup>.  The iron and copper ions were clearly contaminants 
obtained from the use of in-house distilled water used in the HPLC separation. 
Repeated CID and analysis by MS<sup>2</sup> of the ion represented by peak at 
<i>m/z</i> 787.2 produced spectra with many peaks.  The peptide had to fragment 
between Y428 and Y432, and peaks at <i>m/z</i> 840.2, 886.3, 894.2, 931.0, and 
1050.0 and this fragmentation pattern shows that Y428 and Y432 are nitrated.
