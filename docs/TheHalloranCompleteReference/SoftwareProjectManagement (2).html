<h1>Big Picture of Project Management</h1>
<p>
Focus is on creating &amp; updating software.  Project management focuses on 
9 areas to be managed, shown in table below (these are from PMI).
<table class="td-left" style="font-size:83%;">
<caption>The Nine Project Management Knowledge Areas</caption>
<tr><th>Knowledge Area   <th>What It Does
<tr><td>Scope Management
  <td>Control of planning, execution, and content of the project, paying 
attention to project scope and product scope so that intended software is
resulting software
<tr><td>Time Management 
  <td>Managing schedule so that it meets deadline
<tr><td>Cost Management
  <td>All about budgeting, cost estimation, cost control
<tr><td>Quality Management
  <td>Ensuring deliverable has expected or better-than-expected quality: this
may involve testing and proof of good testing
<tr><td>Human Resources Management
  <td>This is about putting together the right team and may involve hiring process.
People may be employees or contractors
<tr><td>Communications Management
  <td>90% of a PM's effort is in communicating effectively and in making sure
that team members are informed
<tr><td>Risk Management
  <td>This is about anticipating risks (planning for all possible things going
wrong or crises) and how to handle them
<tr><td>Procurement Management
  <td>All about engaging vendors in contracting for goods and services.
<tr><td>Integration Management
   <td>Knowledge acquired in one area affects other knowledge areas.
</table>
<p>
<b>Operations</b> is a term describing day-to-day activities of an organization.
These are not projects.  Rather operations may be about doing projects.  However
some companies treat all operations as projects, and this is called management
by projects.
<p>
Projects have constraints, which are usually:
<ul>
<li>resource constraints: includes team members who have too many projects and
cannot divide time
<li>tight deadlines
<li>budgetary limitations
<li>government regulations
<li>software limitations
<li>scope limitation: required to use an existing interface
<li>hardware requirements
<li>all else restricting options
</ul>
<p>
There are three universal constraints on projects, forming an <q>iron triangle</q>
affecting quality: time, cost, and scope.
<p>
Particularly for scope there are two scopes:
<ul>
<li><b>product scope</b><br>
all features and components of the finished deliverable are described, listed,
and categorized
<li><b>project scope</b><br>
all the required work to create project deliverable: work, activities, and
progress to achieve product scope; must be protected from unapproved changes
</ul>
<p>
Software project success usually have projects ending on time and as planned.
These usually have 3 things in common:
<ul>
<li>a leader who knows what he/she is doing
<li><a href="">tight change control system</a>
<li>team members understanding what project should deliver
</ul>
<p>
Projects often limp to finish line, overbudget, late, and demoralizing. Done but
not done well and they have three attributes:
<ul>
<li>project customers have poor requirements
<li>project manager poorly communicating
<li>team is demoralized
</ul>
<p>
Project failures are those never finished, missing deadlines, blowing budgets,
or having changes of scope that even the PM doesn't know what is being made.
Attributes are:
<ul>
<li>no clear vision of priorities
<li>no leadership from project manager or sponsor
<li>timid project manager
<li>PM has no autonomy
<li>resumes being typed in unison
</ul>
<p>
<b>Process groups</b>.  This is a mini life cycle moving project one step closer
to completion. They are cycles because processes happen repeatedly as needed.
The figure below 
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesSoftwareProjectManagementHTML/process-groups.png"
  alt="process groups: initiating, planning, controlling, executing, closing">
<p>
These process groups are:
<ul>
<li><b>initiating</b>: where things are now, in process of getting selected,
sponsored, funded and launched
<li><b>planning</b>: determines how the project is achieved; note that project
can go into planning based on the controlling processes
<li><b>executing</b>: this is about doing the work according to plan
<li><b>controlling</b>: this is the PM's work in controlling the team
<li><b>closing</b>: project work completed, tying up loose ends, and closing
out project
</ul>
<p>
In developing project cost, the attempt will be to set the cost as the 
<b>baseline</b>, and then set a range comprising the variances which are 
acceptable low and high values. The actual cost is then tracked over time.

<h1>Initiation</h1>
<p>
Projects must have <b>purpose</b>.  At least two important questions must be
asked:
<ol>
<li>Why is the project being initiated?
<li>Does everyone agree on purpose and goals?
</ol>
<p>
Understanding the purpose is the key to asking the right questions that create
the solution and solving the problem.
<p>
Important is understanding what the stakeholders want, whether customers or
senior management.  There are 5 questions a PM should ask stakeholders:
<ol>
<li><b>What are the factors for completion?</b><br>
This answers what the project will accomplish and help in planning how to get 
there. Qualifications must be understood to be ready for work. Without knowing 
the end result, don't start the project
<li><b>What is goal of project</b>?<br>
This should be obvious.
<li><b>What are areas of organization this project will affect?</b><br>
This provides information for setting up paths of communication, who must be
in the loop at meetings and communications.
<li><b>What is the priority?</b><br>
This determines the allocation of time and resources according to the schedule,
and it determines the schedule.
<li><b>What is the accepted range of variance?</b><br>
This is the low and high values offset from the baseline both on budget and
schedule.
</ol>
<p>
The project must align with the vision and specifics of the executives. Kill the
project if the executives are not getting it.  Executives should be questioned
for the factors for success, how the result aligns with the vision, what's 
more important: time or budget, and the risks.
<p>
At the level of functional management (below the executive), they carry out the
visions of executives.  Tactics, strategy, and delivery of purpose is their role.
They need to understand the <i>what</i> of project management.  They will want
or need to know details of schedule and cost and what areas of organization are
affected.  Several questions addressed to them are factors for success, 
project end date and scheduling issues, resources available for software 
creation, departments and customer interaction, team assembly, whether preset
budget is in mind, and risks.
<p>
The people in operations are at the bottom of the organization but vital, since
they do the work.
<p>
<b>Consensus</b>. At this point it is vital to get stakeholders in agreement
of what the project is about, to find the common ground.  This can be done 
in several ways:
<ul>
<li><b>conducting interviews</b>: meeting with the key stakeholders must be
done to be clear about goals and what deliverables will be
<li><b>root cause analysis</b>:  suppose project creates software to solve
problems of multiple databases and recursion issues, then a root cause analysis
can help design a solution examining potential causes to specific problems.
The figure below shows an Ishikawa diagram, or cause and effect diagram, or 
fishbone diagram; the recursion issue has causes in network speed, multiple
databases, poor coding, etc.
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesSoftwareProjectManagementHTML/ishikawa-diagram.png"
  alt="Ishikawa diagram, cause and effect diagram, fishbone diagram">
<li><b>do a business analysis</b>: a business analyst is sometimes the go-between
for project manager and key stakeholders; they will gather and prioritize the
project needs
<li><b>walk a mile in stakeholders' shoes</b>: if an order form for the web is
being used, then check the current ordering process to see why the project
is necessary
</ul>
<p>
<b>Politics</b>. There are some things to be careful of in pursuing the project:
<ul>
<li>Do not agree or contribute to complaining, gossip or moaning about problems
or project solutions
<li>Avoid the negative: don't say anything about anyone you would not say to 
that person's face. Share constructive criticism openly, and be complimentary 
when possible
<li>If you're right, don't give in to what is wrong. Combine tact, honesty, 
and logic without giving ground. Admit when you're wrong too.
<li>Software PMs usually have worked with different software languages, developed
applications, and can out-code team members. But not on the project: the time
is to lead and guide, and not do the work itself
<li>Be fair with everyone, don't play favorites.
</ul>
<h2>Initiation</h2>
<p>
Projects can involve solving problems, capturing opportunities,
making profits, improving existing environments, speeding up or making more 
efficient processes.  Identifying why the project is being done is important.
Once that is done, the rest of the intiation can involve steps such as:
<ul>
<li><b>Feasibility study</b>: the examines high-level goals of project; the 
resources needed; factors influencing project success. The study reveals whether
project can accomplish objectives of time, cost and scope. Study results show
whether project is stopped, outsourced, put back on drawing board, or divided
into multiple projects
<li><b>Knowing the deliverable</b>: once project is feasible, then the product
must be described and this is a prelude to knowing project scope.  These will be
design documents usually when it comes to software.
<li><b>Project charter</b>: this is written by person who has authority to make
project get on the ground, the one who authorizes funds and resources. This can
be written by the PM, but will be signed off by the one with the power (project
sponsor).
</ul>
<p>
In particular the product description should be as detailed as possible or 
there will be headaches later.  Most likely not all details will be fully 
understood until the project team is assembled, but as much as can be known 
now will help later.
<p>
<b>Project Charter</b>.  This should identify the PM and the sponsor. It 
authorizes the PM to use/spend resources on the project.  It contains the
product description. It addresses the business need the project undertaken to
represent.

<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>
The planning process is the 2nd process group. This gets the project rolling
in a big way. Planning will occur mostly in the planning phase. The plan will be
drafted and revised several times until there is a consensus that it is right.
Approaches to planning can be the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Rolling wave planning:</b> this is the plan-work-plan-work cycle, which
is okay for software projects
<li><b>Scrum:</b> This is a quick, usually daily meeting to plan, talk about 
what is done so far, what will be done today, and addressing issues for next week
<li><b>Extreme programming:</b> this involves rounds of planning, testing, 
team involvement, execution.  Communication and teamwork are features. Look 
up what eXtreme programming is.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Using A Worksheet</b>. Create a spreadsheet that logs mistakes and successes,
which becomes the Lessons-Learned document. It is vital to keep a record now
of what goes wrong and what goes right for future projects.
<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>
The work is authorized now and the activities of the project are begun.  In this
process group:
<ul>
<li>procurement activities start, if needed
<li>work with quality assurance programs
<li>communciation with project stakeholders
<li>manage risk assessments
<li>develop the project team
<li>deal with conflicts among team members
</ul>
<h2>Control of Project</h2>
<p>
Simultaneous with execution is the control of the project. This means that
execution is going according to plan. Control of the projects components:
quality, scope, budgets, schedule, risks.
<h2>Close</h2>
<p>
Closing is full of activities actually, it is not the end of activity.
<ul>
<li>Financial matters are resolved, with verification of procurement
documents and deliverables, and settling accounts.
<li>Final acceptance of the customer must be obtained for the product
<li>Final reports must be prepared and submitted, addressing planned amounts
versus actual amounts spent or consumed. The documentation is part of the
deliverable.
</ul>
<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
<p>
These are everyone with vested interest, from end user to project sponsor
to team member. Be particularly attentive to stakeholders concerned about cost
and return on investment.  At the initiation, there has not been a real 
idea of cost. Don't commit to any number or else you can be held to it.  If
they insist, come up with a reasonably high value that might be the upper limit
on budget variance.

<h2>Feasibility Study</h2>
<p>
Generally the feasibility study looks at the <b>constraints</b> on the project,
examining details of scope and looking at issues. As PM, the role may be to 
list the facts to someone and let them determine feasibility.
<p>
These studies do require time and resources though, and they may not be 
available, so no feasibility is done.
<p>
For large projects it is worth the effort: they save time and money and they
do a good job of bringing out what the risks are, which must be identified in
project planning phase anyway.
<p>
Feasibility studies are not research papers as they only explore the chance of
a project for success.  They are not used to promote points of view but look
at the project neutrally, dispassionately. Alternative ideas should be presented
along with the merits and pitfalls of the project.  These studies do not try
to elicit more time and funds for a project either: if management pushes a
hard deadline or scrimps on money, a risk should be identified.  Most importantly
a feasibility study does not promote or discourage the project, but just
presents facts.
<p>
Generally feasibility studies are conducted by a business analyst or consultant
or subject matter expert (SME). Outsiders have nothing at stake so might possibly
be more objective. SMEs can be found by a variety of means, but one is 
referrals from colleagues.  Consultants should have experience in the technology,
not just in doing studies. Consultants should listen to stakeholders, all of them,
before reporting out their work.  The SME should also be involved with the 
project rather than remaining at a distance.

<h2>Understanding How Executives Select Projects</h2>
<p>
With limited capital and need to prioritize time, some projects go ahead of
others and many go nowhere. Projects in a queue get selected in one of two ways:
<ol>
<li><b>constrained optimization</b>: this actually makes use of computer
algorithms to select the project, with many variables as inputs
<li><b>benefit comparison methods</b>: the most commonly used approach in which
accessible formulas, comparison models and systems choose which projects to 
launch
</ol>
<p>
The benefit comparison model basically selects the project with the (most number
of) best attributes. A scoring model might be used (see sample table below)
<table class="td-center"> 
<caption>Sample Scoring Model</caption>
<tr><th>Project        <th>Experience <th>Schedule  <th>Cost <th>Portfolio <th>Final Score
<tr><td class="left">Project ABC    <td>10        <td>5         <td>3    <td>8          <td>26
<tr><td class="left">Code &amp; Code Project<td>4  <td>9         <td>4    <td>6          <td>23
<tr><td class="left">Web App Project<td>7        <td>2         <td>9    <td>7          <td>25
<tr><td class="left">Patch &amp; Fix Project<td>7<td>6         <td>5    <td>2          <td>20
</table>
<p>
The highest scoring projects usually get launch.
<p>
<b>Facing Murder Board.</b> These are committees who are designed to be the 
devil's advocate on a project.  They probe for project weaknesses. It also 
sizes up the PM, favoring those who work well under pressure. To prepare for the
committee, come up with questions thought to be asked and have ready answers for
them.
<p>
<b>The ROI.</b>  All projects expect a return on investment. There should be
a very clear calculation (or estimate) about the earned value.  The result of the
project should be greater than the costs expended doing the project.  The 
present and future values must be compared: this comparison is what the company
would benefit if it had just invested the money on the project into an 
interest-bearing account instead.  Use this formula:
<p class="eqn-serif">
<b>future value</b> = present value &times; (1 + <i>i</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup>
<p>
If someone claims that 5 years from now a deliverable will be worth $275,000.
Suppose there is a 6% interest rate.  This means that the present value is
$205,000. Thus if a project costs more than $205,000, it is better to leave
the money to collect interest.
<p>
Software is delivered in stages or versions. With each release, the organization
hopes that the net value is increased. The <b>net present value</b> which is
greater than zero promises at least some profit.  Computation is shown in the
table below for software that has a yearly release. The steps are:
<ol>
<li>Determine present value for each annual release
<li>Find sum of each release's present value
<li>Subtract original investment from sum of present value
</ol>
<table class="td-center">
<caption>Finding Net Present Value</caption>
<tbody>
<tr><th> Year          <th> Future Value      <th> Present Value
<tr><td> 1             <td> $35,000           <td> $33,019
<tr><td> 2             <td> $48,000           <td> $42,720
<tr><td> 3             <td> $81,000           <td> $68,009
<tfoot>
<tr><td colspan="2" class="left">Sum PV values             <td> $143,748
<tr><td class="left">Investment      <td> $97,000         <td>
<tr><td colspan="2" class="left">
   NPV (Sum of PV values &minus; Investment)<td> $46,748
</table>
<p>
The NPV will be a decision tool for helping in deciding what projects get cut
first. They are really used for determining which projects are worth the time.
<h2>Writing Product Description</h2>
<p>
This is written in the initiation phase because it accurately says what the 
project creates. It is put down on paper to remind everyone of the goal.
Description is about the deliverables, the function of the deliverablse, and
how product affects organization.  This is the <b>product scope</b>.  Note it
is not the <a href="#scope">project scope</a>!
<p>
A good product scope defines or describes the following:
<ul>
<li>overall software function
<li>features of software to be created or revised
<li>purpose of project work: solving problem, getting opportunity, or something
else
<li>optional or desired components that may be incorporated at PM's discretion
<li>metrics for product acceptance: speed, reliability, consistency as examples
<li>expectation of performance of product vendors who may be contracted 
in the project
</ul>
<p>
<b>Statement of Work (SOW)</b>.  In working with a vendor, a contract will be
developed and in the contract is a Statement of Work which is included in the
product description.  More about the SOW and contracts with vendors is described
<a href="#goods-services">later</a>

<h2>Wish List</h2>
<p>
With a project about to begin, make a mental checklist: what's needed, who will
be on the team, resources to gather.
<p>
<b>Tools.</b>  Few projects get done without tools. These might be hardware,
such as faster processors, two monitors. Or compilers for language to produce
the software. These will be among the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Development language:</b> the code to use will be that which delivers
the product in the fastest way, and also the best product for the customer.
These may not match: development environment and best quality may not go 
together.  The question is <i>time:</i>  is it available for training programmers
on the job and is too much time also too much money?
<li><b>Hardware:</b> generally with the cheapness of hardware and a team justifying
the need, then buy it.  If the need is made clear, make the hardware available.
<li><b>Training</b>: the team may already know how to do tasks without training,
but it may be required. Training becomes an investment.
<li><b>Other resources</b>: other than people, there are things, and these are
things keeping developers happy.  This means soda and pizzas to reference books
and Internet subscriptions to IT web sites.
</ul>
<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
PMs may already have a team in place they like from past projects. Or they may
get to cherry-pick from among the personnel. Others get team based on who is 
available.
<p>
Good teams have people with people skills and technical competence.  Teams are
built in four phases usually:
<ol>
<li><b>Forming:</b> People come to meetings, shake hands, converse. As PM, 
take charge, introduce people, and explain their roles
<li><b>Storming:</b> Attitudes, personalities, and alliances emerge. Someone
else will try to usurp the PM role. The PM tries to maintain influence.
<li><b>Norming:</b> This comes after all the politics have been ironed out, if
any. If the storming phase is persisting, be patient. If things are lagging,
consider replacing team members, or just dismissing them.
<li><b>Performing:</b> The team should be working on all cylinders in this phase
and even nearing completion of their tasks, according to plan, not getting
in the way of progress.
</ol>
<h2>Preferred Vendors</h2>
<p>
Be careful here. Write specifications for the contract that are well 
developed and revised. Create an algorithm of selection that avoids the 
appearance of favoritism or nepotism.  Vendors must have the right combination
of talent, experience, and competitive price.

<h2>The Charter &amp; Doomed Projects</h2>
<p>
The project sponsor must sign off on the charter after initiation is done.
The sponsor should be high up the command chain.  The sponsor should have 
authority over all resources in the project.  If the manager of a team member
will not make the team member avialable, then it is important to have as a 
sponsor someone with authority over the manager to be overruled.

<!-- Sec 3 -->
<h1 id="scope">Scope: Product &amp; Project</h1>
<p>
Product scope is knowing what the essential ingredients of the product are.
Once the product scope is agreed to, then project scope can be detailed.
Product scope helps define what a customer sees in the product. Project scope
is what the PM focuses on with respect to the work plan.
<p>
<b>Stakeholder analysis</b>.  All stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities
must be understood.  A project requires a minimum set of roles and 
responsibilities, and the people who have them must exist.  Be sure to develop
a list of questions that must and should be answered to get the project result
done right:
<ul>
<li>Please describe conditions this deliverable will operate in?
<li>What opportunity will this project grasp?
<li>What's the main problem with software solves?
<li>How do you see the deliverable solving your problem?
<li>What other software will this deliverable interact with?
<li>What are the primary and secondary features of the software?
<li>How will this software make the end-users’ jobs better or easier?
<li>Are there other stakeholders that we should consider?
<li>How do you see this deliverable benefiting your customer?
</ul>
<p>
While the stakeholder should be allowed to express himself freely, make
sure that questions are asked in getting answers for project planning.
<h2>Managing Stockholder Objectives</h2>
<p>
There will be competing interests about how the software will emerge in the end.
The important thing is to nail stakeholders down as to what the product should 
be and reinforce the idea that the version that emerges should be the one that
ends the project if it was developed as planned.
<p>
The following conflicts have been ranked in order of frequency at PMI:
<ul>
<li><b>Schedules:</b> getting team members available to do the project 
with their hectic schedules ranks the highest
<li><b>Priorities:</b> everyone has a favorite feature, idea, tool or component.
If databases are used, there are the SQL or Oracle camps. This is a source of
unhappiness
<li><b>Resources:</b> good developers are in high demand, so good luck getting
the best of what you need and want
<li><b>Technical approaches:</b> software developers rarely agree on how to 
decide on the 8 ways there are to do the same task.
<li><b>Policies, procedures:</b> the project must incorporate the bureaucratic
red tape in getting to the finish. Some are good, some are not, but plan for it.
<li><b>Costs:</b> these are tied to timeframe for R&amp;D, simulations, 
reworking kinks, learning, and productive coding.
<li><b>Personalities:</b> generally personality conflicts only appear when the
project is already stumbling, or they prevent the project from moving forward.
</ul>

<h2>Resolving Conflicts</h2>
<p>
Identifying conflicts is one thing, settling them is another. There are 
5 approaches that generally work:
<ol>
<li><b>Problem Solving</b>: this has the conflicting parties think about taking
a problem-solving attitude, telling them to work together for good of project.
This often helps to remove ego and politics, telling them it's a win-win.
<li><b>Forcing:</b> not a particularly good situation, since it's the person with
the power who decides and demands no further discussion.
<li><b>Compromising:</b> this usually means both parties in the dispute must
give up something they want.  They get part of what they want, but neither gets
everything. Ultimately this is a lose-lose situation
<li><b>Smoothing:</b> the PM and other people in power downplay differences
between stakeholders
</ol>

<h1>Planning: Estimating Time</h1>

<h1>Cost Estimation</h1>
<p>
This is the determination of the effort used for the project. The values for this
will be given in man/person-months or man/person-years.
<p>
Cost estimation is done throughout project life cycle. First is done at beginning
when requirements are outlined, and it may be frequently revised before project
start.  Continuing estimates result because more data become available.
With projects, re-estimates are done with the idea that they eventually 
converge with actual cost. However, with vendors, one has to get it right:
one cannot look over the shoulder of the vendor throughout the project to see
the vendor is saving money and will pass the savings to the project.
<p>
A historical approach to estimation would be comparing similar projects done in
the past. Estimations should be done by outsiders but they do not have some
intimate knowledge of the organization that may help the estimate. Outside 
estimators will probably use empirical methods (COCOMO).
<p>
This is the first step in estimation is to produce a <b>Cost Estimate Plan</b>. 
The plan indicates the data to be obtained, why it is obtained, and the goal for 
the cost estimation. When the data determination is made, this sets the metrics 
level of detail for cost estimation. Data that is not specified for gathering 
should not be obtained since it is a waste of time.
<p>
In the 2nd step cost estimation is done based on requirements. Project 
decomposition can be done if a lower level of abstraction needed for data.
Use more than one method of estimation since there is no perfect technique.
If there are wide variances from the different method estimates, re-evaluate
the information used to make the estimates.

<h2>Cost Estimation Process</h2>
<p>
Results of cost estimation cannot be understood if the process is not understood.
The process is a set of techniques and procedures used to derive the cost estimate.
Most models consider models who estimation of cost is a function of the cost
drivers.  The primary cost driver (or most important) is believed to be the
software requirements. A cost driver will be anything that affects the cost of
the software: design methodology, skill levels, risk assessment, experience of
personnel, which programming language used, complexity of system.
<p>
In the classical view of the estimation process, three outputs are generated (see
figure below)
<ol>
<li>effort <br>
time/labor in person-months (PM) or man-months (MM)
<li>duration <br>
estimated time to complete project
<li>loading <br>
should be a plot showing allocation of number of personnel to project as function
of time
</ol>
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesSoftwareProjectManagementHTML/software-estimation-process-classical-view.png"
  alt="classical view of the software cost estimation process">
<p>
But the actual process is more complex or richly detailed.  The inputs are not
only cost drivers having vague requirements of the software and other factors,
but also the constraints both financial and in resources as well as risk factors,
fuzzy architecture, and the software process. Cost estimation often requires 
using an existing architecture or software in place. Experienced estimators 
detect ambiguities and inconsistencies in all requirements, which might be solved
by modifying the requirements. Any ambiguous and inconsistent requirements 
remaining unsolved affect estimation accuracy.
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesSoftwareProjectManagementHTML/software-estimation-process-actual-view.png"
  alt="actual view of the software cost estimation process">

<h2>Cost Estimation Accuracy</h2>
<p>
First the measure of performance of the accuracy of the cost estimation model
is based on certain parameters:
<ul>
<li>Absolute error = Predicted Estimate (Epred) &minus; Actual Cost (Eact)
<li>Relative error = (Epred &minus; Eact) / Eact
<li>Mean Magnitude of Relative Error
</ul>
<p>
Absolute error fails to take into account the size of the project, and 
the mean magnitude of relative error masks systematic bias, meaning one does not
know if the estimation is over or under.

<h2>Cost Estimation Methodology</h2>
<h3>Algorithmic (Parametric) Model</h3>
<p>
Here a set of mathematical equations are used to arrive at cost estimation.
These equations combine theory supported by historical data. The inputs are
source line of code (SLOC), function points, and other cost drivers. Calibration
based on the software environment can be used to improve the estimation.
Examples are COCOMO, COCOMO II, Putnam's software life cycle model (SLIM).
There are advantages and disadvantages with this approach:
<ul class="no-marker">
<li>Advantages
 <ul>
 <li>generate repeatable estimations
 <li>easy to modify input data
 <li>easy to refine and customize formulas
 <li>objectively calibrated to experience
 </ul>
<li>Disadvantages
 <ul>
 <li>unable to deal with exceptional conditions
 <li>some experience and factors cannot be quantified
 <li>sometimes algorithms may be proprietary
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Expert Judgment (Expertise-Based)</h3>
<p>
The knowledge and experience of the estimator are taken in these techniques and
based on similar projects in which they participated. Delphi, Wideband Delphi
and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) are examples.
<ul class="no-marker">
<li>Advantages
 <ul>
 <li>useful in absence of quantified, empirical data
 <li>ability to factor in differences between past project experiences and
 proposed project requirements
 <li>ability to factor in impacts of new technologies, applications, languages
 </ul>
<li>Disadvantages
 <ul>
 <li>estimate is only as good as the expert's opinion
 <li>hard to document factors used by experts
 </ul>
</ul>
