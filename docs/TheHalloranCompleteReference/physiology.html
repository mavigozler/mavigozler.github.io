		Signaling by extracellular secreted molecules can be classified into three
		types, <dfn>endocrine</dfn>, <dfn>paracrine</dfn> or <dfn>autocrine</dfn>.
		Additionally, certain membrane-bound proteins on one cell can directly
		signal an adjacent cell.

		<ul>
			<li><b>Endocrine signaling</b>
				<br>signaling molecules act on target cells distant from their site
     of synthesis by cells of endocrine organs
			</li>
			<li><b>Paracrine signaling</b>
				<br>signaling molecules released by a cell only affect target cells
       in close proximity
			</li>
			<li><b>Autocrine signaling</b>
				<br>cells respond to substances that they themselves release
			</li>
		</ul>

		There are some convenient generic assay kits to determine and quantitate
		metabolic activation, such as the Cytosensor microphysiometer.
		<h1>Membrane Physiology</h1>
		Membranes maintain electrochemical gradients (electric and chemical
		potentials) for all sorts of solutes, ionic and nonionic. The
		expression of the electrical potential is the Nernst equation:

		</table>
		where
		<ul style="list-style-type:none;margin-left:2em;">
			<li><i>V</i><sub>m</sub> is the membrane voltage (potential)
			</li>
			<li><i>R</i> is molar gas constant (8.314 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>
			</li>
			<li><i>T</i> is absolute temperature (typically 298 K)
			</li>
			<li><i>c</i><sub>o</sub> is extracellular concentration of ion
			</li>
			<li><i>z</i> is charge/valence of ion
			</li>
			<li><span style="font-family:'Formal Script','Brush Script',cursive;">F</span>
				is Faraday's constant (96,500 C mol<sup>−1</sup>)
			</li>
			<li><i>c</i><sub>i</sub> is intracellular concentration of ion
			</li>
		</ul>
		The sum of all individual ionic potentials for the resting (steady-state)
		membrane provides for an overall potential of −70 mV. Note that
		when the value is less than zero, there would be a tendency for
		positive ions to move from inside to outside, or for negative ions
		to move from outside to inside. If greater than zero, positive ions
		want to move from outside to inside, and negative ions from inside
		to outside. The resting membrane potential favors overall inward
		rectification for positive ions, outward for negative ions.
		<p>
			The potential of Na<sup>+</sup> is +59 mV (assuming 142 mM outside and
			14 mM inside), indicating the free energy favors inward rectification.
			The potential of K<sup>+</sup> is −91 mV, indicating free energy
			toward outward rectification.

		</p>
		<h2>Calcium Movement</h2>
		The existence of voltage- and membrane (G) protein-regulated ion channels
		for sodium, potassium, and chloride particularly in excitable tissues,
		is focused largely on whether calcium ion channels are to be opened.
		Action potentials move down axons to end terminals, where depolarization
		results in changes (openings) of voltage-sensitive or voltage-operated
		calcium channels (often called VOCs). These channels open when membrane
		potential is about −30 mV, and so open with depolarization. It
		has been theorized and proven that adjusting the extracellular concentration
		of potassium to 40 mM and above will bring the membrane potential to a
		point that allows the opening of VOCs.

		<h1>First Messengers</h1>

		tissues that produce and secrete them, their target or target tissues or

		<h1>Second Messenger Systems</h1>

		Second messengers are basically the intracellularly transduced
		signalling systems that start at the plasma membrane of the
		cell, and which require a first messenger to initiate them through
		a specific receptor. Without a ligand-bound receptor, there is
		no second messenger.
		<p>
			The interaction of cyclic nucleotides, their synthesizers and their
			hydrolases, make simplistic models regarding how metabolism is altered
			impossible.

		</p>
		<h2>Cyclic AMP</h2>
		All ligand-activated receptors that act via G proteins to converge
		in the activation of adenyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP.
		cAMP binds to regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase
		(PKA) to release as monomers catalytic subunits which go on to phosphorylate
		a variety of proteins. The target protein substrates that get phosphorylated
		depend on the cell type and its gene expression profile. In smooth
		muscle cells, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is phosphorylated,
		resulting in its inhibition (deactivation). Since active MLCK
		phosphorylates myosin light chains to enable muscular contraction, its
		inhibition would therefore result in relaxation, the ultimate effect
		of this signalling system. PKA also activates the
		Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase which has the effect of stimulating
		the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> antiporter (exchanger) to flush calcium
		from inside the cell. It also phosphorylates membrane proteins (PLC) to
		inhibit PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolytic activity and the phosphoinositol pathway.

		<h2>Cyclic GMP</h2>
		Guanyl cyclase converts GTP to cGMP.

		<h3>cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG)</h3>
		Two types of PKG have been identified, type I and II PKG. Type I PKG also has
		<i>α</i> and <i>β</i> subtypes. Smooth muscle is rich in both
		subtypes of type I PKG, while type II PKG is found largely in epithelium
		of intestinal mucosa.
		<p>PKG can be activated directly by cAMP as well
			if cyclic nucleotide levels are extremely high. This actually becomes
			inportant in terms of how NO levels contribute either to the cAMP- or
			cGMP-dependent pathways (see Nitric Oxide).

		</p>
		<h2>Phosphodiesterases</h2>
		These hydrolases of cyclic nucleotides are important in the second messenger
		system if only for the reason that they modulate or attenuate the response,
		as every signal needs to be turned off at some point. Phosphodiesterases
		(PDE) are therefore essential in constitutively reducing cyclic nucleotide
		levels.
		<p>
			Nine (9) isozymes of PDE are known. There is generally significant
			sequence homology, and some proteins may be generated from transcript
			alternative splicing. Type III PDE in adipocytes is activated by PKA
			phosphorylation, and in platelets it is phosphorylated (and activated?).
			In bronchiolar smooth muscle PKA activation actually inhibits type III PDE.
		</p>
		<p>
			Types III and IV PDE target cAMP directly, and type V in lung, vascular
			and bronchiolar smooth muscle is specific for cGMP. Type I hydrolyzes
			both cAMP and cGMP and is regulated by calcium (binds to
			Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin for activation). Type II PDE is stimulated
			by levels of cGMP, while type III is inhibited by cGMP. Type VI
			is apparently specific for photoreception and anchored to membranes
			via an isoprenylation, and type VII has been found to be
			rolipram-insensitive. Very specific inhibitors exist for all types
			except Types VIII and IX (only recently sequenced).

		</p>
		<h2>Phosphatidylinositol</h2>
		A component of any active biomembrane is
		phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>).
		G protein-coupled receptors can activate phospholipase C, an
		enzyme which specifically hydrolyzes PIP<sub>2</sub> to
		make diacylglyceral (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
		[IP<sub>3</sub>]. DAG activates protein kinase C (which is also
		calcium-dependent), while IP<sub>3</sub> binds to channel
		proteins in endoplasmic reticulum to cause an increase in
		intracellular calcium. IP<sub>3</sub> can also be modified by
		kinases and phosphatases to be involved in other signaling pathways.
		<p>
			PIP<sub>2</sub> can be phosphorylated on the membrane to
			phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), by
			the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In particular PIP<sub>3</sub>
			accumulates when protein tyrosine kinases are activated; its
			presence modulates activities of effector such as the G protein Rac
			and the Ser/Thr protein kinase B (Akt). PIP<sub>2</sub> also
			binds to pleckstrin homology domain, allowing it to dock with proteins
			having the PH domain.

		</p>
		<h3>Phospholipase C</h3>
		Based on amino acid sequence information, this enzyme classed into
		four types. Ten isozymes in mammals (four PLC-β, two PLC-γ,
		and four PLC-δ) identified. PLC-α shown to be a fragment
		of PLC-δ1. Recently a PLC-ε was identified.
		PLC-δ appears to be found in all eukaryotes, while the beta,
		gamma, and epsilon forms are found only in higher eukaryotes (not
		yeast or slime molds). PLC-δ is about 85 kDa, and PLC-β and
		-γ are 120-155 kDa, and PLC-ε is 230-260 kDa. Sequence
		conservation is limited to the X and Y domains forming the catalytic
		core. Considerable variation exists between types in terms of length
		and composition of sequences between X and Y domains; the γ-type
		features two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and one SH3 domain (these
		bind P-Tyr and Pro-rich sequences, resp.).
		<p>
			The PH domain is found in amino terminus of β-, γ, and δ-types.
			This binds to polyphosphoinositides of all kinds, and this presumably
			allows these polyphosphoinositides to regulate PLC activity. Some
			PLC forms are catalytically inactive, resulting from splice variants
			where the important X domain is altered. It is not known entirely if
			there is a useful function: one isoform binds IP<sub>3</sub> and may
			inhibit the latter's interaction with ryanodine receptors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Three-dimensional structures for a PLC-δ1 mutant lacking the PH
			domain and a structure of the PH domain itself have been determined.
			Four domains are revealed:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>PH domain: binds to IP<sub>3</sub> and PIP<sub>2</sub>
			</li>
			<li>EF hand
			</li>
			<li>catalytic domain of tightly associated X and Y domains
			</li>
			<li>C2 domain
			</li>
		</ul>
		The amino terminus PH domain in PLC-δ contains several Lys
		in close proximity which directly interact with phosphates,
		showing the high affinity electrostatic interactions. Residue
		modification shows lowered affinity and catalytic activity.
		PLC-γ PH domains bind to PIP<sub>3</sub> and not PIP<sub>2</sub>.
		PLC-β appears to bind specifically to PI-3P, suggesting
		it is recruited to membranes when PI3K is activated. In addition
		PLC-β binds to the βγ subunits of G proteins, and there
		may be a cooperative recruitments between PI-3P and G proteins to
		recruit PLC-β.
		<p>
			All forms of PLC are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent. Both structure and
			mutation studies reveal residues involved in Ca-binding, substrate
			recognition and catalysis. Lys438, Ser522, and Arg549 of rat PLC-δ1
			are involved in hydrolysis; replacing Lys440 affected only PIP<sub>2</sub>
			hydrolysis.
		</p>
		<p>
			The C2 domain may be important in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediate binding
			of the enzyme to membrane acidic phospholipids. PLC-δ1 C2 domain
			may promote formation of enzyme-PtdSer-Ca<sup>2+</sup>. PLC-β
			C2 domain has no affinity for membrane bilayers when calcium is present;
			it does interact with activated α subunits of G<sub>q</sub> proteins.
		</p>
		<p>
			EF hands typically bind calcium too (some variants do not). However
			in PLC, it may just be a flexible link between PH domain and the rest
			of the protein. Other evidence indicates EF-hand does bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>
			and this is necessary to mediate interaction between PH and PIP<sub>2</sub>.
		</p>
		<h3>G protein interactions</h3>
		Of the four G protein subfamilies (G<sub>s</sub>α,
		G<sub>i</sub>α, G<sub>q</sub>α, and G<sub>12</sub>α),
		the G<sub>q</sub>α subunits activate only PLC-β of all the
		PLC types. Four subtypes of PLC-β differ in their tissue distributions:
		β2 in hematopoietic cells, β4 in retina and certain neuronal types,

		<h2>Nitric oxide</h2>
		The nitric oxide synthases (NOS) activate arginine to produce the free radical
		nitric oxide and citrulline. Three synthase types have been characterized:
		<ol>
			<li>neuronal, nNOS (type I)
			</li>
			<li>inducible, iNOS (type II)
			</li>
			<li>constitutive, cNOS or eNOS (type III)
			</li>
		</ol>
		The eNOS (“endothelial” NOS) designation comes from the fact
		it was discovered in vascular endothelium. cNOS is in fact really inducible
		under conditions of regular exercise. cNOS produces NO in picomolar amounts
		within seconds to minutes. The activity of cNOS appears to be under the
		control of acetylcholine, bradykinin, histamine, and platelet
		activating factor. iNOS makes NO in the nanomolar range.
		<p>
			nNOS predominates in cholinergic cells, epithelial cells, and the
			ciliated epithelium of the respiratory system. iNOS can be found
			expressed in macrophages and eosinophils, in epithelium of asthmatics,
			and when an immune or inflammatory process is occurring.
		</p>
		<p>
			All the tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent NOS requires oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)
			as a substrate or are dependent upon oxygen, which ultimately provides
			atoms for the NO free radical product.
		</p>
		<p>
			At low levesl the product NO activates guanyl cyclases, which convert GTP to cGMP.
			Guanylate cyclase comes in two forms, a membrane-bound particulate type
			(pGC), and a cytosolic form (sGC). NO activates sGC while pGC is activated
			through GPCRs for natriuretic peptides (atrial, brain, and c-) and by
			VIP. Activation of sGC by NO involves heme group binding, although
			there is some question that it may act through another system, such
			as thiol modificiation, either in an active site or in an important
			structural change causing conformational shift. Proteins with thiol
			or active metal centers should be considered legitimate targets for NO.
		</p>
		<p>
			At higher intracellular levels (&gt; 1 mM), NO can activate PKA, can
			produce a nitrosperoxide (ONOO<sup>−</sup>) and cause
			ADP-ribosylation. Sustained high or chronic levels of NO increases
			cAMP-dependent pathways while reducing the effect of cGMP-dependent
			stimulation. In smooth muscle cGMP-dependent activation would lead
			to reduction of intracellular calcium (through inhibiting L-type
			Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and altering proteins crucial to the contractile
			process) and therefore relaxation.
		</p>
		<p>
			NO also controls gene expression. It can activate transcription factors
			such as NF-κB and activation protein-1 (AP-1). NF-κB is
			also signalled by p21<sup><i>ras</i></sup>, and AP-1 activity may
			also be directly cGMP-dependent (NO activates cGMP formation as well).


		</p>
		<h1>Receptors</h1>

		Thousands of different kinds of receptors differ from one another
		by the ligand they bind, but they all are members of one and only
		one of about a dozen types of systems generating second messengers,
		if they are involved in second messenger systems at all.
		<p>
			Receptors functioning as ion channels do not need and do not likely
			participate in second messenger signalling. The nicotinic acetylcholine
			receptors, one type of serotonin receptor, two types of dopamine
			receptors, and some monoamine and amino acid receptors are all
			ion channels, and if they induce any signalling at all, it’s as perhaps
			a side effect of ion movement.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some receptors acquire an enzymatic activity upon ligand binding. The
			insulin and many other peptide growth factor receptors become
			phosphorylated and acquire an active tyrosine phosphotransferase
			(protein kinase) ability, through which they affect intracellular
			metabolism.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other receptors couple to membrane protein assemblies and activate
			enzymatic activities in quiescent membrane-bound proteins, or cause
			cytosolic proteins or substances to become membrane-bound and, more
			importantly, activated.

		</p>
		<h2>G Protein-Coupled Receptors</h2>
		G proteins are discussed in the previous section. G proteins only work when
		a hormone, or first messenger, a ligand to a receptor, binds to its specific
		receptor and the assembly is thus able to bind to the G protein assembly.
		<p>
			G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have several common characteristics.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Like many ligand-gated ion channels, they are composed of one or more
				subunits with each subunit having polypeptide sequences that span the
				membrane
			</li>
		</ol>

		The G protein is a heterotrimeric assembly of αβγ
		subunits which has an active and inactive state. In the inactive
		resting state, its α subunit is bound to GDP, associated with
		the other two subunits. When a ligand binds to a G-protein coupled
		receptor, the receptor binds with a specific G protein. This causes
		an exchange reaction, in which GDP leaves and GTP binds. The
		α subunit then become free while the β and γ subunit
		remain. The α-GTP subunit then binds a specific protein to
		activate it. At the same time, ligand is freed from binding to the
		receptor. Over time, the GTP slowly hydrolyzes, inactivating
		the α subunit. The inactive α then returns to the assembly.

		<h2><a id="moreAChR">Cholinergic system</a></h2>
		Many choline-containing substances will bind acetylcholine receptors (AChRs).
		These ligands feature a quaternary ammonium compound that binds to an
		anionic residue (in muscarinic receptors, this is an Asp residue in
		transmembrane domain III).
		<p>
			Cholinergic receptors are probably the most abundant in terms of
			where they are found in the CNS and PNS. Acetylcholine is the
			neurotransmitter of choice in the preganglionic neurons of
			both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and in the
			postganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic system.
			Cholinergic receptors must therefore be located on the
			postsynaptic membranes to elicit continued nerve transmission.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cholinergic receptors are subdivided into two types:
			<b>nicotinic</b> and <b>muscarinic</b>.
			Acetylcholine is the physiological agonist which can occupy
			both receptors under certain conditions. The <i>nicotinic</i>
			receptor is found in striated (skeletal)
			muscle innervations, autonomic ganglia, and the central nervous
			system (see table). <b><i>Nicotine</i></b> is the specific
			agonist for stimulating this receptor class, afterward blocking
			further stimulation of this receptor. The antagonists are
			typically <b>d<i>-tubocurarine</i></b>, which blocks the
			nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the skeletal muscle and
			autonomic ganglia, and <b><i>hexamethonium</i></b>, which
			principally blocks the receptors in the autonomic ganglia.
			The <i>muscarinic</i> receptor is characterized by multiple
			subtypes, M<sub>1</sub> through M<sub>5</sub>,
			which also have different affinities for different drugs.
			These receptors are activated by <b><i>muscarine</i></b>
			and the antagonist of choice for these receptors is
			<b><i>atropine</i></b>. The M<sub>1</sub> receptor is
			found primarily in the autonomic ganglia
			and CNS. The M<sub>1</sub> receptor may mediate its effect
			through G proteins to phospholipase C. The M2 receptor is
			found at the terminal arborizations in the end organ and
			in the CNS (see table); it may largely mediate its effect via
			G proteins to adenyl cyclase and on to cAMP.
		</p>
		<p>
			α-Latrotoxin is a poison released by black widow spiders
			that appears to induce a massive release of ACh. It may do this
			by acting as a Ca<i>2+</i> ionophore. Botulinum toxin from
			<i>Clostridium botulinum</i> probably works by inhibiting the release
			of ACh at all.

		</p>
		<h3>Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChRs)</h3>
		The nicotinic AChRs belong to a family of ligand-gated
		<em>ion channels</em> which includes the glycine, GABA<sub>A</sub>,
		and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors as well. Two subfamilies of nAChRs
		exist, one in the skeletal neuromuscular junction of the muscle,
		and the other in both pre- and post-synaptic elements of the CNS
		and PNS. Developing muscle is composed of a pentameric
		α1<sub>2</sub>β1γδ stucture, with the γ later
		replaced by ε in adults. The neuronal nAChRs are composed of
		a pentameric combination of just α and β, of which eight
		α types (α2 - α9) and three β (β2 - β4)
		subunits have been identified. The α subunits actually bind ACh
		and happen to be rich in disulfide-bonded cysteines. β subunits
		have no disulfide bridges or even cysteines.

		<h3>Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors (mAChRs)</h3>
		The muscarinic AChRs are ligand-binding metabotropic receptors which
		couple with G proteins. At least four types of muscarinic receptors
		M<sub>1</sub> to M<sub>4</sub> have been identified.
		These can be distinguished using radiolabeled binding compounds like
		pirenzipine, which binds M<sub>1</sub>, and methylscopolamine in the
		presence of pirenzipine, which will reveal M<sub>2</sub>.
		The mAChRs bind the natural ligand acetylcholine (ACh) as well as
		carbamylcholine and muscarine (from the fly agaric mushroom <i>Amanita muscaria</i>).
		<p>
			Metacholine is an esterase-resistant compound with high specificity
			for M<sub>3</sub> receptors, a type in abundance in smooth muscle;
			metacholine at high concentrations occupies M<sub>2</sub> receptors
			as well. M<sub>3</sub> receptors associate with G<sub>q</sub> receptors
			which activate phospholipase C (PLC) hydrolyzing PIP<sub>2</sub> to
			generate IP<sub>3</sub>: the generation of IP<sub>3</sub> to mobilize
			Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the action of protein kinase C (PKC) both contribute
			strongly to contraction.
			M<sub>2</sub> receptors are typically in presynaptic
			parasympathetic end terminals, whose function is to modulate cholinergic
			release, but these are also found in smooth muscle too. M<sub>4</sub>
			have been identified only in rabbit alveolar walls in the lung, and not
			in other species. M<sub>2</sub> absolutely couples to G<sub>i</sub>
			to inhibit or counteract activation of adenyl cyclase. In this
			way it may compete with β-adrenergic coupling to G<sub>s</sub>
			to activate adenyl cyclase in the same cell. In smooth muscle,
			elevated cAMP is associated with smooth muscle relaxation, reduced
			cAMP combined with elevated calcium is associated with contraction.

		<h2 id="moreadrenergic">Adrenergic system</h2>

		The adrenergic system uses the catecholamine neurotransmitters
		(dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) at its nerve terminals.
		These transmitters are secreted from nerve terminals in neurons
		of the CNS and from many but not all of the postganglionic
		neurons of the sympathetic PNS.

		<p>
			Receptors for these neurotransmitters also come in two classes:
			α-adrenergic and β-adrenergic.
			These receptor classes are further subdivided into particular
			classes showing different affinities for the different
			catecholamines and drugs which bind them.
		</p>
		<p>
			At least three types of β-receptors are identified.
			β<sub>1</sub> is abundant in heart and intestine,
			β<sub>2</sub> is in smooth muscle, and β<sub>3</sub>
			in adipose tissue (its has only 50% homology
			with β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub>.

		<h2><a id="monoaminergic">Monoaminergic Neurotransmitters and Receptors</a></h2>

		<h3>Serotonin</h3>
		There are at least 7 types: 5HT<sub>1</sub> to 5HT<sub>7</sub>, with
		several subtypes for certain types:
		<ul>
			<li>6 subtypes for Type 1: 5HT<sub>1A</sub> to 5HT<sub>1F</sub>
			</li>
			<li>3 subtypes for Type 2: 5HT<sub>2A</sub> to 5HT<sub>2C</sub>
			</li>
			<li>2 subtypes for Type 5: 5HT<sub>5A</sub> to 5HT<sub>5B</sub>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Certain drugs affect (block) certain subtypes. Sumatriptan blocks
			5HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> and show anti-migraine activity. Buspirone
			blocks 5HT<sub>1A</sub> and appears to be an anxiolytic. Olanzapine
			shows anti-psychotic activity and block 5HT<sub>2</sub>. Cisapride
			blocks 5HT<sub>4</sub> and nocturnal heartburn. And clozapine
			appears to have mixed receptor activity and is used in the treatment
			of schizophrenia.

		</p>
		<h3>Histamine</h3>
		The histamine GPCR has two types, H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>.
		H<sub>1</sub> receptors are important in magnifying the effects
		of allergic reactions. The drug loratradine is used to block
		the receptors. H<sub>2</sub> receptors are found in stomach lining
		(parietal cells) and overstimulation results in ulcers. The drugs
		ranitidine and cimetidine are blockers of this type.

		<h2><a id="amacidtrans">Amino Acid Neurotransmitters and Receptors</a></h2>
		<h3>Glutamate</h3>
		Glutamate is the most important neurotransmitter in the cortical areas of
		the CNS, where hierarchical neurons exist.
		<p>
			Glutamate binds to fast excitatory receptors. One kind is a metabotrophic
			G protein-coupled receptor involved in neuronal development and plasticity.
			Another kind is ionotrophic, of which there are two subtypes:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>kainate and 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)
				are selective agonists for this GluR type.
				This fast excitatory GluR opens Na channels to elicit EPSP.
				Barbituates appear to block AMPA receptors and topiramate (Topamax)
				is an antagonist with anti-epileptic properties.
			</li>
			<li>N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) with a more slower, pronounced
				depolarizing ability that involves both Na and Ca ion movement.
				Glycine may have a binding site on the NMDA receptor as well, distinct
				from the natural Glu binding site; its presence increases the
				frequency of opening; the binding of Gly is not to be confused
				with the glycine receptor found elsewhere.
			</li>
		</ol>
		AMPA and NMDA GluR receptors appear to co-localize to activate simultaneously.
		<p>
			NMDA GluR also has a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding site which blocks the channel
			at resting potential. Release of binding occurs with deplorization to
			−30 mV (usually induced by AMPA, kainate, or other receptor interaction.
			This opening is inhibted by about Zn<sup>2+</sup>. NMDA GluRs may mediate
			cell death as a result of Glu overstimulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx,
			and an action taken by nitric oxide synthesis. Ketamine and phencyclidine
			are antagonists occupying the open channel. Other antagonists include
			felbamate [Felbetol] (anti-epileptic) and riluzole [Rilutek], an agent
			used in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Other general anesthetics and
			alcohol affect the ability of Glu to interact with its receptor.

		</p>
		<h3>GABA</h3>
		GABA-secreting neurons found largely in CNS, acting in negative
		feedback circuits both pre- and post-synaptic. The action of these
		neurons is to induce IPSP. Release of GABA is promoted by drugs
		such as gabapentin (Neurontin), an anticonvulsant. Reuptake
		inhibition is promoted by tiagabine. A GABA transaminase inactivator
		is inhibited by anticonvulsants such as vigabatrine (Sabril) and
		valproic acid (Depakene).
		<p>
			The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is G protein-coupled which specific
			is bound by baclofen (a muscle relaxant).
		</p>
		<p>
			The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is a chloride ion channel inducing IPSP
			upon binding. It is a pentameric protein whose subunits traverse
			the membrane only 4 times. Specific agonists include muscamol (no
			clinical use). Specific antagonists include picrotoxin, which
			has analeptic (convulsant) action. Benzodiazepines faciliate the
			action of GABA in channel opening and are not direct agonists; they
			can be direct antagonists however by working to close chloride
			channels (inverse agonism). Flumazenil (Maxicon) is an antagonist
			and anti-inverse agonist and used in benzodiazepine overdose..
			Barbituates can open chloride channels in absence of GABA if levels
			high enough. Many drugs work via the effect they exert on
			GABA<sub>A</sub>R: diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax),
			temazepam (Restoril).

		</p>
		<h3>Glycine</h3>
		Glycinergic neurons predominate in brain stem and spinal cord. Renshaw
		cells are feedback inhibitory motor neurons in the spinal cord.
		Tetanus toxin appears to interfere with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated
		release of glycine.
		<p>
			The GlyR is a ligand-gated chloride channel which produces IPSPs.
			Strychnine is an antagonist of GlyR.

		</p>
		<h2 id="peptidergic">Peptidergic Hormones/Neuromodulators and Receptors</h2>
		<h3>Angiotensin</h3>
		Has an AT<sub>1</sub> receptor identified. Angiotensin has the effect
		of increasing blood pressure when blood volume is depleted. In cases
		of hypertension, blocking AT<sub>1</sub> activity with drugs such as
		losartan often helps.

		<h1>Notes on Nervous System Physiology and Neuroanatomy</h1>

		<h2>Basal Ganglia</h2>
		These are structures parked within the cerebral cortex next to the
		ventricles and canals that form the cerebrospinal fluid system.
		Ganglia are essentially the collection of nucleated cell bodies from
		which afferent (dendritic) and efferent (axonal) processes extend
		to all parts of the brain and body, usually the former.
		<p>
			It is composed of the <dfn>caudate</dfn> (“having a tail”),
			the <dfn>putamen</dfn> (“shell-shaped”), and the
			<dfn>globus pallidus</dfn> (“pale body”). A connection
			of cells between the caudate and putamen are darkened due to chromaffin
			cell-like appearance, and so the structure is also called the
			<dfn>corpus striatum</dfn>. Comparatively, the corpus striatum makes
			its first appearance in the reptilian brain (it is also called the
			<dfn>neostriatum</dfn>), and the structure becomes more elaborate in
			the mammalian brain.
		</p>
		<p>
			Neurons in the ventral part of the striatum and cells in the central
			and dorsal areas of the caudate-putamen all appear to be projection
			neurons and immunoreactively show the presence of tyrosine hydroxylase
			(TH)<sup>1</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			GABAergic neurons make up most (9 in 10) of the neurons of the striatum
			and have spiny dendrites and project to many areas outside the striatum.
			The balance of neurons are cholinergic and extend no dendritic processes
			and likely serve as interneurons (associative cells). All neurons also
			secrete enkephalins, substance P, and neuropeptide Y along with the main
			neurotransmitter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cells of the globus pallidus form the <dfn>paleostriatum</dfn>, a
			forerunner to the neostriatum. The GP communicates with the putamen
			via myelinated fibers of the external medullary lamina. The GP actually
			divides into a medial or internal (GPi) and lateral or external (GPe) body,
			each with distinct connections. The paleness of the GP results from
			traversal of myelinated fibers through its body.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that the term <dfn>lenticular</dfn> or <dfn>lentiform nucleus</dfn>
			is used to refer to the globus pallidus and putamen together because
			of the lens shape they form.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <dfn>nucleus accumbens</dfn> is medial and ventral to the
			caudate/putamen and was once considered functionally distinct from
			the striatum and limbic system, but it now is connected with the ventral
			striatum and pallidum and to the limbic structures.

		<h2>Connections</h2>
		Afferents to the striatum come from many sources of the cerebral cortex,
		most notably the frontal lobes. To the putamen come many radiations from
		the primary motor, premotor, supplementary motor, and somatosensory areas.
		To the caudate come connections from the prefrontal and parietal association
		cortex. All cortical axons elaborate glutamate excitatory transmitters.
		Afferents to the striatum also come from the substantia nigra pars compacta
		(SNc), which extends inhibitory dopaminergic terminal processes.
		<p>
			Efferents from the striatum project to the both internal and
			external divisions of the globus pallidus (GPi and GPe), and to both
			the pars compacta and pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNc and
			SNr). These are inhibitory GABAergic neurons.
		</p>
		<p>
			Afferents to the GP come from the striatum, as noted, representing the
			major input. The GPi also receives input from a subthalamic nucleus
			(the subthalamopallidal projections) composed of excitatory glutaminergic
			fibers. Other afferents come from the SNc and the pedunclopontine nucleus.
		</p>
		<p>
			Efferents from the GP represent the major influence of the basal ganglia
			on all systems outside of it. The striatum exerts its influence
			indirectly through the GP, largely through the GPi; it also indirectly
			communicates via connections through the SNr. Projections from the GPi to
			two ipsilateral thalamic nuclei are made via the lenticular fasciculus
			and the ansa lenticularis, which combine toward the thalamus to form
			the thalamic fasciculus; these are inhibitor GABAergic neurons.
			These meet with nuclei in the thalamus, which are neuronal elements with
			excitatory efferents to the motor areas of the cortex. Other GPi efferents
			proceed to nuclei in the SNr and the pediculopontine nucleus of the midbrain
			tegmentum.
		</p>
		<p>
			Efferents from the GPe are to the subthalamic nucleus. The efferents from
			the subthalamic nucleus continue on to the striatum and SN.
		</p>
		<p>
			Afferents to the ventral striatum and pallidum, including the nucleus
			accumbens come from the sensory and motor areas of the parietal lobe and
			the frontal lobe.


		</p>
		<h2>The Membrane Proteins: Ligand- and Voltage-Gated Ion Channels
			and Receptors</h2>
		The cellular elements of the nervous system are covered with membrane
		proteins that are the keys to the system. Sodium, potassium, and
		chloride channels provide the electrochemical steady state in the
		resting state, and also serve during the action potential. Voltage-gated
		channels propagate the action potential, while ligand-gated (the ligand
		being the neurotransmitter) channels determine the threshold.
		Other membrane proteins are not ion channels, but provide communication
		which alters cellular activity in some way, whether its gene expression
		or activation or repression of catabolic or biosynthetic pathways.
		<p>
			Virtually every ion channel is a multisubunit arrangement of polypeptides
			that have identical characteristics in terms of the number of times the
			polypeptide strand spans the membrane (usually an odd number of times)
			and how the N and C terminus are oriented on one side of the membrane.
			The slight variation in the amino acid sequence of each subunit, and
			the particular combination of subunits that aggregate, provide specificity
			to the ion channel that may be helpful in terms of cellular or tissue
			function. These variations may affect the sensitivity of the various
			ion channels to certain voltages, or to their ability to pass certain
			ions, or their ability to bind to certain ligands.

		</p>
		<h3>The <i>Conus</i> snail venomous peptides</h3>
		These peptides are as numerous as there are membrane protein types and
		subtypes in excitable tissues. There are conotoxins that bind
		ion channels both ligand- and voltage-gated, and even for specific
		protein types and subtypes, there are toxins that act differently in
		terms of being blockers or modulators of conductance, and so on.

		<h2>The Synapse</h2>
		The synapse is formed by the following structural elements:
		<ul>
			<li>the end terminal arborizations (<dfn>knobs</dfn>)
				of the electrochemical efferent structure of the neuron, which if it
				extends a single process, is known as the <dfn>axon</dfn>
			</li>
			<li>any structure of a post-synaptic cellular element, which can be
				<ul>
					<li>an electrochemical afferent structure which, if it is a process
						extended by the cell, is called a <dfn>dendrite</dfn>
					</li>
					<li>that portion of the post-synaptic cellular element which is
						not identifiable as an extended process of it, and typically where
						the nucleus and other typical cellular structures are found, and
						which is called the <dfn>soma</dfn>
					</li>
					<li>an electrochemical efferent structure which, if it is a process
						extended by the cell, is called an <dfn>axon</dfn>
					</li>
				</ul>
				The connections between an end terminal knob of the pre-synaptic
				cellular element and the post-synaptic cellular elements respectively
				listed above are referred to as <dfn>axodendritic</dfn>,
				<dfn>axosomatic</dfn>, and <dfn>axoaxonic</dfn>.
			</li>
			<li>a <dfn>synaptic cleft</dfn>, a space between the membrane of the
				presynaptic cellular element and the postsynaptic cellular element.
				The cleft is about 200 Å long, which is the length of less
				than three typical cell membranes if they were stacked on each other.
			</li>
		</ul>
		Within the end terminal knobs of the presynaptic element are <dfn>synaptic
			vesicles</dfn>, each containing about 10,000 to 100,000 molecules of
		neurotransmitter.

		<h2>Excitation of The Postsynaptic Cell</h2>
		Excitation of the neuronal postsynpaptic cell occurs by release of
		neurotransmitter into the cleft. Neurotransmitter molecules bind
		to the specific receptors on the membrane of the post-synaptic element,
		and membrane proteins representing ion channels are opened. If the
		post-synaptic cell is a neuron propagating impuluses, the ion channel
		is for sodium. As sodium moves into the cell, the overall potential
		across the membrane is reduced from its −70 mV resting potential.
		This gradual reduction is caused the effect of a single event release
		of transmitter from a single end terminal knob. The release of transmitter
		from a single knob is <em>not</em> usually sufficient to cause
		the postsynpatic element to propagate the impulse. However,
		the postsynaptic element has a reduced resting potential and
		is “primed” for a repeated action by release of
		transmitter again. This is called <dfn>faciliation</dfn>.
		<p>
			Depolarization of the postsynaptic cell, in which an <dfn>action
				potential (AP)</dfn> develops and the impulse propagates can occur as
			a result of two kinds of <dfn>summation</dfn> of presynaptic inputs:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><dfn>spatial summation</dfn>, in which the combined effects of
				several synapses (either of a single presynaptic neuron with several
				connections, or multiple presynaptic neurons with their own synapes to
				a single postsynaptic neuron) act with a single impulse to move
				<dfn>the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)</dfn> past the
				<dfn>threshold</dfn> for initiating an AP.
			</li>
			<li><dfn>temporal summation</dfn>, in which a single end terminal knob
				forming a synapse does not initiate an AP with one release event, but
				does cause an AP with repeated release events
			</li>
		</ol>
		Note that a sub-threshold EPSP lasts only about 15 milliseconds before
		a return to resting potential. The time required for liberation of
		transmitter from vesicles to crossing of the cleft to stimulating
		of the Na<sub>+</sub> ion channels on the postsynaptic cell is about
		0.5 ms.
		<p>
			Threshold for AP initiation occurs at about −60 mV (a reduction
			of only 10 mV from the resting). The action potential causes
			full depolarization to about +30 mV. Propagation of the AP involves
			a wave-like depolarization resulting from voltage-gated sodium channels
			opening to allow sodium to depolarize the membrane. Once depolarization
			occurs, the sodium channels close. The closure may result from
			a sensitivity to the magntiude of the change in potential, or the
			change in membrane polarity. Within nanoseconds (tens? hundreds?)
			of sodium channel closure, potassium channels open in a voltage-sensitive
			manner. The time by which they remain open may be programmed into the
			structure of potassium ion channels, or it may be the result of
			the effect of the repolarization that occurs as potassium moves out
			extracellularly to restore a potential that makes the membrane
			ready for another AP. The period between depolarization and repolarization
			makes the membrane unresponsive to continual stimulation, and is
			called a <em>refractory</em> period.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sodium channels can be blocked by neurotoxins such as
			<b>tetrodotoxin</b> (TTX) from puffer fish, <b>saxitoxin</b> from
			the red algae dinoflagellates, and <b>batrachotoxin</b> from
			the Colombian arrow-poison frog.

			Potassium channels are blocked using <b>tetraethylammonium (TEA)
				salts</b> Note that combined poisoning of nerves with TTX and TEA
			will not affect its ability to secrete neurotransmitter, which it
			can do if the nerve ending is artificially depolarized.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sodium and potassium channels involved establishing the AP are not
			the same as sodium and potassium channels responsible for generating
			the EPSP in excitatory neurotransmission. In the AP, there is
			both a distinct spatiotemporal sequence of channel opening and closing
			as described above, and the opening and closing have a component that
			is in part or whole voltage-sensitive. In the EPSP, both sodium and
			potassium channels (a different subset) are opened, with the effects
			of sodium inflow dominating probably because it moves with its
			electrochemical potential, while potassium moves only with its
			chemical potential. The Nernst equation suggests that simultaneous
			opening of sodium and potassium channels could account for the
			slight depolarization by Δ<i>V</i> = −10 mV. EPSP
			sodium and potassium channels are sensitive <em>only</em> to
			ligand binding of neurotransmitters, and are not blocked by TTX or
			TEA, resp.

		</p>
		<h3>IPSPs</h3>
		Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) are usually the result
		of release of neurotransmitters from inhibitory presynaptic neurons
		which act in concert with excitatory neurons. The effect on the
		postsynaptic element is hyperpolarize the membrane. This can be
		achieved usually either by:
		<ul>
			<li>selective opening of a potassium channel
			</li>
			<li>selective opening of a chloride channel
			</li>
		</ul>
		The chemical potentials (but not electrical potentials) of these ions
		in the resting membrane state favors this activity.

		<h3>Saltatory Conduction</h3>
		It is not necessary that an AP move as a wave over a contiguous surface
		with closely spaced voltage channels to set up the local field resulting
		in membrane potential changes. The AP can be propagated from its origin
		to its target by minimizing the need for major changes in electrochemical
		potential, an effect achieved by forming an insulating layer (myelin
		sheath) around the depolarizing membrane which probably channels a
		voltage field of greater intensity or efficiency as a result of ordering
		ions (reducing entropy) along the extracellular surface.

		<h1>Autonomic Nervous System Control</h1>
		The involuntary nervous system is divided into a <b>sympathetic</b>
		and <b>parasympathetic</b> control, which are generally antagonistic
		to each other where they innervate and control common organs.
		Below is a description of the organ/tissue which are controlled
		by these two parts, and the effect which their activation has
		on the organ or tissue.

		<h1>The Glia</h1>

		Three kinds of glial cells: astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia.
		<p>
			Functions of astrocytes:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>recovery of neurotransmitter from synpatic environment
			</li>
		</ol>
		Functions of oligodendrocyte
		<ol>
			<li>precursor to Schwann cell, which forms mylein sheath around
				axon of myeleinated neurons.
			</li>
		</ol>

		Pio del Rio-Hortega develops silver carbonate stain which
		distinguishes microglia from other cells in the brain (1919).
		Microglia are rounded in developing brain, become highly ramified,
		ramifications making contact with astrocytes and neurons.
		If traumatic injury (stab wound) occurs, cells round up and
		assume macrophage-like character. In 1932 Rio-Hortega put
		forward the finding that microglia were phagocytic upon rounding,
		functioning as macrophages.
		<p>
			In the 1980s V. H. Perry and colleagues (U. Oxford) screened
			microglia for monoclonal antibody binding, using MAbs as
			identifiers of microglia. The ability to culture microglia
			also enables a closer look at their functional properties.
		</p>
		<p>
			Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells and use class II
			histocompatibility antigens as part of the presentation process.
			Antibodies to class II antigens bind to macrophages very well,
			identifying them and showing they produce the antigens. Treatment
			of nervous tissue similarly shows that microglia are class II
			antigen-rich.
		</p>
		<p>
			G. W. Kreutzberg and others wanted to demonstrate that MG were not
			simply monocytes that found their way into the nervous system.
			One way was to inject toxin into neurons with cell bodies located
			inside the brain by with axons terminating outside the brain;
			one must accept the notion that macrophages would not enter
			the brain region in this type of injury. They found that
			microglia had moved to the dead neuron and attempted to remove.
		</p>
		<p>
			Microglia are generally highly ramified (multiple branches)
			in the quiescent state. The ramifications likely maximize
			contact with surrounding tissue. These "tendrils" may function
			to maximize the ability to sense (abnormal) changes in the other
			cells. When there is an injury or infection, microglia in the
			region can lose ramifications and begin to assume three shape
			types: bushy, rodlike, or perineuronal. These shape changes
			depend on the space and location of the microglia. The rodlike
			MG will for example form along long, thin neuronal projections.
			If the tissue does not quickly return to normal, the MG may be
			come actively phagocytic. In that event, expression of class
			II antigens is stepped up markedly.
		</p>
		<p>
			MG also serve a developmental role, secreting growth factors to
			direct CNS formation. In particular, more glia and neurons are
			made than will be eventually used, and neuron death will occur.
			Microglia may also secrete "sustaining" factors which enable
			glia and neurons to survive.
		</p>
		<p>
			The activity of microglia is also linked to pathological disorders.
			As with macrophages, microglia exposed to bacterial components
			make very reactive oxygen components (superoxide, hydroxyl radical,
			and hydrogen peroxide), which will damage in an undiscriminatory
			manner. Moreover, MG release lysosomal proteases. They also
			release inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, tumor necrosis factor)
			which draw other phagocytic and active cells. Cytokines may
			exert direct damage on neurons, and TNF has been shown to
			kill oligodendrocytes.
		</p>
		<p>
			MG may also have a role in promoting the damage done by HIV
			to the nervous system in AIDS. HIV does not infect neurons
			but does seem capable of infecting MG, causing them to secrete
			neurotoxic cytokines and other molecules.
		</p>
		<p>
			MG may also aggravate Alzheimer’s disease. Beta amyloid plaques
			form in affected brain regions, and it is known that MG show
			elevated levels of IL-1 and other cytokines in the region of
			the senile plaques which form. MG may also contribute to
			this problem by forming amyloid precursor protein themselves,
			probably an autocrine response to IL-1 activation; this protein
			would split in a way to form beta amyloid.
		</p>
		<p>
			Is the amyloid-MG connection strong? Down’s syndrome patients
			show senile plaques in their brains just as in Alzheimer’s
			disease (although at a younger age). There are lab mice which
			have a genetic defect that affects the brain similarly. These
			mice at the fetal stage show unusually reactive MG, with
			increased oxygen radical activity, cytokine secretion, and
			inflammatory activity. Other diseases which either may be
			principally caused by or are aggravated by overactive microglia
			include Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic
			lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease).
