Relevant Documents of Bio-Rad

<div class="outerblock">

<p>
The documents are prepared by Bio-Rad and are both useful and relevant
because this laboratory uses the Bio-Rad proteome works system
for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.  The PDFs are put on this
server only because direct links cannot be made to them on Bio-Rad's
server as it uses session control systems.
<p>
However, Bio-Rad often revises these documents, so you should go
to Bio-Rad's web server and use catalog numbers to make sure you have
the latest information from Bio-Rad.
<p>
Also consult the <a href="/Proteomics/ProteomicsReference.html">Reference
in Proteomics</a>, which provides additional information about tips
and techniques for using Bio-Rad equipment learned from practice.

<h1>Gel Electrophoresis</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="/BioRadDocs/2DGEMethodProductManual.pdf"><b>2-D
Electrophoresis for Proteomics.  A Methods and Product Manual</b></a>.<br>
 This is a rather complete survey of Bio-Rad's approach to gel-based
 proteomics and should be read first.  It has a great deal of detailed
 information and shows typical results you should expect to see.
<li><a href="/BioRadDocs/ReadyStripIPGInstructionManual.pdf"><b>ReadyStrip
IPG Strip Instruction Manual</b></a>.<br>
 This manual (Catalog #163-2099) provides the details for using
 isoelectric focusing (IEF) strips from sample loading to running on the
 2nd dimension.  You must be familiar with this if you do IEF using IPG
 strips.
<li><a href="/BioRadDocs/PreventingHorStreaks.pdf"><b>Preventing Horizontal
Streaks on 2-D Gels</b></a>.	A good technical note that deals with a
common problem that mostly affects IEF strips (although you discover these
in the 2nd dimension).  Here is the summary:
 <ul>
 <li>Bio-Rad says that running the focusing for too long (or at least until
the current is at a low, unchanging value) does not improve the resolution
but can even cause streaking.
 <li>Alternatively, streaking can be caused if focusing is done for too
short a time.
 <li>Overloading:  when the total protein load exceeds that recommended,
and particularly when a single protein dominates (makes up 30-100% of the
total protein), this can cause all sorts of problems.
 <li>Bad Sample Prep:  it may be necessary to remove salts and other
materials that conduct current and prevent the IEF maximum voltage from
being reached within the normal time.
 <li>Poor Protein Solubilization:  always spin the samples that you plan
on loading on the IPG strips at maximum speed for 10-15 min.  This prevents
protein that has come out of solution from being loaded on to the strip.
 </ul>
<li><a href="/BioRadDocs/TechNote_2740.pdf"><b>Use of the PROTEAN Plus&trade;
Dodeca&trade; Cell for Second-Dimension SDS-PAGE</b></a>.  This technical
note actually explains some things that we have noticed from our
experience in working with the Dodeca gel format system.  For one thing,
thin gels (1.0 mm thick) are in fact easily torn when handled, so extreme
care must be exercised.  The 1.0 mm gels are better when all you want is
a 2-D gel and you do not want to do spot cutting for mass spec work.
Also, staining with the collioidal (&ldquo;Bio-Safe&rdquo;) Coomassie
G does appear to
take MUCH, MUCH longer than what Bio-Rad states.  The tech note here states
that they stained the gels for 48 h, and then changed it with fresh stain
for <em>another</em> 48 hours!!!  That's four days to do staining.  That is
really unacceptable if that is what is necessary.  We are finding very
weak staining with the Coomassie G product, and we may either have to
switch to Sypro dyes or silver staining.  (Sypro if we want linear staining
and quantitative expression evaluation, and silver if we only really want
to cut spots out.)
<li><a href="/BioRadDocs/IEF-BioRadSystems.pdf"><b>2-D Electrophoresis
Brochure</b></a>.  This is actually an illustrated advertisement,
but it provides a good summary of what the essential 2DGE products are
and do, and gives a list of catalog numbers for ordering.
</ul>

<h1>Gel Illumination (Staining), Imaging, &amp; Image Analysis</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="/BioRadDocs/PDquest%207.2.pdf">PDQuest 7.2 User Guide for Windows
and Macintosh</a><br>
This manual explains the details of using the gel image analysis software
for spot detection, spot matching, and creating gel analysis sets.  There is
no manual for PDQuest 8.x, just a <q>quick guide</q> which tells one how to 
use the Experiment Wizard.  Probably in most cases, you click Help on the menu
to get information about how to use a function in this bug-ridden software
(save frequently!).
<li><a href="/BioRadDocs/TechNoteImageAnalysis.pdf"><b>Normalizing
Between 2-D Gels with PDQuest&reg; Software</b></a>.<br>
Normalization is rather important when you are attempting to <em>quantify</em>
protein expression based on stained gels.  Suppose you prepare 2-D gels
identically:  you load the IEF strips with the same amount from the same
sample, you run on the same strip and then the same gel, and then you
find that after staining, there are difference in the size, although
not perhaps the position and number of spots.  How could there be a difference?
What normalization does is try to eliminate the differences between
between gels when you know that spots or bands are loaded identically
but which ultimately stain or illuminate differently.
