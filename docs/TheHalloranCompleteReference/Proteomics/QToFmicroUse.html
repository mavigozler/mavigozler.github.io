<!-- ============================================================= -->
<p>
The Micromass Q-ToF <i>micro</i> is sold as part of the Waters proteomics
system.  It features a <b><i>Q</i></b>uadrupole (MS1) detector which provides
large mass range data as well as selecting the mass range for the
<b><i>T</i></b>ime <b><i>o</i></b>f <b><i>F</i></b>light (MS2) detector
orthogonally following the quadrupole.  Between the quadrupole and the
ToF is a hexapole to tighten the ion beam, an argon-gas collision cell
to produce fragments for the ToF detector, and various lensing systems
whose voltage is user-controlled to permit improvements in sensitivity
or resolution.  The <i>micro</i> name derives from this instrument being
the latest generation of mass spectrometers that has been miniaturized
to sit on the benchtop and that it holds a footprint only 1 &times; 1.5
meters.
<p>
There are many options to configure the source of the Q-ToF <i>micro</i>.
The basic source comes with an electrospray interface ideal for ionizable
macromolecules.

<h1><a name="ionanalysis">Ion Analysis Details</a></h1>
<p>
Ions are generated in some form or fashion before they enter into the
analyzing train.  Ionization may be by high voltage charge on the liquid
phase solvent and analytes (ESI) or by gas-phase ionization in the
presence of a charged pin/needle (APcI).
<p>
<b>The problem of clustering</b>.
Once ions are generated outside the <b>sample cone</b>, some of the
ions are sampled into the <b>source block</b> as a result of the vacuum
within created by the rotary vacuum.  As solvent and analyte ions enter
into the sample cone, they expand.  This expansion causes cooling that
can lead to freezing of analyte ions with solvent species to form
clusters of varying masses.  These <i>clustered solvent-analyte ions</i>
hence reduce signal and increase noise (background).  To counter clustering,
the Waters systems:
<ol>
<li>heat the source block
<li>use a cone or curtain gas against the analyte flow
</ol>
<p>
Cone gas applied at 139 L/h provided a 12% signal increase in 10 &mu;g/ml
prednisolone compared to no cone gas;  moreover a peak at 402 Da
representing the acetonitrile adduct [M + MeCN]<sup>+</sup> disappeared,
indicating that solvent removal is assisted.

<h1><a name="esi">Electrospray Ionization</a></h1>
<p>
The theory of ESI is discussed elsewhere in a document on the principles
of mass spectrometry.
<p>
The Q-ToF micro uses several different probes/sources which usually differ
with respect to the degree of the flow of the solution into the probe.
<p>
As an initial solvent, use 50% acetonitrile.  Most substances are soluble
at usual concentrations in this solvent, and it provides sufficient volatility
for generating vapor from the spray.  Make adjustments to temperatures and
gas flow depending on the proportion of more volatile organic phase to
less volatile aqueous phase.
<p>
For <b>positive ion mode</b>, use a 0.1-2% formic or acetic acid to
enhance ionization.
<p>
For <b>negative ion mode</b> using 0.1-1% ammonium hydroxide/acetate/carbonate.
<p>
However in doing flow injection analysis (FIA), do not use these additives
since switching from positive to negative ion modes is required.
<p>
In typical use, chromatographic plumbing is through fused silica capillaries
that might be joined by PTFE sleeves.  For megaflow setups, which can be
used 2.1 or 4.6 mm columns without any splitting, PEEK tubing with
1/16-inch o.d. and 0.007-inch i.d. should be used (0.1778 mm = 178&micro;m).

<h2>Post-Column Splitting</h2>
<p>
Between any chromatography column and a probe, a post-column flow splitter
may be required to divide flow such it is reduced for the limits or optimum
of the electrospray source (probe).
<p>
The Z-spray probe can take 1000 &micro;l/min but optimally should be
set at 200 &micro;l/min.  Thus if a column is run at 1 ml/min, a 5:1 splitter
after the column may be useful.
<p>
The actual split ratio of divided flow is affected by back pressure
on the waste line, which can be adjusted by controlling:
<ul>
<li>the length of the waste line
<li>the diameter of the waste line
</ul>


<h2>Standard Z-Spray Source</h2>
<p>
A Z-source spray that is designed to enrich gas
phase ions and reduce interference and noise in the mass analyzer
by removing nonionized species, especially solvent molecules that can
be entrained into the ion beam in the mass range discriminator by
the pull of the vacuum.
<p>
The Z-spray source has the following advantages and disadvantages:

<table class="td-left" style="text-align:center;">
<tr><th>Advantages                     <th>Disadvantages
<tr><td>molecular weight confirmation  <td>limited fragmentation
<tr><td>ionic &amp; easily protonated  <td>limited to relatively low flow rates
<tr><td>good sensitivity               <td>Z-spray rugged enough to handle
                                           non-volatile salts, but highly
														 ionic modifiers reduce sensitivity
<tr><td>sample MW can exceed instrument range if molecule
       can be multiply charged  <td rowspan="2">
<tr><td>suitable for capillary LC
</table>
<p>
Optimal flow rates tend to be 100-250 &mu;l/min, but may be less if
analyte concentration is high.

<p>
Ionization of low MW molecules is usually that they are singly charged,
typically by acquiring a proton.  Biomolecules of low MW that are basic,
particularly amines, will usually gain a proton and should be analyzed
in positive mode.  Extreme care should be taken when using ESI with
ammonium, potassium, or sodium ions present since they form adducts.
These adducts increase the mass by the adduct mass:
NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (M + 18), Na<sup>+</sup>(M + 23), and
K<sup>+</sup> (M + 39);  this typically causes problems
with interpretation of mass spectra, and analysts should always take
caution with this.

<p>
High MW biomolecules and polymers form multiply charged species.
Fragmentation of these species rarely occurs.
<p>
The sensitivity&mdash;ability to detect an ion&mdash;will invariably depend
on the analyte and its matrix.

<h2>In-Source Fragmentation</h2>
<p>
Fragmentation usually does not occur in the source.  Increasing the voltage
of the sample cone however can cause fragmentation.  Normally the cone
is used to extract ions from the atmospheric region and then into the
first vacuum.  Ions accelerate to the rear toward the skimmer.  The region
between the cone and the skimmer is under vacuum, although the pressure
is high with respect the analyzing regions.  If the voltage is increased
in the cone, the higher cone-skimmer voltage difference results in a
larger acceleration, and with solvent vapor and nitrogen present, the
collisions might cause fragmentation.  The energies are such that only
weak sigma bonds between C-N and C-O are likely to be broken however.

<h2>Starting The Electrospray</h2>
<p>
There seems to be more of an art than a science to starting the flow
from the capillary for electrospray.  Available to the user
are several independent variables
(i.e. variables the user can control, or inputs), and a couple of
variables to monitor to see how well the setup is, or the outputs.

<h3>The Outputs:  What To Look For in Optimizing Electrospray</h3>
<p>
One of the first and more important variables (outputs)
to monitor in electrospray is a visual one.  For the Nanoflow-type
sources, which include the Nano-LC and the Nanovial (glass capillary),
the stream must be set up with the proper distance of the tip of the
capillary from the sample cone.
<p>
The figure below shows a typical example of the Nano-LC as seen through
the magnifying scope from the top of the source.  The user should absolutely
be using the magnifying scope with the source chamber illuminated according
to the setup provided by Waters/Micromass.  Also useful is for the operator
to put his hand over the transparent chamber at the 3 o'clock position
(as the operator faces the source) to prevent stray light especially
daylight entering the laboratory from an unshaded window from preventing
viewing of the electrospray.  The figure belows shows a panel boxed
in green that shows an electrospray that appeared to be ideal.  It also
shows two panels boxed in red that give unsteady or poor ion beams.
Note that the green-boxed figure shows a stream that actually looks
like a thin fabric thread slightly wavering as if in the wind, and that
it bends toward the sample cone but passes beyond the sample cone.
<p>
In the examples of poor electrospray, in the middle red-boxed example,
the thread-like stream is actually seen entering the mouth of the sample
cone.  While this might seem logical since more of the analyte enters
directly, the problem is that the analyte is trapped in the liquid
phase in aerosolized droplets.  Ionized analyte molecules can only
become part of a detectable ion beam if they have been put into the
gas phase.
<p>
In the red-boxed figure on the right, two examples of
a poor electrospray are shown.  The one at the left shows drops being
sprayed as visibly large drops from the tip of the capillary.  The desolvation
gas is essentially blowing the drops formed at the tip off the tip.
But the thread-like small stream is not formed because either the capillary
voltage is too low (or non-existent), or if voltage is sufficiently
high based on experience, it could be that the sample is not prepared
correctly;  perhaps there is no ion-promoting agent in the solvent,
such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in a sufficient concentration (0.1% v/v).
In the example on the right, drops are seen to form on the outer wall
of the capillary, behind the tip, as if emerging from a wall defect itself.
This is probably not the case.  The wall was wetted on the surface probably
as a result of flow started in the capillary without desolvation gas
or capillary voltage being on, and so a backward flow from the capillary
tip leads to droplet formation in this way.

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="QToF-SourceFlow.gif" style="border:2px solid blue;"
alt="An example of good electrospray and a couple of examples of bad electrospray">
<p>
In the figure below a magnified view of a capillary in the source block
is shown, in perspective, and in cross-section.  In the cross-section,
the liquid stream is shown with ionized (or perhaps ionizable) particles
shown.  There location and motion in the liquid phase shows them to be
randomly distributed, diffusing in this way, and obeying the second law
of thermodynamics.  The desolvation gas channels around the capillary
are apparent.
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="Electrospray.gif" style="border:2px solid blue;"
alt="Magnified view of capillary in source block">
<p>
When the capillary voltage is applied in the positive ion mode and
liquid flow is started, the source block is given a high negative
voltage (seen in <span style="border:1px solid black;"><b>A</b></span>
in the figure below).
The liquid within the capillary becomes polarized in the
sense that positive ions (or positive portion of a dipole in the case
of polarizable molecules) move toward the wall of the capillary, while
negative ions (or the negative part of a dipole) are crowded within the
radial center of the long axis of the capillary.
<p>
The stream that emerges from the tip forms a cone, called the <i>Taylor
cone</i> (seen in <span style="border:1px solid black;"><b>B</b></span>).
The region of the Taylor cone region is magnified in
<span style="border:1px solid black;"><b>C</b></span>).  The wall of the
cone is merely a continuation of ordered arrangement of the ions from
the source electric field, whose magnitude diminishes as the stream
moves away from the block.  Droplets begin to form from the cone tip,
both from the effect of a high temperature, high flow desolvation gas
and from a fission created by charge repulsion of ions at the surface.
Being on the surface of droplets, positive ions are more likely than
negative ions to enter the gas phase, promoted by charge repulsion and
by the typical the typical forces that increase their kinetic energy
sufficient to make the phase transition (hot nitrogen desolvation
gas hitting either analyte or solvent molecules in gas provides the bulk
of this kinetic energy.
<p>
As the stream (electrospray) gets further from the tip, the electrospray
is seen as a thread blowing in the wind <span
style="border:1px solid black;"><b>D</b></span>).
Droplet size gets smaller due
to droplet fission promoted by charge repulsion and due to liquid-to-gas
phase transition of solvent molecules from the desolvation gas.
The figures in row <span style="border:1px solid black;"><b>E</b></span>)
show a magnified view of the droplets.  In
<span style="border:1px solid black;"><b>F</b></span>), a more magnfied
view of the process, droplet formation is shown as a &ldquo;budding&rdquo;
process from the surface.  Budding is quite distinct from fission however:
the latter is a splitting into two (equal volumes), while in the former,
smaller droplets emerge from a larger droplet to form &ldquo;daughter&rdquo;
droplets.
<p>
Whether ever smaller droplet formation is a fission or budding process
is not entirely clear.  The important point is to promote the transition
of the desired ion (positive or negative) into the gas phase, which
electrospray does well.

<h2>Nano Lock Spray</h2>
<p>
The purpose of the Nano Lock Spray is to combine the low flow
electrospray from the material to be analyzed with a low flow from
an electrospray from a reference or standard whose mass is known
(a &ldquo;lock mass&rdquo;).  This provides the greatest capability
of making exact mass measurements outside of a true internal standard
being present.
<p>
In older configurations, the reference was actually teed into the LC
flow by a switch, so that it all came from the same electrospray source.
There can be some problems associated with use of the tee-in:
<ul>
<li>the analyte might be suppressed by the reference or vice versa
<li>the reference and analyte can interfere with each other's mass reading
<li>the analyte and reference might cluster
<li>the reference signal can later with changes in the LC gradient
</ul>
<p>
The NanoLock Spray isolates the reference from the analyte by use of
its own electrospray, and each spray is sampled at different time periods
by use of oscillating baffle.  Software makes a determination from the
indicated lock mass and the actual lock mass, and uses this to make a correction
on all unknowns.
<p>
Useful references for the Q-ToF include [Glu<sup>1</sup>]-Fibrinopeptide,
with an <i>m/z</i> of 785.8426 (its double-charged form).

<h3>Assembling the Reference Probe</h3>
<ol>
<li>Wear powder-free gloves at all times.  Nitrile gloves work well.
<li>The reference probe has a black cover which is removed
<li>Cut 3 cm of 1.6 &times; 0.12 mm PTFE tubing (P/N 6416004) and
insert into one side of Valco metal union (P/N 6070232).  The PTFE
tubing must be cut squarely, and a large amount of tube inserted into the
union to avoid dead volume.  The tubing is inserted into a ferrule and through
the union nut.
<li>Tighten the union nut to make the ferrule grip the tubing without
overtightening.
<li>Remove the tubing from the union and cut it down to length so that it
is flush with the edge of the union nut.
<li>Cut ~15 cm of 20 &mu;m i.d. fused silica capillary (P/N 6028621)
and thread this into the PTFE sleeve made in the union.  Use the tile
to cut the capillary.
The end of the silica should be made flush with the end of the sleeve.
<li>Insert the sleeved capillary into the union.  Push the capillary through
the union and then tighten the union to cause the capillary to grip within
the sleeve.
<li>Cut a long (&gt; 30 cm) amount of 75 &mu;m i.d. fused silica capillary
(P/N 6490512) and make the same sleeve as for above, but use the green PEEK
tubing sleeve (P/N 6070190).  Thread the sleeve into a headless sealtight
nut and ferrule (P/N 6070248).  The PEEK sleeve should have some of its
thread exposed when fully tightened, indicating minimum dead space.
<li>A 1.5 mm hex key should be used to loosen the set screw that
locks a Valco T-piece (P/N 6070253) on to the probe assembly.
<li>Cut 3 cm of 0.12 &times; 0.8 mm PTFE (P/N 6063061) and make a sleeve
from it to produce a gas-tight seal on the T-piece, using the T-piece
nut (P/N 6070850) and ferrule (P/N 6070788).
<li>Tighten the nut to engage a grip of the ferrule on the tubing without
overtightening.  Remove nut from T and cut down the PTFE, with 4 mm
of sleeve protruding from the nut of the T.
<li>Thread the 20 &mu;m capillary in the union through the nut and sleeve.
<em>Do not tighten the nut that locks the T, since the capillary must be
mobile</em>.
<li>A <b>nebulizing capillary</b> (P/N M956134) is now pushed as far as it
will go into the Valco T piece.  The nut to the T is tighted until the
ferrule grips.
<li>Thread the 20 &mu;m i.d. capillary through the T piece and the
nebulizing capillary.
<li>Finger-tighten the T nut that holds the capillary sleeve, but make
sure the capillary is free to move through the T.  Thread the capillary
through the T piece unto the Valco union is close the T piece.
<li>Thread the capillary assembly into and through the probe housing,
and seat the T piece into its holder and tighten the set screw to hold
it.
<li>The union is now positioned to be close to the tee.  The capillary
is cut near to the nebulizing capillary.  Re-position the union so that
0.5-1.0 mm of capillary protrudes from the nebulizing capillary.
<li>The set screw above the Valco union is tightened to secure this
part of the assembly.  The gas seal nut on the T is also tightened
to secure the capillary in that assembly.
<li>Remove the PEEK bulkead union, then attach the nebulizing gas
tube.  Insert the nebulizing gas tube (P/N 6063060) through the
PEEK nut and ferrule, then tighten until ferrule grips.
<li>Thread the tube through the plastic nut and the rest of the probe
assembly.  Tighten the nut to hold the bulkhead union securely.
<li>Bend the tube to fit it into the T, and then tighten the nut
to fit the ferrule to the tube securely and the tube into the T.
<li>The tube is now bent (without kinking it) so that runs down
the center of the probe.
<li>A length of PTFE tubing (P/N 6060774) now must be cut and inserted
into the larger of the bulkhead union nuts, and tightened to grip the
ferrule to the tube.
<li>A 1/16-inch T (P/N 6070309) is used to split the nanoflow gas supply
and the end of the reference probe PTFE tubing is attached to this T
until the ferrule grips.  The other end of the nanoflow gas supply is attached
to the analyte probe.
<li>Put back the reference probe cover to complete the assembly.
</ol>

<h3>Operating and Tuning the NanoLock Spray</h3>
<p>
The reference spray is coupled to a pump that can deliver reference in
a pulse-free manner with a flow of 0.3 to 2 &mu;l/min.  Generally the
reference is sampled between 2 to 10 seconds.
<p>
<strong>Be quite careful in setting the capillary and sample cone
voltages!  They should not produce any arcing between the probe and the
baffle!</strong>
<p>
The position of the analyte probe is adjustable whereas the reference
probe is not.  It is best to make adjustments to the position of
the analyte probe and to tune the beam on the analyte.  Then make adjustments
to the concentration and flow rate of the reference so that its ion count
is about 150 counts/second.  When tuning manually, set the baffle to
<b>Reference</b> or <b>Analyte</b> to tune the desired probe.
<p>
Note that the cone voltage can be optimized independently for the reference,
and then set/configured in the experimental set up when preparing the
sample list.
<p>
Scans of the reference are averaged and processed in both Centroid
and Continuum mode.  From the Mass Lynx application, select
<b>Instrument&rarr;MS Method</b> to get <b>Experimental Setup</b> dialog
(MS Method Editor).  Click the Function Editor icon to get its dialog.
Under the <i>Reference Scan</i> group, the number of <b>Scans to Average</b>
is displayed.  This is the minimum number of scans required to generate
the average that will be used to provide a correction factor;  values
from 5-10 are typical.  Setting it too low means that insufficient counts
may lead to an erroneous mass accuracy, while setting too high may mean
that drift within the period gives rise to a wrong correction factor.
<h3>Possible Faults</h3>

<table>
<tr><th>Problem  <th>Possible Solution
<tr><td>Tune page times out while trying to find the analyte or reference

and source<li>Check that the controller is switched on</ul>
<tr><td>Signals from either spray are unstable<br>Signal changes when
operating

</table>

<h3>NanoLock Spray Maintenance</h3>

<h4>Baffle</h4>
<p>
The oscillating baffle requires cleaning on a periodic basis.  A thumb
screw holds it to its shaft.  Set the NanoLock Spray in its <b>Analyte</b>
position to gain access to the screw.
<p>
The baffle is then sonicated for 15 minutes in a beaker containing either
50% acetonitrile or 50% methanol to which 1% formic acid has been made.
A rinse in water is done after the cleaning.  Be careful to set the baffle
correctly into position.

<h4>Reference Probe Capillary</h4>
<p>
If the reference capillary becomes blocked, contaminated, or damaged,
it must be replaced.
<ol>
<li>Put the system into Standby.
<li>Disconnect the reference line from the probe and remove the finger-tight
nut.
<li>Disconnect the cable from the reference probe on the front panel.
<li>Disconnect the reference probe nebulizing gas tubing.
<li>Loosen the two bolts that hold the reference probe to the NanoLock Spray
housing and withdraw the probe.
<li>Remove the nebulizing gas line from the T by loosening the set screws
that hold the T and the union, and remove the T and union from probe holder.
<li>Loosen the T nut and union nut that face each other and which hold the
reference capillary.  Remove the capillary and PTFE sleeves.
<li>Remove the headless sealtight nut and ferrule and the 75 &mu;m capillary.
Discard both capillaries.
<li>Cut ~15 cm of 20 &mu;m i.d. capillary (P/N 6028621) and thread
into the PTFE sleeve  and make sure the end of the capillary is flush with
end of sleeve.  Insert sleeve and capillary into union.
<li>Push capillary through union and tighten union nut to put grip on capillary.
When the grip is sufficient to stop movement, remove nut and move capillary
so it is flush with edge of PTFE sleeve.  Tighten nut to lock capillary
in place.
<li>Thread the 20 &mu;m capillary through the T piece and the nebulizing
capillary.  Tighten the T nut holding the capillary sleeve so that it
is finger tight and make the capillary is free to move through the T.
<li>Thread the capillary through the T piece until the Valco union is
close to the T piece.
<li>Cut a &gt;30 cm long length of 75 &mu;m i.d. capillary (P/N 6490512)
and thread it through the sleeve, making sure the caipllar  and make
sure the capillary end is flush with the end of the sleeve.
<li>Insert capllary and nut into other side of Valco union; make
sure of mininum dead space (that excess PEEK is exposed).
<li>The whole assembly is threaded through the probe assembly.  Seat the
T piece into its holder and tighten the set screw to hold it into place.
<li>Position the union so that it is close to the T; cut the capillary
near to the nebulizing capillary.
<li>Reposition the union so that ~0.5 - 1 mm of capillary protrudes from
nebulizing capillary.
<li>Tighten the set screw above the Valco union and secure it in place;
tighten the gas seal nut on the T to secure the capillary.
<li>Reconnect the nebulizing gas tube; re-tighten the nut.
<li>Replace probe cover; tighten set screw to clamp the LC union
<li>Reconnect the gas and the lines.
</ol>

<h2>Glass Capillary (Nanovial) Electrospray</h2>
<p>
The glass cap

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>
As with ALL proteomics LC-MS, wear <em>non-powdered vinyl</em> gloves
when handling equipment that makes contact with reagents and samples
used in proteomics analysis.
<p>
In handling glass capillaries, always be careful to avoid handling the
sharp end and take care not to set the capillary down on the sharp end
and always mount the capillary in a cushion if it is not in its electrospray
mount.

<ol>
<li>Rotate the stage outward, and unscrew the union from the end of the assembly.
<li>Press down on the foam with two fingers and carefully lift the capillary
vertically from the case.
<li>Pass the knurled nut over the blunt end of the capillary about 5 mm
of conductive elastomer and finally the union.
<li>Finger-tighten the nut with 5 mm of glass capillary protruding
from the end (measured as the distance from the end of the nut to
the glass capillary shoulder).
<li>Load sample using either a fused silica syringe-adapted needle or
with a gel loader pipet tip.  If you use the gel loader tip, you may
have to break the capillary in half (first score it with a capillary
cutting tile) so that the gel loader tip can go all the way to the
capillary tip.
<li>Finger-tighten the capillary assembly to the stage mount.
<li>Before positioning the assembly, set Capillary voltage to 0 V.
<li>The capillary tip should be positioned with the center of the sample
cone, and about 2-3 diameters of the cone orifice away from the cone.
<li>Adjust the Nanoflow regulator on the Q-ToF so that the pressure
is sufficient to produce a drop from the capillary.
<li>Select the API Gas on to apply nitrogen.
<li>Go into operate mode
<li>Set capillary voltage from 600-1000 V.
<li>Set Desolvation Gas to 100 L/h using knob on the front panel of the
instrument.
<li><b>Blocked/Stopped Capillary Flow</b>.  If the capillary flow stops
prematurely, it may be blocked.  Set capillary voltage to 0V, and then
use the stage 3-axis manipulator to bring the capillary to the cone and
get the capillary glass to shear off.  Use magnification to view the
process.  Another possibility is to increase the pressure (up to 20 psi
or 1.4 bar is allowed) to force liquid out;  if nothing comes out, it
is blocked.
</ol>


<h1><a name="cid">Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID)</a></h1>
<p>
In some cases the sampled <i>parent</i> ion will be subjected to the presence
molecules placed in their path to cause fragmentation of the molecule
that results from collision.  Fragmentation usually occurs in a reproducible
pattern, reflecting the fact that the structure of a molecule makes it
susceptible to dissociation along certain moieties.
<p>
Sulfamethazine, with a mass of 278 Da, will typically fragment on either
side of the sulfoxide moiety (O=S=O) to produce child ions of mass 92,
156, and 186 Da, and so the mass spectra reveal that.
<p>
Advantages and disadvantages of CID:

<table style="text-align:center">
<tr><th>Advantages                     <th>Disadvantages
<tr><td>sometimes increases structural information for pseudo-molecular
        ions obtained from &ldquo;soft&rdquo; ionization
    <td>lack of mixture analysis capability
<tr><td>suppresses chemical noise from solvent cluster
	 <td>cannot pre-select cursor ion as with MS/MS
<tr><td>often fairly simple spectra to interpret, but does not follow
        established &lsquo;classical&rsquo; rules, as with EI
	 <td rowspan="2">
<tr><td>better ion transmssion than in MS/MS
</table>

<h1><a name="acpi">Atmosphere-Pressure Chemical Ionization (APcI)</a></h1>
<p>
APcI is ideal for neutral to polar compounds that are labile.  Few adduct
ions are formed on the analyte molecule, and flow rates from the
<i>uncharged</i> capillary
can be set to between 0.2 and 2.0 ml/min without splitting the flow.
APcI can be used to confirm MW and has good sensitivity.  Because it is
gentle, there is limited information from fragmentation, and there is
higher noise than signal from chemicals when ranged in the lower masses.
APcI is not appropriate for analytes that are involatile.
<p>
APcI occurs in two stages:
<ol>
<li>flash vaporization:  the capillary and tube are set up to maximize
vaporization of solvent and volatile analyte prior to ionization by the
corona discharge needle
<li>gas-phase chemical ionization:  the capillary is not electrified, and
so ionization does not occur in the liquid stream;  the corona discharge
needle is set at 2000-5000 V to produce a plasma at the sample cone
</ol>
<p>
As the sample emerges from the capillary, it encounters an electrified
<i>corona discharge needle</i>.  This typically ionizes the solvent molecules.
These ions then react with the analyte molecules to form ionic clusters.
The ionic charge is then transferred to the analyte molecule.
<p>
With APcI, only singly charged ions form and there is little fragmentation.
Adducts particularly from the solvent can form, and the ion mass will reflect
that.  Relative to ESI, there are fewer matrix effects, e.g., spectra
are not affected by minor changes in most variables such as type and strength
of buffer.

<h1>Quadrupole Mass Range Selection</h1>
<p>
Mass range selection in the quadrupole is achieved by adjusting the
the voltage parameters of the quadrupole in four periods of the set scan
period.  The voltages are set in the four dwells as follows:
<ol>
<li>Dwell 1:  1.25 &times; the Low Mass resolution setting
<li>Dwell 2:  1.95 &times; the Low Mass resolution setting
<li>Dwell 3:  0.20 &times; the High Mass resolution setting
<li>Dwell 4:  0.25 &times; the High Mass resolution setting
</ol>
<p>
As an example, if the mass range is set from <i>m/z</i> 75-1000 with a
1 second scan time, the RF amplitude will be optimized to select at
<i>m/z</i> 94, 146, 198, and 250, each for 0.25 seconds (one-fourth of
the scan period).  This ensures a thorough spectrum over the total mass
range.  If the logical exception occurs that 0.25 &times; High Mass &lt;
1.25 &times; Low Mass, then the set quad range&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.25 &times; Low Mass.


<h1><a name="ToFMSmode">ToF MS Mode</a></h1>
<p>
The QToF micro can be set in a single MS mode in which there is no
fragmentation of the parent ion by collision with argon in the gas
cell.  Argon is introduced in the cell, but for improving resolution rather
than providing possible de novo sequencing or other mass info
There is a practical
mass range selection of 0.8<i>x</i> to ~3<i>x</i> where <i>x</i> is the
set mass.  For a set mass of 400, the efficient transmission of ions is
with a <i>m/z</i> of 320-1000 Da.

<h1><a name="MSMSmode">MS/MS Mode</a></h1>
<p>
The gas cell collision pressure and the accelerating voltage for CID must
be set appropriately for good MS/MS mode analysis.
Gas pressure is not measured directly but the Analyzer Penning gauge can
be used as a monitor.  The pressure might be &lt;10<sup>&minus;5</sup> mbar
in MS mode, but the gas cell pressure can be adjusted to increase the
Analyzer Penning reading to ~6 &times; 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> mbar as a
starting point.  This might need adjusting to optimize CID.
<p>
Set the collision energy from between 28-32 eV, but its optimal setting
is largely sample-dependent.

<h1>Operational Start-Up Quick Reference &amp; Checklist</h1>
<p>
This is intended as a guide and checklist to get the Q-ToF <i>micro</i>
up and running.  It is based on a sequence of actions taken to make
the Q-ToF run.

<h2>Running MassLynx &amp; Communication with Q-ToF MS</h2>
<p>
Normally, MassLynx software should be running at all times in Operate
mode with voltages set to keep the detector lifetime long.
<p>
If MassLynx is not open, do not start it until you get the computer
that runs MassLynx talking with the embedded computer in the Q-ToF micro.
<p>
Make sure <i>first</i> that the computer which runs MassLynx is
communicating with the embedded PC
(the computer inside the Q-ToF micro instrument).  From the Windows XP,
select the <b>Start</b> button, and click <b>Run</b>.  In the <b>Open</b>
text entry box, enter <tt><b>ping -t epc</b></tt>.  A MS-DOS-like command
line interface opens, and you will see the output of a <tt>ping</tt>
command.  Ping is a protocol of TCP/IP (the protocol language by which
hosts on the Internet communicate at a basic level) in which computers
using TCP/IP learn if they are on a network and talking to each other.
The Q-ToF micro embedded PC and the MassLynx PC talk to each other using
the TCP/IP protocol, which is why you use the ping command to learn if they
are talking.
<p>
If the two computers are talking to one another, the output from the
<tt>ping</tt> command looks like:

<pre>
Reply from 64.1.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
Reply from 64.1.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
Reply from 64.1.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
Reply from 64.1.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128

Ping statistics for 64.1.1.1:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
    Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
        Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms
</pre>
<p>
Note that the series of numbers <code>64.1.1.1</code> is an IP address
which identifies a host (computer) on a TCP/IP network.  The name 'epc'
has been recorded on the computer running MassLynx as a hostname
for the IP address, so the computer does an easy lookup of the name
'epc' to get the IP address.  The IP address <code>64.1.1.1</code>
may not be the address you see, just so long as you see the series
of four numbers (it will be similar).
<p>
The output will have a continuous series of &ldquo;Reply&rdquo; lines,
and the time it took to ping and get a reply.
<p>
If the computers are not communicating, then you will see as series of
these lines:
<pre>
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
.
.
.
</pre>
<p>
You may see these lines of output initially, then you may see the
<code>Reply</code> lines.  That means the hosts were not communicating
initially, but did start communicating later.
<p>
Once you see they are communicating, start MassLynx.  During the startup
you should look at the MassLynx window bottom edge which contains
the status bar.  The status of the software is reported in several ways.
You are looking for statements like &ldquo;Connecting to Instrument&rdquo;
and finally &ldquo;Connected to Instrument&rdquo; or &ldquo;Instrument
Present.&rdquo;   This means that MassLynx is talking with the special
software inside the Q-ToF micro.  (The operating system of the embedded
PC in the Q-ToF MS itself is not Windows XP, but something called
VX Works.  You might do a search on the Internet to see how it works,
but it is not at all essential to your operation of the MS or the
software.)

<h2>Getting the Q-ToF and CapLC Running</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>Priming the CapLC Pumps</b>.
If you are going to use the CapLC (HPLC), you need to begin
the wet priming of the CapLC A/B/C pumps, which is routine at the start
of the day and often at the start of a run.
 <ol>
 <li>Turn on the nitrogen gas supply to the CapLC pumps.  The syringe
pumps require nitrogen gas to work.  At this time, the nitrogen gas
supply comes from the N<sub>2</sub> gas generator (Dominick-Hunter).
You might as well turn on the argon (Ar) gas supply too.
 <li>From the MassLynx Shortcut toolbar, click the Inlet Method icon
to call up the CapLC interface.  The CapLC interface has a number of details
which will not be a part of this checklist.  You need to know those from
a separate web page.
 <li>From the <code>Cap LC Tools</code> menu, select the <b>Diagnostics</b>
command.
 <li>From the new window <b>CapLC Diagnostics</b>, in
the <code>General Status</code> display box, you should see
the word <b>Idle</b>, or perhaps <b>Idle - Flowing</b>.  If not
(for example, you see <b>Autosampler Not Responding</b> or something else,
then from the <code>Control</code> menu, select <b>Reset Communications</b>.
You may need to use this command very frequently whenever you see an error
condition, and you have corrected the error, and want the system to understand
this.
 <li>From the <b>CapLC Diagnostics</b> window, select either the
button <b>WP</b> (Wet Prime) on the toolbar, or select from the
<code>Control</code> menu the <b>Wet Prime</b> command.
 <li>From the new window <b>Wet Prime</b>, click in the checkboxes for
all pumps A, B, and C and click <b>OK</b>.  Accept the default of 5
cycles, usually fairly long.
 <li>Verify that wet priming is occurring:  you should see solvent coming
out of all the waste lines for each of the pumps.  If you do not see it after
a few minutes, then perform a Reset Communications command to stop the
wet priming (it stops all activities on the CapLC pumps and autosampler
except for dry priming).  Perform the Dry Priming procedure for a dry
solvent line, but make sure you hook up the syringe and syringe adaptor
to pull solvent in.
 </ol>
<li><b>Washing Autosampler System</b>.  Start washing the Autosampler
syringe and loop if you intend to use the Autosampler to inject samples.
 <ol>
 <li>If you have not used the Autosampler in a long time (more than a few
 days) it is a wise idea to wash/prime in methanol first.   Remove the
 wash bottle now on the system, and place a bottle of HPLC-grade methanol.
 <li>From the <code>CapLC Diagnostics</code> window (obtained from the
<code>Cap LC Tools</code> <b>Diagnostics</b> command), select <b>User
Diagnostics</b>.
 <li>You should see a button <b>Wash</b> which starts the wash routine
of the Autosampler.  Click it.  The wash routine will end by itself.
<li>During the wash routine as the syringe fills and empties (goes down
then up), inspect the syringe barrel to make sure there is no air.
The use of methanol in the wash typically purges out the air bubbles.
If it does not, you might have to take the syringe off the Autosampler
and manually remove air.
 <li>If you have used methanol in the wash, remove the MeOH bottle and put
on the regular solvent bottle (it will likely be the same composition as
solvent for pump C).  Re-start the wash procedure with this solvent, and
then your Autosampler will be ready for injection.
 </ol>
<li>When wet priming is complete, you can start a flow in your HPLC system
using the correct solvents and solvent composition and flow rate.  You
need to know your system to know what to do.  Generally if you have
a reversed-phase system, you will first start up in 100% (or the highest
proportion) of acetonitrile (or organic solvent), especially if your storage
of columns is in organic solvent, then move towards equilibration conditions.
You should make note of the system backpressure in organic solvent and
equilibration conditions (presumably high aqueous), and that it is similar
to the last time you had the column system on.  For a Symmetry column
with 0.3 mm (300 &micro;m) diameter, you want a flow of 4-5 &micro;l per
minute usually.  For a nanocolumn with a 75 &micro;m diameter, your flow
should be no more than 0.2-0.3 &micro;l/min (200-300 nl/min).
<li>Turn on the NanoLock Spray Controller unit, sitting on top of the
Q-ToF MS usually.  The power switch is at the back left of the unit
as you look at it from the front.  Verify that the illumination light
to the NanoLock Spray assembly has come on.  You can also verify the
correct position of the baffle by selecting <b>Reference</b> or
<b>Analyte</b> from the Tune Page
<li>The nitrogen and argon gas supplies should be open/on.  The
nitrogen gas to the Q-ToF should be set at 7 bar (100 psi), and this
is introduced into the back of the MS through 6 mm dia PTFE tubing;
only metal or PTFE tubing should be used, since tubing of other plastics
results in chemical contamination that appears in the spectrum.
 <ul>
 <li>Look at the gas gauges on the Q-ToF MS panel.
 The <b>Nanoflow</b> gauge should be set at about 0.5 bar (7 psi);
 this is the nitrogen stream to the NanoLC probe and reference
 lockmass probe.
 <li>The <b>Gas Cell</b> gauge is the argon (collision) gas supply.
Its setting must be determined during gas flow set from the Tune Page.
Turn on the Collision Gas (Col Gas button on the toolbar looking as
if it is pressed) and the nitrogen gas (API Gas button).  Now turn the
Gas Cell dial (clockwise for more gas, counterclockwise for less gas)
until the <b>Analyzer Penning</b> vacuum gauge on the Tune Page
reads approximately <tt>6e&minus;5</tt>.  During the use of the Q-ToF,
you will see the value move away (up or down), especially early in the
day, and so you may need to adjust it somewhat continuously.  You will
adjust it less as time goes on.
 </ul>
<li><b>Reference (Lockmass) Capillary flow</b>.  Set up a test solution,
probably your lockmass solution, in the Hamilton syringe and mount it
to the syringe pump.  Your flow should go through the 75 &micro;m
capillary into the Reference probe through the top of the NanoLock Spray
assembly.  You should test the actual conditions under which it will
work.  You should set the flow rate so that it lasts for the time that the
syringe will operate under your chromatographic conditions.  If 50 min,
then a 100 &micro;l syringe will have to operate at 2 &micro;l/min or less.
Your reference mass should be at a concentration easily detectable by the
Q-ToF during reference sampling.
 <ol>
 <li>Set the LockSpray baffle in the Reference position from the Tune Page.
 <li>Set the proper flow rate, turn on the capillary and cone voltages,
and turn on the syringe pump from the Tune Page.  Make sure that you have
the scope (<i>m/z</i> range) set up for observing your ion, with proper
scan time.
 <li>Look for your ion in the beam.
 <li>If after some time that you do not see it, turn off both the capillary
and cone voltage and stop the nitrogen gas flow to the NanoLock Spray, but
keep the syringe flowing.  Look through the magnifying scope on the
NanoLock Spray to see that a drop of fluid is coming out the capillary
tip.  If it is, that means that the capillary is not blocked (one of the
possible problems).  If you do not see a flow, your capillary might be
blocked and you may have to replace the 20 &micro;m capillary in the
Reference flow setup.
 <li>When done verifying the Reference solution setup, turn off the flow
(syringe pump) and shut down the capillary and cone voltages, unless
testing the analyte spray.  See note about keeping capillary voltage high
in a non-flowing system.
 </ol>
<li><b>Methods Programmed</b>.  All of your methods (Q-ToF MS, CapLC)
should have already been programmed and ready before you go to the
next (Calibration) step.  Details about programming are not in this
checklist.
<li><b>Calibration</b>.  You should try to save Calibration for within
an hour in which you will do the run.  Calibration is done on a daily
basis.  You can use whatever calibrants you like, but they should
span the <i>m/z</i> range you intend to collect data in.  Do not
calibrate at only one end of the range and ignore the other, or you risk
not getting an accurate mass at the range for you have no calibrant.
PEG in ammonium solution is good for the <i>m/z</i> 100-1000 range, which
covers most tryptic peptide work.   There are other useful calibration
systems however.
 <ol>
 <li>Wash out the Hamilton with water and acetonitrile thoroughly, the
final rinse being water.
 <li>Put your calibration solution  in the syringe at the proper concentration.
 <li>Start the pump and get an ion beam.  Set the cone voltage to what
you will use during all experiments:  you cannot change the cone
voltage if you calibrate to a particular cone voltage.  If you change the
cone voltage, you have to re-calibrate to that cone voltage.
 <li>Make sure that the source temperature and desolvation temperature
and gas flow rates are set at what you will use.
 <li>Your flow rate and capillary voltage will be adjusted so that you
get no more than 200 counts per second on the base (highest) peak;
follow the spectrum scale on the Tune Page.  You should try to keep the
capillary voltage close to what you will use in most of your runs, but
it is not a strict requirement that capillary voltage be kept constant
after calibration.
 <li>Check resolution.  You may also want to check for deadtime, although
that is not a strict requirement if you keep the base peak counts to
around 200 per second.
 <li>The details of doing the calibration are given <a href="#">below</a>
Briefly, you want to uncalibrate (open the Uncalib.cal file) the instrument,
acquire the calibration solution spectra and combine those, process the
combined spectra (background subtract, smoothing, centroiding), and then
match the peaks above the noise with the reference masses.  For
removing noise, use a polynomial 5 with threshold 35-40% for the background
subtract,
 </ol>
</ol>

<h1><a name="shutdown"></a>Shutdown:  Daily (Short-Term) and Long-Term</h1>

<h1><a name="startup"></a>StartUp</h1>
<p>
If the instrument has been shutdown for a long period:
<ol>
<li>Check the level and quality of the rotary pump oil and change
or fill as needed.
<li>The supply of nitrogen gas should be dry and high purity with outlet
pressure adjusted to 7 bar (100 psi) to the Q-ToF.
<li>Connect the water supply to connectors on instrument rear.
<li>Is rotary pump exhaust properly vented?
<li>Are the electrical mains appropriate or suitable?
<li>Check ethernet link from control PC to instrument PC.
<li>Boot up host PC and wait for system to open before turning on Q-ToF power.
<li>Switch on mains of Q-ToF.
<li>Switch on embedded instrument PC.
<li>Open the Mass Lynx software and select <b>Instrument&rarr;MS Tune</b>.
</ol>
<h2>Pumping</h2>
<ol>
<li>Select <b>Vacuum</b> from menu bar at top of tune page.
<li>Click on <b>Pump</b>.
<li>Rotary pump will start, and then the turbomolecular pumps begin pump.
Check to see if Vacuum LED on front panel is amber, and then becomes green
in color when the system reaches operating vacuum.
<li>Open the pump ballast if the oil has been changed or replenished (otherwise
follow manufacturer's directions.  Allow to remain open for 30 minutes before
closing again.
</ol>
<h2>MCP Detector Conditioning</h2>
<p>
Detector conditioning is done by slowly raising voltage over time.
If the instrument has remain vented for some time even though vented with
dry nitrogen, the humidity may be too high.  If so, allow pumping for 12 h before
beginning conditioning.
<ol>
<li>Make sure ToF vacuum has pumped down to 2e-6 mbrar
<li>Before setting into <b>Operate</b>, ensure MCP Detector voltage is zero,
then set.
<li>From <b>Options</b>, select <b>MCP Conditioning</b> to access its dialog.
<li>When the detector has been vented for a long time, set the following:
	<ul><li>Start: 100 V<li>Stop: 2700 V<li>Duration: 600 min<li>Step: 5 min</ul>
<p>
When the detector has been under vacuum for a long time but has not been
at resting voltage:
	<ul><li>Start: 100 V<li>Stop: 2700 V<li>Duration: 180 min<li>Step: 1 min</ul>
</ol>
<p>
When the detector is not being used, keep voltage at 1500 V.
<h2>The Fully Ready, Warmed-Up Instrument</h2>
<p>
The best mass accuracy is obtained when the instrument temperature has
stabilized for a minimum of two hours after switching to Operate.
<p>
<b>Note</b>:  The instrument should be left in Operate mode even overnight
in order to reduce mass scale shifts due to temperature changes.  Leaving the
instrument in operate does not reduce detector lifetime.

<h2>Megaflow Operation</h2>
<p>
This mode allows use of a 2.1 mm microbore and even 4.6 mm diameter columns
without postcolumn splitting.  Flows can be from 0.2-1.0 ml per minute.
Use yellow-striped PEEK tubing (1/16-inch o.d., 0.007-inch i.d.).  Nitrogen
inlet pressure should be 6-7 bar (90-100 psi).  The exhaust liner and
cleanable baffle should be fitted to source.  All this is important for
optimum electrospray intensity and stability when operating at low flow rates.
<ol>
<li>Electrospray should be connected to pulse-free pump.
<li>Solvent should be degassed since bubbles cause beam instabilities.
<li>PTFE tubing should be connected to Nebuliser Gas port.
<li>Start flow at 10 &micro;l/min (no gas) to observe fluid emerging from tip.
Avoid unwanted capillary action effects by not allowing flow for longer periods
from the probe with nitrogen gas switched off.
<li>Turn on <b>API</b> gas to start nitrogen flow, with flow of &lt; 100 L/h.
Check there is no leak in nitrogen gas flow from any place.
<li>Make adjustments to probe tip to ensure nebulization of liquid.
The capillary should protrude from the probe tip by about 0.5 mm (ideally
0.6 mm).  Incorrrectly adjusted tips can cause poor ESI performance.
<li>With a magnifying loop check the inner and outer stainless steel capillaries
and make sure they are straight and circular.
</ol>

<h2>Nanoflow Operation</h2>
<p>
The nanoflow setup offers a mount for a borosilicate metal-coated glass
capillary and for the Nano-LC probe.  Flow is in the range of 5-1000 &micro;l/min,
2-3 orders of magnitude less than the Z-spray.
<p>
If the assembly is to be mounted to the instrument, take note of the following:
<ol>
<li>If the cone gas nozzle special to the nanoflow setup is to be mounted,
do not neglect to close the sample isolation valve.  Remove the two screws and
mount the cone and fit the cone gas nozzle.  Cone gas flow will be 30% of the
total desolvation gas flow.
<li>The purge gas port should be plugged.
<li>The cleanable baffle, exhaust liner and corona discharge pin blanking plug
should be fitted.
<li>A viton O-ring and three short nanoflow pillars are fitted.
<li>Install the perspex cover and nanoflow end flange, securing with socket
head screws.
<li>Block the <b>Desolvation Gas</b> port on the panel and close the nebuliser
needle valve.
<li>Attach the cables to the Capillary/Corona and Probes sockets.
<li>Set <b>Source Temp</b> to 80&deg;.
</ol>

<h1><a name="qtofbeamtuning"></a>Tuning the Ion Beam</h1>
<p>
Several factors determine a well-tuned ion beam.  Beam tuning involves
first detecting ions (reaching a certain sensitivity), and then making
sure that the resolution of the system is proper, and that the ion count
is not so high that dead time in detection causes shifting of the <i>m/z</i>
from an accurate or true <i>m/z</i>.
<p>
Before adjusting voltages, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Set the proper <b>Ion Mode</b>: positive or negative, ESI or APcI.
<li>Desolvation gas flow should be 300 L/h
<li>Set liquid to flow at 10 &micro;l/min (megaflow setup) and desolvation
to 100&deg;.
<li>Set the probe stage from the cone gas nozzle so that the tip is 4 mm
to the right and 8 mm back from the nozzle.  The probe adjustment wheels
will move 1.25 mm per revolution with a maximum 10 mm travel in each direction.
<li>When flow rates are adjusted to a higher rate,  move the probe tip further
away from the cone for better stability and sensitivity.  At lower flow rates,
position is less critical.  For the megaflow, 70-90 L/h nitrogen gas nebulization
is best; open the Nebulizer flow control valve fully on instrument panel.
<li>Desolvation temperature and gas flow is based both on solvent flow
rates and its composition.  The <b>Desolvation Gas</b> flow setting in
software actually is the <i>total drying flow</i>, which is the sume of the
desolvation gas emerging from probe tip, the cone gas flow (nanoflow only),
and the purge gas, if it is enabled.  The following table is a guide for
temperature and gas settings based on solvent flow rate:
<table>
<tr><th>Solvent Flow Rate<br>(&micro;l/min) <th>Desolvation Temp<br>&deg;C
 <th>Desolvation Gas Flow<br>L/h
<tr><td>&lt;10 <td> 100-120 <td>200-250
<tr><td>10-20  <td>120-250  <td>200-400
<tr><td>20-50  <td>250-350  <td>200-400
<tr><td>&gt;50 <td>350-400  <td>500-750
</table>
Higher desolvation temperatures will improve sensitivity but if too high will
reduce beam stability. <strong>The desolvation temperature should not be
sustained at high values without gas flow, or the source could be damaged</strong>.
<li>The cone gas reduces intensity of solvent cluster and adduct ions.
Increase the cone gas to reduce these effects, but do not diminish the intensity
of the [M+H]<sup>+</sup> ion (the ion of interest).  At megaflow rates, cone
gas will be 100-300 L/h.
<li>Purge gas: not necessary for most ESI applications, but in megaflow
operation when an analyte is susceptible to MeCN adducting, it can be used.
Remove the blanking plug from the outlet situated in the source enclosure, and
the gas flow rate will be a constant 30% of the total desolvation gas flow rate.
<li>Source Temperature:  For a 50% MeCN solvent, 100&deg; is suffient up to
50 &micro;l/min flow rates.  Increasing to 150&deg; may be necessary for either
higher flow rates or higher water content of the solvent. <strong>Maximum
operating temperature is 150&deg;, and the megaflow source should not be
operated at a higher temperature</strong>.
</ol>

<p>
The ion source must be
have the capillary and sample cone voltages adjusted, the nitrogen
gas flow rate and temperature adjusted for desolvation and the cone gas
(that is <em>six</em> variables!).  The source is important because it
produces the ions necessary.  It must also remove the solvent from the
analyte ions efficiently too.  The flow and temperature of the desolvation
gas is adjusted for that purpose.
<p>
The quadrupole must have its voltages adjusted too.  Its function is
usually as a mass range selector, and so the Q-ToF micro automatically
adjusts the voltages to provide the proper <i>m/z</i> range selection.
However, other components are also involved in making the beam to and
from the quadrupole narrow, or steering it to the flight tube.
Components in the time-of-flight tube also affects resolution and sensitivity,

<tr><td>Capillary Voltage
	<td>Ionizes the analyte in the solvent as it emerges from the capillary.
	Flow rate and capillary voltage should be adjusted so that big drops
	are not coming out, and the drops break up.
	<td>Depends a great deal on the analyte and the solvent composition,
	and perhaps on the flow rate.  But between 1500-3000 V is the usual
	range.  In megaflow, a range 2500-4000 V is usual for positive ion
mode, 2000-3500 V for negative ion mode.  At rather high flow rates,
it is possible that an optimal voltage as low as 1000 V.

   <td>2642
   <td>2500
<tr><td>Sample Cone Voltage
	<td>Starts the ion beam.  Along with the vacuum gradient, it pulls
	the ion into analyzer.  Higher cone voltages can increase the probability
  of ion fragmentation in the source.
	<td>Typically 30-50 V for multiply charged species.  A higher
	setting for singly charged species, and also when the analyte mass
	is large.  For a megaflow Z-Spray setup, a 25-70 V setting is possible,
with the lower setting for small ions and higher setting for proteins.

<tr><td>Desolvation Temperature

	from the flow controller.
	<td>Usually 150&deg;, but it might be higher or lower depending
	on the solvent nature.  For largely aqueous solutions, 150&deg; is
	okay.  For solvents or solvent mixes that have volatile components
	(methanol, acetonitrile), a lower temperature might be better.
   For megaflow setups, might be as high as 400&deg;

<tr><td>Source Temperature
	<td>This is the temperature of the ion block (the part that holds the
	sample cone, extraction cone, etc.).  This keeps ice from forming
	inside the ion block as the solvent passes into the sample and extraction
	cones, and the increasing vacuum causes solvent molecules to go into the
	gas phase, causing solvent molecules remaining behind in aerosolized
	drops to form ice around the analyte as an evaporative cooling effect.

Cycle times can be set between 30-255 &micro;s.  Setting to less than
30 sets the pusher value at 30.
<p>
If a value of 0 (zero) is set, the pusher is disabled.
<p>
If the flight time is increased, the duty cycle (sampling efficiency)
in the ToF is reduced, and so is the sensitivity.
<p>
The instrument should ALWAYS be recalibrated if the flight time is
changed.

<h2>Manual Pusher &amp; How To Check for Pusher Pulse Presence</h2>
<p>
Normally the pusher frequency is set to one of six preset values to
cover the mass range.
<p>
If there is difficulty in getting a beam, confirm the working of the
manual pusher.

<ol>
<li>Set the TDC Stop to 30 mV.
<li>Look for ghost peaks at around <i>m/z</i>75-80, which occur because
of capacitive coupling in the head.
</ol>

<h2>TDC Setting</h2>
<p>
The <b>TDC Settings</b> (time-to-digital converter) is found under the
<b>Options</b> menu.

<table>
<tr><th>TDC Component <th>Function/Use  <th>Typical Setting
<tr><td>Start

</ul>



<ol>
<li>Set the instrument into <b>OPERATE</b>.
<li>Turn on the <b>API Gas</b> (nitrogen), <b>Col Gas</b> (argon),
and start the flow on the <b>Syringe</b>.
<li>Look for response in the peak display window:  adjust the
<b>Capillary</b> and <b>Sample Cone</b> voltages to adjust peak height and
shape.
<li>Other voltages should be set and/or verified:
 <ul>
 <li>ToF tube: 5630 V
 <li>Reflectron: 1780 V
 <li>Pusher: 810 V
 <li>Puller: 620 V
 <li>Collision Energy: 10
 <li>Entrance:  110 V
 <li>Steering:  0 V

 <li>Acc V:  200 V
 <li>Pusher and Grid 2 offsets: 0 V
 <li>Focus: 0 V
 <li>Tube:  65 V
 </ul>
<li>Adjust collision gas pressure (the knob on the gas panel that
reads <b>Gas Cell</b>) so that Analyzer Penning is about
~6e&minus;5 mbar
</ol>

<h3>Checking Resolution</h3>
<p>
Tuning means getting peak resolution to 5000.
<ol>
<li>Use leucine enkephalin (2 ng/&micro;l in methanol/water/1% acetic acid)
at 5 &micro;l/min as an example.
<li>Select <b>Acquire</b> from the Tune Page.  Set the <b>Data File Name</b>
appropriately, with <b>TOF MS</b> set as the Function, and <b>Continuum</b>
for the Data Format.  The mass range is <i>m/z</i> 100-1000, and
the acquisition time is 1 min.  Scan time can be any reasonable,
but 1 sec with an interscan time of 0.1 s is usualy.
</ol>

<h2>Improving Resolution in the Q-ToF</h2>

<h3>ToF Resolution</h3>
<p>
Resolution in the flight tube is used to achieve good separation of the
ions based on time of flight.
<p>
Set TDC Start to 500 and TDC Stop to 200.  L<sub>teff</sub> is 1081
and V<sub>eff</sub> is 5630.
<p>
Acquire scans of 2.5 seconds in <i>m/z</i> 100-1000 range.
If the splitting of peaks is observed, adjust the TDC Start value.
<p>
To improve flight tube resolution in the Waters/Micromass Q-ToF <i>micro</i>,
adjust these voltages in the following order:
<ol>
<li>Adjust <b>Pusher</b> and <b>puller</b> voltages to affect the most
gross aspects of resolution.
<li>ToF:  Pusher offset (also Steering)
<li>ToF:  Tube Lens adjustment gives best resolution and peak shape
<li>Source:  Sample Cone
<li>Quadrupole:  Aperture 2 reduction will increase resolution but at the
expense of sensitivity
<li>Quadrupole:  RF Lens 2
<li>Quadrupole:  Pre/Post Filter
<li>Adjusting the <b>Entrance</b> voltage can improve resolution as well.
</ol>


<h3>Quadrupole Resolution</h3>
<p>
Quadrupole resolution is important when the quadrupole is in scanning mode
but also when a single/parent ion is to be filtered to the flight tube.
<p>
Quadrupole resolution has no importance in ToF MS mode and the importance
is upon using the quadrupole in focusing the beam.  Thus the resolving
dc component in the quadrupole is shut off in this mode.
<p>
In parent or survey mode (ToF MS/MS is used), then the low and high
sliders on the quadrupole page become significant.

<h2>Setting TDC Stop</h2>

<ol>
<li>Get a beam in the range <i>m/z</i> 100 to 1000 using any sample.
<li>Set the MCP Detector at 2800 V
<li>Set the Entrance to 0 V to kill the beam.
<li>Reduce the TDC Stop value until significant noise is seen (TIC &gt; 1e3)
<li>Increase the TDC Stop until the noise is reduced to &ldquo;grass&rdquo;
(TIC &gt; 200)
<li>Consider this the new TDC Stop value.
<li>Increase MCP to 2900 V, and see that the noise stays below TIC &lt; 200.
<li>Set Entrance back to its value, and re-check resolution.
<li>If there is ringing, reduce the MCP voltage.
<li>Do the MCP gain test, which should plateau before ringing occurs.

<h1><a name="QToFcalib">Calibration</a></h1>
<h2>Quadrupole</h2>
<p>
The quadrupole has no point detector and thus there is no ability to
calibrate this component.

<h2>ToF</h2>
<p>
Basic time of flight calibration follows the equation:
<p class="eqnserif">
&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid black"><i>m/z</i></span> =
<i>Q</i> + <i>Pt</i>
<p>
where <i>P</i> is a coefficient that include the factors of pathlength
and voltages, and <i>Q</i> is an offset that occurs from propagation delay
which includes limitations of the electronics (detector rise time, delays
of trigger signals in cables).

<h3>Nominal Mass Accuracy</h3>
<p>
<i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i> is the <b>eff</b>ective <b>L</b>ength of the flight
<b>t</b>ube.  An <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i> is entered into the system.
To calculate a new <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i>, the following relationship
holds true:
<p class="eqnserif">
adjusted <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;current <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i>
&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid black"><i>m<sub>ind</sub></i> /
<i>m<sub>act</sub></i></span>
<p>
where <i>m<sub>ind</sub></i> is the indicated mass on the QToF and
<i>m<sub>act</sub></i> is the actual mass.  This is derived from the equations
of motion in the flight tube.
<p>
Normally a test compound spectrum is acquired and the measured and accurate
mass data are plugged into to equation above with the current <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i>
being 1078.

<h4>Setting the <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i></h4>
<p>
Follow this protocol for calculating the <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i>:
<ol>
<li>Prepare Leu-enkephalin at 2 ng/ml in 50% methanol
<li>Set this up in the syringe pump at 5 &micro;l/min
<li>Acquire spectra for about 2 minutes
<li>Combine the necessary spectra and center.
<li>Take the measured value against the actual mass (556.2771) and calculate
the Lteff.  Suppose the measured mass is 561.2170.  The new Lteff is
1082.78.
<li>Enter the calculated Lteff into the <b>TDC Settings</b> dialog.
<li>Repeat the acquisition.  The new setting is the nominal mass accuracy.
</ol>

<h3>Accuracy Factors</h3>
<p>
The accuracy of mass depends on several factors involving
the proper conditioning of the instrument, as well as correcting for
the effect of temperature.  In order to calibrate, the following steps
are taken:
<ol>
<li>the beam tuning is optimized
<li>an evaluation is done for adequate ion counts and to avoid dead time
<li>the calibration is done
<li>a QA check follows
<li>analytical data acquisition can be done with intermittent QC done
</ol>
<p>
<b>Source optimization</b>.  Before a calibration can be done, the beam
must have total ion counts in series of scans that vary no more than
10%.  The instrument should have been set in operate and be in its current
ion mode for at least 45 min.  The proper <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i> should
also have been calculated with 0.5 Da or better.
<p>
<b>Ion counts</b>.  The ion counts should be &lt;0.1 ions per push.
If more than 0.1 ions were detected in a 1 Da region during a pusher
cycle (44 &mu;s for range <i>m/z</i> 50-950), there is a probability
that another ion was present and not detected.  To determine if a mass
spectral peak is in dead time, accumulate <i>x</i> spectra, where
<i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 to 3 with one spectrum per second, centroid the data with
Np&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and Res&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, then divide the peak intensity by the number of
pusher cycles (peak height of centroided spectrum / (count of spectra
combined &times; count of pushes per spectra).  If the result is
&gt; 0.1, the peak is in dead time.  The number of pushes per second is
22727, since there are 44 &mu;s between each push.  If the total count
of ions measured in the base peak is 2500, the the ions per push is 0.110,
and the peak is in dead time.

<h3>Performing the <i>Instrument</i> Calibration</h3>
<p>
The instrument calibration is the most frequent type of calibration and
is done before acquisition of spectra from unknown samples.  The calibration
parameters are saved as <b>.CAL</b> file.  All spectra acquired with this
calibration file loaded are given their mass weights based on this
calibration.
<p>
The steps in the calibration follow this course:
<ol>
<li>center the spectrum
<li>save spectrum
<li>call calibrate from the Tune Page
<li>select the correct reference file
<li>Process -- Calibration from file
<li>Select ToF calibration
<li>browse and select from history the saved spectrum
<li>check that all points make a reasonable fit; delete those that distort
curve
<li>close and accept the calibration
</ol>

<ol>
<li>As an example calibrant, prepare the following substances in
2 mM ammonium acetate in 50% acetonitrile:
 <ul>
 <li>10 pmol/&micro;l PEG 300
 <li>10 pmol/&micro;l PEG 600
 </ul>
<li>Dilute this solution 1:10 with in 50% acetonitrile
<li>Set up in the syringe pump at 5 &micro;l per min.
</ol>
<p>
The following steps are done to achieve the actual calibration:
<ol>
<li>Set cone voltage to 30-40 V to provide a good distribution of PEG
peaks.
<li>Check the peak resolution.
<li>30-60 seconds of data is acquired (in this case over the range
<i>m/z</i> 100-1000 with a 1 second scan time
<li>verify from some single spectra that scan is not in dead time
(should not be more than 200 counts per second)
<li>combine the spectra (at least 30 scans)
<li><b>Check for Deadtime Distortion</b>:
  <ol>
  <li>Call the <b>TOF Spectrum Center</b> dialog using
    <b>Process&minus;&gt;Center</b> from within the Spectrum application
  <li>Click the <b>TOF</b> button
  <li>The <b>QTOF Accurate Mass</b> dialog appears.  Set the Resolution
    and Np Multiplier to 0.
  <li>Center the spectrum with the following values
    <ul>
	 <li>min peak at half height:  2 channels
	 <li>centroid top: 80%
	 <li>create a centered spectrum (selected) with <b>Heights</b> <b>Add</b>ed
	 </ul>
  <li>Re-center the data with a resolution of 5000 and the Np multiplier set
   to 0.7.
  <li>the differences in the centroided masses should be &lt; 0.001 Da.
  If the differences between the two peaks is &gt; 0.001 Da, then repeat
  acquisition with less intense peaks (dilute solution, or reduce capillary
  voltage).
  <li>Save the satisfactory spectrum in the history
  </ol>
<li>center the combined spectra&mdash;get the ToF Spectrum Center dialog box
and make the following settings:
 <ol>
 <li>Min. peak width = 3
 <li>Centering method is <b>Centroid top</b> set @ 80%
 <li>Check <b>Create centered spectrum</b> by <b>Areas</b>
 <li>and have the created spectrum <b>Add</b>ed rather than creating a new
   window or replacing spectra in the window
 </ol>
<li>From within the <b>ToF Spectrum Center</b> dialog box, click the <b>TOF...</b>
button to get the <b>TOF Accurate Mass</b> dialog box for setting
the ToF constants:
 <ol>
 <li><b>Resolution</b> should be set to <b>5000</b>
 <li><b>Np multiplier</b> should be set to <b>0.65</b>
 <li>Because no lock mass is used, <b>Lock Mass</b> should be set to <b>0</b>
 <li><b>Lock Spray</b> needs to be set to &ge;1 although it is not used at all
 </ol>
<li>Save the centered spectrum (<b>File&rarr;Save Spectrum...</b>)
<li>From the <i>Tune Page</i>, select
<b>Calibration&rarr;Calibrate&nbsp;instrument...</b>
<li>The <i>Calibration</i> dialog box may show a calibration file loaded:
select <b>Calibrate&rarr;Default</b> to set the current calibration to
the &lsquo;Uncalibrated&rsquo; settings
<li>Do a <b>File&rarr;Save As...</b> to save the current calibration file
<li>Select <b>Calibrate&rarr;File...</b>.  In the
  <i>Display Calibration Graphs</i> dialog box:
 <ol>
 <li><b>Select Calibration Type</b> is set to <b>TOF</b> (<b>MS1</b>
  is not normally calibrated, and set up to nominal mass on install and
  only check at preventative maintenance)
 <li>The <b>Browse...</b> button is selected in <b>Select Calibration File</b>
  to look for the just created spectrum in the Spectrum Browser
 <li>Select the .RAW file that contains the calibration spectrum and
  click <b>History</b> and select the centroided spectrum representing
  the Accurate Mass data
 <li>Click OK several times to get out of the Calibrate From File process
 </ol>
<li>The parameters for calibration must be set in the <i>Calibration
  Parameters</i> dialog box:
 <ol>
 <li>For the <b>Curve Fit</b>ting, the polynomial order should be <b>1</b>
 <li>Leave Auto Peak Matching set to the defaults
 </ol>
<li>A <i>Calibration</i> window shows four plots:
 <ol>
 <li>a <i>data file</i> plot on the top that shows it is
    &ldquo;uncalibrated&rdquo;
 <li>a <i>reference file</i> that shows all known peaks with accurate masses
 <li>a <i>mass difference</i> plot in which the matched masses of the
   data and reference are subtracted to compute
    <i>data&nbsp;mass&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;reference&nbsp;mass</i>
 <li>the <i>residuals</i> plot which computes the square of the
  <i>mass difference</i> value
 </ol>
 Do the following:
 <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
 <li>Match the data masses to the reference masses as much as possible
 <li>If the mass difference line does <em>not</em> cross zero, an
   incorrect <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i> is indicated, in which
   case, the <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i> needs to be re-set and a recalibration
   done
 <li>If there is a &ldquo;smile&rdquo; in the residuals plot, this may
   be evidence of dead time:  re-acquire the data
 <li>with a good <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i> set (and regeneration of calibration
  data with re-set of <i>Lt<sub>eff</sub></i>, check the residuals:  if
  there are large residuals at high <i>m/z</i>, check the peak shape
  and centroiding at high <i>m/z</i> and reject peaks that are split,
  since centroiding is not supposed to generate split peaks
 <li>try to get calibration with a 1st order line, but if necessary
 increase the polynomial order to get a good fit
 <li>the residuals error should be &le; 0.003
 <li>Exit the calibration and save it
 </ol>
</ol>
<p>The Calibration file (extension *.cal) now contains the equation to
adjust all masses of future acquisitions to accurate masses.
<p>
<b>Confirming the calibration</b>.  Immediately acquire data using the
same calibration solution or another QA mixture.  Use the appropriate
lock mass and the <em>same</em> mass measurement parameters to determine
mass accuracy on several spectral peaks.  Use a spreadsheet to calculate
the RMS of the mass error:  the mass error is the difference between
the theoretical <i>m/z</i> to the experimentally derived <i>m/z</i>.
The average mass error should be &le; 5 ppm!

<h3>Performing the <i>Spectrum</i> Calibration</h3>
<p>
This sort of calibration is used to re-calibrate/process spectra already
acquired.  This kind of calibration is saved as a <b>.SCL</b> file.
<p>
The steps involve:
<ol>
<li>centering the calibration spectrum
<li>Tools&minus;&gt;Make Calibration
<li>selecting the reference file
<li>Applying (Tools&minus;&gt;Apply Calibration) the calibration to any
spectrum.  The calibration is then associated with the spectrum in its
header file (_header.text).
</ol>


<h3>Exact Mass Measurement</h3>
<ul>
<li>When using a lock mass, try to aim for an intensity of 100-200 counts
per second
<li>The lock mass used should be at the upper end of the mass range.
<li>Changing the transfer lens voltages requires an instrument re-calibration
<li>Changing the cone voltage will not affect a calibration.
<li>Chemical interferences might affect mass accuracy.
<li>Base calibrations might be better done doing changes to the probe axis
rather than using lower concentrations, which often minimizes chemical
interferences from background ions.
<li>Continuously monitor the probe spray:  variations produce fluctuations
in ions per peak with the pusher pulse, causing errors in deadtime
calculations.
<li>Combine scans of similiar intensity, whether in the top or the tail
of the chromatographic peak;  this ensures that ions per pusher pulse
is calculated correctly.
<li>The deadtime correction model has limits:  keep the ion current to
less than 10,000 counts per peak per second without correction.
<li>For measurement of mass of doubly charged ions, it is best to select
the doubly charged peak (cluster) of the lockmass reference for correction.
<li>The standard deviation computed in determining the centroid  of
a Gaussian peak if only looking at ion statistics is (assuming a peak
approximates a triangle):
 <p class="eqnserif">
 &sigma; ppm = 10<sup>6</sup> &Delta;M / M (24 &times; Np)<sup>0.5</sup> ppm
 <p>
where M is &Delta;M is the width of the base of the triangle peak,
M is the <i>mass</i> value of the peak, and Np is the number of ions in the
peak.  Assuming a standard deviation of 5 ppm when measuring a peak at
500 m, one can calculate Np.  If the resolution is 5000, then &Delta;M
is 0.2 <i>m/z</i> (width at base = twice width at half-height), and so
Np = ((0.2<sup>2</sup> &times; 10<sup>12</sup>)/(24 &times; 500<sup>2</sup>
&times; 5<sup>2</sup>)) = 267.  Hence standard deviations of &lt; 5 ppm
can not be expected unless the count of ions per peak &gt; 267.
</ul>


<h1>Data Acquisition</h1>
<p>
Acquisitions will typically be taken from the tune page to evaluate
the settings for a single sample, but should be started from a MassLynx
sample list for multiple sample acquisition.

<h2>Sample Preparation/Setup</h2>
<p>
Samples should be fully dissolved.  Use a centrifuge or filter or both to
remove undissolved material and any particulates.
<p>
Biopolymers should not be at concentrations higher than 20 pmol/&micro;l.
Lower concentrations yield better ESI results for biopolymers while
higher levels require frequent cleaning of source and increase risk of
capillary blocking.
<p>
Low MW substances should not be at concentrations higher than 10 ng/&micro;l.
The best levels are 1 ng/&micro;l.
<p>
Samples with salts in solvent, particularly phosphate, should be avoided.
If it cannot be avoided, pull the probe away from the cone to minimize
deposition on the cone, although sensitivity might be reduced.
<p>
To test performance, try using horse heart myoglobin (MW 16951.48)
in the range <i>m/z</i> 800-1600 to observe the multiply charged ions,
in either positive or negative ion mode.
<p>
Polyethylene glycol mixtures can be used to calibrate the instrument, and
can be mixed with their different average molecular weights (300 / 600 / 1000)
in positive ion mode.  For negative ion mode, a mixture of sugars serves
in the same range.  NaI or CsI can also be used for negative ion mode.

<h3>Positive or Negative Ion Mode?</h3>
<p>
Typical selections for positive ion mode are:
<ul><li>peptides and proteins <li>small polar compounds
  <li>drugs and their metabolites
  <li>environmental contaminants (pesticides, pollutants)
  <li>dye compounds  <li>some organometallics  <li>small saccharides
</ul>
<p>
For negative ion mode:
<ul><li>some proteins <li>some drug metabolites (e.g., glucuronide conjugates)
  <li>oligonucleotides
  <li>some saccharides and polysaccharies
</ul>


<h2>Tune Page Acquisition</h2>
<p>
Inlet programs cannot be used in this mode, nor multiple sample acquisitions
set.  A <b>Data File Name</b> must be entered.  In addition comment
<b>Text</b> is permitted.  The mass range is also specified, and the
duration of acquisition, along with time of each scan and the interscan
period are set.
<p>
If a TOF MS/MS is specified the <b>Set Mass</b> is that of the precursor
ions.
<h2>Monitoring the Acquisition</h2>
<p>
Select <b>Options&minus;&gt;</b> to obtain a <b>Scan Report</b>.
This provides the file name, a number for a function, the retention
time, the number of the scan, the ion mode, total ion count, and
intensity and mass of the BP.

<h2>Expermiment (MS Method) Editor</h2>
<p>
A mixture of MS and MS/MS acquisition methods can be set up either
concurrently or sequentially, although <b>Survey</b> and
<b>Parent Ion</b> methods must be run in isolation.
Mixed function experiments/acquisitions attempt to acquire
MS/MS product ion spectra in different retention windows.
<p>
From the MassLynx instrument shortcut bar, select <b>MS Method</b>.
Several functions are available in the Q-ToF micro.  Each function
operates with a span of time within the total run time set.  The total
run time and the span of the function time are indicated within
the display.  Functions can be created, edited (double click the selected
function, copied (Copy, then Paste from Edit menu), and removed/deleted.
The order of functions can be reset using the up and down arrowhead keys.

<h2>Solvent Delay</h2>
<p>
This is used to avoid the appearance of solvent-related peaks in the
TIC chromatogram.  Data acquisition is delayed during this period.
Select <b>Options&minus;&gt;Solvent Delay</b>.

<h2>Functions</h2>

<h3>MS Scan</h3>
<p>
In setting up the TOF MS scan, the following parameters must be set:
<ul>
<li>Low and High Mass range settings.
<li>the start and end times for the acquisition
<li>a cone voltage (alternatively, the voltage set in the Tune Page can be
used)
<li>the ionization mode, data format
<li>time of a scan and the interscan delay
<li>the period and cone voltage for scanning a lockmass reference,
and the count of scans to average
</ul>
<p>
Data formats can be:
<ul>
<li><b>Centroid</b>.  Continuum peaks are centroided, and intensity
and mass assigned peaks stored.
<li><b>Continuum</b>.  An analog signal is stored for all scans.
The data file sizes can be enormous, so to limit it, a centroid
type of data collection should be used, or a threshold to eliminate
storage of <i>m/z</i> values representing noise.
<li><b>MCA</b>.  Multi-channel analysis (MCA) represents a
&ldquo;summed continuum.&rdquo;  Only ONE scan is stored, representing
the accumulation of ion counts for a set of scans.  An advantage of MCA
is that random noise is averaged out, and there is a better indication
of signal-to-noise.  A disadvantage is there can be no time-resolved
data.  The <b>Scans to Sum</b> represent the number of scans to be
accumulated for creating the spectrum.
</ul>

<h3>MS/MS Scan</h3>
<p>
In addition to setting all the functions in the MS Scan, the MS/MS scan
includes the following settings:

<ul>
<li><b>Set Mass</b>.  This is the mass of the precursor selected by the
quadrupole for fragmentation in the gas cell.  For multiply charged
species, the high mass range should be sufficient to include product
ions with lower charge but higher <i>m/z</i> value than the precursor.
<li><b>Time</b>.  Several sequential and overlapping times can be set
to specify several MS/MS functions with set masses.
<li><b>Collision Energy</b>.  Collision energy can be set, or the tune
page setting can be used.
</ul>

<h3>Survey Scan</h3>
<p>
See <a href="#dda">Data-Dependent Acquisition section</a>.

<h3>Parent Scan</h3>
<p>
In MS mode, the quadrupole is run in rf-only mode and essentially acts
only as an ion guide and not a mass filter.  The collision energy is
switched alternately from low (4 V) to high.  The parent of a product
ion of interest is seen in a high energy dataset, all its precursors are
revealed in the low energy dataset.  The two datasets contain the entire
set of precursor and product ions that can be formed so it is possible to
generate the equivalent of a neutral loss scan.
<p>
Consider phosphorylated petpides where the neutral loss of 98 Da
(H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) occurs by &beta;-elimination from
P-Ser and P-Thr residues.  The Q-ToF switches from MS to MS/MS when the
pseudomolecular ion shows a neutral lose of 98 Da between high and low
energy data.
<p>
To set up a parent ion scan:
<ol>
<li>From the MassLynx standard window (where sample lists are shown),
select <b>MS Method</b> from the left pane containg toolbars.
<li>The <b>Experiment Setup</b> method editor window appears.  From it
click the button labeled <b>Parent</b> in the toolbar under the menu.
<li>In MassLynx 4.1, a new window <b>DDA Wizard</b> appears.
The wizard will query the user on a number of options and requirements
for the parent scan.  In version 4.0, a dialog window interface is
presented and the user selects the various tabs and enters in the
required parameters.  The parameters are described below.
</ol>

<p>
Parameters which are necessary to know for a parent scan:
<ul>
<li><b>Parent Survey</b>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Mass Range Start and End</b>:  the mass range of the ions to
be surveyed.
 <li><b>Method</b>: positive or negative ions, and whether spectra are
represented as contiuum or centroid.
 <li><b>Time of Survey</b>: both a start and end time are indicated
 <li><b>Scanning Times</b>:  Total scan time in seconds, and the
 time between scans (interscan delay) in seconds
 <li><b>Cone Voltage</b>:  the user sets the cone voltage or can elect
 to use the one already set in the Tune Page
 <li><b>Collision Energy</b>: both a low and high collision energy are
 specified, where the low collision energy is when in MS mode and
 the high CE is for fragmentation mode
 <li><b>Reference Lockspray</b>:  user should specify:
  <ul>
  <li>number of scans to average
  <li>frequency of reference scans in seconds
  <li>cone voltage during reference scans
  </ul>
 </ul>
<li><b>Product Ions</b><br>
 This creates a list of ions which must be detected for parent ion discovery
 to be triggered.  The list is typically a file.  Note the use of the
 booleans <b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b>:  if <b>AND</b> is selected, all product
 ions must be detected for the switch;  if <b>OR</b> is selected, then
 only one of the product ions must be detected.  Additional criteria for
 the switch are indicated below under <b>Switch Criteria</b>.
 <ul>
 <li><b>Switch Criteria: Threshold</b>.  These are the ion counts per
 second (default = 10) that must occur if the switch is to be made.
 <li><b>Switch Criteria: Detection Window</b>.  This value is the tolerance
 in the <i>m/z</i> value indicated above.  Default is 0.1 Da (100 mDa)
 or 0.025 Da (25 mDa).  The latter value is recommended for greater
 specificity.
 </ul>
<li><b>Neutral Loss</b><br>
This triggers parent ion discovery mode by attempts to detect a neutral
loss.  For example, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (accurate mass = 97.9769)
is typically lost from phosphopeptides.  The neutral loss mass must be
indicated.  All ions will have their charge state determined in real time
and be evaluated for neutral loss.  The switch to discovery mode also
features a <b>threshold ion count</b> and a <b>detection window</b> or
tolerance as for product ions.
<li><b>MS/MS Template</b><br>
 Much like the Parent Mode (MS) tab, the settings control the MS/MS mode
 for ions filtered by the quadrupole.  For MS/MS mode, an IPR file should
 be specified to indicate all voltage settings.  Nonetheless, a cone
 voltage and collision energy can also be specified.
<li><b>MS to MS/MS Switching</b><br>
 Determines parameters for switching to MS/MS from MS mode.  In general
 the user chooses either to switch when the <em>total ion count</em>
 or <em>any individual ion count</em> exceeds a threshold.  Usually
 individual ion intensity is selected.
 <ul>
 <li><b>Switch Criteria: [Individual Ion] Intensity</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Threshold</b>:  value in counts per second
  <li><b>Detection Window</b>:  this helps to prevent selection of isotope
peaks of a species as additional precursor ions.  For instance a setting
of 1 Da extracts a 1 Da range on the <i>m/z</i> scale and gets only the
most intense peaks.  For +1 and +2 ions, a 2 Da range is suitable.
  <li><b>Number of Components</b>:	the count of precursors that can be
selected for concurrent MS/MS data acquisition from a MS survey scan.
Should be set to 1 for parent ion discovery.
  <li><b>Retention Time Window</b>:  can only be used when an include list  is
used.  In the include list are a set of retention times.  The window
value is in seconds, so for a peak to be selected for fragmentation,
a window value of 30 seconds means that an include list retention time of
18 minutes requires the peak to be detected between 17min45seconds and
18min15seconds.
  </ul>
 <li><b>Switch Criteria:  TIC</b>
  <ul>
  <li>[ ]
  </ul>
 <li><b>Charge State</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Tolerance Window</b>
  </ul>
 </ul>
</ul>


<h2><a name="dda"></a>Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA)</h2>
<p>
This actually allows precursor ions whose identity (mass, etc.) is
not known to be scanned in MS/MS mode when they are of interest.
To be of interest, the precursor ions must fall within set
parameters, limits, or thresholds.  DDA can only be set from within
a MassLynx sample list (or set by ProteinLynx accordingly), and
cannot be started as a feature of the Tune Page.  The field
MS FILE in the Sample List controls the use of DDA.  MS FILE are
created by the method editor.
<p>
From within the MassLynx sample list, put the cursor on MS FILE
field, click the right mouse to get a popup menu, and open the
method editor.  From within the editor, select <b>Survey</b> scan.
<p>
There are several tabbed windows in the Survey Scan.
<h3>Q-ToF Survey</h3>
<p>
Within this tabbed window, all of the parameters are similar to the MS
Scan:  start and stop of acquisition, mass range, ionization type,
data format, scan and interscan time, cone voltage, period and cone voltage
of any reference scan.  The interscan delay reflects the time required
to move data from the embedded to the host PC.  Setting scan times
to less than 1 sec is possible, but the duty cycle declines at fast
acquisition rates because of the fixed interscan delay.
<h3>MS to MS/MS</h3>
<p>
Generally the switch is determined by either the TIC (total ion count)
or the individual intensity of an ion (<b>Intensity</b>).
Generally intensity is set for multiple precursors to be examined.
It helps if some MS data are observed to see the difference between
noise (background) and signal in order to set a threshold.
The threshold is the number of ion counts per second.
<p>
The <b>Detection Window</b> is used to prevent selection of isotopic
peaks of the precursor ions.  For +1 and +2 ions, it should be about 2 Da.
<p>
The <b>Number of Components</b> defines the number of precursor masses
selected for concurrent MS/MS analysis from a single MS survey scan.
Only the most <i>n</i> intense precursors can be selected for simultaneous
MS/MS analysis, when Number of Components is <i>n</i>.  The maximum is
8 precursors for simultaneous analysis.  The best setting for LC peaks
whose half-height peak widths are 10-20 seconds is 3 or 4.
<p>
When an include or exclude file has been selected, the <b>Retention
Time Window</b> is the value in seconds added to the retention time
in the include/exclude by which the precursor must elute if
fragmentation mode is selected.   As an example, if retention time
window is 30 s, and the include/exclude file indicates 18 min, a
peak must elute between 18:00 and 18:30.

<h4>Charge State</h4>
<p>
Used to set parameters for charge state recognition algorithm.
<p>
The <b>Tolerance Window</b> is used to measure between adjacent peaks
and should be set to the default 0.1 Da (i.e, a tight tolerance).
<p>
<b>Mass Extraction Window</b> is the mass range (in Da) around the peak
identified upon which charge state recognition is to be done.
Enter 2 Da for peptide work.
<p>
<b>Intensity of Main Peak</b> is a percent threshold to remove low intensity
peaks from being evaluated in the charge state determination.  A default
2% is recommended.

<h4>Precursor Selection</h4>
<p>
This is generally used to select precursors that are either known or
unkownn.  If nothing is known about precursors, select <b>Everything</b>.
If MS/MS analysis is to be done only on certain masses, prepare an include
list and select <b>Included Masses Only</b>.  When <b>Included Masses
and Everything Else</b> is selected, precursor MS/MS analysis occurs
on all the most intense ions <i>if</i> they are not within the time
or mass window of the included masses;  otherwise the included masses
are given a higher priority as the selected precursors, even if
they are not the most intense ions.

<h4>Detected Precursor Inclusion</h4>
<p>
The <b>Auto Exclude</b> excludes mass values and its associated detection
window defined in the exclude table from selection.
<p>
<b>Always Include</b> allows the immediate selection of a previously
selected mass value.
<p>
<b>Include After Time</b> excludes a previously selected mass value
and associated detection window as defined in the exclude table from
any selection for a specified time period.  This is useful when
there is a tailing from strong LC peaks and prevents multiple selection
of the same precursor, but allows fragmentation of the near isobaric
components eluting at other retention times.  The maximum value
is 200 seconds.
<h4>Data</h4>
<p>
If the <b>Discard Uninteresting Survey Scans</b> is checked, only
those survey scans triggering MS/MS analysis are stored.  This
can reduce the file size, and should be used carefully depending on the
nature of the experiment.

<h3>MS/MS to MS</h3>
<p>
The switch back to survey mode needs to be defined so that interesting
precursors are not missed.
<p>
If the <b>Default</b> method is chosen, the trigger will be one of three
possible options:
<ul>
<li><b>TIC falling below threshold</b>.
<li><b>TIC rising above threshold</b>.
<li><b>Intensity falling below threshold</b>.  When the count of ions
per second on the base peak of the MS/MS spectrum falls below the set
value, the switch is made.  For peptides on the Q-ToF, set to 2 or 3.
</ul>

<p>
If the <b>After Time</b> method is set, then the switch back occurs
within the maximum time set, unless the intensity has fallen below
the threshold earlier than the maximum time, in which case the switch
back occurs earlier.
<p>
Note that MS/MS mode analysis affects ONLY the precursor being scanned.
If multiple precursors are being scanned simultaneously, only precursors
falling below threshold or reaching maximum time are removed from MS/MS
mode analysis, while other precursors continue to be MS/MS mode analyzed
until their switch-back parameters are set.
<p>
In setting the After Time parameter it is best to set it to an integral
number of cycles of MS/MS scanning.  If the MS/MS scan time is 1 sec,
the interscan delay is 0.1 s, and CE profiling is enabled, then to
obtain 3 scans at three different energies requires an After Time
parameter setting of 9.9 seconds.

<h1><a name="QToFSoftware">Software Interface</a></h1>
<p>
The embedded PC runs on a VxWorks operating system specifically designed
to run hardware like that found on the QToF micro.  The host PC runs
on Windows XP and communicates with the EPC through TCP/IP.
<p>
To summon the EPC, call a cmd shell and ping the epc, and telnet to it:
<ul>
<li>ping ept -t
<li>telnet epc
</ul>
<p>
Once a telnet connection is made, the following commands on the EPC work
through the VxWorks system:
<table>
<tr><th>command    <th>description
<tr><td>i          <td>a list of information about tasks on EPC
<tr><td>checkStack <td>local memory being used by tasks on EPC
<tr><td>memShow    <td>total memory being used by EPC
<tr><td>lkup "****"<td>used to find commands on the EPC
</table>
<p>
Other advanced troubleshooting of communication faults include
<b>telnet logging, tdc9806EnableDiagnostics, SetTimeCentroid,</b>
and <b>DMPrints</b>.

<h1><a name="QToFHazards">Potential Hazards</a></h1>
<p>
Besides the chemical hazards which involve working with the sample (wear
gloves), there are <b>temperature</b> and <b>electrical hazards</b>.
<p>
The temperature hazards include:
<ul>
<li><b>desolvation</b> component, which can be as hot as 400&deg;
<li><b>source</b>, which can get as hot as 150&deg;
<li><b>APcI</b>, which can reach 650&deg;
</ul>
<p>
Voltages are also high:
<ul>
<li><b>capillary</b> voltage is as high as 3000 V
<li><b>cone</b> voltage can be as high as 60 V
</ul>
<p>
Safety interlocks usually shut down the voltage on the probe and cone
voltage, and also the desolvation and APcI temperature, but not the source
temperature.


<h2>Engineer's Notes</h2>
<p>
QToF micro uses seven high voltage DC supplies.  The Electronics unit has
<ul>
<li><b>Brandenburg DN1046</b>: HV DC Supply<br>
  430/780 V for the Analog Lenses and Quadrupole DC
<li><b>Brandenburg DN1051/CE135</b>:  5kV Probe Supply
 <ul>
 <li>Capillary Voltage
 <li>Corona pin current (APcI mode)
 </ul>
<li><b>2x Brandenburg 540-301-01</b>:  8kV Supplies
 <ul>
 <li>ToF Voltage
 <li>Reflectron Voltage
 </ul>
<li><b>Spellman MI3P1/I15</b><br>
  +3kV for TOF MCP detector
<li><b>Spellman MI1PN15</b><br>
  1kV for pusher pulse
<li><b>Spellman MI1PN15</b><br>
  1kV for puller pulse
</ul>
<p>
Note that the Spellman parts are found on top of the flight tube.

<h1><a name="QToFVacuum">Vacuum System</a></h1>
<p>
A vacuum is present to maximize the mean free path and minimize collisions
with the ion.  Insufficient vacuum can result in arcing at kilovolt
potentials used in the instrument.
<p>
The vacuum functions on a gradient.
<ul>
<li>Cone:  at the sample cone is an interface between atmosphere and
0.1 mbar
<li>Extraction: between the extraction cone and hexapole, the vacuum is
between 0.001 and 0.1 mbar
<li>Hexapole Aperature:  between the hexapole and analyzer, the vacuum
drops from 0.001 and 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> mbar
</ul>
<p>
Quadrupoles can change and stabilize fields in &lt; 1 millisecond.
When the vacuum is at operating pressure, mean free path is long, and
the time between collisions is on the order of 10 milliseconds.

<h2>Pumps</h2>
<p>
The vacuum system depends on two types of pumps.  The external rotary
pump provides the vacuum for the extraction cone block and is the
backing for the turbomolecular pumps.
<p>
The turbomolecular pumps  must be rotating at &gt; 80% for their operating
efficiency.  The require cooling from a circulating water supply that should
be set at 15-20&deg;.  The pumps have 3 red LEDs and 1 green LED that should
all be illuminated when the pumps are at full speed.

<h3>Rotary Pump</h3>
<p>
The QToF <i>micro</i> at Ankara University Biotech is equipped with
a BOC Edwards E2M28 rotary vacuum pump, which is a two-stage, direct drive,
sliding vane pump.  It is driven by a single phase or three-phase (four
pole) electric motor.  The motor itself is completely enclosed and
cooled by a cooling fan directing air along heat dissipation fins.
<p>
Oil within the drive portion of the pump lubricates pump shaft bearing
surfaces and rotor sealing faces.  A distribution valve prevents suckback
in the event the pump stops.
<h4>Maintenance</h4>
<p>
The oil and mist filter need to be changed regularly.  The manufacturer
recommends the pump oil be replaced for every 3000 hours of operation
(if running continuously 24 hours, 7 days a week, that is approximately
18 weeks or 4.5 months).  The maximum oil capacity is 1.32 liters.
BOC Edwards recommends that you use the Ultragrade 19 oil of most
operations (those within the ambient temperature working range of pump).
<p>
When replacing the oil, follow this procedure:
<ol>
<li>It is better to drain warm oil as it is less viscous.
If the pump has not been operating,
turn it on for 10 minutes then switch off the pump.
<li>Disconnect the pump from the electrical system and the vacuum system.
<li>Remove the oil filler plug.
<li>A block should be placed under the pump to tilt it so that the drain
plug sits lowest.  This will permit pump oil to drain fully by gravity.
<li>Open the drain plug and let the oil flow from the pump.
<li>Replace the drain plug and fill the pump with oil through the filler
port so that the oil level in the sight glass is between MIN and MAX mark.
If there is an overfill, open the drain plug and catch the oil in a clean
container.  Close the drain plug and then re-pour the oil so that it is
again between MIN and MAX.
<li>If the replaced oil appears dirty (very cloudy) or contaminated, it
is highly recommended that the fresh oil be used to clean the pump.
Turn on the pump for 5-10 minutes, then drain the oil.  If the oil appears
dirty or contaminated still, repeat the process until satisfied that the
pump is washed clean.
</ol>
<p>
Besides the oil change, the general schedule for pump maintenance is:
<ul>
<li>Monthly check the oil level in the sight glass to make sure it is
between MIN and MAX marks.  Fill if necessary.
<li>With every oil change, inspect and clean the <b>inlet filter</b>.<br>
The inlet filter is next to the oil filling port on the top of the motor.
It consists of four parts (from top to bottom):
a threaded inlet adaptor to which the mist filter connects, an O ring,
a circlip, and a somewhat conical inlet filter.  Unscrew inlet adaptor
and then remove it and the other three parts.  Wash the filter in a cleaning
solution and then let it dry.  Refit the assembly as it was when it was
removed.
<li>With every oil change, clean or replace the <b>gas-ballast filter</b>.
<br>The gas ballast filter is next to the oil filler plug.  It is possible
that the filter was removed to connect it to a gas supply or valve to the gas
ballast inlet.  It consists of several parts in the order specified
from outermost to innermost:  a retaining circlip, circular wire mesh,
filter element, and then circular wire mesh.  After removing the retaining
circlip, the filter element and wire mesh come loose.  Wash them in a suitable
cleaning solution and let dry.
<li>Yearly clean the motor fan cover and enclosure
<li>For every 15,000 hours of operation, clean and overhaul the pump
<li>For every 15,000 hours of operation, test the motor condition
<li>For every 30,000 hours of operation, fit the pump with new blades
</ul>

<h2>Gauges</h2>
<p>
<b>Pirani "Spare" gauge</b>.  This monitors the quadrupole analyzer vacuum.
It should be better than 5 &times; 10<sup>&minus;6</sup> for a VAC_OK signal
to allow the system to be operational.

<p>
On the back of the Q-ToF are two power switches.  One turns on the
system power (turn this on first); the other is labeled <b>Electronics</b>
and is actually a circuit breaker that trips if the current draws more than
is rated.
<p>
The system is protected by a 13 A (UK only) fuse to the 230 V mains outlet.

<h2>Event Out</h2>
<p>
<b>Out1</b> to <b>Out4</b> allow peripherals to be connected to the instrument,
and switches <b>S1</b> to <b>S4</b> allow the output to be either a
<i>contact closure</i> when in upper position or <i>voltage output</i>
when set in lower position.  <b>Out1</b> and <b>Out2</b> will provide
5 V output and <b>Out3</b> and <b>Out4</b> provide 24 V.

<h2>Contact Closure In</h2>

<p>
Circuit breakers are present for instrument protection.  These work for

<h1><a name="QToFvoltages">Voltages</a></h1>
<p>
The many components of the QToF micro have voltages relative to one another
to train the ion beam.  All the voltages below are set in <b>positive
ion mode</b>:
<ul>
<li><i>V</i><sub>probe</sub> is from 0 to 5000 V.
<li><i>V</i><sub>cone</sub> is from 0 &rarr; 200 V with respect to
   <i>V</i><sub>extraction</sub>
<li><i>V</i><sub>extraction</sub> is from 0 &rarr; 100 V with respect to

<li><i>V</i><sub>ring 1</sub> is set at &minus;2210 V

</ul>


<p>
Changes in the ToF entry region voltages occur to deliver ions to the
ToF tube.  Between pushes, voltages on the pusher and grid 2 are set to
0 V + the offsets.  During pushes, voltage on the pusher is 810 V + the
pusher offset, and grid 2 is &minus;620 V + grid 2 offset.
<p>
Ion transmission to the MCP is affected by the efficiency of the
ion beam elements to bring them to the detector.
<ol>
<li>Pushed ions:  clearly not all ions sampled through the extraction
cone are pushed to the ToF.  Only about 22% are pushed orthogonally.
<li>Transmission through grids:  the accelerating grids and rings at the
start of the ToF tube transmit only 12% of the pushed ions
<li>MCP detection:  the plates only detect about 65% of ions that hit them
when dead time is not a factor

<h2>Sample Cone and Cone Gas Nozzle Removal and Cleaning</h2>
<ol>
<li>Put the Q-ToF in STANDBY.
<li>Set the Source Temperature to 20&deg; and permit it to cool.
<li>Turn off the API gas.
<li>Remove the probe assembly, adjuster flange and glass cover.
<li>Set the isolation valve (vacuum lock) to closed.  This means turning
it fully counter-clockwise, so that the slot on the brass head has the line
pointing at the Q-ToF.  (It is open when the line of the slot on the brass
head is passing through the sample cone.)
<li>Screw in the special extraction tool into the hole in the sample cone
assembly (this is at about the 10 or 11 o'clock position from the cone
as you face the sample cone directly).  This will hold the assembly when
you unscrew the sample cone assembly.
<li>Remove the two screws holding the sample cone (these are at the
6 and 12 o'clock positions of the cone as you face it.  <em>Be extremely
careful in handling the inner cone of the sample cone assembly:  its
aperture is easily damaged</em>.
<li><b>Cleaning the Cone</b>.  Place the cone in an ultrasonic bath
containing either acetonitrile:water:formic acid (45:45:10)
or methanol:water:formic acid (45:45:10).  In rare cases it may be
necessary to use a stronger regimen for cleaning (such as nitric acid
or other solvents).
<strong>Do not use hydrochloric or sulfuric acids!</strong>.
<li>Rinse the cone in the ultrasonic bath with either a 50:50
acetonitrile:water or methanol:water.
<li>Place the cone, the PTFE (Teflon) insulator, and the cone gas nozzle
using the tool, and put in the retaining screws.
<li>Turn the isolation valve to release the vacuum lock.
<li>Put on the source and its cover, and adjust probe position.  Do not
forget the source and desolvation temperatures, turning on the API gas,
and returning to OPERATE mode.

<h1>Sample Lists in MassLynx</h1>
<p>
MassLynx prepares sample lists with a similar interface (appearance),
but since different mass spectrometers in the Waters/Micromass product
line have different features, MassLynx has instrument-dependent features.

<h2>Q-ToF</h2>
<p>
The Q-ToF <i>micro</i> can operate in a MS and MS/MS mode.  Generally
the human operator himself, if acquiring data in a non-automatic mode,
might switch from one mode to another if insufficient information
was produced in one mode and more information
can be obtained with another.

<h3>Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA)</h3>
<p>
The Waters/Micromass <b>Data-Directed Analysis</b> or <b>Data-Dependent
Acquisition</b>, or DDA as it calls the feature, automates this decision-making
in MassLynx.  The user sets up a dependency in which the Q-ToF analysis
is mode is altered if the data in another mode does not fall within
a certain set of conditions.
<ol>
<li>From the sample list sheet in the main MassLynx window, select the
cell under the <b>MS File</b> column, right-click to get a pop-up menu
and select <b>Open</b>.  The Method Editor is accessed for the MS method
file.
<li>To create a blank method file, select <b>File&rarr;New</b>.
Otherwise, the currently defined parameters can be edited.
<li>Click the <b>Survey</b> button for creating a data-dependent
acquistion (DDA).
<li>This brings up a multi-tabbed dialog window with the Survey tab
selected.  From this, the mass range, ionization mode, type of data
processing, data collection time, scan period and interscan delay,
and the cone voltage can be selected.  If the NanoLock Spray is being
used, parameters special to the reference spray (count of scans to average,
period of baffle sampling, and the cone voltage) can be set.
</ol>
<p>
The other tabs include specifying conditions in which to make
MS&rarr;MS/MS and MS/MS&rarr;MS switching.

<h4>MS&rarr;MS/MS Switching</h4>
<p>
Conditions under which the switch to MS/MS mode would occur.
<h5>MS&rarr;MS/MS Switching Criteria</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>Total Ion Count</b> or <b>Intensity</b>.  Select either a
TIC or intensity.  Intensity is usually selected as multiple precursors
are selected from a concurrent MS/MS experiment.  MS data are sampled
to determine the level of background and peak intensities
<li><b>Threshold</b>.  Enter a value for the threshold after first
tuning a beam and determining the background level and peak intensities
of the sample peaks.  Any peaks rising above the threshold within the
selected mass range will be identified as candidate precursor ions.
<li><b>Detection Window</b>.  This sets the window to eliminate the
isotopic variation in a molecular species.  Normally there are many peaks
surrounding the main peak that represent the isotopic forms of the same
species.  The window prevents evaluation isotopic variation of a species
as a unique species.  For +1 and +2 ions, a suitable window is 2 Da.
The window should be reduced for multiply charged ions.
<li><b>Number of components</b>.  The maximum number of precursor masses
that can be selected for concurrent MS/MS data from one MS scan.
If <i>n</i> is the value, then the <i>n</i> most intense peaks will be
selected for MS/MS analysis.  The maximum is 8, but LC peaks whose with
is 10-20 sec wide (at half height) should have a setting of 3-4.
<li><b>Retention Time Window</b>.  This sets a window for ion count
peaks defined in a file of peaks to be included or excluded in the evaluation.
The window is set only when such a file exists and peaks are defined,
and the window is the maximum time beyond the time for which any included
or excluded peak is defined in the file.  Thus for  window of 30 seconds,
a peak defined to elute at 18 minutes must elute within 18:30 minutes to
be identified as the included or excluded peak.
</ul>

<h5>Charge State</h5>
<p>
Parameters for charge state recognition algorithm are set.
<ul>
<li><b>Tolerance Window</b>. A window for discriminating the peaks that
are adjacent to each other (isotopic variants).  Typically set to the default
0.1 Da (should be set for tight tolerance).
<li><b>Mass Extraction Windows</b>.  The mass range around the peak
identified and selected upon which the charge state algorithm will be applied.
The default of 2 Da is recommended for peptides.
<li><b>Percent Intensity of Main Peak</b>.  The minimum threshold for peaks
evaluated by the algorithm.  This eliminates evaluation of low intensity
noise.  A 2% default is recommended.
</ul>

<h5>Precursor Selection</h5>
<p>
Choose between one of three modes:
<ul>
<li><b>Everything</b>.  Selected to indicate that user predefined masses
are not used/defined, or are to be ignored.  Peak selection is automatic
according to criteria in the Automatic Function Switching parameters.
<li><b>Included Masses Only</b>.  Only masses listed in an included list
or file will be selected for MS/MS evaluation, and only if the intensities
meet threshold.
<li><b>Included Masses and Everything Else</b>.  Both masses listed in
an included list or file and masses not defined but also meeting threshold
will be evaluated in MS/MS mode.  Even if the masses included are not the
most intense, evaluation is certain.
</ul>

<h5>Detected Precursor Inclusion</h5>
<p>
Choose between one of three modes:
<ul>
<li><b>Auto Exclude</b>.  Excludes a <i>m/z</i> value and its associated
detection window (defined in exclude list) from any subsequent selection.
<li><b>Always Include</b>.  Immediate selection of previously selected
<i>m/z</i> value.
<li><b>Include After Time</b>.  This excludes a previously selected
<i>m/z</i> value and its associated detection window (defined in exclude
list) from subsequent selection for the period specified.  Prevents
multiple selection of same precursor when tailing occurs in strong
LC peaks.  The fragmentation of other components eluting at other
retention times is allowed.  Maximum permitted value is 200 seconds.
</ul>

<h5>Data</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>Discard Uninteresting Survey Scans</b>.  Only data from scans
that triggered a switch to MS/MS mode will be saved.  Helps to keep
data file sizes small and free of unnecessary information.
</ul>

<h4>MS/MS&rarr;MS Switching</h4>
<p>
If MS/MS&rarr;MS is the default method, one of three criteria are selected
to enable the switch.  They all have to do with either TIC or
Intensity crossing a set threshold.  These are
<b>TIC Falling Below Threshold</b>, <b>TIC Rising Above Threshold</b>,
and <b>Intensity Falling Below Threshold</b>.  In all cases, threshold
value is set in <b>counts per second</b>.  In the case of the Intensity
threshold, the measurement is on the base peak in the MS/MS spectrum.
<p>
In addition a method of switching is either a default (immediate switch)
or <b>After time</b> in seconds.

<h4>MS/MS Data Acquisition Template</h4>
<p>
In this tabbed section the parameters for data acquisition are set.
<p>
An Instrument Parameter (.ipr) file must be selected to set tuning conditions.
<p>
In addition a mass range (start to end <i>m/z</i>) is set.  This is
distinct from the Survey Scan start-to-end <i>m/z</i> setting.  The Survey
Scan only identifies the range of masses that trigger the Survey Scan
functions and mode switching, whereas the template here defines the mass
range data to be acquired.  Note also the scan period (in seconds) and
inter-scan delay are definable here.  Moreover the ionization mode and
processing of data (continuum or centroiding) is set here.
<p>
<b>Collision Energy</b> for MS/MS mode can also be set (in V).

<h4>Included Masses</h4>
<p>
These are a list of predefined <i>m/z</i> values which, if present in
the MS mode, will cause a switch to MS/MS mode for analysis, assuming these
were set in the switch criteria.  Values can be entered in a comma-separated
fashion in the <b>Range</b> text entry field, or a <b>File</b> selected
which lists the masses and their specific parameters (including retention
time, collision energy, cone voltage, charge state).  Files are created,
saved, and modified using the buttons for the interface.
<p>
In addition, a <b>Charge State</b> allows inclusion of ions in MS/MS switching
based on their calculated charge state.  Useful when singly charged
ions make up uninterpretable background and should be precluded.
Specified charge states should be comma-separated.  Values above 4 are ignored.
<p>
The number of components to include are the maximum number of <i>m/z</i>
values above detection threshold.  The range is 1-100, and values between
60-80 would be reasonable.  Higher values slow down data processing and
divide acquisition time too much between components.

<h4>Collision Energy</h4>
<p>
This tab controls the selection of collision energy.  Several choices
are possible for MS/MS mode.  The default can be specified.


<h1>Database Parameters for ProteinLynx Searches</h1>
<p>
This is not going to be a complete detailed manual for using the
Waters ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS).  Read the <b>ProteinLynx&trade;
Global <i>Server</i> Version 2.0 Software User's Guide</b> for the complete
understanding of this user interface.
<p>
PLGS runs in Windows in a complex fashion.  It is written in Java and
runs also in Linux/Unix (in Windows, it is installed in <b>C:\PLGS2</b>
and non-Windows systems in <b>/usr/local/PLGS2</b>).  At installation,
preferences are set for the search engine hostnames (127.0.0.1 is the
local host for databases on the same host as the server), the MS instruments
that generate the data (the default one for the client is the machine
it is connected to), and for bookmarks of useful sites.  See
<b>Options&rarr;Preferences</b> from the ProteinLynx browser main window.
