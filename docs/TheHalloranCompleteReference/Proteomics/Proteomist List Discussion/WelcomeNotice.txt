===========================================================================

Welcome to the Proteomics discussion list!

Please store this message in a useful place, since it might come in handy
at a later time should you wish to refer to it.  Because this welcome 
notice might be rather long in content, and you probably do not have time
to read long messages, I have a mini-list of contents here:

1. PURPOSE OF THIS LIST / YOUR FIRST POST / RELEVANT TOPICS
     Why this list?  What does the list talk about?
2. TERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION
    Are there any qualifications to join?  (quick answer, no)
3. CONTROLLING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AND SETTINGS / UNINTENDED SUBSCRIPTIONS
    How to subscribe, unsubscribe, set up for either post-by-post or digests
4. POLICY ON PRODUCT NAMING / ADVERTISEMENTS / SPAM
    Distinctions about product naming, product promotion

I recommend that you try to read the whole thing when you have time.

===================================
1. PURPOSE OF THIS LIST / YOUR FIRST POST / RELEVANT TOPICS
This is a list called 'proteomics,' so as you can imagine, anything
related to proteomics is on topic here.

* Proteomics: expression, functional, interaction, sequence, structure
* Methods/Methodology in proteomics:  mass spectrometry, chromatography,
  high throughput sample handling/processing
* Equipment (hardware) and software used in proteomics:  databases,
   query interfaces to databases
* Biology:  results/things learned in or through proteomics

The list aspires to make this a discussion of the HOWs and WHYs of proteomics.

You can make your first post by introducing yourself, telling the list what
role you play or would like to play in proteomics, what your research 
focus is if you are involved in research.  You don't have to have any
questions.

===================================
2. TERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION
There are no real strenuous terms and conditions which you must meet here.

You just need an interest in proteomics.  

No advanced degrees or certificates in or out of proteomics.

No memberships in the National Academy of Sciences...although if the
list does have the honor of having a member among us, the list administrator
would love to be advised.

We don't require extreme politeness around here, but we do recommend that
you be polite, thoughtful and considerate of others.   The general
rule when writing posts (emails) is not to do so while angry or otherwise
enraged.  If someone says something wrong, it's better just to point
out what you believe to be the truth (and it helps to cite something)
and set aside the desire to characterize someone as intellectually a 
no-show.

Please read Section 4 on Product Naming, since that is probably the
one set of terms we will adhere to.

===================================
3. CONTROLLING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AND SETTINGS / UNINTENDED SUBSCRIPTIONS

In the unlikely event that you did intend to subscribe to this list or 
someone has done it for you, maliciously or otherwise, see the section 
below on UNSUBSCRIBING FROM THE LIST.  Since you have to confirm your
subscription, it is unlikely you would be reading this notice.

SENDING POSTS TO THE LIST.  You need know only one email address
sending posts to the lists, and that is:

    proteomics@freelists.org

These are the posts you want the subscribed members of the list to
read.

You do NOT send administrative matters like subscribing and
subscribing and changing message options to this address. 
You deal with these in the next section.

ADMINSTRATIVE ISSUES/CHANGING SETTINGS ON SUBSCRIPTIONS.  There is
more than one way to adjust your account settings for the list.

Perhaps the best and easiest way to control your subscription 
is to go the FreeLists home page and use the web forms.

   http://www.freelists.org/list/proteomics

The other ways is to send commands by email to the list server in 
a message to this address:

   proteomics-request@freelists.org

Notice carefully the addition of the "-request" suffix to "proteomics",
which distinguishes it as an administrative feature.

Commands are placed either in the Subject header or the message body
starting on a line by themselves.  Note that address is read by a
machine and not by a human, so commands are processed in an automated
fashion.

When you want to UNsubscribe from the list, you can send an email 
to mailto:proteomics-request@freelists.org and put "unsubscribe" in
the Subject header.

For a full list of by-mail commands, put "Help" in the Subject header
and send to 'proteomics-request@freelists.org'.

As a list subscriber, there are many setting that you can adjust
or "configure."  One of the more important ones is whether you get the
list distributions as they are posted (post-by-post method) or whether you
get them all in a bundle (digest method).

(i) post-by-post:  that is, when someone sends a post to be distributed
to the list, the server distributes to every subscribed member of the
list who has designated that they want to receive the posts as they happen

(ii) digests: the list server collects a number of posts and puts them
in a temporary holding box, and then after a certain limit based on
either time or on the size of the posts collected in the box, all the
posts are sent in one mail message to each subscribed member who set
their option to receive by digest

The advantage of digests is that you only get one mail message from the
list occasionally, although it is a huge one.  The advantage of post-by-post
is that you get to read and respond on a timely basis.  The current
limits set for the digest method of distribution is 75,000 bytes on
size and 7 days on time, and so a digest is sent whichever limit is
reached first.   If you don't like to see a lot of individual messages
you might prefer the digest method.

===================================
4. POLICY ON PRODUCT NAMING / ADVERTISEMENTS / SPAM
A primary reason this list was started because of the difficulty of
working with some hardware and software to analyze MS data and in doing
database searches.  There are too many companies out there trying to
sell things out there with all the market hype and nothing on the 
delivery side.  

If you have bad and good things to say about products you use, then 
name them and complain about what you are finding/seeing/using.
Some of the people I want to see subscribe to this list are the
developers and engineers and sales and (tech) support teams of 
companies

SPAM.  Suppose one scientist recommends to another a product they have
had success with.  That's saying something good about something,
almost as good as an advertisement.  But since the scientist does not
work for the manufacturer or company making the product, it's not
really an ad, is it? 

For the time being, the policy of this list will be to accept 
distribution of product advertisements by their sales/support 
people, but the following rules MUST BE adhered to:

(i) EMPLOYMENT STATUS.  You must work for (be an employee of) 
the company making the product you intend to promote.  You are
INCLUDED even if you are contractor who would benefit from the sales
of a product of another manufacturer.  You are EXCLUDED if you are
a scientist at a academic/research/government institution engaged
and who is not a stockholder/officer of the company making the product
and whose research is NOT being directly funded by the company as
part of a product development contract.

(ii) SET SUBJECT HEADER WITH TEXT "PRODUCT AD" OR THE LIKE.  If you
are promoting or selling a product, you must write in the 
Subject: header "PRODUCT AD" or "ADVERTISEMENT" in capital letters
as has been shown here.  This allows the list readers to understand
what it is and to discard it.  You must do this even if you have
other things to say in the message (that is, the message is not
just about product promotion).  If you have something to say besides
this, it is better 

(iii) DEFENDING YOUR (OUTRAGEOUS) CLAIMS.  If you distribute a product
promotion or sales schtick, you must be prepared to defend your
claims when others respond to your post.  There will be no
posting-and-running.  In fact, if I were a sales person, I'd probably
want to defend any slander or criticism of it.  We encourage posters
here to rip apart the products and get past the hype and palaver,
so be prepared to get as good as you give, and vice-versa.

=========================================================================

Again, welcome to the Proteomic discussion list and I hope you find
this rewarding.
