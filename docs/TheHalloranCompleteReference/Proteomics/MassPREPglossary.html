<dt id="airgaps">Air Gaps
 <dd>Air gaps can be created within a pipetting tip and tube to transport
multiple samples or components of a mix.  Three kinds of air gaps are
possible: <a href="#sysgap">system air gap</a>, <a href="#sepgap">separation
air gap</a>, and <a href="#transgap">transport air gap</a>.

<dt id="aspirate">Aspirate
 <dd>A <a href="#step">step</a> that instructs the pipetting system to
take liquid from a source.  It is generally part of a
<a href="#xfergroup">transfer group</a>.  It must be mapped to labware
in the deck view.  Several different types of aspiration steps are
also defined:  <a href="#aspair">Aspirate Air</a>,
<a href="#aspdiluent">Aspirate Diluent</a>, and
<a href="#aspxcess">Aspirate Excess Sample</a>.

<dt id="aspdiluent">Aspirate Diluent
 <dd>A <a href="#step">step</a> included when any dilution procedure is
defined.

<dt id="aspxcess">Aspirate Excess Sample
 <dd>A <a href="#step">step</a> included whenever a <a href="#diln-serial">Serial
Dilution</a> procedure is defined (or enabled in a
<a href="#xfergroup">transfer group</a> when a custom procedure is used).
Excess liquid is aspirated from the last sample of a serial dilution set,
which generally has the full volume in it as a result of it being the last
dilution.  This step removes the excess to equalize its volume with the
intermediate dilution series.

<dt id="blowout">Blowout
 <dd>A pipetting mode in which a volume of air is aspirated before the
the sample liquid is taken.  It is later dispensed along with the sample
liquid.  This is a parameter usually defined in the Performance file.
Associated with this mode is:
<ul>
<li><b>blowout air volume</b>:  the amount of air to be aspirated as blowout
<li><b>blowout delay time</b>:  the time period between the dispensing of
the sample liquid and the blowout from the tip;  a delay time might be
necessary for the pipetting of more viscous liquids
<li><b>blowout liquid</b>:  blowouts must be controlled and indicated for
custom procedures, whereas they are formally regulated within the transfer
groups of defined procedures
</ul>
Compare to <a href="#waste">Waste mode</a>.

<dt id="custom">Custom
 <dd>A procedure type that allows the method user flexibility to add
steps in any order to build a procedure conforming to the needs of
particular application.

<dt id="diln-custom">Custom Dilution
 <dd>A procedure type that allows the method user to define the dilution
pattern, usually a mix of <a href="#diln-serial">serial</a> and
<a href="#diln-direct">direct</a> dilutions with a set.

<dt id="diln-direct">Direct Dilution
 <dd>A procedure type performing a dilution scheme where the system
assumes one original source for the dilution procedure.

<dt id="dispense">Dispense
 <dd>A procedure type performing a dilution scheme where the system
assumes one original source for the dilution procedure.

<dt id="droptip">Drop Tip
 <dd>This step is automatically created for a defined procedure involving
pipetting if a disposable tip type is set/selected in the Pipetting
fieldset of the Overview tab.  Each pipet detaches its tip at a mapped
deck location.  Sensors indicate whether a tip was dropped.

<dt id="embedded">Embedded Procedure
 <dd>A procedure type that is a child to a parent or owner procedure.

<dt id="findliq">Find Liquid
 <dd>A <a href="#step">step</a> which allows the up-and-down search movement
of the probes using the liquid sensing circuitry to find a liquid level
at a mapped tip position.  Although it can be used to test the liquid
sensing system, it is useful in <a href="#userfunc">User Functions</a>.
Height and volume value determinations can be used to make decisions for
the next set of operations.

<dt id="fixedtip">Fixed Tip
 <dd>A parameter selection indicating the use of either the standard fixed tip 
adapter or the disposable tip adapter <strong>without</strong> disposable tips. 
Fixed tips are essentially the tips that are integral to the pipetting probes. 
Liquid Level Sensing is supported and activatable for either adapter type. 
Flush and wash steps are usually required to prevent sample carryover.

<dt id="flush-wash">Flush-Wash
 <dd>A set procedure that causes the flushing and washing of the pipetting
tips (probes).  <b>Flushing</b> is pumping the system liquid through the
tips directly out to the waste.  Sample or reagent within the tips is thus
removed.  <b>Washing</b> is the placement of the pipetting tips within a
<a href="#washbowl">washbowl</a> so that the pumping of the system liquid
creates a splash or fountain effect that washes sample or reagent on the
outside of the tip.  All liquids drain to a waste container.

<dt id="flush">Flush
 <dd>This <a href="#step">step</a> causes system liquid to be dispensed through
the pipetting tips for the purpose of cleaning the inside of the tips
free from reagent or sample.  A large volume is passed to ensure a
constant flow required for cleaning.  The tip should have been placed
over a deck location where waste is collected.  The Flush step is one
part of the <a href="#flush-wash">Flush-Wash</a> <a
href="#procedure">procedure</a>, which is a defined procedure that can
be used to ensure thorough cleaning of both the inside and outside
of the probe tips.

<dt id="function">Function
 <dd>the coding in MSL that

<dt id="gettip">Get Tip
 <dd>This step is automatically created for a defined procedure involving
pipetting if a disposable tip type is set/selected in the Pipetting
fieldset of the Overview tab.  Each pipet attaches to a tip at a mapped
deck location.  Sensors indicate whether a tip was attached.

<dt id="getdata">Gets Data From
 <dd>A column in a table parameter that specifies the source for a parameter
value defined in the associated parameters of a procedure.  The table
value is linked to the parameter set in the specific procedure:  any change
or edit made in the global table or the specific procedure setting affects
either the global table or specific procedure setting.  Possible values
include:  <a href="#local">Local</a>, <a href="#varusewellmap">Var: Use
Well Map</a>, <a href="#varaskuser">Var: Ask User</a>,
<a href="#varselect">Var: Select</a>, <a href="#varcalc">Var: Calculate</a>,

<a href="#samplistflag">SmpList: Flag,</a>
<a href="#samplistrecs">SmpList: Records</a>,
<a href="#perffile">Performance File</a>, <a href="#machfile">Machine File</a>.
<p>
Data can also can be obtained from a well map (<b>Gets Data From Well Map</b>).
This can be from source that is <b>Local, File: Column, SmpList: Column,</b>
or <b>SmpList: ScanMap</b>.

<dt id="inituserquery">Initial User Query
 <dd>A procedure type that permits the creation of multiple query
pages that are displayed at the start of a method.  By default it includes
all parameters (variables) that must be defined or which were deferred
to runtime;  therefore it is best to modify this procedure after all
procedures and steps are set up.

<dt id="labware">Labware
 <dd>any piece of equipment or part that can be defined as having a
 position on the MassPREP deck

<dt id="local">Local
 <dd>A designation indicating that the value for the parameter is defined
elsewhere in the test outline within a specific procedure which also defines
that parameter value.  The value of the parameter is <em>not</em> deferred
until runtime.

<dt id="location">Location Button
 <dd>The means by which a step (Aspirate, Dispense, Flush, Get Tip, Drop
Tip, Park Arm, Mix, Move To Target, etc.) is associated with a position
on the deck (mapped) on which labware is located.  This is usually
a coordinate location on the deck.

<dt id="machfile">Machine File
 <dd>A file containing values for specific parameters that are machine
dependent with respect to pipetting.  Usually default pump and motor speeds,
home positions, motor current, travel limits, etc. are specified.  Precision
parameters for Flush and Wash operations are also found here.

<dt id="mapping">Mapping
 <dd>The linking of labware with a particular step or procedure in the
test outline;  steps required to be mapped to labware (usu. liquid handling)
but which are <em>not</em> mapped are marked in <b>bold</b>.

<dt id="matchsteps">Match To Step(s)
 <dd>This parameter set specifies that the mapping of the step (or steps
in the procedure) is to be <em>matched</em> (or set identically) to the
mapping of another step or procedure elsewhere in the test outline.
When selected, the <b>Step Selection for Sharing Maps</b> option is
activated and the test outline is displayed in a 3-column grid.
The pointer &quot;<tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt>&quot; in the <b>Select</b> column
indicates the current step being defined within the test outline.
A checkbox is available for steps in which a map is defined for that step
and which the current step can use.  The <b>Order</b> column indicates
the numerical order of the steps whose maps are used (checked in the checkbox).

<dt id="mix">Mix
 <dd>A <a href="#step">step</a> that mixes the contents of a well by
aspirating and dispensing a given volume of liquid at that well position.
One cycle involves one aspirate and one dispense step.  A Mix step can
only be added to a <a href="#custom">Custom</a> procedure.
assumes one original source for the dilution procedure.  Many defined
procedures contain the possibility of adding <a href="#preaspmix">Pre-Aspirate
Mix</a> and <a href="#postdispmix">Post-Dispense Mix</a> steps.

<dt id="movetarg">Move To Target
 <dd>A <a href="#step">step</a> that allows the probe arm to move in a
direction that does <em>not</em> depend on the straight line approach.
The movement of the probe arm to the next target is specified for the
purpose of safe travel to the target:  there may be an obstacle in the
way that would impede the probe arm (the tips would hit the obstacle).

for test kit preparation requiring sample material plus one or more reagent
liquids to do the test.

<dt id="msl">MultiPROBE&reg; System Language
 <dd>MSL is a customized language developed for advanced programming of
MultiPROBE&reg; II functionality.  It is interpreted C language, with
a library of customized functions defined for the MultiPROBE&reg; II
liquid handling environment.  Extended functions can be written as well.
Several files are associated with MSL:

<dt id="node">Node
 <dd>Each <a href="#step">step</a> or <a href="#procedure">procedure</a>
  in a test method is an object (or &quot;objectified&quot;);  this
  object refers to a <i>node</i> because the method design shows multiple
  branching in a tree, representing a hierarchical relationship.

<dt id="panel">Panel
 <dd>This procedure type aspirates one source liquid and dispenses that
liquid to two or more destinations generally not wells that are contiguous
in a rack.  This type is useful for pipetting multiple assays to separate
plates from the same set of source tubes or plates.  It is also useful for
plate-to-plate transfers to create replicate plates.

<dt id="parkarm">Park Arm
 <dd>A procedure that puts the probe arm in a position so that it is out
of the way when deck or labware maintenance is done.  Ideally it should
be at a position above a container that catches liquid waste so that
any dripping of liquid is not on the deck or other labware during
pump, tip, or tubing maintenance.

<dt id="perffile">Performance File

timing of additions of separate reagents or samples in test methods where
the timing is important.

<dt id="timer">Timer
 <dd>A procedure type that permits the performance of time-related tasks:
<ul>
<li>pauses the method for any defined length of time, such as to allow
an incubation period after all reagents and sample are mixed
<li>activates a method but can delay or postpone it to start at a certain
time or even date
<li>pauses the test for a defined length of time which is calculated from
a specific <a href="#timemark">Time Marker</a>, usually providing the
spacing between timed additions of sample transfer or reagent
</ul>

<dt id="xfergroup">Transfer Group
 <dd>A set of parameters automatically added to defined liquid handling
procedures (it must be added by the user to custom procedures).  It usually

free from reagent or sample.  A large volume is passed to ensure a
constant flow required for cleaning.  The tip should have been placed
over a deck location where the tips are set inside a washbowl as part
of the washing process.  The washbowl flow should also go to a location
where waste is collected.  The Wash step is one part of the
<a href="#flush-wash">Flush-Wash</a> <a href="#procedure">procedure</a>,
which is a defined procedure that can be used to ensure thorough
cleaning of both the inside and outside of the probe tips.

<dt id="washbowl">Washbowl
 <dd>A specially designed wash station that permits a pipetting tip (probe)
enter its cavity to a certain position so that when system liquid (usually
water) is dispensed at a properly rapid flow rate, the liquid splashes

thoroughly.  It is usually used as part of the
<a href="#flush-wash">Flush-Wash</a> procedure.

<dt id="waste">Waste
 <dd>A pipetting mode in which a volume of the sample liquid is aspirated
before the specified volume of sample liquid itself is taken.  Only the
specified volume of sample liquid is dispensed at the destination, while
the waste volume acts as a buffer against short volumes (pipetting error).
This is a parameter usually defined in the Performance file.
Compare to <a href="#blowout">Blowout mode</a>.

<dt id="wellmap">Well Map
 <dd>Well maps apply to any <a href="#step">step</a> performed in a test
outline.  Steps that involve <a href="#labware">labware</a> having
