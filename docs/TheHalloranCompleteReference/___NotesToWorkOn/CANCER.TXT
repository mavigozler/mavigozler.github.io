Your mention of Mom's latest medical condition has us all in shivers.
We know endometrial cancer is beatable as most cancers go, but there
is always the chance that you are that 1 in 100 million individuals
who draws life's short straw.  I have information immediately below
which might be useful.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This book on clinical oncology I told you about earlier is indeed quite
useful, full of necessary information without being absorbed in the
details.

Considering your mentioning about Mom's "endometrial biopsy,"  I am
going to enter in some extracts on the subject of endometrial cancer.

I will say first that, after having read the section on endometrial
cancer, Mom fit the high-risk individual almost exactly.

These extracts are taken from pages 485-487 of this introductory
text published 1991 by the American Cancer Society, so the stuff
is fairly up-to-date.  Follow closely.  Remarks I make are outside
the quotes and offset.


                      ENDOMETRIAL CANCERS
                      ----------- -------

"Endometrial tumor is the most common type of female genital cancer in
the United States and is one of the six leading causes of cancer
death.  While in the first half of the twientieth century cancer of the
cervix was three to six times more prevalent than cancer of the
endometrium, this trend has reversed.  According to the American Cancer
Society, 33,000 new endometrial cancers were expected to occur in 1990
as opposed to only 13,500 new cases of cervical cancer."

     I calculate the rate of endometrial cancers for US women 
     in 1990, using that figure, is about 1 in 4300 US females 
     of all ages, although by 1995, with an error of 1 in 2000 
     to 1 in 8000 females.  I would guess that the rate in 
     post-menopausal US women is anywhere from 1 in 500 to 1 in 
     2500.  So even the chances of getting the cancer are 
     remote, let alone succumbing to it.

"The sharp rise in the relative prevalence of endometrial tumors probably
has been due to the aging population, high-calorie and high-fat diets,
and the popularity of estrogen therapy without progestational modification
ion the 1960s and early 1970s.  However, the cure rate for endometrial
cancer is very high because these tumors tend to be well-differentiated
and localized (Gusberg 1988a).  In 1990 endometrial tumor was expected
to result in only 4000 deaths in the United States, as compared with
approximately 6000 deaths from the less-common cervical cancer, 44,000
breast cancer deaths, and 50,000 female lung cancer deaths."

     Obviously, that is not much comfort to the 4000 women 
     who died in 1990, but the statistics are relieving for 
     women who are not in that category and about to undergo
     testing.

"Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is the predominant malignant neoplasm
of the uterus that originates in the endometrial epithelium.  However,
a variety of other tumors of mixed origin can arise in the body of the
uterus, the most common of which are:  sarcoma of the endometrium,
mixed mesodermal tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, hemangio-
endothelioma, adenosquamous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and
papillary serous carcinoma."

     I will provide other information on these other types of 
     tissue becoming cancerous in the uterus, but needless to 
     say, the glandular type ("adeno-") is the most common.  
     But that is mainly of interest to biologists studying the 
     histology of cancer.

     You should pay attention to the next set of extracts, 
     wherein bells ought to ring:

"EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS

"Endometrial cancer mostly affects postmenopausal women:  75% of cases
occur after age 50, and only 4% before age 40.  The incidence peaks at
58 to 60 years of age, approximately 10 years later than invasive
cervical cancer or adenomatous hyperplasia, the precursor to endometrial
cancer.

"Although no genetic marker is known, in 12% to 28% of cases the tumor
has occurred in families.  In this respect it is similar to breast
cancer.  The disease has also occurred in identical twins at about the
same age.

"Women with endometrial cancer tend to be of a higher socioeconomic status,
although in the United States this tendency has been disappearing as
the so-called class differences are being evened out.  Geographically,
frequency is higher in industrialized countries and lower in developing
countries, while the distribution of cervical cancer follows an inverse
pattern and is lower in developed countries and higher in developing nations,
Japan being the only exception. Both the socioeconomic and geographical
patterns are now attributed to differences in diet, as a high incidence of
endometrial cancer is related to high intake of dietary fat."

One should take some of what the ACS book says here with a grain of salt.
There are some chapters in this book which deal with some pretty
controversial issues regarding cancer and what causes it, and the position
of the ACS in some cases appears almost political and less scientific
when it mentions that one study shows this while failing to mention that
another study came to the opposite conclusion.  Scientists generally present
ALL the facts and leave it to the reader to decide based on the
probabilities.  I note the ACS links a lot of cancers with lifestyles
(smoking, alcohol, high fat in the diet, no fiber in the diet), and
the writing in some cases shows that these things are settled issues when
in fact they are still in dispute.  To continue:

"Women at a high risk of developing endometrial cancer tend to be obese
and have a large body frame, a finding that has been confirmed by
epidemiologic studies (Wynder, Escher, and Mantel 1966).  Women who are
50 lb (22.5 kg) overweight have a 9-fold risk of developing the disease.
Other risk factors include diabetes and hypertension, although
the relationship with these disorders appears to be casual and not
causal.  However, a young, slender, nondiabetic, normotensive woman
can have endometrial cancer.  Constant estrogen stimulation and a
deficit in progestational modification necessary to protect the endometrium
(Gusberg 1947) are other risk factors.  Yet although the hormone 
dependency of endometrial cancer has been a long-established fact, almost
40% of endometrial tumors appear to be autonomous and unrelated to
endocrine dysfunction, and their etiology remains unknown.

"Infertility due to failure of ovulation is one of the hormone-related
disorders characteristic of the high-risk group.  Absence of ovulation
creates a deficit in progestin, resulting in endocrinologic imbalance.
Menstrual aberration, common in the history of women with endometrial
cancer, is another symptom also frequently related to anovulation.  Another
significant characteristic is dysfunctional bleeding during the menopause,
which indicates overstimulation of the endometrium by irregular estrogen
secretion with modification by progesterone."

     Of course in normal menstrual physiology, you have this conflict
     of estrogen produced by the thecal cells of the ovary, this
     steroid normally stimulating a build-up of the vascularized 
     glandular tissue which is the endometrium, and then after
     ovulation, the corpus luteum (remnant) taking over estrogen
     function by MAINTAINING but not BUILDING UP the endometrium.
     Indeed, after a while, continued progesterone no longer works
     or begins to decline, resulting in an efficient sloughing off
     of the endometrial tissue.  Hence the difference between estrogen
     and progesterone are that estrogen at the vary least stimulates
     cell proliferation (the singularly most important characteristic 
     of any cancer cell) while progesterone does not stimulate cell
     proliferation but probably differentiates it.

     There is a theory that women who have had induced abortions are 
     particularly at risk for things like breast cancer since this 
     disrupts the normal hormonal changes that take place are abruptly
     blocked--something about estrogen levels being too high when the
     abortion is induced--and that with spontaneous abortions
     (miscarriages) or pregnancies seen through to the end,
     changes in estrogen levels occur normally or gradually, not
     necessarily leading to breast cancer.

"Finally, prolonged exogenous estrogen administration has been shown to
increase the risk of endometrial cancer.  Studies have demonstrated that
women taking estrogen for more than two years had a 4- to 14-fold risk
of developing the tumor compared with age-matched controls.

"DIAGNOSIS     
"Because of its clearly defined risk factors, the initiation of a screening
activity would seem appropriate, although few such attempts have been made.
While screening for cervical cancer is directed towards younger women
especially, detection programs for endometrial tumors should be aimed
primarily at the perimenopausal and postmenopausal age groups.  Due to the
long preclinical stage, suggested by its development late in life, and
the recognition of its precursor lesions, the development of this tumor
is highly preventable.  In addition to screening all women at menopause,
preventive measures must include restriction of promiscuous use of
estrogen and appropriate treatment of precursor lesions.

"Various techniques are available for detection and diagnosis of endometrial
tumors and precursor lesions.  Aspiration curettage, which can be performed
with minimum discomfort on an outpatient basis, is widely performed in
the United States.  Fractional curettage under anesthesia is a highly
accurate technique that offers a complete biopsy for analysis.  The Pap
smear, which is very accurate for cervical cancer, has only a 50% accuracy
in the detection of endometrial tumors.  Cytologic samples taken through
a cannula from the endometrial cavity have considerable degree of accuracy,
but usually not for precursor lesions.  Cytologic samples obtained by
abrasion also frequently supply histologic fragments that are diagnostically
useful.

"The only significant clinical sign is bleeding, which signals ulceration.
In postmenopausal women, bleeding indicates a malignancy in one-third
of the cases and benign condition in about another one-third;  it has
unknown etiology in the remaining one-third.  In pre- and perimenopausal
women bleeding is associated with endometrial cancer in a small minority
of cases.

"Pain usually appears only in widespread disease, and is not helpful for
early detection.  Pelvic examination is of little use because the uterus
frequently retains its normal size and shape.

"STAGING
"Adenomatous hyperplasia has been recognized as an endometrial cancer
precursor since the 1940s (Gusberg 1947).  If left untreated, it can
progress to invasive cancer in 20% to 25% of cases.  Depending on the
extent of histopathologic changes, grades I, II, and III of adenomatous
hyperplasia are distinguished.  Grade III may be called stage 0
carcinoma of the endometrium."

     Note that the hyperplastic condition is not necessarily a cancer
     or even tumor, and it is GRADEd instead of STAGEd, although the
     author equates the final grade of hyperplasia with something
     which is effectively now a cancer.

     In the previous section, the only real way to get at early detection
     of endometrial cancer is to understand that you are in a risk
     group and then get the uteroscopic exam on a regular basis a little
     before, during and well after menopause, but particular when you
     are in your middle to late 50s.  Extensive prior use of estrogen,
     being obese, and the other conditions multiply the risk.

"Staging of endometrial cancer previously was based on the extent of the 
tumor.  However, studies conducted in the 1960s have shown the importance of
incorporating major virulence factors--size of uterine cavity, involvement
of cervix, and histologic differentiation--into the classification scale.
The staging proposed by the FIGO (International Federation on Gynecology
and Obstetrics) committee in 1971, which includes these factors and
is now widely accepted, is [given in the table immediately following]. A 
new surgical staging is now proposed."

     Below is the table on tumor staging.

TABLE 33.5  FIGO CLASSIFICATION OF VIRULENCE FACTORS IN ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stages         Description/Features
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IA             Tumor limited to endometrium
IB             Invasion to less than halfway into the myometrium
IC             Invasion to more than halfway into the myometrium

IIA            Endocervical glandular involvement only
IIB            Cervical stromal invasion

IIIA           Tumor invades serosa and/or adnexae and/or positive 
               peritoneal cytology
IIIB           Vaginal metastases
IIIC           Metastases to pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes

IVA            Tumor invasion of bladder and/or bowel mucosa
IVB            Distant metastases including intra-abdominal or inguinal
               lymph node

Within each stage are three grades (GI, GII, GIII) which refer to the
particular histology of the tumor tissue itself (i.e., is it
solid or cystic?, is there necrosis in parts?).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


     Needless to say, the lower the stage, the more confined the tumor
     whether malignant or benign.  You don't want to hear that you have
     stage IV, since...well, the section on treatment is below.

"The rate of metastasis varies greatly, but no more than 15% of tumors
develop quickly and lethally.  The adenocarcinoma tends to spread along
the surface of the uterine cavity before progressing to deeper invasion.
It can then spread in several ways:  directly into the myometrium;
to the ovary or peritoneal cavity via cells escaping from the Fallopian
tubes;  to lung, bone or other sites through the blood vessels;
and through the lymphatic system."

     It is my opinion that a healthy immune system, in part bolstered by
     good health which includes exercise, will keep in check transformed
     cells, and especially the wanderers (the metastatic cancers).
     The appearance of especially multifocal tumors is especially well
     correlated to immune-compromised individuals, not the least of
     whom are AIDS victims.  For example, if I knock out most of your
     white blood cells with a little radiation without inducing bacterial
     infections, you will see something like Kaposi's sarcoma begin to
     pop, something that rarely happens in people with normal immune
     systems.


"APPROACHES TO TREATMENT"

I am going to summarize here since it is rather long.  Naturally you are
aware that for any cancer, a three-pronged attack can be considered:
surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy includes the
use of new natural substances produced in the body to stimulate the immune
system (whether deficient or not) to attack the cancer, since that is
its job anyway.  These substances are the interleukins and growth factors
that have been identified and cloned.

First, recall that the adenomatous hyperplasia is a sure sign that
endometrial cancer will eventually develop as the hyperplastic tissue turns
malignant.  Well, this hyperplasia is "hormone fed" by estrogen, and so
the typical treatment is to give a progestin, and the tissue is resorbed.
With the grade III hyperplasia (considered carcinoma in an early form)
a hysterectomy is indicated.  Estrogen should be stopped in postmenopausal
women and progestin given before surgery.

Indeed the hysterectomy is more often than not the treatment of choice in
postmenopausal women with any sign of cancer.  The surgery should be done
using the vertical suprapubic or paramedian incision rather than with the
more cosmetic Pfannenstiel incision.  Abdominal incision is also important
to assess the involvment of the pelvic region and upper abdomen.  A radical
hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy is done only under special circumstances
since it shows a greater operative morbidity and does not help the cure
rate.  Conservative hysterectomy with pelvic and aortic node dissection
is preferred.

Radiotherapy is combined with surgery as an adjuvant, and also in the
inoperable patient.  Some early studies indicated that preoperative
radiation was better than surgery alone, but more studies are really
necessary.  When radiation is combined with surgery, it doesn't matter
if the radiotherapy is pre-operative or post-operative, since cure
rates are the same with either.

Radiotherapy can be internal or external.  With internal treatment, a
traditional method is called the "Stockholm Packing," in which tubes
containing radium or its equivalent are inserted into the endometrial
cavity.  Also radium irradiation of the vaginal vault is done post-
operatively in an internal technique.  External radiative treatment
may be preferred however, since it covers the entire pelvic region at
risk;  it may be done either pre- or post-operatively.

Doses used in radiotherapy for endometrial cancer, unlike those for
cervical cancer, don't present much risk of toxic radiation effects
so long as they are carefully directed and they are adjusted to prevent
hyperradiation of vital organs.  Radiation is really used after
surgery when a recurrence is a high risk (about 30% of cases).

As for hormonal and chemotherapy, progestins are used to try to induce
regresion of metastases, particularly where the lung is involved.
This hormonal course works well if the lesion has differentiated; and
it works well with recurrent diseases.  Primary metastases are more
resisant to this therapy.  Chemotherapy works best with poorly
differentiated tumores that are not hormone-dependent.  It can help with
patients showing positive for malignant cells in para-aortic lymph nodes.
Adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil can be used singly or in combination,
being the drugs most well-characterized for used in advanced or
recurrent endometrial carcinoma.

5-year survival rates used to characterized the success in treating
all cancers are not surprisingly well analyzed for endometrial cancers
because not all studies stage the cancer according to virulence factors.
In general though, 75% of cases show a 5-year survival.  I assume that 
the 5-year period is taken from the date of diagnosis of endometrial 
carcinoma, rather than the date when first or last treatment is done,
since treatments can be combined or used singly.

Okay, you now have the lowdown.  I am going to continue to browse this
book and identify high risk parameters with which you guys might fit
the profile.  As you know, I know very well that I am quite high risk
for malignant melanoma, which is many more times higher in bringing
certain death than would endometrial cancer, largely because the
cells show a greater tendency to metastasize, being aggressive bastards
by nature (they are derived from embryonic neural crest cells, which
are highly translocatable).  The oncology book says that I am entering
the age range now where, if the melanoma is going to show, it will
do it pretty soon.  I am keeping an eye on my many moles, many which
seem to have sprouted within the last 5 or 6 years.  Nothing to worry
about yet.  I have heard a report however that the immune system
can be stimulated to knock off metastasizing melanoma, and so we
may have saved 8 of 10 cases of lethal melanoma.

                                                 YOUR PHONE (optional)



I believe your fax should have a phone output line and your can interpose
it between your modem and the wall hookup.  When your computer is not
on, the fax is programmed and ready to receive messages as normal.  Now
when you want to turn on the computer AND make a phone call out via the
modem, set your fax NOT to receive messages or answer the phone.  Calls
should ring through back and forth without any interference from the fax.
If your fax gives no option not to answer the phone, then just turn the
damn power switch off.  The effect is the same.  When you are done using
the modem, reset the fax (either by a programming switch or just by turning
it back on) for answering a dial-in.  You should be able to have the fax
normally operating while you have the computer on and are not using the
modem.

Now suppose you have a really cheap fax machine with no "Phone" out jack
as pictured in the diagram.  In that case, switch the order of the modem
and the fax, i.e., wall-->modem-->fax.  I know your modem has a jack
to the wall, a jack that says to the phone (this line goes to the jack in
on the fax), and third connection to the computer (if it is an external
modem), so there should damn well be no problme with that sort of 
arrangement .  The computer nor the modem power need be on to allow 
a dial-in to the fax to occur;  it should ring normally.

The connections are (or should be) all standard phone jacks that you buy at
the store.  If you have a problem with this set-up, let me know.  The last
arrangement may be better than the first (the diagrammed) one, since
you do not necessarily have to turn the fax off or set it not to answer
when you use the modem (I could be wrong):  turning the fax off or setting
it not to answer means you have to remember to turn it on when you get
off the modem (phone), and that can be difficult after a long session
reading tasteless or moronic stuff on AOL.

Any and every advice you have on pregnancy.  I was talking to everyone
about how people in the states are using cloth diapers once again.  You'd
thought I was some sort of cave man, the way they regarded the whole
idea.

Fact is, in Turkey cloth diapers are used by the very poorly and highly
uneducated.  Nilgun's mother Ayten says that the soaps used in cleaning
the diapers become so caked into the cloth that they irritate the baby
in the worst way.  I told that is because they are using too much soap
and ONLY soap to clean the diaper.  I have observed in particular that
Nilgun does not use bleach to clean white underclothes.  Indeed although
bleach is sold here in Turkey, it apparently is not understood by a large
number of Turkish women--men are years from desiring to be educated about
"woman's work" here--just what bleach does, when it is used, and how
much is used.

So the "modern," elite Turkish mother uses disposables.  They supposedly
don't give baby rash, and how easy it is to clean them!  The environment:
what's that?  Turks give selfishness and self-destructiveness new
meanings in the dictionary.  The most of them truly do not think beyond the
end of their own noses.  Protecting the environment is no way to buttress
any argument you have for using cloth diapers or any point you are trying
to make.

And when you consider how diapers have to be cleaned...and who will clean
them?  Well, I have proposed a system wherein cleaning is not to be
much of a problem.  I want your ideas or thoughts.

Mitch's Cloth Diaper Cleaning System
------------------------------------

Materials/equipment necessary:

* A large plastic bucket or pail (4-5 gallon size)
* A plastic (polypropylene) stick or rod
* A flexible hose connected to any water faucet
* bleach


Stage I--Immediate to near-immediate processing of solid waste.

The smell of pooh can be tolerated for only a minimal time, no matter how
much your nose becomes acclimated to it.  Hence, baby's dirty diaper needs 
to be processed at the first moment baby lets you do the processing.  I
think we all know that to be logical.  Now toilets in Turkey come in two
styles, as I have certainly mentioned before, and the other style is
ideal for dealing with dirty diapers.  A faucet nearby is hooked with a
hose and assists in removing the bulk, using minor pressure.  A plastic
rod or stick can also assist the process.  The diaper is then placed in 
a pail with water containing the appropriate amount of bleach to keep
bacteria from growing, but not too much bleach to wear down the cloth 
fiber too fast.  I would now let about 20-30 diapers accumulate in this
pail (my guess is, that is 4-5 days' worth of diapers).  The process
of cleaning each diaper takes between 1-5 minutes, largely depending on
pooh amount and consistency.  If baby stays off the hamburger and
french fries and sticks to fruits and vegetables, pooh should be easy to
remove.

Stage II--Preparation of the soaking diapers for washing.

The soaking diapers now have to get into the washing machine.  But there
is the unpleasant task of removing the excess water from the diaper
before it can be placed into the machine.  Using the rod to hold the diapers,
the water is drained from the pail.  The bucket is refilled with water,
the diapers stirred, drained again.  The process is repeated once more.
With rubber-gloved or bare hands, each diaper is twisted twice or three times
to ring out excess water.  Diaper is now ready for machine loading.

Stage III--The human work is done.

A proper amount of a proper soap/detergent and the measured volume of bleach
are placed into the washer.  I suggest the use of a long rinse cycle-- 
maybe even a double rinse cycle--to calm any fears about soaps irritating 
baby, preferably a rinse with warm water rather than cold water since 
chemicals rinse out of clothes much faster and better the hotter the 
water temperature is (that is just purely from a knowledge of chemistry).
We use a Bosch import washer that does a spin dry like you can't believe:
the machine is like a fucking ultracentrifuge.  Even towels are so near to
dry after the spin that you can practically time your shower with the
machine's spin and towel off after you take it from the machine.  (That
kind of G-force probably stresses the cloth fibers a bit much.)


Anyway, that is the system.  Nothing technological, no apparent use of
integrated circuits.  It is merely an attempt to make an unpleasant duty
seem more worthwhile because it looks systematic and prepares the person
doing the cleaning with the knowledge of how much time he gets his hands
dirty and when.  Your ideas on the matter are appreciated.

Seen any good movies lately?  I remember the times I would come over and
it would be video festival, catching up on all the awesome down to fair
stuff.  Considering what I have missed in the more than two years since
coming here, I would have to rent the whole of the store.  So many good
titles to see:  Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, Clint Eastwood's western
(Unforgiven, was it?), The Mask.  The last movie I saw with Tom Hanks in
it was "Big" I think, and that is pretty sad when you consider that just
about everyone wants him in their movie these days.

I keep up with TIME now and then which tells me what kind of things are
being missed.  This summer is rolling around and there are titles like
Waterworld, which I hear is more of a comedy than an adventure with all
the big budget handwringing and off-stage stuff being more news than the
movie.  Kevin Costner's name is likely to be mud if this ends up a
failure.  And to think "Dances with Wolves" was just a few years ago.

Bruce Willis is supposedly back with what he does best:  Mr. Snide in any
movie named "Die Hard."  This time it is "Die Hard with a Vengeance" and
I hear Jeremy Irons is playing Mr. Bad.  (Alan Rickman, whom I haven't
seen in a while, played the last Mr. Bad.)

And if the Irons-Willis pairing does not seem like oil and water, how
about Clint and Meryl?  What!?  I am not sure if it says so much about
Clint as it does about Meryl.  Clint's style just seems different from
Meryl's.

Some movies that came and went that I am curious about.  Tom Cruise in
Interview with a Vampire (based on a book I was reading just before
leaving the States):  how was the movie?  how was Cruise?  Then a movie
with the most bizarre casting imaginable:  the cast included
that Fox TV sensation Johnny Depp, Faye Dunaway, and Jerry Lewis
(yes, Mr. Muscular Dystrophy).  Actually I am glad to see Jerry back in
the movies.  The French, who fancy Jerry Lewis a comic genius, may be
partially right.  I didn't see the movie or Lewis, but I can just
imagine that over the years, Lewis might have developed the ability
to at least feign humility or that there are a new breed of directors
who can know how to tame giant egos.  I can imagine Lewis being able
to act (he does it rather decently in those telethons) in more than
just comedies, and it is pure genius demonstrated by a movie producer
who is looking for a new movie idea and comes up with role that someone
like Jerry Lewis might fit into.  There are plenty of examples of
Hollywood reaching back into the past and resurrecting major personalities
(Don Ameche being one example) to give them new careers.

Other movies coming this summer.  Casper (the friendly ghost, I guess,
although I hope he shows an evil streak).  The ghost is live action like
Who Framed Roger Rabbitt (another movie I never saw but never really
wanted to either).  Disney has the animated full-length feature
Pocohantos coming out, which I imagine ought to piss off some Native
American group even though the movie story has been thoroughly PC'ed, I'm
sure.  Mel Gibson fans won't be pissed, since he is one of the voices.

And then Batman Forever.  Is Keaton Batman again?  I know Jim Carrey will
play the Riddler, and I hear there is another villain as well.  The
movie will belong to Carrey no matter who plays Batman, since our psyche
always identifies with the bad guy.
