      Bias is essentially determining the differences in the report or response
      of a machine to known or standard references. If the true cocenration is
      xt for a substance but the report of a machine gives a population mean of
      m, the following obtains

    <h1>Operational Amplifiers</h1>

    The diagram will illustrate the inputs and outputs. ε
    <sub>−</sub>
    and ε
    <sub>+</sub>
    are input potentials and
    <i>
      V
      <sub>i</sub>
    </i>
    represents the difference between these potentials. +PS and −PS refer to the
    power supply to the amplifier (usu. +15 and −15 V dc). The amplifier has a
    gain (β) in which the signal multiplicaiton factor is understood. The output
    voltage will therefore be
    <i>
      V
      <sub>o</sub>
    </i>
    = −β
    <i>
      V
      <sub>i</sub>
    </i>
    .
    <i>
      Z
      <sub>i</sub>
    </i>
    and
    <i>
      Z
      <sub>o</sub>
    </i>
    represent the input and output impedance to the amplifier. Most opamps are
    self-contained units containing ~30 transistors and resistors put into an IC
    chip. Capacitors and diodes may also be part of the setup. The properties
    shared by most if not all opamps are:
    <ol>
      <li>
        large open-loop gains (β = 10
        <sup>4</sup>
        to 10
        <sup>6</sup>
        )
      </li>
      <li>
        high input impedances (
        <i>
          Z
          <sub>i</sub>
        </i>
        ≥ 10
        <sup>6</sup>
        Ω)
      </li>
      <li>
        low output impedances (
        <i>
          Z
          <sub>o</sub>
        </i>
        ≤ 1 to 10 Ω)
      </li>
    </ol>

    In addition, they should provide zero output for zero input (ideally &lt;
    0.1 mV output), but the zero output voltage can be obtained by use of an
    offset trimming system that reduces the voltage.

    <p>
      Measurement of voltages for both the input voltages and the output voltage
      are made with respect to a common ground in the circuit (the ground
      potential). This is essentially a conductor providing a common return of
      all currents to their sources. The ε
      <sub>−</sub>
      and ε
      <sub>+</sub>
      do not represent how voltage potentials are to be connected but represent
      how potentials to the opamp are to be treated. Potentials connected to ε
      <sub>−</sub>
      will be
      <em>inverted</em>
      (a positive becomes negative, a negative a postive, and ac voltages are
      180° out of phase), will those connected to ε
      <sub>+</sub>
      are unchanged with respect to polarity.
    </p>
    <h1>Uses of opamps</h1>

    <h2>Feedback circuits</h2>

    These return a fraction of the output signal to the amplifier, this being
    feedback. The feedback loop has a resistor (R
    <sub>f</sub>
    ) which connects to the lead going to the opamp inverter input. Note that
    voltage in this circuit is opposite in polarity (if dc) or out of phase (if
    ac) with the input to the opamp. The following from Ohm's law and Kirchoff's
    rules describe the relationship:
