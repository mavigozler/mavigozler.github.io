	<h1>Chili</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>2 tbsp minced onion
		</li>
		<li>1 ½ tsp chili powder
		</li>
		<li>1 tsp seasoning salt
		</li>
		<li>½ tsp cayenne pepper
		</li>
		<li>½ tsp minced garlic
		</li>
		<li>½ tsp ground cumin
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ol>
		<li>Mix all the ingredients into an airtight container with a lid or sandwich
			baggie. If you're making chili right away, leave it out on the kitchen counter.
		</li>
		<li>This equals a store bought package of chili seasoning mix. This is better
			than store bought because it doesn't contain extra sugar, salt, and
			preservatives.
		</li>
		<li>To make into chili, brown 1 pound of ground beef or turkey in a skillet. If
			you like, you can also cook some diced onion, crushed garlic, and diced green
			pepper in with the pound of meat. Add this spice mix. Stir it in well. Then add
			two cans of kidney beans and two cans of diced tomatoes. Stir again and heat it
			up. Serve this chili with a salad and corn bread or corn chips.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Chili Seasoning Mix II</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>¼ cup all-purpose flour
		</li>
		<li>4 tsp chili powder<br>
              Chili powder or powdered chili is the ground, dried fruit of one
              or more varieties of chili pepper, sometimes with the addition of
              other spices, when it may be known as chili powder or chili powder
              blend
		</li>
		<li>1 tbsp crushed red pepper
		</li>
		<li>1 tbsp dried minced onion
		</li>
		<li>1 tbsp dried, minced garlic
		</li>
		<li>2 tsp white sugar
		</li>
		<li>2 tsp ground cumin
		</li>
		<li>2 tsp dried parsley
		</li>
		<li>2 tsp salt
		</li>
		<li>1 tsp dried basil
		</li>
		<li>¼ tsp ground black pepper
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li>In a bowl, stir together flour, chili powder, red pepper, onion, garlic,
			sugar, cumin, parsley, salt, basil and pepper. Store in an airtight container.
		</li>
	</ol>


	<h1>Cookies</h1>

	<h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
	<p>
		There must be 10,000 different recipes for chocolate chip cookies out in the
		wild. The one I used most was in the Prudence Penny Regional Cookbook, something
		in my mother's possession. Where recipes are given below that are taken from
		the web, they will be linked in their titles.

	</p>
	<h1>Pies</h1>
	<p>
		In this section you will find pie recipes.
	</p>
	<h2>Pie Plates</h2>
	Best pie plates are:
	<ul>
		<li>anodized aluminum
		</li>
		<li>tin- or enamel-coated steel
		</li>
		<li>porcelain-coated aluminum with non-stick finish
		</li>
		<li>glass (Corning tempered)
		</li>
	</ul>

	These materials absorb heat, which helps the pie crust to become brown.
	<p>
		Crusts that are baked in shiny, heat-reflecting metal pans are often
		pale. If all you have are these kinds of baking containers, or you do
		not have the above, then it helps to put the pie dish on a cookie sheet,
		which will assist browning of the pie crust.
	</p>
	<h3>Greasing</h3>
	Never grease a pie plate unless the recipe calls for it. Pie crusts
	are made of grease themselves and usually do not cause the crust to stick
	to the plate.
	<p>
		If there is an unbaked crumb crust that needs to be loosened, do the following:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Soak a cloth in hot water and wring it out well.
		</li>
		<li>Wrap the cloth around the plate for a minute or two.
		</li>
		<li>Cut the pie.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Lining The Plate With the Bottom Crust</h3>
	If making a <a href="#twocrust">2-crust</a> pie, divide pastry into two
	pieces, one slightly larger than the other, and use the larger portion for
	the <a href="#bottomcrust">bottom</a> crust. If making two
	<a href="#onecrust">1-crust</a> (<a href="#bottomcrust">bottom</a> crust
	only) pies, divide the ball into two equal halves.
	<ol>
		<li>Roll the pastry into a circle about 1/8 inch (3 millimeters) thick
			and 4 inches (10 cm) larger than the diameter of the pie plate
		</li>
		<li>Hold or lightly rest the rolling pin over the pastry circle but close
			to one edge of it (so that it forms a short chord through the pastry
			circle). The long axis of the pin should be oriented not left and right
			to you, but forward and backward. If you are right-handed, it is best to
			hold the pin with your left hand, and place it over the edge of the pastry
			circle at the far right. If you are left-handed, it might be useful to
			do the opposite.
		</li>
		<li>At the midpoint of the edge closest to the pin (the far right edge if
			you placed the pin for right-handed persons), use your free hand to lift
			the pastry over the top of the rolling pin.
		</li>
		<li>Simultaneously continue to pull the edge of the pastry over the
			top of the pin and also move the pin toward the center of the pastry
			circle. The pin will act to lift the pastry circle through the center
			(diameter) of the pastry circle.
		</li>
		<li>Now lift the circle (hold the pastry gently on the pin to keep the pin
			from rolling) and move it to the pie plate so that the pin spans across
			the center (diameter) of the pie plate. The half of the pastry circle
			that goes under the bottom of the rolling pin should be resting in the pie
			plate, and the half of the circle over the top of the pin will be resting
			on the other half of the pastry circle.
		</li>
		<li>With the hand that is not holding the rolling pin (you might have switched
			hands), hold the edge of the pastry circle whose portion goes over the top
			of the rolling pin. While gently moving the rolling pin toward the half
			of the pie plate not covered, move your hand holding the pastry edge in the
			direction of the pin to unroll the pastry to cover the pie plate completely.
			“Unroll” means the rolling pin should move as the pastry
			rolls off the pin.
		</li>
		<li>Press the pastry circle on to the bottom and side of the plate
			with gentle pressure of the fingers
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Do not stretch the pastry at any point: it will only shrink back
		during baking.
	</p>
	<p>
		Proceed to make a decorative edge for the pie and then fill it. Optionally
		a top crust can be put on the pie.

	</p>
	<h3>Making The Top Crust</h3>
	With the smaller part of the pastry ball, do the following:

	<ol>
		<li>Make into a ball and roll out the pastry into a circle as was done
			to make the bottom crust.
		</li>
		<li>With a sharp knife, make a few short slashing cuts or some other
			design within the center of the pastry circle.
		</li>
		<li>Roll the pastry circle around the rolling pin as you did for the bottom
			crust, life the c
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Making A Decorative Edge</h3>
	Making a decorative edge can be done with both 1-crust and 2-crust pies.
	If you have a 1-crust pie, the edge is obviously made with the bottom crust.
	If you have a 2-crust pie, you can sandwich a top crust overhang of the same
	length with the bottom crust, and then work with the overhang.

	<h4>Old-Fashioned Fork Edge</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Cut the pastry even with the edge of the pie plate. That is, there is
			no overhang. Cut with sharp knife or scissors.
		</li>
		<li>Dip a 4-tined fork in flour.
		</li>
		<li>Press the bottom of the fork into the pastry at the edge of the plate.
			The tine marks should be visible, but not all the way through to the plate
			surface.
		</li>
		<li>Do this for the entire rim of the plate.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h4 id="fluted">Fluted Edge</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Cut the pastry circle so that there is a 1-inch (3-centimeter) overhang
			beyond the rim of the plate
		</li>
		<li>Fold the edge of the overhang <em>under</em> so that the edge rests on
			rim and causes the pastry to stand up.
		</li>
		<li>For right-handed people, hold the outer side of the standing-up pastry
			with the index finger and possibly middle finger holding one part of the outer
			side, and the thumb holding the other part of the outer side, and
			with the index finger of the other hand, press into the inner side
			of the standing-up pastry so that the
			pastry is pinched into a curved flute.
		</li>
		<li>Continue around the rim of the plate, spacing the flutes about
			¼-inch (6-7 millimeters) from each other.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Rope Edge</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Cut the pastry circle so that there is a 1-inch (3-centimeter) overhang
			beyond the rim of the plate
		</li>
		<li>Fold the edge of the overhang <em>under</em> so that the edge rests on
			rim and causes the pastry to stand up (as is done to make the fluted edge).
		</li>
		<li>From the outside of the plate, press the thumb into the pastry at
			an angle, and at the same time, pinch the pastry between this thumb and
			the knuckle of the index finger (the finger might be curled or extended).
		</li>
		<li>Place the thumb in the groove left by the index finger (this helps
			you determine the spacing/position of the next pinching action), and repeat
			the pinching all the way around the rim.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Modified Fluted Edge</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Prepare the <a href="#fluted">fluted</a> edge as above, but leave
			½-inch (12-13 millimeters) spacing between flutes.
		</li>
		<li>Take a floured 4-tine fork, and press each of the flutes, flattening
			them to the rim.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Turret Edge</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Make the stand-up edge as for the <a href="#fluted">fluted</a> edge.
		</li>
		<li>With a knife, cut through the pastry down to the rim at ½-inch
			(12-13 millimeter) intervals.
		</li>
		<li>Press the cut strips that are formed flat around the edge of the plate.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Scalloped Edge</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Make the stand-up edge as for the <a href="#fluted">fluted</a> edge.
		</li>
		<li>Hold the thumb and index finger of one hand apart about 1.25 inches
			(3 centimeters) on the outer side of the standing-up pastry.
		</li>
		<li>Get a round-bowl measuring tablespoon and flour it.
		</li>
		<li>While holding the outer side, use the bottom of the round spoon
			to press the inner side to make in impression of the spoon into the pastry.
		</li>
		<li>Proceed around the rim of the plate.
		</li>
		<li>Pinch the points in between.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Decorative Top Crusts (for 2-Crust Pies)</h3>
	<h4>Lattice Tops</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Place in the bottom crust pastry and cut a 1-inch overhanging edge.
		</li>
		<li>Put the filling in.
		</li>
		<li>Roll the pastry for the top crust into a circle and cut it into
			½-inch (10 millimeter) strips.
		</li>
		<li>Moisten the edge of the bottom crust with water.
		</li>
		<li>Place the strips about 1¼-inch (3 centimeters) apart across
			the filling.
		</li>
		<li>Trim/cut the strips so that their length is even with the overhang.
		</li>
		<li>Press the ends of the strips into the overhang, so as to seal them.
		</li>
		<li>Lay an equal number of strips at right angles to the first layer.
			If you want to make a woven lattice top, place the strips over and under
			alternately around the first set of strips.
		</li>
		<li>Pinch the edges to seal them and make a high stand-up edge, and then
			flute the edge.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Pie Crusts: Making Pastry</h2>
	<p>
		Always use <strong>cold</strong> water when making the pie crust.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the water feels lukewarm from the cold tap, add an ice cube to chill it.
		If lard is being used instead of shortening, put it into the refrigerator
		to chill it before using it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Do not handle the pastry more than necessary. The body heat from your
		hands warms up the pastry and makes it more difficult to prepare properly.
		The best way to work the shortening into the flour is to use either a
		pastry blender or two knives in a scissor-like action.
	</p>
	<p>
		When adding water, stir it into the dough with a fork. Add only enough
		water to make the ingredients hold (stick) together. Absolutely avoid
		making the pastry wet.
	</p>
	<p>
		With your hands, press the pastry into a ball.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the day is too hot, the pastry may become too soft to handle. In that
		case, wrap it in waxed paper and put it in the refrigerator for 30 min,
		or until the pastry is firm again. Then re-work the pastry.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even if you are making a crust for only one pie, prepare enough pastry
		for two crusts (or more). You can refrigerate or freeze any unused pastry.

	</p>
	<h3>Rolling The Pastry</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Spread a thin layer of flour over the surface that will be used
			to roll the pastry.
		</li>
		<li>If possible, cover the rolling pin in a stockinette. Roll the
			stockinette-covered pin over the flour surface.
		</li>
		<li>Put the pastry ball on the floured surface.
		</li>
		<li>Put the pin on top of the ball and roll it to flatten the ball slightly.
		</li>
		<li>The pie crust should always be rolled so that it is circular. To do
			this right, roll the crust as follows:
			<ul style="font-weight:bold;">
				<li>Always roll from the center of the crust to the edge.
				</li>
				<li>If necessary, push the sides of the crust in occasionally by hand.
				</li>
				<li>To avoid making the edges too thin, lift up the pin slightly as
					you roll to the edge
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Make sure that you rotate the pin around north, south, east, and west
			so that the crust becomes circular and of even thickness.
		</li>
		<li>Lift up or move the crust occasionally to make sure that the crust
			is not sticking. Rolling out the crust on a cold surface helps this.
			If the crust does stick, use a spatula to lift it without breaking
			it, and place some flour underneath.
		</li>
		<li>If cracks or breaks appear, you can patch the tear by cutting a strip
			from the pastry edge, moisten the torn edges, and then lay the patch
			over the crack/break/tear, and press or roll the patch into it.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		If you want a golden glaze on the top crust,
		brush the top crust—<em>not the
			edge</em>— with either milk, half-n-half (half heavy cream/half
		milk), undiluted evaporated milk, or slightly beaten egg white. If desired,
		sprinkle the crust with sugar,
	</p>
	<p>
		If the top crust browns too much, cover the pie loosely with foil for
		the last 15 minutes of baking.

	</p>
	<h3>Recipe for A 2-Crust Pie</h3>
	This recipe will make enough pastry (dough) for a single 2-crust pie
	or for two bottom crusts for 8- or 9-inch (20-23 centimeter) pie plates.
	<p>
		Beginners might want to make the 2-crust pie dough even though only
		making a single 1-crust pie. With experience, the recipe can be altered
		to reduce the amount of materials used (the more experienced will
		probably use 60-70% of the amounts in this recipe for a single 1-crust pie).
	</p>
	<p>
		Obtain the following ingredients:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>2 cups all-purpose flour
		</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon salt
		</li>
		<li>¾ cup shortening
		</li>
		<li>5-6 tablespoons of cold water
		</li>
	</ul>
	Do the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Place the flour and salt in a medium-sized bowl.
			(“Medium-sized” bowl means that the flour should
			probably fill about half the volume of the bowl.)
		</li>
		<li>Using a <a href="#pastryblender">pastry blender</a> or two
			knives while making a scissor action with them, cut (mix) in the
			shortening until the mixture forms coarse-sized (rather large) crumbs.
		</li>
		<li>Get one tablespoon of cold water, and sprinkle it over the flour.
			Try to distribute it well. <em>Do not add <strong>all</strong> of the
				cold water</em> indicated in this recipe.
		</li>
		<li>Use a fork <em>gently</em> to mix the water into the flour.
		</li>
		<li>If the mixture is not holding together, add another spoonful of
			cold water and repeat mixing with the fork. It is critical not to
			add too much water, which makes the pastry too wet and difficult to
			handle and to roll out.
		</li>
		<li>Use your hands to shape the pastry into a ball. It is important
			not to overhandle the pastry: hold it only for the time necessary to
			shape it into a ball (the body heat from the hands can alter the
			texture of the pastry). If it is a hot day, it may be necessary
			to wrap the ball in wax paper and leave it in the refrigerator for
			30 minutes.
		</li>
		<li>If making a 2-crust pie, cut the ball into two parts,
			but not equal parts: make one slightly
			smaller than the other. If making two 1-crust pies, then cut the
			ball into two <em>equal</em> parts.
			Re-shape each of the cut parts into a ball.
		</li>
		<li>Obtain a rolling pin. If possible, place it into a stockinette,
			and then lightly flour the stockinette.
		</li>
		<li>Find the surface you will use to roll out the pastry. A
			hard (marble is good) surface is essential, and it is helpful if it
			is cold too. It should not be hot or overly warm though. Place
			a light flour coating on it.
		</li>
		<li>Place the larger pastry ball on to the surface, and roll it into a
			circle as described above. The final thickness of the circle should
			be 1/8-inch (3 millimeters). The circle should be 2 inches (5 centimeters)
			larger than the pie plate; this means that the pastry circle should
			have a diameter 4 inches (10 centimeters) larger than the diameter of
			the pie plate.
		</li>
		<li>Transfer the pastry into the pie plate, lifted by the rolling pin,
			as described above.
		</li>
		<li>If making a 2-crust pie, pour in the filling and place the top
			crust pastry on top of the filling as described above, using the rolling
			pin.
		</li>
		<li>Cut the overhang from the pie plate so that 1 inch (2.5 centimeters)
			of pastry remains as an overhang. If making a 2-crust pie, press the
			top and bottom crust pastries together at the edge (it might help to wet
			them a little).
		</li>
		<li>Decorate the edge as desired.
		</li>
	</ol>


	<h2>Pie Filling</h2>
	Note that the recipes given are for the diameter specified for the pie plate.
	It is sometimes the case that the capacity is smaller than the diameter.
	In cases where there is too much pie filling, leftover filling can be
	baked in a custard cup, covered with foil if there is a crust, and the
	baking time should be about one-third of the pie baking time.

	<h3>Pies With Ice Cream of Frozen Fillings</h3>
	These pies are easier to cut, and also have more flavor. Let the pies
	stand at room temperature for 15 minutes after taking out of the freezer
	before you serve them.

	<h2>Storing/Freezing Pies and Pastry</h2>
	Pies that are made with cream, custard, whipped cream, or chiffon fillings
	must be stored in the refrigerator. They should be used (consumed) within
	a few days if their original appearance is desired (as long as they are
	refrigerated, they can be consumed without spoilage for several days, although
	they will not have their original appearance).
	<p>
		Pies filled with fruit can be left at room temperature for as much as 2-3
		days. They can be stored longer if refrigerated. Cover them to keep them
		from drying out, especially in dry climates.
	</p>
	<h3>Pastry</h3>
	Balls of unbaked pastry (used to make crusts) can be wrapped in plastic or aluminum
	foil and stored in the refrigerator for a 1-2 days.

	<p>
		Balls of uncooked
		pastry can also be freezer-wrapped (wrapping materials or containers designed
		for the freezer) for up to two months. When ready to be used, thaw the
		pastry in its wrapping, leaving at room temperature for 2-4 hours.
	</p>
	<p>
		The pastry can be frozen after rolling out into circles also. The circles
		should be 3-inches (7.5 cm) longer around the edge of the pie plate they
		will be placed in (that is, the circles should have a diameter 6-inches
		or 15 cm longer than the pie plate diameter). Stack all the circles
		with two sheets of waxed paper for each circle. Wrap and then freeze.
		When ready to use, place the circle on to the pie plate and allow to thaw
		10-15 min before pressing into the plate and shaping.

	</p>

			pie. It might be pastry rolled out, much like the bottom crust, to cover
			the entire pie filling. Or it might be a decorative woven
			<a href="#lattice">lattice</a> top made from pastry strips. Pies with
			top crusts are usually called <a href="#twocrust">2-crust</a> pies.

		<dd>A pie made with both a bottom and top crust. All pies have bottom
			crusts on which the filling is poured. But they do not need or require
			a top crust, and perhaps in some cases, should <em>not</em> be overlayered
			with a top crust. Apple pies tend to be 2-crust pies. Cherry and pecan
			pies often are 2-crust pies. Pumpkin pies are not exactly 2-crust pies:
			they might have a decorative top crust which is a woven
			<a href="#lattice">lattice</a> top crust.

		</dd>
		<dt id="lattice">lattice top crust
		</dt>
		<dd>This is a variation on the top crust. Enough pastry to make a 2-crust
			pie is rolled out and then cut into strips. The strips are usually
			layered atop the filling, with the strips placed over or under each
			other alternately, as if weaving the strips. A decorative edge to the pie
			is usual as well. See <a href="#woventop">Making a Woven Lattice Top Crust</a>
			for more information.
