      <h5>10% Neutral-Buffered Formalin</h5>
      To prepare a 1.0 liter solution:
      <ol>
        <li>??</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Citrate Solution</h5>
      Used or recommended for antigen unmasking.
      <p>
        Prepare a 500&nbsp;ml of a 0.1&nbsp;M (10&nbsp;×) pH&nbsp;6 solution as
        follows:
      </p>

      <h1>Tissue Block Processing</h1>

      <h2>Organization and Controls</h2>

      Both positive and negative controls should be used whenever possible. This
      guards against changes in the quality of the reagents, and provides the
      necessary reference. Controls are recommended for the following staining
      protocols:
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>acid fast (Kinyoun's)</td>
            <td>
              ferric ferrocyanide for ferric ion and hemosiderin (Prussian Blue)
            </td>
            <td>Picro-Sirius acid</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

      <h3>Slide Labeling</h3>
      The slide label should contain the following information, given in four
      rows:
      <ol>
        <li>Tissue identification (accession-block number)</li>
        <li>Fixative used</li>
        <li>Staining protocol identifier</li>
        <li>Date and initials of histotechnologist</li>
      </ol>
      Record keeping is essential to any operation which processes tissue blocks
      for histological examination. Professional laboratories assign unique
      identifiers (accession numbers) to all samples for easy tracking. This
      applies not only to processed sections on slides, but stored tissue
      blocks.
      <p>
        Cryostats require regular service. On a monthly basis, or when
        contaminated, cryostats should be cleaned and defrosted. Knives should
        be clean and rust-free, maintained sharp, and kept cold (placed within
        cryostat). Knives are cleaned with xylene, then absolute alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glassware that is used for silver nitrate-based staining techniques must
        be acid-washed. 5-10% nitric acid (often combined with 5-10%
        hydrochloric acid) is used, and then the glassware thoroughly rinsed
        with distilled water to remove acid wash.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tissue blocks should not be thicker than 3-4 mm in one dimension to
        permit penetration of fixatives over a time that is reasonable before
        continuing to process for sectioning. Blocks should be immersed in a
        volume of fixative that is 10-20 times the volume of the block.
      </p>
      <h2>Slide Cleaning</h2>
      Dirty slides can be placed in 95-100% alcohol, then wiped with gauze or
      soft lint-free towel. They can then be air-dried or placed in acetone
      before drying.
      <p>
        Acid-cleaned slides might be better. Soak in 5-10% nitric acid by itself
        or in combination with 5-10% HCl. Then rinse with large quantities of
        clean distilled or deionized water. Leave to air dry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Slides can also be washed in warm soapy water, rinsed with several
        changes in warm water. Soak then in 1% acetic acid, and polish with
        cloth.
      </p>
      <h2>Slide Coating</h2>
      Several methods can be used to make slides more adhesive.
      <p>
        <b>Gelatin</b>
        . Heat a pinch (0.07%) of Difco gelatin in a water bath (sprinkle the
        gelatin on the surface as the water heats). Then dip the slides and let
        dry.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Agar</b>
        . 1.25 g Bacto agar is dissolved in 500 ml distilled water (final 0.25%)
        by heating, with addition of a few thymol crystals. This is a stock
        reagent. To make, pour 15.0 ml in 1000 ml water.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mayer's Egg Albumen</b>
        . 50 ml of fresh egg albumen (it can be purchased) is used. 50 ml
        glycerin and 1 g sodium salicylate are added to it. Place in capped
        container and shake vigorously to produce air bubbles, which collect and
        rise to the surface carrying away egg white. The egg white top layer is
        removed to leave a clear solution. With tip of finger, rub thin film on
        to each slide. Place drop of water on slide, and spread tissue section
        with enough heat to evaporate the water partially. Remove excess water,
        dry with moderate heat. Purpose is to coagulate albumen with completely
        melting paraffin.
      </p>
      <h2>Sectioning of Frozen Tissues</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          label the base mold and partially fill mold with frozen tissue matrix
        </li>
        <li>
          Place tissues from animal in the pre-labeled base molds, in a way that
          the tissue is near the bottom and so that tissue is exposed with cut
        </li>
        <li>
          Plunge base mold into liquid nitrogen until it
          <strong>almost</strong>
          solidifies (about 30 s).
          <strong>Blocks left too long in nitrogen may crack</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Put block on dry ice (or keep tissue in base mold or transfer to
          plastic bag), and store at −70° until time for sectioning
        </li>
        <li>
          To section, mount block to the cryostat chuck by adhering it with
          small amount of frozen tissue matrix and allowing to freeze
        </li>
        <li>
          Typical depth is 5 μm, with sections collected on to glass slide
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover cut surface of block with frozen tissue matrix and freeze and
          store at −70° if block is to be re-cut later.
          <strong>
            Do not store tissues on cryostat; many have defrost cycle
          </strong>
        </li>
        <li>Fix sections in cold (−20°) acetone for 2 min</li>
        <li>
          Let fixed sections dry completely, label them, and store −70° until
          they are to be worked up further
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Fixation</h2>
      Part of the content here from Kiernan JA (1999)
      <i>Histological and Histochemical Methods: Theory and Practice</i>
      , 3rd Ed., (London: Arnold).

      <h3>Heating</h3>
      The simplest physical method, but typically used in microbiology.
      <p>
        Dipping large specimens in boiling saline (often containing formaldehyde
        [HCHO]) can be done, but more usual is to use a microwave oven. Current
        technique is to bring the temperature to 55° in chosen fixative, and
        heating accelerates the fixation process. Since microwaves penetrate
        tissues deeply, the water in them also heats quickly. Fixation in HCHO
        with 20 min of microwaving gave superior results to room temperature
        fixation over 48 h. The microwave needs to be standardized/optimized
        before it can be successfully used. It might also need to be placed in a
        fume hood when using fixatives that are somewhat volatile.
      </p>
      <h3>Freezing</h3>
      Freezing must be done to minimize formation of ice crystals which usually
      leave cell-size holes. Usually seen in large specimens which are frozen
      slowly. Freezing must be done rapidly or, if to be done slowly, use of a
      cryoprotectant is necessary. If the rapid freezing approach is taken, the
      possibilities include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          immersion in isopentane cooled to its freezing point (−170° C) using
          liquid nitrogen
        </li>
        <li>
          placing the specimen on a metal block already cooled using liquid
          nitrogen or dry ice-acetone mixture or even liquid helium (−268° C).
        </li>
      </ul>
      If rapid freezing is not an option or damaging, tissue should be
      cryoprotected before slow freezing techniques are applied. Incubating in a
      physiological saline or buffer containing a cryoprotectant is typical.
      DMSO, propylene glycol, and sucrose at 10-20% concentrations are usual.
      Sucrose is more likely to be used for already fixed tissues. Incubation
      overnight (12 h) at 4° in the cryoprotective solution is usual.
      <p>
        <b>Freeze-drying</b>
        might be used. The specimen is left in a −40° evacuated chamber until
        all ice has sublimed (an alternative to a vacuum is the presence of
        phosphorous pentoxide). Specimens can be infiltrated with paraffin but
        sections will not flatten on water during slide prep. Since the tissue
        is not strictly fixed, tissue-destructive enzymes might be present and
        active. Freeze-dried blocks/sections might be placed in a chamber with
        gaseous HCHO to achieve fixation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Freeze substitution</b>
        involves soaking a frozen specimen in a liquid dehydrating agent
        (usually EtOH or acetone) at super-cold temperatures (below −49°). This
        removes water/ice, but does not cause protein coagulation. After
        dehydration is complete, the temperature is then brought to 4° for a few
        hours, at which time coagulation of proteins occurs in the presence of
        the solvent. Block is then cleared and embedded in paraffin. Use of
        <i>n</i>
        -butanol allows simultaneous freeze-substitution and clearing, since it
        is miscible with the wax.
      </p>
      <h3>Chemical Fixation/Fixatives</h3>
      Important considerations in the use of chemical fixation will include the
      nature of the specimen (tissue block) and its ability to be penetrated by
      the fixative to be used. Some fixatives rapidly penetrate all kinds of
      tissues and fixation is complete within 24 h even when the specimen is a 5
      mm cube. When the fixative slowly penetrates blocks should not be more
      than 2 mm thick.
      <p>
        Time of fixation should not exceed 24 h in most cases with the exception
        of formaldehyde (HCHO), which often requires 1 week for the chemistry to
        be complete. Cannulating vessels to infuse/perfuse fixatives should be
        exploited when possible.
      </p>
      <h3>Organic Solvents and Acids As Fixatives</h3>
      <b>Acetone, ethanol (EtOH)</b>
      , and
      <b>methanol (MeOH)</b>
      all work by removing water surrounding protein and thus affect the
      hydrogen bonding intra- and intermolecularly. This results in
      <b>denaturation</b>
      . Soluble proteins coagulate, and organellar structure disrupted. Nucleic
      acids remain soluble in water (not precipitated). Below −5°, EtOH
      precipitates but does not denature proteins, and these remain soluble in
      water. All of these solvents extract lipids from tissues, whereas glycans
      are unaffected. Typical applications of acetone, EtOH, and MeOH are to fix
      films (cell smears) and unfixed cryostat sections. They are usually not
      suitable for tissue blocks because of severe shrinkage and hardening. It
      might be suitable to use if enzyme activitiy within a section is to be
      retained. Plant tissues for anatomical study might be fixed in 50-70% EtOH
      since it preserves cell wall structure.
      <p>
        <b>Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)</b>
        is a well-known agent for protein precipitation. Coagulation might be
        due to the trichloracetate ion associating with protein amine groups. It
        is usually a component in other fixatives.
      </p>
      <h3>Formaldehyde-Based Fixation</h3>
      Formaldehyde is a gas (bp −21°) which can be passed into solution to a
      maximal 40% by weight. Concentrates from commercial suppliers are usually
      37-40% (w/v). A 10-15% methanol stabilizer is present in reagent grade
      formalin to prevent polymerization. Concentrations are expressed as the
      dissolved gaseous material as percent by weight: thus 4% formaldehyde is a
      better reference than 10% formalin.
      <p>
        Paraformaldehyde is the polymerized form [HO(CH
        <sub>2</sub>
        O)
        <sub><i>n</i></sub>
        H, where
        <i>n</i>
        = 6-100] of formaldehyde occurring in powder form; it appears also as
        the white precipitate in formalin that has been around for a while. It
        dissociates in 60° water under slightly alkaline conditions (add sodium
        hydroxide dropwise to pH 7.2). In aqueous solution, the aldehyde forms
        the hydrate methylene hydrate, but it also polymerizes into soluble form
        HO(CH
        <sub>2</sub>
        )
        <sub><i>n</i></sub>
        OH where
        <i>n</i>
        =2-8 (polyoxymethylene glycols). MeOH is added to 10% to stabilize
        formalin against polymerization, forming the hemiacetal (methylal). Any
        polymers formed are eliminated when diluted with excess water, with
        depolymerization slower in acidic solution but more rapid in
        neutral-buffered formalin. Adding CaCO
        <sub>3</sub>
        chips to formalin solution will help in depolymerization. Over time
        formalin deteriorates as it reacts with itself to form formic acid and
        MeOH (Cannizaro reaction):
      </p>
      <p class="eqnserif">
        2 HOCH
        <sub>2</sub>
        OH → MeOH + HCOOH + H
        <sub>2</sub>
        O
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally such reactions occur in alkaline medium, but this occurs
        despite the drop in pH with HCOOH formation. Paraformaldehyde itself
        will depolymerize in neutralized water: the methylene hydrate produced
        has no MeOH or HCOOH and is preferred to diluted formalin as a
        histochemical and EM fixative. Heating paraformaldehyde to 50-80° will
        produce gaseous HCHO and the vapor applied to freeze-dried specimens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formalin fixation does not harden tissues as much as others (it is a
        “soft” fixative), and a wide variety of staining is possible; use a
        harder fixative when certain cytoplasmic structures are not fixed
        adequately for paraffin embedding. It is excellent at penetrating and
        preserving blood and fatty tissue, and frozen sections are possible with
        this fixation. Use Carnoy fixation when there is a desire to preserve
        nucleic acid. Tissues can be stored in formalin since it is a soft
        fixative, but 70-80% alcohol solutions are better for storage since iron
        and other pigments are better preserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solutions are prepared as 10%. Neutral-buffered formalin eliminates
        acidity arising from presence of formic acid; buffers include phosphate-
        and carbonate-based salts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formaldehyde as the methylene glycol reacts with free amines, guanidyl,
        sulfhydryl, hydroxyl groups on proteins. It also likely reacts with the
        amide nitrogen in peptide bonds. Addition of water or alcohol would
        reverse the reaction. However, continued reaction of the hemiacetal to
        form the acetal has the effect of cross-linking biomolecules, producing
        the fixation by methylene bridges. In most cases the reaction is with
        peptide amide nitrogens and amine groups on lysine. Thus fixation might
        reduce reactivity with anionic dyes slightly. Over time (6 months to 10
        years), the -NHCH
        <sub>2</sub>
        OH hemiacetal will oxidize form the stable aminic acid -NHCOOH, making
        older specimens unstainable by anionic dyes completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fixation times are temperature-dependent. Formalin penetrates at about 1
        mm per hour at room temperature. 10% formalin at 20-25° fixes well at 48
        h, at 35° within 24 h, and 20% formalin hardens within 3 h at 55°.
        Fixation occurs as free amino groups are bound and cross-linked,
        resulting in tissue hardening; this process is similar to resin
        production in urea or melamine with formaldehyde.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is vital to wash formalin-fixed tissues to remove excess formalin,
        which interferes with staining processes. A period of 24 hours of
        washing is a reasonable expectation. Tissues should ideally be stored in
        70-80% alcohol until the histological work can be done.
      </p>
      <p>
        An unwanted pigment can develop in formalin-fixed tissues that results
        from a reaction of formic acid and hemoglobin (a hematin). Tissues rich
        in blood fixed below pH 5.6 can show this development (an alkaline
        hematin may form above pH 8, by the way). These colorful pigments resist
        all strong mineral acids but nitric, but can be handled by 10-12%
        alcoholic saturated (ammonium or not) picric acid solutions, and by
        alkaline solutions. Prior to staining, sections are placed in the picric
        acid solution for 5 min, then washed 5 min or until clear.
      </p>

        Pigment formation can be prevented by simply using phosphate-buffered
        formalin (PBF) instead. The negative is that PBF does not preserve
        nuclei well. Add 100.0 ml of formaldehyde to a solution containing 4.0 g
        monobasic sodium phosphate and 6.5 g dibasic sodium phosphate (potassium
        phosphate can be substituted, but account for the weight difference).
        This makes a pH 7-7.2 formalin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formal saline is formalin with isotonic (9.0 g/liter) sodium chloride.
        It is used for the Ponceau fuchsin stain of adrenals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formalin can be acidified (to pH 2) by mixing 1:99 glacial acetic acid
        and 10%/20% formalin. Use this in preparing for silver or gold staining
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add 2.0 g ammonium bromide to 100 ml 15% formalin, and use this Formalin
        Ammonium Bromide for tissues of the CNS, particularly for noble metal
        staining techniques.

        Alcoholic formalin preserves glycogen-rich tissues (liver) quite well.
        10% formaldehyde is made up in absolute ethanol instead of water. An
        advantage is that drying/hydrating steps are avoided, without graded
        changes in alcohol. A disadvantage is that alcohol shrinks tissues, and
        leaches hemoglobin from erythrocytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acidified alcoholic formalin is also better for glycogen-rich tissues.
        RNA digestion might be performed on tissues, and this fixes cytoplasm
        quite well. Formaldehyde is added to 10% and glacial acetic acid to 5%
        in 95%-100% ethanol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formaldehyde preserves lipids well and especially in the presence of
        calcium, which reduces the solubility of phospholipids in water.
        Formol-Calcium uses 10% formalin containing 1% calcium chloride. The
        CaCl
        <sub>2</sub>
        appears to prevent distortion of phospholipids when they extend their
        surface outwards during intake of water.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Aldehydes &amp; Glutaraldehyde</h3>
      Glutaraldehyde is a difunctional aldehyde with a linking three methylene
      groups. It polymerizes by the aldol condensation reaction to form olefinic
      molecules, which occurs with time and in more alkaline solutions. Usually
      it is prepared as an acidic (pH 3) 25% solution. If polymerization is
      excessive, it is no longer usable as a fixative.
      <p>
        The chemistry of glutaraldehyde is such that as polymerization occurs,
        only mid-chain aldehydes are involved in fixation where as the free end
        are not, and these can react and interfere with amine based dyes
        (Feulgen, periodic acid-Schiff, any reactions which depend on the
        production of aldehydes as part of the staining process). Thus steps
        have to be taken to make sure fixatives that produce aldehydes are
        blocked/changed to make them unreactive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often the dialdehyde is mixed with formaldehyde in a neutralized
        solution to produce an excellent EM fixative. Pure glutaraldehyde is
        more likely to lead to less antigen masking than with a mixture of
        formaldehyde.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chloral hydrate is the stable hydrate of trichloroacetaldehyde and is an
        additive for fixing nervous tissue. Acreolin (H
        <sub>2</sub>
        C=CH-CHO) is a very toxic EM fixative, and the reaction includes the
        unsaturated bond.
      </p>
      <h3>Karnovsky's Fixative</h3>
      This fixative is used when ultrastructural (EM) work is required for
      cultured cells or even tissues.
      <p>The original Karnovsky's combines the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2.5 vol 16% paraformaldehyde</li>
        <li>1 vol EM-grade 50% glutaraldehyde</li>
        <li>3.125 vol 200 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2</li>
        <li>3.125 vol distilled water</li>
      </ul>

      The final is a 5% glutaraldehye, 4% formaldehyde in 80 mM buffer and is
      extremely hypertonic with an osmolarity of 2000 mOsm.
      <p>
        A
        <b>modified Karnovsky's</b>
        is used for vascular profusion:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>2.6 vol 16% paraformaldehyde</li>
        <li>1 vol EM-grade 50% glutaraldehyde</li>
        <li>10 vol 200 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2</li>
        <li>6.4 vol distilled water</li>
      </ul>
      Osmolarity can be adjusted by adding sucrose or NaCl.

      <h3>Acetic Acid</h3>
      Acetic acid does not fix proteins but coagulates nucleic acids. This is
      believed to result from an action of the undissociated acid and not the
      acetate ion, and other carboxylic acids both miscible in water and in
      lipids are thought to have the same effect. When included in fixatives the
      intent is to preserve chromosomes, precipitate chromatin in interphase
      nuclei, and to counter shrinkage caused by agents like EtOH and picric
      acid.

      <h3>Other Fixatives</h3>

      <h4>Clarke's Fluid</h4>
      Made with 3 volumes of absolute EtOH and 1 volume of glacial acetic acid
      just before using, it is a general fixative and also used to preserve
      nucleic acid and carbohydrates. After a month, ethyl acetate may become
      significant but not necessarily detract from fixation. After fix, move to
      95-100% EtOH.

      <h4>Carnoy's Fluid</h4>
      Made just before use according to recipe above, it rapidly penetrates and
      coagulates protein and nucleic acids, extracts lipids. Tissue blocks up to
      5 mm thick are fixed in 6-8 h then moved to 95 or 100% EtOH. Hydrolysis of
      nucleic acids (loss of RNA) can occur if left too long in this fix (18 h);
      lower (5%) acetic acid can be used instead, called modified Carnoy's.

      <h4>Picric Acid-Based Fixatives, Bouin's</h4>
      Picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrophenol) is a strong acid fixative which should
      be present in water. Dry substance is explosive. Nearly saturated
      solutions have a pH 1.5-2.0 will precipitate proteins by complexing with
      basic groups. This does not happen in neutral solutions of the substance,
      and neutrlization also allows resolubilization of proteins. After fixing
      in the acid, tissues are transferred to 70% EtOH to coagulate the
      precipitated protein.
      <p>
        Picric acid should not be used where DNA and RNA are to be studied
        quantitatively since some hydrolysis of nucleic acid might be mediated
        by its presence. For qualitative staining of nucleic acids, picric acid
        is not detrimental.
      </p>
      <p>
        The acid is satured in water at about 1.2%. It coagulates proteins, and
        its complexes with proteins give strong affinity for acid dyes. It is
        particularly useful in glycogen-rich tissues, fixing protein that can
        readily solubilize it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acetic acid is often added to counter-act the shrinkage caused by picric
        acid. Acetic acid causes tissue swelling because it breaks down collagen
        cross-linking. Picric acid can also de-calcify as it fixes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Picric acid
        <strong>MUST</strong>
        be washed thoroughly from tissues after sectioning. Staining is quite
        poor without the removal of picric acid. Do not use water or buffer
        since it reveses fixation. A 70-80% alcohol solution is better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bouin's is an acidified picric acid-enhanced formalin. Picric
        acid-Formalin (PAF) is a neutral version made by mixing 2.1 g picric
        acid in 150 ml water with 20 g paraformaldehyde in 100 ml which has been
        depolymerized (clarified) by heating it to 60° and adding dropwise NaOH,
        and then adding 3.3 g NaH

        As an oxidizing agent, chromium(VI) is much stronger in acidic solutions
        (oxidizing power varies inversely with pH). Products involve formation
        of Cr(III) ions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dichromate does not coagulate proteins and chromatin unless acidified;
        otherwise protein precipitation (insolubilization) occurs but nucleic
        acids are unaffected. Alkaline solutions are usually not used as
        fixatives. Thorough washing in water is required after fixation, for
        immersion into alcohol causes formation of unwanted chromic oxide
        precipitate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chromium centers in chromates are coordinated by carboxyl groups
        (typically in proteins). This coordination is strongly promoted at very
        acidic pH values. This coordination cam involve other ligands (hydroxyl,
        amino) as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        In history chromic salts have been used in tanning (converting collagen
        into leather) and in hardening of gelatin in photographic emulsions;
        gelatin is a collagen boiled in water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chromic/dichromate fixes should be washed extensively with (tap) water
        (12-48 h) before doing dehydrating alcohol treatments, since EtOH can
        react with dichromate to form a green-colored chromium trioxide (and
        acetaldehyde) as the alcohol is oxidized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orth's Fixative can be used to preserve glycogen (which can then be
        demonstrated with Bauer's technique). This uses a stock 2.50% potassium
        dichromate solution, in which formaldehyde is added to 10% of the volume
        just before using. Tissue is allowed to fix 48 h (longer--72 h--for
        brain). Wash 16-24 h, then store in aqueous alcohol or formalin. Orth's
        can also be buffered (make the stock with sodium acetate added to
        1.62%), which preserves iron pigments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kose's variant of Orth's fix uses 3% potassium dichromate instead of
        2.5%. This hardens tissues more in the same time period, and is better
        for the enterochromaffin reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hillarp-Hökfelt technique is a chromium-based fix which is good for
        biogenic amines, found in chromaffin, rickettsiae, bacteria, and also in
        degenerative processes and necrosis. Myelin also preserves well. Since
        chromium oxidizes polysaccharide to make aldehydes (for Bauer test), it
        can highlight glycogen and fats.
      </p>
      <h4>Mercuric Salts</h4>
      Hg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      typically complexes electrostatically with carboxyl groups on proteins. It
      will also coordinate with hydroxyl groups, and with phosphate in
      nucleoproteins. Chromium has the ability to bind proteins together
      however, causing them to coagulate; mercuric ion does not.
      <p>
        It especially reacts with thiols in reversible manner (adding another
        thiol will reverse it).
      </p>
      <p>
        A more important feature of mercuric ion (same for copper, silver,
        nickel, zinc, cobalt, and manganese) is the ability to link a protein
        with a small organic molecule. These molecules can be azide dyes in
        particular. It helps if the molecule contains other functional groups
        that create second bonds via hydrogen bonding.
      </p>
      <h5>Mercuric Chloride</h5>
      The molecule Cl-Hg-Cl in solution contains hardly in free Hg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      ions. A hydro complex is thought to occur: HO-Hg-Cl + H
      <sup>+</sup>
      + Cl
      <sup>−</sup>
      . When acid is added, this will lead to the reverse reaction forming H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O and HgCl
      <sub>2</sub>
      .
      <p>
        If NaCl is added, a tetrachloride coordinate complex is though to form:
      </p>
      <p class="eqn">
        HgCl
        <sub>2</sub>

        ]
        <sup>2−</sup>
      </p>
      <p>In the presence of ammonium salts or amines, the chemistry is:</p>

        <sub>2</sub>
        -Hg-Cl + H
        <sup>+</sup>
        + Cl
        <sup>−</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that in the 2nd reaction, the Cl atom might be substituted with
        another R-NH
        <sub>3</sub>
        <sup>+</sup>
        group, resulting in cross-linking and probably insolubilization of
        proteins. But these -N-Hg-N- complexes are unstable if chloride ion is
        added complex with more Hg ion. Addition of acids or thiosulfate ions
        has the same effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        What leads to fixation is the formation of a more stable Cl-Hg-S-
        complex from the presence of thiols.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Osmium Tetroxide (OsO
        <sub>4</sub>
        )
      </h4>
      Osmium tetroxide is volatile at room temperature. The vapor can cloud
      corneas and is irritating. It is soluble in water (does not ionize or
      complex) but more so in organic solvents. Traces of organic matter can
      react to produce OsO
      <sub>2</sub>
      • 2 H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O. It is a vigorous oxidizer and for this reason is not toxic since it
      produces a non-toxic product. It should not be discarded down the sink
      however: it is more economical to recover the expensive osmium for
      recycling to the tetroxide.
      <p>
        During fixation it reacts with proteins (via thiol groups) and
        carbohydrates. Protein solutions are gelated and not coagulated.
        Crosslinking likely occurs. It particularly reacts with unsaturations
        (-HC=CH-) to form a cyclic osmium ester. The crosslinking may result
        when two unsaturations are positioned near the molecule. When OsO
        <sub>2</sub>
        precipitates it is black. Blackening of tissues occurs when passage
        through EtOH occurs, and the cylic ester of osmium results in EtOH
        oxidation, leading to formation of a vicinal diol in the
        protein/carbohydrate and to osmium dioxide (and acetaldehyde). This also
        occurs with the tetroxide not washed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically OsO
        <sub>4</sub>
        is included to preserved ordered lipid structures which are made black
        in color and are electron-dense for EM ultrastructural work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proteins treated with OsO
        <sub>4</sub>
        will lose their affinity for anionic-type (acid-based) stains.
        Acidophilic elements will be stained by cationic (basic) dyes. This
        might be due to oxidation by OsO
        <sub>4</sub>
        of free amine groups to form an unstable imine (-CH=NH), which then
        reacts with water to form an aldehyde (-CH=O) and the aldehyde then
        oxidizes further to form a carboxylic acid, completely transforming the
        functional nature. Oxidation of OsO
        <sub>4</sub>
        is unlikely to be the dioxide, since the tissue would be blackened: it
        is thought that a soluble osmate [OsO
        <sub>2</sub>
        (OH)
        <sub>4</sub>
        ]
        <sup>2−</sup>
        or osmiamate (OsO
        <sub>3</sub>
        N)
        <sup>−</sup>
        might be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Penetration is not so deep (0.5 to 1.0 mm) so blocks should be cut
        small. This fixative is quite good at preserving structure without
        morphological artifacts.
      </p>
      <h4>Zenker's</h4>
      Zenker's base is sufficient as a fixative, but metallic salts penetrate
      tissues slowly. The use of formaldehyde or acetic acid helps to get better
      penetration of the metal salts.
      <p>
        The Zenker fixative is recommended for bone marrow, bone which must be
        decalcified, and blood-containing organs. Fix the tissue for only 4-24 h
        (it will overharden if done too long). Mercuric chloride was added to
        the dichromate formulation of Müller's in order to improve the fixation
        of nuclei. HgCl
        <sub>2</sub>
        is a permanent mordant, with brilliant staining of nuclei and cytoplasm;
        it also coagulates proteins (fixes proteins by precipitation). HgCl
        <sub>2</sub>
        does not penetrate well in thicker specimens, which is why these should
        be post-fixed with 2.5% aqueous potassium dichromate for 2 h.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zenker-Formol includes formalin to improve penetration, particularly in
        fatty tissues. Use this especially to preserve intact granules in
        endocrine glands. Fix the tissue for 4-24 h, and not beyond that to
        prevent overhardening. Do not use Zenker-Formol that shows the
        development of a white-to-gray or black precipitate: the formaldehyde,
        which should be added only immediately before use, will reduce the
        mercuric chloride to mecurous chloride (calomel) and even metallic
        mercury.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding sodium chloride (to 6%) to Zenker's acetic helps to prevent
        hemolysis which occurs with the presence of 5% acetic acid. It also
        preserves acid-sensitive zymogen granule lysis in pancreatic tissues.
      </p>
      <p>
        With thin blocks (4 mm thick), fix in Zenker's fixatives for 6-8 h, and
        with thicker pieces, 15-18 h. Chromate is then washed out with running
        water (or many changes of water), 12 h for small pieces, 24 h for
        larger. Store in 70-80% alcohol, which removes excess HgCl
        <sub>2</sub>
        . Store in cedar oil for the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eosin- and acid-based dyes stain cytoplasm brilliantly, possibly
        obscuring basophilia and oxyphilia seen in necrosing and regenerating
        cells. Nuclear structures are preserved, and this staining is compatible
        with most stains. As a mordant, HgCl
        <sub>2</sub>
        makes brilliant the staining of chromatin and cytoplasm, and is also a
        good coagulant for mucin, shrinking the tissues less with only moderate
        hardening, with less cell distortion. Unfortunately, HgCl
        <sub>2</sub>
        can also harden outer layers into a hard white mass, so use only thin
        blocks to keep fixation short and uniform. Longer fixation makes
        sectioning difficult and staining poor. Poor washing will interfere with
        nuclear staining. Note that mercury and its salts are highly toxic!
      </p>
      <p>
        HgCl
        <sub>2</sub>
        can leave unwanted pigments that represent precipitated salt. These can
        be removed with Gram's iodine (0.33% iodine + 0.67% potassium iodide) or
        with alcoholic iodine (0.3-0.5% iodine in 70-80% alcohol), followed by
        washing in 5% sodium thiosulfate. The iodine reacts to form mecuric
        iodide, which is made soluble in sodium thiosulfate. This is best done
        after sectioning: deparaffinize the sections, then treat 5-10 min with
        iodine, rinse with water, then de-colorize 5 min with the sodium
        thiosulfate solution, and finally wash 10 min in water prior to
        staining.
      </p>
      <h4>Non-Aqueous Fixatives</h4>
      Alcohol preserves certain specimens well, such as smears, glycogen,
      pigments, and films of blood/tissue. A brief denaturation in 60-80% at
      −20° to 4° can keep proteins and enzymes in an undenatured state
      (relatively). Alcohol hardens and dehydrates simultaneously. It will not
      leach many useful components that would be soluble in aqueous fixes. It
      will not fix chromatin, and nucleic acids converted to soluble forms lost
      in solution. Negatives include that it can overharden and shrink tissue;
      it can so rapidly harden that cells deep within tissues can become
      encased, making penetration of substances difficult. It also coagulates
      cytoplasm.
      <p>
        Acetone-based fixatives are used primarily to retain the activities of
        enzymes (lipases, phosphatases). Tissue if fixed in ice-cold acetone for
        24 h, and then cryosectioned, or perhaps lyophilized. Fats will dissolve
        under ice-cold acetone, but dry-ice-cooled acetone preserve them after
        freeze-substitution. Galactolipids and phospholipids are insoluble in
        acetone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carnoy and its methanol variant, Methacarn (Methanol-Carnoy, substitute
        methanol for ethanol) are better for fibrous tissues (muscle) and where
        tissues are rich in alpha-helical proteins. Nuclear structure is
        well-preserved, but DNA and globular proteins rearrange. These are rapid
        fixes (12-24 h on 3-5 mm slices). No washing is required: they can go
        directly to absolute alcohol, but methyl benzoate should be used to
        clear before using xylene. These fixatives should be used when
        water-soluble components (chromatin) are to be preserved. Do not wash in
        alcohol very long, to avoid excessive shrinkage. Red cells, myelin,
        pigments, and acid-soluble granules will not be preserved. Do not
        process thick tissue blocks in this system (&lt;4 mm).
      </p>
      <h2>Dehydration</h2>
      Tissues should be dehydrated prior to any paraffin embedding, or else the
      wax will not infiltrate the tissues. Alkyl alcohols provide the best
      results. Ethanol is the most commonly used, being relatively non-toxic.
      Methanol is used for blood/tissue smears and for tissues fixed in
      methanol-Carnoy (Methacarn). Butanol is sometimes used. While not an
      alcohol, acetone also provides dehydration and is rapid.
      <p>
        The best techniques apply dehydration (alcohol) in graded steps, washing
        tissues in increasing percentages by volume of the dehydrating agent.
        The leads to less morphological distortion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unwanted hardening of the tissues during paraffin embedding is
        attributed to improper technique in dehydration.
      </p>
      <h2>Clearing</h2>
      Alkyl aromatics provide the best result. Xylene is the clearing agent of
      choice (there are ortho-, meta-, and para isomers). Benzene is sometimes
      used because it hardens tissue less than does xylene, but it evaporates
      quickly and is a carcinogen. Toluene evaporates slightly less rapidly than
      benzene, and is less hardening than xylene, and is sometimes used as well.
      Methyl benzoate is used when tissues have been fixed in Methacarn.

      <h2>Infiltration/Embedding</h2>
      The table below shows the different types of paraffin and their melting
      points. The most commonly used is the 56-58° paraffin.
      <table align="center">
        <tbody>
          <tr>

      </table>
      <p>
        It is essential to regulate the temperature of the paraffin. Tissues
        should not remain too long exposed to the heat. Paraffin ready for
        infiltration should be between 2-4° above its melting point (in fact,
        paraffin kept in this state for several weeks is superior to paraffin
        freshly melted).
      </p>
      <p>
        Preferred additives (e.g., Tissuement [Fisher], Paraplast [Curtin],
        polyisobutylene, and many proprietary additives) should be already well
        mixed. Other additives include beeswax or crepe rubber, which apparently
        promote ribboning of sections, and DMSO, which accelerates penetration
        of tissues. It is important to note that regulating the paraffin mixture
        temperature is done in part to prevent degradation of additives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paraffin blocks that do not cut properly most likely were not dehydrated
        properly prior to embedding. The solution is to melt the block,
        rehydrate the specimen, and then proceed from the beginning, this time
        properly dehydrating the tissue.
      </p>
      <h3>Embedding Protocol</h3>
      Several days are required to prepared fixed tissues for paraffin
      sectioning. Most of this time is involved in dehydrating the tissues in
      graded steps.
      <ol>
        <li>Day 1: incubate tissue block in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°</li>
        <li>Day 2: incubate in PBS at 4°</li>
        <li>Day 3: incubate in 30% ethanol</li>
        <li>Day 4: incubate in 50% ethanol</li>
        <li>Day 5: incubate in 70% ethanol</li>
      </ol>
      The tissue is stored in 70% ethanol until ready for paraffin embedding.
      <p>
        On the day of embedding, cut tissue to a 3-5 mm thickness and place in
        an embedding cassette. The following steps take about 6 hours:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Place in 95% ethanol for at least 30-60 min</li>
        <li>Repeat 95% ethanol in second (fresh) batch for 60 min</li>
        <li>Place in absolute ethanol for 30-60 min</li>
        <li>Repeat absolute ethanol for 60 min</li>
        <li>Incubate in Hemo-De (Fisherbrand xylene) for 30-60 min</li>
        <li>Repeat in Hemo-De for 60 min</li>
      </ol>
      If the paraffin process is not to be completed during the day, then make a
      heat 1 volume Hemo-De and 1 vol paraffin separately at 60° (in oven), then
      mix them 1:1 immediately prior to use, and place the tissue within,
      leaving at room temperature. Heat to 60° just prior to going to the next
      set of steps on the next day.
      <p>Perform these steps for the embedding procedure:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place tissue in Paraffin #1 at 60° for 60 min. Stir occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place tissue in Paraffin #2 at 60° for 60 min. Stir occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place tissue in Paraffin #3 at 60° for 60 min. Stir occasionally.
        </li>
      </ol>
      Set the paraffin dispenser to 60°

      <h2>Standard Fast Procedure</h2>
      The times given below are for tissue specimens not greater than 3 mm
      thick. Use the slower method below if cutting sections presents some
      difficulties. No viscous clearing agents are used as in the standard slow
      method.
      <p>
        For tissues (such as plants and invertebrates) that contain significant
        water, prior to step 1, it is useful to dehydrate in graded steps in 15,
        25, then 50% dehydrating agent for 30 min h each step; this results in
        less morphological distortion.

      The wax infiltration can be done using an oven or a vacuum-embedding
      chamber (the latter is preferred). Other clearing agents include
      DL-limonene, benzene, chloroform, or a mixture of chloroform with benzene
      or toluene.
      <h2>Standard Slow Procedure</h2>
      The time periods for each step given below are typical for tissue blocks
      with a thickness of 3-5 mm. Longer times for all steps should be done for
      thicker specimens.
      <p>
        When the fixative is alcohol, the dehydration steps can be omitted.
        Volumes of all reagents should be 10-20 times that of the specimen. The
        dehydrating agents can be ethanol (95% or absolute), methanol, or
        isopropanol. The oily clearing agent can be, among others, amyl alcohol,
        benzyl benzoate, cedarwood oil, methyl salicylate or terpineol
        (preferred). For tissues (such as plants and invertebrates) that contain
        significant water, prior to step 1, it is useful to dehydrate in graded
        steps in 15, 25, then 50% dehydrating agent for 2 h each step; this
        results in less morphological distortion.

      A suitable mold should be used at the end to block out the wax. The wax
      infiltration can be done using an oven or a vacuum-embedding chamber (the
      latter is preferred). New solvents must be used for container 2 of the
      oily clearing agent. Wax in containers 1 and 2 may be used only once in
      non-volatile solvents were used in the clearing step. Wax in containers 3
      and 4 can be used once more.

      <h2>Rehydration</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          De-paraffinize if necessary using xylol for 5 min. Repeat two times.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse in absolute alcohol with three changes of alcohol</li>
        <li>Rinse in 95% alcohol with 2-3 changes</li>
        <li>Rinse in 80% alcohol once only</li>
        <li>Remove the pigment according to the type of fixation</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Removing Pigment</h2>
      For formalin-fixed tissues, perform the rehydration to the 95% alcohol
      step, then place in saturated picric acid/alcohol solution for 5 min, then
      rinse in tap water until all acid is removed and the tissue clear (ca. 10
      min).
      <p>
        For Zenker-fixed tissues, proceed from the 80% alcohol step to water for
        10 min, then to soak in Gram's iodine for 10 min, then 5% sodium
        thiosulfate until clear, then water for 10 min.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Kaiserling-fixed tissues, combine the procedure used for formalin
        with the Zenker-type.

      <h2>Dyes/Stains</h2>
      [many notes in this section from Kiernan JA,
      <i>Histological &amp; Histochemical Methods: Theory &amp; Practice</i>
      , 3
      <sup>rd</sup>
      Ed.]
      <p>
        Dyes have two functional parts the
        <b>chromogen</b>
        which is the colored part, and the auxochrome, which is the part that
        attaches to substrate. Auxochromes are the side chains which may be
        ionizable groups, a group with reactivity to bind covalently to
        substrate, or a arrangement of atoms forming coordinate bonds with a
        metal (
        <b>mordant</b>
        ). Auxochromic functions in molecules include the
        <i>basic</i>
        auxochromes: all amines, primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary of
        which the first three are ionizable. Basic dyes are also
        <b>cationic</b>
        when positively charged. The
        <i>acidic</i>
        auxochromes include those with sulfonic, carboxylic, and phenolic
        (-Ar-OH ↓ -Ar-O
        <sup>−</sup>
        + H
        <sup>+</sup>
        ). Sulfonic groups are usually always ionized at all pH values.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Reactive auxochromes</b>
        create covalent bonds. The most important class of reactive auxochromes
        are the halogenated triazinyl, such as dichlorotriazinyl (see figure
        below) derived from cyanuric chloride. The auxochromes are attached to a
        nitrogen atom on the chromogen. The di- and monochlorotriazinyls react
        with nucleophiles (-OH and -NH
        <sub>2</sub>
        groups) under slightly alkaline conditions.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <img
          src="imagesHistoHTML/dichlorotriazinyl.gif"
          alt="dichlorotriazinyl structure"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fluorescent dyes</b>
        . Fluorescence is conferred by several required structural features,
        including extensive π-bond conjugation, with the best being cyclic
        (aromatic) and a rigid planarity, typically true of ring structures.
        Fluorescence is increased by certain substituents (-OH, -OCH
        <sub>3</sub>
        , -F, -CN, -NH
        <sub>2</sub>
        , -NHCH
        <sub>3</sub>
        and -N(CH
        <sub>3</sub>
        )
        <sub>2</sub>
        and reduced by -C(=O)-, -COOH, -Cl, -Br, -NO
        <sub>2</sub>
        , or -SO
        <sub>3</sub>
        H. Alkyl chains have no effect unless they alter a planar conformation.
        Not all assumptions are valid: salicylic acid is fluorescent although a
        carboxylic group is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        When auxochromes interact with substrate, all bond chemistries apply:
        H-bonding, hydrophobic, van der Waals (London dispersion),
        electrostatic.
      </p>
      <h3>Nomenclature &amp; Classification</h3>
      Because the chemical names of many dyes are too long, trivial or informal
      names are given to them.
      <p>
        The
        <i>Colour Index</i>
        (in 3rd Ed, 1971, and supplements) is published by the Society of Dyers
        and Colourists, which give
        <b>CI numbers</b>
        to identify and designate dyes/stains. Some dyes require certification
        or standardization for use in histological/biological staining.
      </p>
      <p>Many dyes are classified by application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Basic dyes. Used a lot on proteinaceous and cellulosic fibers
          mordanted with tannic acid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acid dyes. Have sulfonic and carboyxlic auxochromes, although many are
          amphoteric (have amine groups). In textiles used to stain
          proteinaceous fibers (silk, wool). Usually stain cytoplasm and
          extracellular structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Direct dyes. Nearly all are azo dyes, being anionic with large
          molecules. Bind to cellulose directly without mordants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mordant dyes. By definition metal ions are used in the staining
          process. The mordant may be applied prior to the chromophore, with it
          as a complex (metachrome), or after (after-chrome).
        </li>
        <li>Reactive dyes. Combine covalently with the substrate.</li>
        <li>
          Solvent dyes. Chromophore that are not water soluble but hydrophobic
          and embed in hydrophobic layers. Also called
          <b>lysochromes</b>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          Vat dyes. Important only in textile industry. These dyes are applied
          in colorless (
          <q>leuco</q>
          ) form and then an oxidizing treatment (air, steam) is done to produce
          color and insolubility (fixation). The classic application is indigo
          staining of cotton. Has no basis in histochemistry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sulfur dyes. A process involving heating various organics with sulfur
          or alkali metal polysulfides. This usually causes reduction of a leuco
          compound to a color form. No purpose in histology.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Dyes Classed By Chromophoric System</h3>

      <h4>Nitroso Dyes</h4>
      Nitrous acid (HNO
      <sub>2</sub>
      ) reacts with phenols to produce nitrosophenols, creating an aromatic
      substitution
      <i>ortho</i>
      and
      <i>para</i>
      to the phenol group. The
      <i>ortho</i>
      product can form colored chelates with metal ions and be mordant dyes.
      They are not really used in histology but have properties that might be
      exploited.

          alt="nitroso dye structure"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        The naphthol greens are representative. Naphthol green Y treated with
        alkaline ferrous solution forms naphthol green B, which can be a
        collagen stain in mixture of anionic dyes.
      </p>

          alt="nitroso dyes: naphthol greens"
        />
      </p>
      <h4>Nitro Dyes</h4>
      These are dyes with an -NO
      <sub>2</sub>
      group. Picric acid is a yellow anionic dye, forming additional compounds
      as charge-transfer complexes, with bonding neither ionic or covalent. It
      is also a fixative, soluble in water (to 1.3%) and more so in alcohol and
      aromatric hydrocarbons. Xylene does not clear it.

          src="imagesHistoHTML/picric-acid.gif"
          alt="nitro dyes: picric acid"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Martius yellow is more deeply colored (approaching orange), more soluble
        in water and less so in alcohol. It is used as cytoplasmic stain in
        conjunction with other anionic dyes. Related in
        <b>flavianic acid</b>
        used as a precipitant for arginine. The flavianic acid sodium salt is
        <b>naphthol yellow S</b>
        (CI 10316).
      </p>
      <p align="center">

          src="imagesHistoHTML/martius-yellow.gif"
          alt="nitro dyes: Martius yellow"
        />
      </p>
      <h4>Azo Dyes</h4>
      This is a huge class of dyes useful in industry and biology. The process
      starts by the oxidation of anilines (primary aromatic amines) with nitrous
      acid in an acidic solution at near-freezing temperatures:
      <p align="center">
        <img src="imagesHistoHTML/azo-synthesis.gif" alt="Azo synthesis" />
      </p>
      <p>
        The diazonium salt above is formed and usually used immediately since
        its stability varies. Excess nitrous acid can be eliminated using urea
        (nicely forms nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases and water). The
        diazonium salt is coupled to phenols and amines, preferentially in the
        para position but the ortho is possible if another substituent is at the
        para position. The synthesis for
        <b>oil yellow II</b>
        is shown below. The product is the well known carcinogen
        <q>butter yellow</q>
        , insoluble in water and not a histological dye. Adding a sulfonic acid
        group para to the aniline converted to the diazonium makes it water
        soluble: that product is
        <b>methyl orange</b>
        (CI 13025, Acid orange 52), which is an acid-base indicator and not a
        dye.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <img
          src="imagesHistoHTML/oil-yellow-synthesis.gif"
          alt="Oil yellow synthesis"
        />
      </p>

        Note that reaction of diazoniums with phenols and amines follows a
        narrow pH. The pH must be made alkaline to improve the reactivity of
        phenols (which react as their more nucleophilic anions) and amines
        (which react as the unprotonated nucleophile), but if too alkaline, the
        diazonium is converted to a diazotate anion (Ar-N=N-O
        <sup>−</sup>
        ). A more alkaline pH would be required than with amines. Azo dyes can
        be produced by reactions of quinones with aryl hydrazines, but are
        always manufactured by diazonium salt coupling reactions.

        The N=N double bond can exist in a
        <i>trans</i>
        or a
        <i>cis</i>
        configuration. The
        <i>trans</i>
        is more usual because of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between an azo
        nitrogen atom and some atom in a group
        <i>ortho</i>
        to one of the aromatic rings. Phenolic azo dyes will exist in a
        tautomeric equilibrium between the hydroxyazo form and a hydrazone
        (quinonoid) form. Amino azo dyes however occur only in aminoazo form
        because of hydrogen bonding.

        <b>Direct Azo dyes.</b>
        These color cellulosic fibers quite well without use of mordants or
        reactive auxochromic functions. The only functional group on cellulose
        are (unionized) hydroxyls, so ionic auxochromes are not helpful. These
        dyes are anionic with most having dis- and trisazo functions, with a
        mixture of phenyl and napthyl rings. In aqueous solution the molecules
        aggregate at room temperature because of their many aromatic rings
        stacking on each other; this stacking does not occur at 90-100° at which
        they are applied to textiles. Dye binding to textiles is believed to be
        an interaction with H atoms of the cellulose hydroxyal and the
        π-electrons in the rings. Some of these dyes are used for histological
        work, especially for amyloid, fibrin, and elastin. In general, because
        these are anionic dyes, their use for that purpose is recommended.

      All of these dyes are cationic or anionic as a net charge, with either
      chloride or sodium counterions.
      <p>
        Note that dyes sold as
        <q>methyl green</q>
        are always ethyl green. The methyl green dye is used in methyl
        green-pyronine for nucle acid stain. Older samples of methyl green are
        likely to contain crystal violet because one of the alkyl groups
        detaches easily on the quaternary nitrogen.

        very well. Oxidants commonly used are sodium iodate, mercuric oxide, and
        potassium permanganate. Peroxides, perchlorates, and ferric salts are
        also used. This process is called "ripening."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hematein complexes with some metals such as aluminum, iron, and
        chromium. With aluminum, it forms hemalum which binds to anionic groups,
        particularly polyanions like DNA/RNA, and to acid polysaccharides and
        proteins. The metal in hemalum alters the color properties of the dye,
        making it red at acidic pH and turning blue as the acid is washed away.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hemalum becomes more selective when the acid and alum concentrations
        are higher relative to hematein. A more pure nuclear stain is obtained
        with excess of acid or excess of alum. Techniques for increasing
        selectivity are divided in two classes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Progressive</b>
          staining involves adding the right amount of acid (if any) and alum to
          begin with, and staining for the proper period
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Differentiation</b>
          selectively washes (de-stains) an overstained specimen, but even with
          the same technician and technique, the same specimen can have a
          different appearance. This is sometimes an acceptable outcome
        </li>
      </ol>
      Differentiation is often done with weakly acidic solutions. The progress
      of differentiation is usually followed microscopically, and certain
      tissues (spleen, thymus) requires more differentiation than others (liver,
      kidney). Because hemalum is an ionic molecule, the presence of metals that
      ionically mask (Al
      <sup>3+</sup>
      , K
      <sup>+</sup>
      , NH
      <sub>4</sub>
      <sup>+</sup>
      ) or of solvents that inhibit ionization (alcohol, glycerol) can alter
      dye-binding efficiency.
      <p>
        Mayer's hemalum is good for autopsy tissues, selective for chromatin,
        staining nuclei and leaving no cytoplasmic staining. 1.0 g hematoxylin
        crystals are dissolved by boiling in close to a liter of water. After
        removing from heat, add precisely 0.2 g sodium iodate (NaIO
        <sub>3</sub>
        ) and leave to ripen 10 min. Ammonium or potassium alum (50 g) is then
        dissolved completely. This is then followed by 1.0 g citric acid. A
        reddish-violet colored solution is obtained. The addition of 50 g
        chloral hydrate is optional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eosin and phloxine are synthetic xanthene (hydroxyxanthenes or
        fluorones) with rapid penetration into compact tissues, less so in
        permeable collagens. Eosin is an anionic dye and therefore binds to
        cationic groups typically seen in the cytoplasm. The acidic dye binds to
        basic groups (histidine, lysine, arginine). A weak base (dilute ammonium
        hydroxide) or alcohol can be used to differentiate it after
        overstaining. Eosin-Phloxine is made from stock Eosin Y and stock
        Phloxine. Stock Eosin Y is made by dissolving 1.0 g eosin in 100.0 ml
        water by heating, then when it is cool, adding 300.0 ml of 95% ethanol.
        Stock Phloxine is made by dissolving (perhaps with heating) 1.0 g
        phloxine in 100 ml water, then added 300 ml 95% ethanol. To make a
        working Eosin-Phloxine solution, add 50 ml phloxine stock to 450 ml
        eosin stock, then add 1.0 ml glacial acetic acid. Lillie's variant on
        the Mayer's hemalum is a variant that is rapid staining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harris' hemalum requires use of acid washing to get the desired
        intensity (regressive staining). The tissue is separated from the dye by
        a mordant, and the differentiation may remove the dye itself or the dye
        and mordant. Dissolve 5 g hematoxylin crystals in 50 ml absolute
        ethanol, and dissolve 100 g of ammonium or potassium alum in 1.0 liter
        water with heating. Remove from heat and combine the solutions. Bring to
        boil now as rapidly as possible, but limit heat to less than 1 min, with
        frequent stirring. Remove from the heat, and slowly add 2.5 g mercuric
        oxide (or 0.37 g or 3.7 ml of 10% sodium iodate). Re-heat to simmering
        until a violet color is seen, the remove and plunge vessel in ice-water
        basin until cool. Filter the stain before it is used. Adding 2-4 ml of
        glacial acetic acid per 100 ml of dye increases the precision of the
        nuclear stain and eliminates a need for differentiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other mordants can be used with hematein as well. Pb, Cu, W, Fe, Cr, and
        Mo have all been tried. These salts are used as their potassium or
        ammonium sulfate forms (alums), but chlorides have also been used. The
        mordant-dye combination can create a “lake” in which an insoluble
        deposit is formed. Phenolic dyes are those that can chelate the metals.
        Dyes that promote lake formation usually have second chelating group in
        the ortho position on the ring (-COOH or -OH).
      </p>
      <p>
        Chrome alums, like iron alums, make use of a trivalent metal as the
        mordant. Iron alums give a violet color, while chrome alums stain nuclei
        blue-black.

        Alcoholic fixation (such as Carnoy) is preferred since Zenker and
        unbuffered formalin fixation generally removes alkali-soluble calcium
        deposits. Alkaline alizarin red staining is suitable for soft tissue
        calcification for both soluble (pH 9) and insoluble (pH 7) calcium
        deposits. Use pH 4 stain for bone and hard deposits. A 0.5% pH 9
        solution can be made up with a 1-2 ml of 1% NaOH. Alizarin pH 7 is
        typically made up in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. 0.5% Alizarin Red S pH 4 is
        made up straight. Note that calcium salts stain an intense red and
        orange to yellow-red. Cytoplasm should be unstained, but batches of dye
        with by-product impurities impart a yellow color. Counterstaining is not
        recommended with this step. Alizarin is an anthroquinone that forms
        salts with calcium, and is metachromatic from pH 3.7 to 5.2.
        Calcification involves the deposition of soluble forms of calcium
        phosphate that become crystalline apatite-like formation that is less
        soluble. Below pH 8.5, these can solubilize (esp. during
        fixation/staining).

      <p>
        Results showed that 10-15 s brief exposure counterstains the surface,
        but 30 s to 2 min is necessary to see cytoarchitecture. As far as
        working solutions, 0.025% produced an optimal level of staining which
        kept background fluorescence to a minimum. Above 0.05% background
        fluorescence was unacceptable. Better results were seen with DiO and
        Di-ASP dyes, although DiI results were good.
      </p>
      <h3>Iodine Solutions</h3>
      Gram's Iodine is 1 g iodine and 2 g potassium iodide dissolved in 300 ml
      quality water (another source says it is 1% iodine in 2% potassium
      iodide).
      <p>
        Lugol's iodine is 6% iodine in 4% KI. It has been used to fix a variety
        of cells: invertebrate blood cells, protozoa, animal and plant tissues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Langeron's iodine is more concentrated: it is 1 g iodine, 2 g KI, but
        both dissolved in 200 ml water. Lugol's iodine is 3-fold Gram's:
        dissolved in 100 ml water.
      </p>
      <h3>Saturated Picric Acid</h3>
      Take approximately 90 g picric acid crystals and add it to 4 L of 95%
      ethanol and mix well.

      <h3>Perl's Reagent (for Prussian Blue Staining)</h3>
      This is used for iron (specifically
      <b>ferric</b>
      , Fe
      <sup>3+</sup>
      )-containing tissues or cells. Ferrous (Fe
      <sup>2+</sup>
      ) will produce no colored product.
      <p>
        Perl's reagent is an acidified potassium
        <i>ferro</i>
        cyanide [K
        <sub>4</sub>
        Fe(CN)
        <sub>6</sub>
        ] solution that is used to produce the following reaction:
      </p>
      <p class="eqn">
        FeCl
        <sub>3</sub>
        + K
        <sub>4</sub>
        Fe(CN)
        <sub>6</sub>
        --&gt; K-Fe-Fe(CN)
        <sub>6</sub>
        + 3 KCl
      </p>
      <p>
        The potassium ferri-ferrocyanide complex is very water-insoluble (it
        precipitates) and has a color known as Prussian blue. If ferric (Fe
        <sup>3+</sup>
        ) ions are present (bound to tissues, for example), the hydrochloric
        acid presence leaches them out to produce the FeCl
        <sub>3</sub>
        reactant. Perl originally did the method in two steps, first the acid
        release and then added the ferrocyanide. While the single mix method
        works in routine analyses, if there are heavy amounts of ferric ion
        (especially hemosiderin), it helps to do the two-step method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because interpretation can be difficult, a positive control is useful if
        it is available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fixation is good with neutral-buffered formalin. Acidic and dichromate
        fixatives and acidic decalcification solutions should be avoided since
        they can cause leaching and loss of ferric ions, making a negative
        result likely.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Reagents</b>
        .
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>4% (v/v) HCl stock.</li>
        <li>Potassium ferrocyanide: 2% (w/v) stock.</li>
        <li>
          Working acidified potassium ferrocyanide: equal volumes of 4% HCl and
          2% potassium ferrocyanide, which should be each half the volume of the
          total volume required. Prepare just before use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Neutral red. 1% dye in 1% (v/v) acetic acid (add acid after dissolving
          first in water).
        </li>
      </ul>
      Make sure all reagents are filtered. Note that a great many recipes for
      preparing Perl's reagent vary the concentration of the acid and the
      ferrocyanide.

      <ol>
        <li>
          After fixing (buffered formalin good), rinse well in distilled water
        </li>
        <li>
          Flood with equal parts of ferrocyanide and HCl and leave for 10 min.
        </li>
        <li>Wash several times with distilled water over a 5 min period</li>
        <li>Counterstain with filtered neutral red for 1 min</li>
        <li>
          Rinse in water. Dip in absolute EtOH to rapidly dehydrate, let clear,
          then mount.
        </li>
      </ol>

      Several colors may be present. Where deep blue is found, ferric salts were
      present. Nuclei will appear red in color. Erythocytes typically have a
      yellow color. Asbestos bodies are blue and black.

      <h3>Diaminobenzidine (DAB)</h3>
      DAB (diaminobenzide: (3,3'-diaminobenzidine 4HCl) will oxidize in presence
      of H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      , although slowly (more quickly with peroxidase). The presence of nickel
      or cobalt salts can produce a greater darkness (blue-black instead of
      brown) polymers; nickel is more popular.
      <p>
        DAB is thought to be a
        <b>carcinogen</b>
        : wear gloves when handling it. DAB should be treated with acidified
        KMnO
        <sub>4</sub>
        before disposing of it in the sink. Detoxification is done by making up
        0.2 M KMnO
        <sub>4</sub>
        and 2.0 M sulfuric acid stocks, diluting the DAB to not greater than 0.9
        mg/ml, then for each 10 ml, add 5 ml each of the KMnO
        <sub>4</sub>
        and sulfuric acid stocks and let sit for 10 h.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before using a peroxidase-based conversion of DAB into its precipitate,
        it is useful to pretreat cells or tissues with 3% hydrogen peroxide for
        10-20 min to eliminate endogenous peroxidases first.
      </p>
      <h4>Use of DAB in Photoconversion of Fluorescent Dyes/Stains</h4>
      When a fluorophore is unstable or will be lost over time, it is useful to
      exploit the finding that fluorophores can be used in the photo-oxidation
      of DAB into an insolube form, replacing the fading fluorophore with
      insoluble DAB product.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Rinse the affected area in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.2 to start, and blot away
          excess.
        </li>
        <li>Place one drop containing 1.5 mg DAB/ml (0.15%) in Tris buffer.</li>
        <li>
          Use the filter set that achieves the brightest fluorescence and
          position field on the slide that is to get the photoconversion. A
          lower objective will give a wider field, so consider this.
        </li>
        <li>
          Replace with fresh DAB (on ice) every 10 min. Reaction usually
          complete in 20-40 min, but monitor the reaction under visible light to
          make sure the photo conversion is occurring.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rinse in Tris buffer at end, then continue processing with other
          stains or mounting.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Mounting Products</h2>

      <h3>Crystal Mount</h3>
      Crystal Mount is originally a product of Biomeda, Inc. (company no longer
      exists) now sold by Sigma (Cat #C0612). It is a water soluble material
      that when it dries protects the specimen from dust. 30 ml will be useful
      for some 50 slides.

      <ol>
        <li>
          To cover the area about the size of a quarter, apply 3 drops of
          Crystal Mount.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rotate the slide/surface angled so that the precession spreads the
          solution about the size of a quarter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drying/curing is done in 1-2 h at 20-37°, or it can be done in 30 min
          in a 40-50° oven. For fluorophores a 60-70° oven can be used for 20
          min.
        </li>
      </ol>
      Never apply oil directly on Crystal Mount. Since it is water-soluble,
      apply water and swirl it around. It may take several rinses and some time
      to solubilize and remove all the mounting medium.
      <p>
        Alternatives to Crystal Mount include Clear Mount.
