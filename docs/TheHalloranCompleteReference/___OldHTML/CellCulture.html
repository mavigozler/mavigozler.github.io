The sections below concern many aspects of cell and tissue culture.

<h2>Tissue Culture Supplies and Consumables</h2>
<p>
There are many manufacturers of tissue culture plastic consumables.
The size (diameter, area) of wells and dishes are generally standardized
however.  The following table shows the diameters and areas of multi-well
plates:

<h3>Proprietary Substrate Surfaces</h3>
<p>
Manufacturers often feature a product line of TC plastic with a substratum
that is <q>modified</q> or <q>enhanced,</q> and the nature
of the modified surface is <q>propietary,</q> meaning that it might
be a trade secret.  Alternatively, its molecular structure is revealed,
but the manufacturing process is a trade secret.  Usually because of
a patent, no other manufacturer may produce TC plastic with such features
anyway.
<p>
Cultured cell types will not grow on every kind of surface however.
Read the product catalog to identify which cell types have been shown
to grow well&mdash;probably without the addition of serum!&mdash;and consider
whether your cell type might not also grow or maintain on such a surface.
Ask for a free sample of the plastic before buying a whole case, telling
customer support what sort of cell type you have.  They may want to
collaborate in some way.

<h2 id="practices">Tissue Culture Practices:
Conserving Resources and Keeping Material Costs Low</h2>
<p>
Dr. Vulliet says that materials/supplies costs on grants do not even amount to 
more than 15-20% of a grant application.  He will tell you that labor costs 80% 
of a grant, and so cost-effectiveness in grant management would be for the head 
of laboratory to make sure his postdocs, graduate students, and techs are 
thinking and working efficiently in laboratory experimentation, rather than 
fretting about consumables.  Dr. Vulliet makes the vitally important point:  if 
an extra pipet for a single use meant possibly reducing the risk of a 
contamination that might ruin, say, 8 or more man-hours of work, then one has 
spent 20&cent; on an extra pipet to save perhaps $100 in salary time and overall 
material use.  Moreover, one is that much closer to the thing that brings in 
grants:  publishable experimental results.
<p>
Of course, with especially critical work, and when much time and effort has been 
spent in an experiment, most of us do not get stressed about a possibly wasteful 
use of materials.
<p>
But it is possible to get into certain good habits that do not impose a higher 
risk of significant loss of time and effort due to contamination, while helping 
both the environment and the laboratory budget because of reduced use of 
materials.

<h3>Changing Media in Flasks</h3>
<p>
Some people use a disposable pipet to remove the old media from flasks, then 
they have to use a second pipet to transfer in the new media.  However, 
experience shows that one only need pour out the old media into a waste 
container rather than use a pipet to remove it.  There is apparently a needless 
fear that media collects around the lip of the container opening and can serve 
as place for biological contamination.

<h3>Pipetting from cleaner to <q>dirtier</q></h3>
<p>
There are other ways to minimize the use of sterile disposable pipets.
Before opening the wrapper on the pipet, think about how it can be employed
in <em>multiple</em> ways before being tossed in the waste.
<p>
Suppose you have to prepare some solutions and cell suspensions, and that you 
will be pipetting balanced salts solutions (HBSS), complete (serum-containing) 
medium, and solutions containing cell suspensions. It is possible to make use of 
a single pipet (say a 10 ml pipet) by first pipetting all your salts solutions 
first without the pipet making contact with anything <em>but</em> the salts 
solutions, then pipetting media without the same pipet contacting anything but 
the media, and then pipetting cells in suspension so as to distribute them to 
containers or prepare dilutions, all by using a single pipet.  In fact, when 
making dilutions, always pipet in the solution in which the cells will be 
diluted first, then transfer the cells.  If you were to transfer the cells first 
to an empty container, you would have to use a second pipet to add the diluent, 
and you would not be economizing.
<p>
See the next section for complete examples in which the number and type
of pipets are counted and use in a best and worst case of materials use.

<h3>Complete Examples of Minimizing Materials Use</h3>

<h4>Preparing Complete Medium</h4>
<p>
Preparation of medium is quite a common practice.  For the bone marrow
cells, concentrated stocks of supplements, namely serum, glutamine,
and antibiotics are routinely added to commercially prepared essential
medium.  In a maximal materials use scenario, a pipet selected for
the appropriate volumetric capacity would be used for each concentrated
stock.  For glutamine and antibiotics, pipetted at 5 or 6 ml, that would
be either a 5 or 10 ml pipet.  For serum, usually aliquotted to 50 ml
with the entire aliquot in the container used, that would be a 25 ml pipet
(perhaps a less commonly used 50 ml pipet).  This would be three pipets.
<p>
It is possible to use only a single 10 ml pipet however.  This is certainly
no problem if the entire contents of the concentrated stock for each
solution are to be used up and the containers discarded, since there
is no anxiety about cross-contamination.
<p>
But if only a part of the whole aliquot/volume of the concentrated stock is to 
be used, and this is shared by others, or there is some concern for 
cross-contamination, it is possible to use a single pipet but select which stock 
is pipetted first.  This follows the <q>from cleaner to dirtier</q> rule.  For 
example, are you more worried about antibiotics in your glutamine stock than 
glutamine in your antibiotics stock?  This would be the case if, in the future, 
you wanted to make antibiotics-free medium supplemented with glutamine and 
serum.  Then if you are to use a single 10 ml pipet, pipet <em>first</em> from 
the glutamine stock, then from the antibiotics stock.

<p>
And suppose you wanted to make serum-free medium in the future (a likely 
possibility), and all the media you would ever make always contains glutamine 
and antibiotics supplements.  In this case, you can use a single pipet first to 
pipet glutamine, then the antibiotics, and then the serum. Note that with a 10 
ml pipet, which has about a 13 ml marked capacity, you would have to pipet about 
4 times to get 50 ml, but that is not so onerous or time-consuming, and the 
benefit is conserved resources and reduced costs.

<p>
Hence in a maximal use scenario, three pipets are used to transfer the
required volumes of three concentrated stocks to the media bottle.
In a minimal use scenario, a single 10 ml pipet can be conveniently used
without adverse affects on cell cultures.

<h4>Media Change</h4>
<p>
In this situation flasks containing adherent cells are emptied of the old medium 
when it is time to do so, and given fresh medium.
<p>
Some people are wary of the risk of contamination involved with pouring out 
medium and getting the lip of the opening wet with medium, which might allow 
growth of contaminating organisms.  Hence they use a pipet to remove the old 
medium, then a fresh pipet to add fresh medium.
<p>
However in most if not all cases, it is possible to eliminate all pipets used to 
remove old media, and to pour them out from their containers directly.  Save the 
pipet.
<p>
One might ask that, if it is not a problem to pour out old medium, why
not save even the one more pipet (using <em>no</em> pipets) and pour
in fresh medium?
<p>
There are several reasons why one should not do this:
<ul>
<li>Flask necks (openings) are quite narrow, and it is difficult to
pour fluids into narrower openings, especially from containers with
wider necks (openings), which are typically of stock media containers.
<li>Pouring gives less control of the stream entering the flask or container
of cells.  The stream should not be poured directly on to the surface
to which the cells are adhering, for the cells getting the force of
the stream can detach.  Hence use of a pipet allows one to control the force
of the flow and to direct the stream toward a surface or part of the
container least likely to result in cell detachment.
<li>Dishes and wells have no volumetric markings to indicate the volume
of medium being received.  The markings on flasks are also not accurate
at the typical small volumes transferred for cultured cells.  Hence
use of the pipet gives much more precise control of the volume pipetted.
This also goes a long way in the conservation of another material resource,
namely the medium.
</ul>
<p>
Therefore in a maximal use case of changing medium, two pipets are used.
In a minimal use case, only one is used.

<h4>Subculturing</h4>
<p>
If one knows that cells are confluent and wants to subculture to a fraction of 
confluence (rather than inoculate a flask with a known count/concentration of 
cells, see next section), then subculturing is as simple as using a very minimal 
amount of detaching medium (trypsin and/or metal chelator), adding a small 
amount of medium and/or Hanks, and then transferring a fraction of that to a new 
flask containing the bulk of the old medium, or removing a fraction from the old 
flask and re-using the old flask.  Consider a couple of examples.
<p>
Suppose a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask contains 100% confluent cells,
and a new flask will be seeded at 10% confluence.  About 2-3 ml of
detaching medium is added, and the proper time is allowed for all
cell-to-plastic and all cell-to-cell contact to occur.  Assuming
20 ml medium fills a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask, then the following is done
in order:
<ol>
<li>Pour&mdash;do not pipet&mdash;out the old media from the flask of
cells to be subcultured.
<li>Take a sterile plastic 5 ml pipet, and add 5 or 10 ml of HBSS,
wash the cells, and pour out.
<li>With the same pipet, add a minimal amount of detaching medium
(usually not more than 2-3 ml for a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask).
<li>Get a new 5 ml pipet (unless you consider a detachment medium-used
pipet not too dirty for putting back into HBSS), and add 5 ml of
HBSS to the old flask with cells without touching the pipet
to the flask.
<li>With the same pipet, add 20 (for the more exacting, 19.5) ml
culture medium to a new 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask;
these pipets contain overflow markings, so
it can be done in 3 instead of 4 pipettings.
<li>Now take the 5 ml pipet into the flask with cells, mix well with
the pipet, and transfer 0.5 ml to the new flask.
<li>Mix the cells in the new flask well and set in the incubator.
</ol>

<p>
This used only a single 5 ml pipet and new 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.
Novices would have used 3 or more differently sized pipets.
<p>
If one is re-using the flask (possible for many cell types), the
following steps might be considered:

<ol>
<li>Pour out the old media.
<li>Use a 5 ml pipet to add a minimal volume of detachment medium, and wait for 
the production of suspended, unclumped cells to occur.
<li>Pour (or get a new 5 or 10 ml pipet), and add a volume of HBSS (or growth 
medium, depending on the fraction of cells to be recovered) that equals the 
total pipet volume less volume of detachment medium added. You may want to spike 
the HBSS with 5-10% of your serum to inhibit trypsin, if it is in the detachment 
medium, but often diluting it is sufficient to negate adverse effects of the 
continued action of trypsin.
<li>If cells are to be counted, add a drop from the well-mixed cell suspension 
to a small tube (0.5 ml conical microtube, sterility is not important), and 
count the cells in a hemocytometer using the usual method.
<li>Remove all but the volume representing the fraction of suspended cells to 
remain for re-seeding in the old flask.  For example, if there is 10 ml of 
suspended cells, and 5% of the total cells are to remain for re-seeding, remove 
9.5 ml of the suspension and discard.
<li>If a more than 20% of the cells are to be recovered for subculturing, then 
the use of HBSS as a dilution medium is unwise, and especially if cells are not 
to be counted, but subculturing is done instead as a fraction of confluence. 
Instead, add growth medium itself to prepare the suspension, and remove the 
fraction of cells not to be subcultured.  To limit the waste of growth medium, 
keep the total volume added lower than you might use in HBSS added for cell 
counting:  add just enough for accurate pipetting.  In general using a 5 ml 
pipet allows accurate pipetting to &plusmn; 0.1-0.2 ml, so if you want to keep 
20% of the cells for subculturing, and 3 ml of detachment medium was added, add 
3 ml of growth medium, mix the cell suspension well, and then remove 4.8 ml of 
the suspension, done quite accurately with a 5 ml pipet.
<li>Get a new pipet and add enough growth medium to fill the flask to its 
appropriate volume, and place the suspension in the incubator. Grow/expand the 
cells as usual.
</ol>

<p>
In this last procedure you have used two, at most three, disposable pipets,
and whatever materials you normally use for cell counting.

<h4>From Flasks to Wells in Plates with Cell Counting</h4>
<p>
It is common when planning treatments of cultured cells to take cells being 
grown in flasks and to seed them in multi-well dishes at a certain count of 
cells per unit area (per square centimeter) of the well. Here is a suggested 
approach for minimizing the use of materials in doing that:

<ol>
<li>Pour out the medium to waste, and use an appropriate pipet to add detachment 
solution.  Wait for the appropriate time and provide the appropriate conditions 
for producing single cell suspensions in the detachment process.  Do not discard 
the pipet (keep it in the pipettor).
<li>Pipet the cell suspension into an appropriate conical spin tube (15 or 50 ml 
tube) and spin appropriately (avoid using too many gravities and too long a 
time, a commonly wrong practice).  Again, do not discard the pipet (it is wise 
to hold on to a pipet until you are certain you need a new/clean one).
<li>Either pour off, or use the pipet you have (probably better, since cell 
pellet packing is not tight&mdash;nor should it be!!!&mdash;and unpredictable) 
to remove the supernatant.  Discard the pipet.
<li>With a new pipet, add enough HBSS to provide the correct volume estimated 
for getting good cell counts.  A cell suspension too concentrated and too 
dilute&mdash;especially too concentrated!&mdash;gives inaccurate counts.  You 
generally want at least 25 and no more than 400 cells in a quarter grid of the 
hemocytometer, representing a range of about 250,000 to 4 million cells per 
milliliter (but cell size can alter that factor up or down).  Add a drop from 
the well-mixed cell suspension to the tube to be used for preparing dilutions 
for counts (if trypan-blue is to be added, for example).  Do not discard the 
pipet.
<li>When the count is complete and the calculations done, then it is time to 
make adjustments.  Make sure that you are aware of certain <a 
href="#rules">rules</a> when planning distribution of cells to the multi-well 
plates or to dishes.  If making dilutions, use a single appropriate pipet to 
fill up containers with the appropriate volume of any diluent medium, and then 
use the pipet to take a volume from the cell suspension, and move it from 
container to container in a serial dilution process, always using the same 
pipet.  If you use single-tube serial dilution process, you need to remove the 
fraction of medium to be discarded, and then use a new pipet to add diluent 
medium;  you could alternatively pour in dilution medium to a volumetric mark on 
the tube, but pouring in medium requires a steady hand not to overshoot the 
mark, and this should not be done when cell counts per unit volume are critical 
at the lower densities. For example, some studies actually want no more than 
5-10 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, which means for a 6-well dish (10 cm<sup>2</sup> per 
well), no more than 50-100 cells per well can be added, and that 50-100 cells/ml 
will be necessary if 1 ml is added to the well (followed by 2 ml plain medium), 
or 17-33 cells/ml if 3 ml is added (the typical volume of a well in a 6-well 
dish).  Here the balance here is the use of more tubes or pipets.  Depending on 
the tube used, pipets usually run more cheaply (even individually wrapped 
sterile ones).
<li>If it is decided that plates will get a volume of cell suspension followed 
by a volume of an additional medium to bring them up to capacity, or to mix in a 
treatment medium not added directly to cell suspensions, then pipet out plain 
medium first to wells, then either treatment medium or cells.  Always work from 
the medium to which all cells would be exposed to the pipetting of cells that 
would be exposed to the previous medium (the clean-to-dirty rule).  Use a new 
pipet whenever there is doubt. Never give a higher priority to minimizing 
pipet/container use when there is the possibility of ruining an experiment.
</ol>
<p>
As always, the minimization of your material use must be balanced against the 
cost in time lost and in labor/salaries when minimizing material use puts too 
much of a risk for contamination.  This can only be learned through experience 
in culturing in general, and through culturing specific cell types.

<h2 id="rules">Rules To Live By In Culturing</h2>
<p>
This is one person's opinion about rules to live by when culturing or preparing 
cells for treatment or other experiments:

<ul>
<li>Never increase the number of variables in an experiment which can increase 
the error, uncertainty, or doubt about the resulting data. For example, if you 
calculate that you need 100 ml of cells at 20,000 cells per milliliter to 
distribute to the wells of plates, prepare a single volume of 100 ml of cells at 
that concentration.  Do not prepare a 50 ml suspension, and then another 50 ml 
suspension (either by design or by the realization that a mistake was made and 
you need more).  This adds unwanted variation and shows poor planning.  Use a 
large flask, which can take as much as 500 ml of a cell suspension, if 
necessary, but rarely do well-planned experiments require that much.
<li>Never take on more than can be managed, especially if treatments are 
measured in minutes instead of hours or days.  Plan the count of replicates and 
treatments (dose or time inputs) to a manageable level.  If there are multiple 
variables to be tested, do each variable in a single experiment rather than all 
of them in a single experiment (if possible).  With each experiment, one can 
determine the optimal treatment, and then proceed to the next variable in a 
subsequent experiment.
<li>Walk through in your mind, i.e. imagine, the steps you will take in the 
culture room before you do them.  Scratch them done in an ordered numerical list 
of steps to take.  You may not think of everything by this process, but then 
again, you might.
<li>If you have to dilute by a few orders of magntiude (that is, you find you 
have 20 million cells and you only need 20,000 cells total), then there are 
several approaches you can take.  One is to do serial log dilutions within the 
tube of cells (i.e. bring it up to 5 or 10 ml, then remove 4.5 or 9 ml, 
respectively and discard, and repeat the process), or the other is to do 
dilutions by serial transfers (i.e., prepare a series of tubes with 9 or 4.5 ml 
of diluent medium, and then transfer 1 or 0.5 ml from tube to tube after 
mixing).
<li>If you find that want to freeze and/or subculture the balance of cells that 
you will not use in the multi-well plates, do those things last rather than 
first:  the multi-well plate inoculations represent your experiments most 
likely, and thus should be given a higher priority. Cells are hardy enough to 
sit while you do the pipetting.  Do freezing and/or subculturing ahead of 
multi-well plate seeding only if you have experience that delaying freezing 
and/or subculturing seriously reduces viability.
 </ul>

<h2 id="subculture">Subculturing Cells:  General Techniques</h2>
<p>
The method details involved in the <q>passaging</q> or subculturing of cells 
will vary from one cell type to another.  Each cell that adheres to a culture 
substrate varies in its ability to be unbound or forcibly removed from its 
substratum.  The particular method for your cell type will depend much upon 
gaining experience with how the cells behave in culture.

<h3>Detachment of Cultured Cells by Trypsin/EDTA</h3>
<p>
Cultured rat bone marrow cells are rather typical in their ability to be 
detached as cells adhering to uncoated tissue culture plastic. The cells make 
use of trypsin/EDTA solutions that are generally ready-made commercially.  The 
time required for detachment depends somewhat on the passage number as well as 
how confluent or overgrown the cells may be. Early passage cells tend to form 
bipolar-shaped cells that orient themselves in axes that are described as 
"swirling," where as later passage cells tend to look more stellate, broad and 
flat.  Early passage cells detach more quickly, while later passage cells are 
more resistant (require a longer time).

<ol>
<li>If your purpose in detaching cells is to freeze (cryopreserve) them, then 
cells should be healthy.  This means that they have not been sitting in media 
that should have been changed days ago.  Cells weakened by improper feeding are 
more likely to revitalize (thaw from cryopreservation) in lower numbers than 
those cells more fit because of proper care.
<li>The commercially available trypsin/EDTA usually comes as a 10 &times; stock 
(2.5% trypsin and 5 mM EDTA).  This is diluted with a balanced salts solution to 
the desired concentration, typically 1 &times;. Aliquot large 10 &times; stocks 
to containers that prevent repeated thawing and freezing.  Trypsin is an 
enzyme/protein, and repeated freezing and thawing reduces its proteolytic 
activity.  Trypsin is also auto-proteolytic, meaning that it is a protease that 
will digest itself.  It is not a good idea to leave it in a 37&deg; water bath 
for several hours, for it may be much reduced in activity.
<li>Pour out the media in the flasks containing your cultured cells to be 
detached.  (Note, you need not use a pipet to remove media;  just pour out the 
old media into a waste beaker, taking care not to let anything splash back into 
the flask.  See <a href="#goodprac">good tissue culture practices</a> for more 
information.)
<li>Rinse your flask of cells with HBSS.  Add sufficient volume to cover a 
couple of millimeters in depth, and swirl the rinse well.  Pour out the salt 
solution into the waste.  The purpose of rinsing the cells in the salt solution 
is to remove traces of serum present in the medium. Serum contains anti-trypsin 
inhibitors, and this can slow or inhibit the action of the trypsin-EDTA 
solution.
<li>Add a minimal amount of trypsin-EDTA solution.  This is usually enough
just to cover the cells.  Some people use half the volume of what covers
the cells, and then spreads the solution all around so that all cells
make contact with the solution.
<li>Inspect the flask under the microscope.  Perhaps it is possible to see
cells already detaching.  There are cell-substratum and cell-cell attachments
to break.  I think the trypsin tends break the cell-cell connections,
while the EDTA ties up the Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> salts that
make cell-substratum attachment more likely.
<li>Put the flask in the 37&deg; incubator for a few minutes.  The
optimal temperature for trypsin activity is 37&deg;, and so it will work
faster.  From time to time, remove the flask from the incubator.  Inspect
the progress of detachment.  Swirl the flask back and forth.   If
&gt;95% of the cells have lifted from the surface, it is okay to continue
with the next step.  Although it is common to see experienced cell culturists
banging the flask with the heel of their hands to jar cells loose, the
use of this method to dislodge cells is not recommended:  such a technique
will break cell-substratum contacts, but does not break cell-cell contact,
and so cells will come off in sheets rather than as single cell suspensions.
<li>It is useful to add in a small volume (at least 1/3 to 2/3 of the volume
of trypsin-EDTA) of serum-containing medium to the flask:  the anti-trypsin
in the serum can be used to neutralize the trypsin.  This is optional
although recommended.
<li>Use the pipet to draw in a small amount of medium now containing cell
suspension, and forcefully blow out along all the floor surface on which
the cells adhered.  This may be done several times to cover the floor.
This washes loose any further cells.
<p style="margin:1em 0 1em -2em;font:bold 90% sans-serif;">
The next steps are only for detaching cells for the purpose of subculturing:
<li>It is possible to remove cells in the trypsin-EDTA solution and
inoculate them directly into new flasks for subculturing if:
<ul>
<li>a minimal amount of trypsin-EDTA was used such that the volume
of medium to which the cells would be transferred would exceed by
more than 15- to 20-fold the volume of trypsin-EDTA used
<li>the cells were not sensitive to either trypsin or EDTA or their
growth inhibited in culture
</ul>
Add sufficient medium, and then inoculate the flasks with the initial
cell density desired.  Normally cells are diluted at least by half
(1:2), but a typical subculturing can be 1:3 to 1:5.
<li>If the trypsin-EDTA is to be removed (always a safe practice),
choose the correct spin tube and transfer the cell solution in the
flask to the tube.  Spin for 5 min at 50-100 &times; <i>g</i> (or
the appropriate settings for the cell type).
<li>If the cells were centrifuged from the trypsin-EDTA step, remove the
supernatant.  If the cell pack is firm and will not come loose, then
just pour off the supernatant.  If there is doubt that the cell pellet
is loose or can pour off, use a pipet to remove the supernatant.
<li>Add media to the spin tube (if you decided to spin out the trypsin-EDTA
solution), and resuspend the cells.  Inoculate new flask at the desired
cell density.
</ol>

<h2 id="freezing">Freezing and Thawing Cells</h2>
<p>
Freezing and re-vitalizing (thawing) cells can be a tricky business. The 
conditions by which to freeze them sometimes need to be optimized especially for 
sensitive cell lines.  Some things are universally understood.  A 
cryopreservative agent (DMSO, glycerol) is used to lower the freezing point; 
this prevents damaging crystal formation.  Moreover the rate at which 
temperature decrease occurs is slowed so that crystals do not form inside the 
cell and puncture the membrane.

<h3>Freezing</h3>
<ol>
<li>The cells to be frozen should be in the most fit condition. If the cells are 
proliferating (have active cell cycles), the ideal cells are in logarithmic 
growth phase, in medium that is 1 or 2 days old at the most.
<li>Prepare your cryopreservation medium (thaw it or make it).  The kind of 
medium varies, but typical components are serum (fetal bovine), growth medium, 
and a cryopreservative (DMSO).  For bone marrow cells a cryopreservation medium 
of 60% growth medium, 35% FBS, and 5% DMSO is used.
<li>Detach the cells from the flask as usual (trypsin/EDTA).  Spin them down. 
Resuspend in 10 or more cell pellet volumes of HBSS.  Take an aliquot and 
determine the total cell count.  It is really necessary to count the number of 
cells you intend to freeze, so that the person who thaws them (it may not be 
you) knows how many cells he might get.
<li>Prepare your cryovials on a rack.  Loosen but do not remove the cap for easy 
opening, filling and closing.
<li>Spin down the cells again and remove the HBSS rinse.
<li>Add the volume of cryopreservation medium you intend to use (it's the 
product of the volume you want per vial and the number of vials you have).  It's 
a good idea to adjust the number of vials and volume of your cryomedium so that 
you have at least 1 million cells per milliliter.  More than 5 million cells per 
milliliter is probably too dense, but then you may have a luxury of cells too. 
Resuspend the cells very well!  You should not see clumps or aggregates of 
cells.  If you do, let them settle out and make sure you do not pipet them into 
the vials.
<li>Distribute the cell suspension to the cryovials.
<li>Place the vials with a special container designed to freeze cells. Nalgene 
(?) makes a product called <q>Mr. Freeze</q> which is filled with isopropanol 
and is designed to slowly freeze cells.
<li>Archive the cells with a reasonable effort at organization.  Long-term 
storage of cells is best in a liquid nitrogen container, but a &minus;70&deg; 
freezer can store cells as long as 6 months.
</ol>

<h3><a name="thawing">Revitalization (Thawing)</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>Have your growth medium warmed at 37&deg; before taking cells
out of the freezer.
<li>Have all the things you will use to re-vitalize the cells
ready to go, in the hood or at hand.  Disposable pipets, flasks,
spin tubes (if used).
<li>Prepare the hood as usual:  place sash at the position you
will want it, then start blower motor, wait at least 15-20 min
for sterile containment to develop.  You might also want to mist
(spray upward) the chamber with 70% ethanol.  Your
work area should be uncluttered, especially with the tools of others.
<li>Retrieve the cells from the freezer, and immediately place them
in a 37&deg; water bath.  Rapid thawing is absolutely preferable to
slow thawing.
<li>Do either (a) or (b):
 <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
 <li><b>Lazy revitalization</b>.  This technique works but depends
on how hardy your cells are (most are).  The rapidly thawed cell
suspension is just added to the medium in your flask, and the
cells are allowed to detach overnight.  You can then replace
the medium the next day to remove components present in the
freezing medium (particularly DMSO).  Note this technique is
similar to the <q>lazy</q> serial passaging method of confluent
cells, in which a bare minimum of trypsin and/or EDTA is used to detach
cells, and then the cells (or a fraction of them) are recovered after
diluting with medium and without removing (by centrifugation) the
trypsin/EDTA.
 <li><b>Scrupulous freezing medium removal</b>.  Transfer the cell
suspension in the freezing vial a spin tube containing at least 5 or more
volumes of isotonic washing medium (HBSS).  Mix well.  At this point,
if you wanted to count the cells, take the necessary aliquot for
counting.  Spin as usual (50-100 &times; g for 3-5 min) to pellet cells.
Remove supernatant.  Resuspend in growth medium and distribute/transfer
to flask(s).
 </ol>
<li>Incubate cells in proper conditions (usu. 37&deg; with humidified
5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere) for at least 12 hours (overnight).
<li>The next morning, inspect the flask (container) for attached cells,
and whether the plate might be super-confluent.
</ol>
<!--
Note that you can reasonably estimate how many cells you need for the
flasks you have and to what percentage of the flasks will be confluent.
For example, suppose cells in a hemocytometer show a diameter of 10 &mu;m.
They may attach and spread to 3-4 times the area they take up rounded
in a hemocytometer.  15 million cells will be thawed.  How many 185
cm<sup>2</sup> flasks will be necessary to avoid plating that is
super-confluent?

<h3 id="ratprep">Preparing the Rat</h3>
<p>
More than one rat can be prepared at a time.  The experienced individual will 
attempt at most a half dozen rats, if the bone marrow of each rat is to be 
handled separately;  more rats, if all the cells can be pooled and cultured.
<p>
Obtain the rats from the housing facility.  There are no real restrictions on 
the size of the rat.  Rats obtained in the 150-175 g weight range will double 
their weight in a few weeks easily.  The quality and yield of stem cell could be 
age/weight-related.  The equipment used, such as the needle gauges for flushing 
marrow, will certainly depend on the size of the rat used.

<h4 id="heparin">Heparin</h4>
<p>
Before the rat is sacrificed, it is thought that the flushing of the marrow is 
assisted by administration of the anticoagulant heparin.
<p>
Weigh the rat, and inject intraperitoneally (i.p.) 2-3 units heparin
per gram body weight.
<p>
Wait about one hour before the sacrifice.

<h4 id="halothane">Sacrifice by Halothane Poisoning</h4>
<p>
The animal handling protocol specifies and demands that the animal be
killed using halothane poisoning (<q>lethal anesthesia</q>).
<p>
Obtain a large dessicator with ceramic inner support.  Cover the support
with a paper towel;  the animal will rest upon it.
<p>
Place the dessicator in a fume hood.  <strong>Any dessicator or container
to be used for this poisoning procedure is NOT to be placed outside
an operational fume hood.  Halothane is quite volatile, and
will kill technicians, if mishandled, as effectively as it kills rats.</strong>
<p>
With the dessicator and bottle of halothane inside the fume hood, open
the bottle of halothane within the fume hood, and pour out 5&nbsp;ml or so
(often a capful) into the lower chamber of the dessicator
(where the dessicant usually goes).  It can be poured on to a towel
or cotton wool, although it is not necessary.  Close the dessicator
lid immediately, if the rat is not placed in immediately.  This also
allows the halothane to distribute in the dessicator.
<p>
The technician should wear gloves (not latex, but nitrile) when handling
the halothane.  Halothane is a fluorocarbon that can pass through skin (?),
and this should be kept in mind when giving the greatest respect to this
substance.
<p>
It will take about 10-15 minutes for the animal to be ready.  It generally
moves around for a while, then goes limp, but continues to breathe for
a while.  It seems that the breathing becomes quite rapid until it stops.
<p>
One can take the animal while it is breathing, but it is important to
cut the animal open quickly and cut a major artery such that it bleeds
profusely.  Otherwise the animal can recover.  However, leaving the animal
in a bit longer after it has stopped breathing will assure the technician
more time in cutting the animal open and bleeding it.

<h3 id="dissect">Dissection</h3>
<p>
Obtain <em>sharp-pointed</em> scissors that have been cleaned with water
in mild detergent, and given a wipe with 70% ethanol (referred to just
as ethanol hereafter).  A large and small size pair of these scissors
is useful.

<h4 id="hindlimbs">Removing the Hind Limbs</h4>
<p>
Lay out a disposable covering (such as plastic-backed absorbent paper)
for working with the animal and catching any blood.  The animal is
laid on its back, and the abdomen soaked in ethanol prior to the first cut.
On the inner side of the hind leg, begin cutting into the skin/fur at the
most posterior point and proceed to cut the skin anteriorly to the
anterior of the hind leg, then cutting dorsally.  The intention is to
remove as much skin covering the hind leg, and expose the muscles of the
hind leg.  Short cuts can be done to pull back skin and fur from the
hind leg.  Cut the skin also toward the ankle of the leg.
<p>
With skin pulled back as much as possible, begin cutting muscle located
at the head of the femur, muscle which proceeds toward the knee.
This makes the femur more movable at wider angles, and allows
the hind leg to be bent backwards to break the capsule that forms the
hip joint and expose the ball joint of the femur head.
<p>
The technician should be careful not to lose time in butchering the
hind leg:  feel for the femur with the gloved hand, and cut only
the muscle alongside it near its head, enough to allow its greater
angular movement and exposure of the hip joint.  The pearl-white
appearance of the ball joint liberated from the acetabular capsule
will be apparent.  Cut free the hind leg from the body.
Repeat the same process for the other hind leg.

<h4 id="bonefrommuscle">Freeing Bone from Muscle</h4>
<p>
The red marrow of the long bones is used.  This means recovering the femur and 
tibia.  The muscle and ligaments surrounding and attaching to these bones is not 
so much cut away, but pulled away.  Generally the tibia is the cleanest, with 
few if any insertions of tendons. The femur requires some trimming.
<p>
Enough skin must have been cut in the anterior of the ankle to expose the bones 
and ligaments of the ankle.  Grasp the ankle/foot, and pull the foot backwards. 
A cracking noise should be heard, and the ankle pulled with sufficient force 
backwards (dorsally) and then up (anteriorally) such that the tibial 
articulation is exposed.  Observe carefully that a tendon or ligament does not 
cause any resistance to the pulling action. Cut it first before proceeding. 
Pull the ankle with attached ligaments anterior to expose more of the tibia. 
When enough tibia is exposed to grasp it, firmly hold the bone and pull downward 
and at an angle.  This will cause the tibia to separate completely from the 
muscle.  The tibia should be entirely free of muscle.  The wire-thin fibula may 
be attached as well, if it was not broken in the handling; it can be removed 
(broken off).
<p>
To liberate the femur, feel for the long capsule forming the patellar joint. 
Use scissor to cut into it, and crack it open.  Do not cut through all the way. 
The opening in the patellar region provides an opening to force the patellar end 
of the femur through.  Attempt for the femur through the opening, cracking the 
patellar capsule if necessary.  Pull back and upward the mass of muscle and 
capsule until enough of the femur is exposed to grasp it.  Grasp the femur and 
continue pulling more muscle away from it.
<p>
Examine the bones for any excess muscle and fat, and trim these away as much as 
possible.  The smaller-sized scissors may be useful for this.
<p>
Place the bones in something like a weighing boat.  Liberally apply ethanol to 
all areas and surfaces of the bone. <strong>Do not let the bones sit in a pool 
of ethanol.  Pour off the excess. </strong> Take the ethanol-bathed bones dry to 
the sterile hood and let them dry within the hood.  Do not let them dry outside 
the hood.

<h3 id="underhood">Under the Sterile Hood</h3>
<p>
These steps should have been completed just after the rat was kept waiting after 
injection of heparin.
<ul>
<li>Place a polymer kitchen cutting board in the hood.  It should be
washed with mild detergent (Alkonox, etc.), rinsed liberally, then
sprayed with ethanol, and allowed to dry in the hood under the UV light.
<li>Obtain a very fine tooth saw (or whatever will be used to cut
through the bone).  It should be washed (if not already clean) and
sprayed with ethanol and kept in the hood.
<li>Have available a selection of needles: 22-, 18-, 16-, and 14-gauge,
washed and sterilized or packaged sterile.
<li>Have available a 3-, 5- or 10-ml sterile syringe.  5-ml is comfortable.
<li>Sterile 15-ml polystyrene tubes (at least half a dozen) should be
available.
<li>Sterile Ficoll-Paque or suitable lymphocyte enrichment/purification
medium should be available (3-4&nbsp;ml per animal prepared).
<li>Hanks&rsquo; Balanced Salt Solution (about 30-50&nbsp;ml per animal) should be
available
<li>A sterile 75&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture plastic flask.
<li>About 25-30&nbsp;ml growth medium will be necessary.  Rat stem cells appear
to like &alpha;-Modified Essential Medium with 2 mM glutamine,
100 units pencillin/ml, 100 &mu;g streptomycin/ml, and 20% fetal bovine
serum.
</ul>

<h4 id="bonesawing">Sawing the Bones</h4>
<p>
The bones having been allowed to dry after the brief ethanol soaking should be 
examined for any need to trim excess muscle or fat.
<p>
Grasp the ethanol-cleaned fine-tooth saw and grab the first long bone. The head 
of the bone will be cut first.  If it is the femur, begin cutting at the 
trochanteric angle where it meets the diaphysis of the bone.  If it is the 
tibia, start about 1 mm below the condyles. Cut at a right angle to long axis of 
the bone.  Do not saw back and forth;  the sawing action works better if the saw 
is pulled towards the technician.  Concentrate on starting the initial cut, then 
the sawing proceeds more easily.  There is usually no need to press down while 
sawing. Saw clean through.  Sometimes the bone separates in a <q>greenstick</q> 
manner, but saw through the separation.
<p>
Repeat the same for the other end.  For the femur, just above the condyles will 
do.  For the tibia, the red marrow appears to extend down only to a halfway 
point along the diaphysis, and it is wise to saw at a point 1-2&nbsp;mm above an 
obvious change in the body of the tibia.
<p>
Cut only one bone at a time and proceed to the next (flushing) step. Do not cut 
all bones at once, then go to flushing.

<h4 id="flushing">Flushing the Marrow</h4>
<p>
The bones can be grasped with a hemostat that has been sprung slightly such that 
it hooks the first catch without applying excessive pressure. Usually hemostats 
apply too much pressure to the cut bones when one tries to hook the first catch, 
which is why that springing the hemostats even to the second catch with a rod 
approximating the bone diameter is a useful idea.  Save the ideally sprung 
hemostat in a special place, and designate for the marrow recovery method.
<p>
Fit a syringe (5 or 10&nbsp;ml probably is ideal, but 3&nbsp;ml will work too)
with a 20 or 22 gauge needle, and draw in fully Hanks&rsquo; Balanced Salt
Solution (HBSS).  (If that&rsquo;s too slow, fit first with an 18 gauge needle
and draw in, then switch to the smaller needle.)
<p>
Grab the bone held by hemostats in the weak hand and hold it over the mouth of a 
15&nbsp;ml sterile centrifuge tube (keep the lid handy and clean). One end of 
the shaft will point down into the mouth of the tube, and the other end will 
have a needle inserted into it.  It is probably better to insert the needle into 
the larger end, with the red-colored cancellous bone evident.
<p>
While inserting the needle, twist in a clockwise-counterclockwise back-and-forth 
action and push in a little bit at a time.  Push on the plunger a little bit to 
fill the penetrating hole with fluid, but not so much as there is a backflush 
that drips from the insertion point. Continue penetrating and filling with fluid 
until the needle is well into the bone.  When pushing on the plunger, do not 
apply the pressure slowly, but in quick rapid pulses designed to apply maximum 
pressure in less than a second before releasing the pressure.  Continue 
penetrating until the needle emerges on the other end.
<p>
Bring the needle back, not all the way, but about to the middle again, and try 
<q>digging</q> or penetrating at another angle, as if to scrape the inside of 
the shaft with the needle.  Do this at several angles.  Combine it with forceful 
ejections of a small amount of solution to flush out the marrow.
<p>
During this combined scraping and flushing action, it is possible to observe the 
very red marrow perhaps emerging out of the end of the cut, and perhaps hanging 
on to it.  Continue working the needle around it until the tissue comes out 
completely free.
<p>
Remove the needle.  Check the amount of solution in the syringe, and fill if 
more than half was used.  Now insert the needle into the other end, and try 
scraping as well the other end.  To be more effective, it is useful to change to 
a larger needle, though small enough to be able to insert into the bone.  The 
length of all needles used however must be greater than the length of the bone.
<p>
Inspect the bone for thoroughness of flushing.  It is unlikely that all red 
marrow will be recovered, but if greater than 80% is obtained, that is often 
sufficient.  It is often possible to look down and through the long bone&rsquo;s 
shaft after a successful flushing.

<h4 id="breakingup">Breaking Up the Tissue</h4>
<p>
Single cell suspensions are important in liberating stem cells from clusters of 
cells that may hide them, and prevent them from adhering to the floor of tissue 
culture plastic.
<p>
Start by drawing in and out with a 5&nbsp;ml pipet  the tissue to try to break 
it into clumps.
<p>
Then take a syringe fitted with a larger needle (14 or 16 guage), and draw it in 
and out in the same way.  Proceed to successively smaller (higher gauge) needles 
to create a more uniform dispersion.

<h4 id="centrifuge">Density Medium Centrifugation</h4>
<p>
Spin the tube at no more than 100 &times; <i>g</i> (not greater 900 rpm in the 
model in Room 2101), as low as 50 &times; <i>g</i>. The time of the spin will 
depend on distance between the top of the volume and the bottom of the tube. 
With tubes that are more full, about 5 or more minutes is okay.
<p>
While it is spinning, set up in new 15&nbsp;ml tubes (one for each set of bones 
from a single animal processed) about 3&nbsp;ml of a mononuclear density 
separation medium, such as Ficoll-Paque, Histo-Paque 177, or other suitable 
cushion.
<p>
With the spin completed, either draw off from the supernatant enough volume so 
that 3-4&nbsp;ml of solution remains, or draw it all off, and add 3-4&nbsp;ml 
HBSS.  In that 3-4&nbsp;ml volume, resuspend the cell pellet.  Wait 15-30 
seconds for bone spicules and heavy material that does not resuspend to settle. 
Draw up as much volume as possible, without drawing up the settled material. 
With the volume in the pipet, wait to see if something settles out into the tip: 
push that part in the tip out.
<p>
With the blow-out switch on the pipettor set for <q>S</q> (slowest), insert the 
pipet into the 15&nbsp;ml tube, which has been angled to 30-45&deg; off the 
vertical.  The pipet tip should come to rest against the lower of the inside of 
the 15&nbsp;ml, just above the level of the Ficoll, and the body/shaft of the 
pipet is support on the 15&nbsp;ml tube mouth edge, touching the tube on the 
opposite of its diameter.  This gives steady support for the pipet inside the 
centrifuge tube.  Slowly squeeze the blow-out control of the pipettor such that 
the cell suspension is layered gently over the top of the Ficoll without undue 
mixing or disturbance of the more dense cushion.  The flow rate could be as slow 
as 0.5 to 1&nbsp;ml/min, at least initially.  Raise the pipet tip so that it is 
always above the level of the suspension as it is dispensed.
<p>
Carefully move the layered tube to the centrifuge, and spin at 400 &times; 
<i>g</i> for 30-40 minutes (this is about 1900 rpm for the centrifuge in 2101).
<p>
When complete, the layers appear almost as when they were loaded. The 
pink-colored phase on top is the Hanks&rsquo; solution which should largely be 
composed of platelets.  The bottom white phase will be rather opaque, and is 
supposed to be rich in granulocytic cells. The dark-red pellet at the bottom are 
hemoglobin-rich cells (erythryocytes at some stage of maturity or development). 
At the interface between the white- and pink-colored phases is the band where 
the mononuclear cells will migrate:  this usually yellow-colored band includes 
lymphocytes, monocytes, and stem cells.
<p>
Recovery of the cells at the interface involves plunging&mdash;somewhat 
deliberately but without mixing&mdash;a 5&nbsp;ml pipet with the tip on, or 
better, just slightly below the interface.  With the suck-in control of the 
pipettor set to <q>S</q> (for slow), draw in the cells at the interface with a 
slow circular movement of the pipet tip to sweep the area.  It is possible that 
a good portion of the pink upper phase and the white lower phase will also be 
collected.  This is to be more liberal rather than conservative in recovering 
cells, worrying less about the presence of contaminating cell types and more 
about recovering all possible stem cells.  It is possible that as much as half 
(3&nbsp;ml) of the total volume is recovered in drawing out the mononuclear 
cells.
<p>
The collected material is put into a fresh 15&nbsp;ml tube.  Add 2 volumes of 
Hanks to this material, and mix well.  Spin 50-100 &times; <i>g</i> for 4-5 min. 
Remove the supernatant.

<h3 id="final">Final Handling</h3>
<p>
If the cells are to be counted at all, it is a better idea to resuspend in HBSS, 
because it is calcium- and magnesium-free, although cells do not really clump at 
all in medium (serum in medium makes any trypan blue use more dark however).
<p>
If the cells are to be set up for primary culture, they can be re-suspended in 
about 5&nbsp;ml of culture medium.  (Rat cells appear to like &alpha;-MEM with 2 
mM Gln, P/S, and 20% FBS.)  The entire yield from a tibiofemoral set of a single 
animal (from 5-20 million cells) can be plated to a 75&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> 
flask.  A 2-3 mm depth of culture medium requires 15-25&nbsp;ml.
<p>
Cells in primary culture should be left at least 24 hours for cells to adhere. 
In fact, 72 hours may be ideal for allowing cells to establish themselves (see 
Haynesworth et al., <i>Bone</i> <b>13</b>: 81, 1992). The medium is changed 
about every 3-4 days (twice a week) to maintain logarithmic growth and healthy 
cells.  At about 12-16 days, the colonies of cells have multiplied sufficiently 
to make it confluent, and the flask is ready for its first trypsin-EDTA-mediated 
detachment. Follow the seed lot storage protocol to maintain lots of cells 
properly.

<h3 id="vary">Variations in Isolation</h3>
<p>
There are many variations/modifications to the method described above:
<ul>
<li>Canine nail clippers are used to cut off the ends of the bones rather
  than a fine-tooth saw
<li>It is possible to omit the Ficoll (density separation medium) step.
However there are more contaminating cell types to deal with, and the
sheer numbers of cells packed into a culture flask could inhibit or
otherwise affect the ability of stem cells to establish themselves.
</ul>

<h3 id="passaging">Passaging Cultures</h3>
<p>
Cells can be detached from coated or uncoated tissue culture plastic by a 
combination of treatment with trypsin and ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA). 
Cells probably adhere to plastic or matrix coats with a combination of proteins 
and magnesium and calcium salts;  the protease trypsin disrupts the proteins, 
while EDTA chelates the divalent ions.  Trypsin and EDTA are dissolved in an 
isotonic unbuffered medium (balanced salts solution, possibly with a phenol red 
pH indicator), with EDTA usually at 0.5 millimolar, and trypsin at 0.25-0.5% 
(w/v).  The level of trypsin and EDTA&mdash;particularly the level of 
trypsin&mdash;can vary according to cell type and how adherent a cell is or to 
the extent of confluence.
<p>
Detachment (trypsinization) of cells can be done in two ways.  One method
does not bother to wash cells free of trypsin (it also uses less resources
such as a wash tube), and the other does wash cells.  The does-not-wash
method would be suitable for cell types whose survival is not overly
sensitive to the presence of trypsin, and especially where the passage
involves splitting one flask into three or more, where the trypsin can be
diluted to sure harmlessness.  If not sure, then the does-wash technique
is always safe.

<h4>Detachment with Trypsin <i>Without</i> Washing</h4>
<ol>
<li>Obtain sufficient Hanks&rsquo; balanced salts solution (HBSS) for rinsing 
out serum-containing medium from the flasks for the number of containers to be 
treated.  Sterile trypsin-EDTA is usually aliquoted into 
17&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100 mm (polypropylene) tubes to contain 10-12 ml and stored 
in the freezer.  Place tubes to thaw.  If tubes are placed to thaw in 
pre-warming (37&deg;) water bath, place them in the bath only for the time 
needed to thaw them, since trypsin auto-proteolyzes, and the extent of 
auto-proteolysis is temperature- (and time-)dependent.
<li>In the sterile hood, pour out (or pipet off) culture/growth medium
into a waste container.
<li>Pipet in sufficient volume for a 1-2 mm depth of serum-free
balanced salts solution.  For example, for a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask,
this would be 7.5-15 ml volume (= 75 cm<sup>2</sup> &times; [0.1 to 0.2] cm
= 7.5 to 15 cm<sup>3</sup>).  Rotate in a circular motion the flask a
few times to ensure a good washing.
<li>Repeat the wash step with balanced salt solution (about half of the first 
wash volume can be used).  The second washing is because a bare minimum of 
trypsin-EDTA solution is used, and it is even more important to wash out 
serum-based medium.  Rock/rotate the flask in a circular motion a few times.
<li>Pipet in a volume of trypsin-EDTA just sufficient to coat (and no more)
the portion of the flask upon which the cells grow.  Put the cap
on the flask tight (to maintain sterility).
<li>Look at the flask under the microscope.  It may be possible to observe
clusters of cells breaking free from the plastic floor, and cells from
each other.
<li>Most cell types require an incubation time of 4-5 min.  Place the
flask in the incubator (the temperature optimum of trypsin is 37&deg;).
After the period, remove the flask from the incubator and look at it
under the microscope to see if most (&gt;90-95%) of the cells have detached.
<li>If cells have not detached to expectation, rock the flask in a
circular motion to swirl to coat the flask again.  Place back in the
incubator for another 3-5 min.  If most cells have not detached still,
try another minimal volume of trypsin-EDTA, and repeat the incubation.
It is advised <em>not</em> to shock the flask with the heel of the hand
to dislodge cells:  cells will come off in sheets from the flask without
detaching from each other to form single cell suspensions, and it will
not be understood correctly what conditions of trypsin-EDTA produce
single cell suspensions.
<li>When the detachment to single cells (or small clusters) is sufficient,
add a volume of serum-containing medium that is about one-tenth (in ml)
of the area of the flask (2-3 ml for a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask, 6-7
ml for a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask, 12-15 ml for a 150 cm<sup>2</sup>
flask).  The serum in the medium contains anti-trypsin agents to stop
the action of trypsin.  Draw in a pipetful of cell suspension, and
blow it (with medium force) across the floor where the cells were
growing.  This dislodges any more cells and washes the floor of cells.
Repeat this a few times until the floor has been well covered.
<li>The detached cells are ready for use as is.  If plating to fresh
flasks without counting the cells, it is only necessary to divide the
volume in the used flask so that each flask gets an equal amount.
If part of the detached cells are to be distributed to wells of plates
or to dishes, or to be used in other experiments, it is probably useful
to obtain a count on a hemocytometer first, then divide the cells as
needed.
</ol>
<p>
When manipulating multiple containers, it is possible to perform each
step on all containers, rather than all steps only on one container
before proceeding to the next container.

<h4>Detachment with Trypsin <i>With</i> Washing</h4>
<p>
If the trypsin-EDTA is to be washed from the cells after detachment
(more typically done), the following modifications to the does-not-wash
method can be done.
<ul>
<li>It is less critical that the bare minimum volume&mdash;one just
enough to coat the cell layer&mdash;of trypsin-EDTA in Step #5 be used.
Using a volume that covers a 0.5 mm depth (for a 75 cm<sup>2</sup>,
that would be
75 cm<sup>2</sup> &times; 0.05 cm = 3.75 cm<sup>3</sup>, or 4 ml or so)
is probably good enough.  Rock or swirl the solution in the flask as
for the does-not-wash method.
<li>At Step #10, transfer the cells to sterile conical centrifuge tube
of the appropriate size (15 or 50 ml tube).  Spin the cells gently
(50-100 <i>g</i> for about 5 min) to pellet them, and remove the
supernatant.  Resuspend cells in growth medium, or in the appropriate
solution for use of cells for experimentation.  It is probably useful
to count cells as well.
</ul>

<h2 id="hcytometer"> Viable Cell Number</h2>

<h3>By Trypan Blue</h3>
<p>
For ethidium bromide/acridine orange viability, see next section.
<p>
A typical method is that described by M. K. Patterson (1979) <i> Meth. 
Enzymol.</i> <b>58</b>, 191-152.  1 vol of suspension of cells of about 
300,000-500,000 per ml in serum-free maintenance medium is mixed with 1 vol of 
0.4%-2.0% trypan blue dye in PBS, and cells excluding dye are counted.  The 
total volume must be sufficient to fill a hemocytometer platform with a grid for 
counting.  This is usually 10 &mu;l.  The hemocytometer platform must be neither 
overfilled (fluid <q>bulging</q> beyond the platform border) nor underfilled 
(fluid not covering all the platform).
<p>
Allow at least a couple of minutes for the dead cells to take up the dye.  The 
microscope is ideally set with a 10&times; phase objective with a green filter 
(the human eye is most sensitive and visual acuity is likely to be greatest to 
the middle of the visible spectrum, that being green light).
<p>
The entire grid on a hemocytometer has 9 major zones, arranged in a 3 &times; 3 
grid, marked by triple lines.  Within the major zones at the four corners, 
single line grids form 16 minor zones arranged in a 4 &times; 4 grid.  Within 
the major zones that are centered between the corner zones and the very center 
of the grid itself, the lines forming the minor zones are double lines.
<p>
Each of the 9 major zones is a  0.1&nbsp;cm &times; 0.1&nbsp;cm square. When the 
coverslip is placed over the hemocytometer, its surface is supposed to be 
0.01&nbsp;cm from the floor of the surface with the grid.  Therefore, the cells 
within the major zone occur in a volume that is 
10<sup>&minus;4</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>, or 10<sup>&minus;4</sup>&nbsp;ml. 
Therefore, if one counted the cells in just a single major zone, multiplied by 
any dilution factor, then multiplied by 10,000, one would have the number of 
cells per milliliter.
<p>
It is not usual to count only one zone, but rather to sample several fields 
(zones) for a count, average them, and then use the average for the calculation. 
The standard method is to count all of the four corner zones, and some count the 
zone at the very center of the grid, for a total of five zones.  During 
counting, many cells will fall across (straddle) a line, either the line 
bordering a major or minor zone.  The usual rule is to count the cell if it 
falls on the line/border that is at the top and left of the zone, and to 
disregard the cell if it falls on the right or bottom of the zone.  Develop a 
total cell count for each major zone counted, sum each of the totals of the 
zones, divide by the number of major zones counted to get the average, then 
multiply by the dilution factor and 10<sup>4</sup> to get the cells per ml.
<p>
For the viable cell count, count the cells that do not take up the blue dye.  To 
report the percent viability, divide the mean value of cells not taking up dye 
by the mean of all cells counted (both those that are blue and those that are 
phase bright).

<h2 id="xtalviolet">Quantitation of Cell Count By Crystal Violet

<p>
This method from Lennon et al. (Exp. Cell Res. 219: 211-222, 1995) used to 
estimate cell proliferation; report shows a linear relationship between rat MSC 
number and amount of recoverable stain measured in a spectrophotometer 
(colorimeter).  This group reports that this is a modification of method of 
Westergren-Thorsson et al. (J. Cell Physiol. 147: 523-530, 1991).

</ol>
<p>
Note that this method does <strong>not</strong> describe a colony-forming assay, 
although it makes use of a stain typically used for such an assay.

<h2 id="cfuassay"> Colony Counting: The Colony-Forming Unit-Fibroblast (CFU-F) 
Assay</h2>
<div id="colcounting">
<p style="margin:0 5% 1em 5%;font:bold 75% Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">
Note:  this method is tentative and likely to be modified as more experience is 
acquired in using this technique, with modifications intended as optimizations.
<p>
To determine, as an example, the number of stem (fibroblast-like) cells in a 
tissue sample, such as bone marrow from a long bone (femur, tibia, etc.), the 
following steps for the CFU-F assay can be taken, explained in the sections that 
follow.

<h3>Preparation of Cells</h3>
<p>
Prepare the cells as they would be prepared for doing a primary culture in a 
flask.  It is highly recommended that cells be enriched in the type of adherent 
cell desired, since contaminating cells, whether adherent or not, might 
complicate the formation of colonies or the development by staining.  The 
preparation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, in particular, should involve 
a cell type separation via density centrifugation on a Ficoll-Paque cushion.
<p>
CFU-F assays are possible <em>only</em> if the suspension is of single cells, 
and not cells clumped together.  Strategies for producing single cell 
suspensions include mechanical means in which the cell suspension is passed 
serially through needles of successively higher gauges, such as from 18 gauge to 
20 gauge.  It is important also to use a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and 
Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free medium in producing the single cell suspensions.

<h3>Counting Cells</h3>
<p>
Count the cells using a correctly gated automated analyzer (e.g., Coulter) or 
manually by hemocytometer.
<p>
To continue the example of the bone marrow stem cells, suppose 1.5 million 
mononuclear cells have been determined.

<h3>Planning and Preparing Dilutions</h3>
<p>
If it is understood that all cells are not capable of forming colonies but the 
proportion that are is unknown, it will be necessary to perform logarithmic 
dilutions.  The number of dilutions is log(cell&nbsp;count)&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, 
where the log(cell&nbsp;count) is rounded to the nearest integer.
<p>
In contrast, if the proportion of cells capable of forming colonies is known 
either from previous experience or published research, a particular starting and 
ending dilution can be used to obviate the need to test a broad set of titers. 
Many publications re-iterate that 1 in 10<sup>5</sup> mononuclear cells from 
bone marrow are stem cells. That would suggest that in 1.5 million cells, 15 
cells are stem cells. Since each stem cell is capable of originating a colony, 
then 15 colonies would probably be counted.  Providing that cells are 
well-dispersed (single cells) and well-mixed, it may be possible to plate all 
cells into a single container, such as a 75&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> flask or 100 mm 
culture dish.
<p>
Instead of just plating all cells at a single targeted dilution in one 
container, it is probably better to have at least two different dilutions (it 
may include the 1/1 dilution, or no dilution) and replicates within dilutions. 
Use of replicates (duplicates, triplicates) might indicate how well the cell 
suspenion is dispersed as well as pipetting technique. Instead of large 
containers for the replicates, consider smaller flasks (25&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>) 
or dishes/multi-well plates.
<p>
As for the factor of the dilution, logarithmic (factor of 10) dilutions are 
adequate, and even the wise choice if there is a need to cover a range of 
several dilutions.  In a follow-up experiment, once the proportion of 
colony-forming units to total cells is known, a smaller factor starting from the 
intial dilution will probably give a more precise count, if the follow-up is 
only to confirm numbers from the previous study.
<p>
Determine first the number of dilutions in the series that will be done, and the 
number of replicates per dilution.  In the example, it is decided to look at 
cell suspension that is undiluted, at 1/10, and at 1/100.  It is also decided 
that duplicates will be plated at each dilution, in 25&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> 
flasks.  One 25&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> flask holding a culture medium with a 3 mm 
depth can only receive 7.5&nbsp;ml medium maximally (25&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> 
&times; 0.3&nbsp;cm = 7.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>). 90% of the total cells will be 
distributed to the total of the replicate flasks of a single dilution.  If the 
1.5 million cells are suspended as single cells, spin them down if they are not 
already in the plating medium.  Re-suspend the cell pellet in plating medium to 
a final volume whose value is divisible by 5 or 10 to make calculations easier. 
Dilute cells out with plating medium to the starting dilution (not necessary if 
the starting dilution includes undiluted suspension).  For successive dilutions 
by a factor of 10 from the starting dilution, add 90% of the volume of the 
starting dilution volume to empty sterile tubes using plating medium.  In the 
example, the 1.5 million cells are resuspended in 10&nbsp;ml plating medium, and 
therefore 9&nbsp;ml of medium is added to two empty tubes representing the 1/10 
and 1/100 dilutions.
<p>
1.0&nbsp;ml is now taken out of the original cell suspension (a 5&nbsp;ml pipet 
will do this more accurately than a 10 or 25&nbsp;ml pipet certainly) and placed 
into the 1/10 dilution tube.  A 10&nbsp;ml pipet can then be used to draw in and 
out about a dozen times the diluted cell suspension, with the suspension being 
relatively well mixed.  The process of using the right pipets and measuring out 
the same volumes is repeated:  1.0&nbsp;ml is drawn out of the 1/10 tube then 
and placed into the 1/100 tube, and then mixed.  For the example, that ends the 
dilutions.

<h3>Plating the Cells</h3>
<p>
Appropriately label the containers with the standard identifying marks (date, 
initials, cell type, perhaps abbreviated description of project or study) and 
what they will receive (dilution, perhaps replicate number).
<p>
The volumes in each dilution are then distributed equally among the number of 
replicates.  In the example, since duplicates are used and since there are 
9.0&nbsp;ml in each tube except the last one, which has 10.0&nbsp;ml but of 
which only 9.0&nbsp;ml will be used as for the other tubes, that means that each 
25&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> flask will get 4.5&nbsp;ml.
<p>
To economize on the use of pipets, use the appropriate pipet on the most dilute 
tube in the series first, and proceed to the most dense.  In the example, take a 
5&nbsp;ml pipet and draw out 4.5&nbsp;ml from the 1/100 tube, place it in a 
25&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> flask.  Draw out the other 4.5&nbsp;ml and place it in a 
second flask.  Without changing the pipet, draw out 4.5&nbsp;ml from the 1/10 
dilution tube, and place it in a fresh flask.  Repeat the process of pipetting 
all volumes without the need to change the pipet until done.
<p>
Since the culture vessel volume is less than the ideal one determined of 
7.5&nbsp;ml (3 mm depth), add the balance (3.0&nbsp;ml) to each flask with 
plating medium.

<h3>Culturing and Staining</h3>
<p>
The purpose of the CFU-F assay is to stain a colony that will be visible to the 
naked (unmagnified) eye and be quite distinct as a colony (circular, with 
well-defined borders to the color spot). The eye can see a spot 2-3 mm in 
diameter comfortably as a recognizable colony.  The diameter of a microscope 
field with the 20 &times; objective set is 0.9 mm, with the 10 &times; 
objective, double that diameter. If one can visualize 50 cells in the field of a 
20 &times; objective when the cells are just confluent (no piling on), and the 
20 &times; field is 0.9 mm, then a spot 2-3 mm in diameter (3-fold the diameter) 
would have 9 times the number of cells, or about 450-500. What is important to 
consider the number of cells in an expanding colony necessary to stain a colony 
recognizable to the naked eye.
<p>
If each colony begins with a single cell, then the time required to produce a 
stainable colony is equal to the following:

<table class="eqn">
<col span="3" style="text-align:center;margin:0;padding:0;">
<tr>
 <td rowspan="2">cell cycle time<br>in logarithmic phase
 <td rowspan="2"> &times;
 <td><b>ln</b> (# cells required to produce stainable colony)
<tr>
 <td colspan="3" style="border-top:1px solid black;"><b>ln</b> 2
</table>
<p>
If the cell cycle time is 1 day (24 h), then to grow 500 cells takes about 9 
days.  However, in practice, it takes about 12-14 days to produce colonies 
sufficiently large for good visualization with a stain. The colonies are usually 
larger and there is a lag phase in the growth of stem cells in primary culture.
<p>
When it is judged that the colonies are sufficiently large for characterization, 
then:

<ol>
<li>Remove the medium from the cells and wash 3 times with
phosphate-buffered saline.
<li>Add 0.5% crystal violet in methanol.  Leave at least 5, and about 10
minutes.
<li>Gently rinse in water to remove the excess.  Do it several times
in small volumes until no more excess is removed.
<li>Count the colonies and verify their appearance in a microscope.
<li>Leave the colonies to dry.
</ol>

<h3>Processing The Data</h3>
<p>
To determine the number of CFU-F in the original source material&mdash;which may 
be the entire contents of the marrow of one femur or more long bones, count the 
number of discrete colonies, verifying them as colonies using a magnifier (both 
compound microscope and disssecting scope with adjustable zoom helps).  If they 
are replicates, determine a mean and measure of variation.  Multiply by the 
appropriate dilution factor.
<p>
Suppose in the example, the two wells of the 6-well plate holding undiluted 
material were overgrown (confluent) with cells, thereby making it possible to 
see a clear separation between colonies. No count is possible for these 
replicates.  In the next set of duplicates representing a 1:10 dilution, the 
count is 31 for one duplicate and 22 for the other, although it was rather 
difficult to count colonies since some had overlapped with each other. In the 
next set of duplicates representing the 1:100 dilution, 5 colonies were counted 
in one, and 6 in another, and the colonies seemed to be the most 
well-delineated.
<p>
The 1:100 solution gave a mean &plusmn; standard deviation of 5.5 &plusmn; 0.7 
while the 1:10 dilution gave a value of 26.5 &plusmn; 6.36.  This is 550 
&plusmn; 70 and 265 &plusmn; 64. The two mean values (or single values, if no 
replicates were done at each dilution) should be close to each other.  They are 
about 2-fold off, and it is good if the 95% confidence interval of one mean 
overlaps with the other, in which case the differences between values in not 
signifcant.  A calculation shows they do not overlap, so it might come down to 
having to favor one set of replicates as more reliable than the other, if a 
single value is to be reported. This would probably be the 1:100 dilution 
values, despite their lower counts reducing the power of the data.
</div>

<h2 id="dilutioncloning">Single Cell Cloning By Limiting Dilution</h2>
<p>
Method explained well in Bennett et al. (1991) J. Cell Sci. 99: 131-139.

<ol>
<li>Establish colonies in primary culture.  For example, plate 2 million
cells in a 25&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> flask in serum-supplemented or feeder cell-
layered growth medium.  Let colonies emerge, but do not allow culture
to become confluent.
<li>Recover cells with standard trypsinization procedure (or what is suitable).
<li>Resuspend cells in growth medium so that there are 700 cells in a single
  aliquot to be delivered to the well of a 96-well plate.  If you
  want to minimize the number of tubes (from 12 to 1) used in a perhaps
  less accurate dilution method, then:
 <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
 <li>Place 16 volumes of a well aliquot in a sterile tube
 <li>Distribute 1 well volume to each well of the 8 wells in one
    column (Column #1) of the 96-well plate; columns of wells are
    arrayed vertically and labeled with numbers 1-12, while rows of wells
    are arrayed horizontally and labeled with alphabetic characters A-H
    usually
 <li>Add 8 well volumes of media to the tube, to produce a 1:2 dilution
 <li>Repeat steps (b) and (c) until you have serial double dilutions
   in all 12 columns of wells
 </ol>
 Alternatively:
 <ol>
 <li>Set up 12 tubes in a row
 <li>Place 20 volumes of a well aliquot containing cells in the first tube
     at the 700 cell/volume cell density
 <li>Place 10 well volumes of media in the remaining 11 tubes
 <li>Transfer from tube 1 to tube 2 exactly 10 well volumes and mix
 <li>Repeat the process of transferring 10 well volumes from tube <i>n</i>
   to tube <i>n</i> + 1 until the end tube is reached.
 <li>From each tube starting with the first, transfer a well volume to
    each well of a <strong>column</strong> (not <strong>row</strong>) of
   wells in a 96-well plate.  A column is a vertical array of wells
   labeled with numbers 1-12, while a row is a horizontal array of wells
   labeled by letters A-H usually.
 </ol>
<li>The last column should have 0.3 cells/well.  Monitor the growth in
each well, especially where single cell colonies are established.  Harvest
with trypsin and continue another round of limiting dilution if you wish.
</ol>

<h2 id="BrdULabeling"> S Phase Labeling Using 5-Bromo-2&acute;-Deoxyuridine

<p>
Cells undergoing active cell cycling can be labeled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine 
(BrdU).  BrdU can also be injected into living animals and cells in rapid cell 
cycling will be labeled (see Orlic et al., Nature 410:701, 2001, who used 
50&nbsp;mg/kg i.p. for 4-5 days prior to sacrifice).

<tr><td>RPMI-1640
 <td>
<tr><td>F-12
 <td>Ham's F-12
<tr><td>DMEM
 <td>Dulbecco&rsquo;s Modified Eagle&rsquo;s Medium
 <td>
<tr><td>MEM
 <td>Minimal Essential Medium
 <td>Supports variety of normal and transformed cells; if it contains Earle's 
 Balanced Salts, suitable for CO<sub>2</sub> incubation (contains 13 amino acids 
 and 7 vitamins).  The alpha modification contains non-essential amino acids, 
 pyruvate, and extra vitamins first used in 1971 by Stanners et al. (which 
 included deoxyribonucleosides and ribonucleosides).

<tr><td>BME
 <td>Basal Medium Eagle
 <td>normal and transformed cells growing in monolayers; good for
 diploid or primary mammalian cell cultures
<tr><td>M199
 <td>Medium 199
 <td>Originally developed in 1950 to support primary chick embryo heart cells 
 without any use of serum.  Used now with serum addition to support virus and 
 vaccine production and in non-transformed cell culture. Typically modified with 
 Earle's Balanced Salt for incubation in CO<sub>2</sub>; with Hanks' Balanced 
 Salts for incubation where CO<sub>2</sub> not used.
<tr><td>
 <td>McCoy's 5A
 <td>Originally developed in 1959 by McCoy for minimal amino acid requirements
 for hepatoma cell culture, done in Basal Medium 5A, which was
 developed to support Walker carcinoma 256 cells.  The Iwakata
 and Grace modifications of this medium are good for human
 myeloblasts.

   <li>get 4-6 glands and keeps them at ambient temp
  </ul>
  <ol>
  	<li>Collagenase prepared by adding BSS; add 20 &mu;l of
      1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> and TH catalase to 20 &mu;g/ml;
     stir 30-45 min.  (Note final collagenase is 0.05% w/v)
   <li>Glands are trimmed to remove fat and rinsed with 70% EtOH
   <li>1 liter of BSS and 200 ml DME/F-12 are brought 20 &mu;g/ml
    with Sigma C-3155 catalase
   <li>Ca. 2-5 ml of BSS/catalase are pumped into each gland
     over 30 min to rinse out RBCs (~500 ml for 4 glands)
   <li>After rinsing, and using a 10 ml syringe, a total of 10 ml
    in 2-5 ml poroom temperatureions are pumped into the gland over and into
    a 400 ml beaker.  Glands are covered and incubated at room temperature
    for 10 min.
  <li>>After the time, glands are re-pumped (using fresh
   solution as needed).  Again the covered glands incubate
   10 min at room temperature.
  <li>A third re-pumping with the syringe is done with an
    additional 10 min incubation,  Some "force" may be used
    with this re-pumping.
  <li>Medullae are recovered into a large glass petri dish with
   10 ml fresh BSS containing Benzonase and catalase.  The
   tissue is minced with scissors and transferred to a large
   (600 ml beaker); disperse with egg beater if necessary.
  <li>The cell material is filtered throug a PLASTIC strainer
   into a coarse nylon mesh funnel.  The strainer is scraped
   with a spoon to remove cells, using minimal BSS/Benzonase/catalase
   solution, and the volume brought to 100 ml.
  <li>The filtrate is spun 15 min in a TJ-6 at 1000 rpm.
   Retained tissue is shaken for another 10 min in a lab
   water bath and filtered for combining with the first filtrate.
  <li>Two washes with BSS/catalase are done by adding the catalase
   "with swirling", which can be done by streaming the solution
   forcefully into the pellet.  Appearance of flocculent
   (perhaps gelatinous) requires removal by polypropylene mesh.
  <li>Renografin centrifugation is done to enrich the cells as
   usual (Wilson procedure).  Note that use of polypropylene
   tubes is specified.
  </ol>
<td>
Nylon mesh is gas-sterilized.  Many other preparations silly to enumerate.

<p>
Glands are cut from "calves" and defatted.  At the lab, a balanced salt solution 
which is 10 mM glucose and 5 mM HEPES-buffered is used.  It is essentially the 
same as Ca-Mg-free Locke's but has about a 10-fold higher phosphate content. 
The solutions used are all at room temp.
<p>
Glands are injected with buffer until the RBCs are removed (red color gone). 
The gland is then rinsed with 70% EtOH while the adrenal vein port is covered. 
They are allowed to soak in buffer until use.
<p>
Half (30 ml) of the collagenase B solution (0.15% collagenase P in buffer) is 
used to work up the 8 to 10 glands.  Each gland is injected until turgid and 
placed in a 800 ml beaker. The syringe is held until the count of 5 and the 
plunger released.  10 ml of collagenase should be pushed through ea. gland in 
this way.  Glands are arranged so that they lie flat and put into a shaking 
water bath (37&deg;). After 8.5 min (which may vary with effectiveness of the 
collagenase lot), the second half of the 0.15% digestion solution is used for 
fresh injections. Lay the gland on its opposite side.
<p>
Using forceps (tweezers) and a scalpel, excise the medulla if it still adheres. 
Mince the tissue with scalpel.  This is all done on polyethylene cutting boards. 
Cells are filtered through 200-mesh nylon filters (Nitex 3-200/35).
<p>
Remaining undigested tissue is processed in a polycarbonate Erlenmeyer 
containing 0.15% collagenase and 5 &mu;g/ml DNase I (Sigma D-5025).  This is 
incubated on a rotary shaker at 85 rpm (64 ml in 250 ml Erlenmeyer) for 17.5 
min. Watch the shaking.
<p>
Cells from the first digestion are spun at 400 rpm for 5 min (IEC Model K).  The 
cells are washed in buffer (25 ml) with trituration using a blue tip on a 
pipettor.  The wash is repeated to remove collagenase.  The cells from the 
second digestion are filtered through mesh and washed and spun in the same 
manner.
<p>
Cells are prepared in 15% Renografin.  The mix is overlayed with 7.5% Renografin 
(should be 1:1 with buffer?) and centrifuged 10 min at 225 x g.
<p>
Cells at the interface are collected and rinsed a couple of times in Ca-Mg-free 
Locke's buffer (take care not to triturate the pellet excessively!).
<p>
Typical characterization with trypan blue and neutral red are done.
<td>
Glands from the abbatoir are trimmed of fat as much as possible and placed in a 
balanced salt solution (BSS) which is HEPES-buffered (5 mM) and contains 
penicillin/gentamycin

<p>
Glands are then flushed with BSS (4 ml ea gland for four times), presumably to 
remove RBCs.  Solution and glands are at 37&deg; during this process.
<p>
A solution of 0.167% collagenase vendor not specified) and  30 &mu;g/ml DNase 
type I (vendor again not specified) is made in the BSS solution.  A small volume 
of 1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> is added to bring Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 0.1 mM.  75 ml of 
the solution is made for 4 glands.  Half is put on ice while the other half is 
warmed for immediate use.

<p>
Each gland is injected with 3 ml warm collagenase solution.
This is repeated 3 more times at 15 min intervals.  After all
of the fresh collagenase has been used, the solution which
has leaked out is used.

<p>
The other half of collagenase is warmed and the medullae
dissected out on to a petri dish.  A scalpel is used
to mince the tissue.  The tissue is transferred to
a 250 ml bottle with stir bar.  100 ml  of BSS added,
the suspension shaken and  then decanted for centrifugation
to recover cells.  The rest of the collagenase is added
to remaining tissue and stirred 30 min.  Then 100 ml of BSS is added.

<p>
All cells are filtered progressively through decreasing mesh
porosities (stainless steel).  Cells are centrifuged,
resuspended in BSS, stirred (triturated?), filtered and centrifuged.

<p>
Eventually with filtering down to 53 &mu;m, the collected cells
are run on 14.5% Renografin.

<p>
Cells collected from the interface are resuspended in BSS but
this time containing 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgSO<sub>4</sub>.  (Why?)

<p>
Cells are plated in a medium containing  DME/F-12 supplemented
with 15 mM HEPES + bicarbonate (Sigma D-8900), as well as with
5% calf serum (fetal?), 100 U/ml (62.4 &mu;g/ml) penicillin-G,
20 &mu;g/ml gentamicin, 50 U/ml nystatin, and 250 &mu;M ascorbic acid.

<p>
Cell are plated out at 500,00/cm2 on normal plastic.  After 6 h
the unattached or loosely attached cells are recovered.

<td>
This procedure he claims produces 100 million cells per gland
(neutral-red positive).  He says they "rarely...obtain &lt;75 x 106/gland."

<p>
Method used is that of Greenberg and Zinder.  Gland is flushed
3-4 times before introducing collagenase.  Collagenase is
1.33 mg/ml (133%???) from Worthington (collagenase CLS) and
0.25 mg/ml dispase from Boehringer.
