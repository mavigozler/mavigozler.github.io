Understanding Electrocardiography

<h1>History</h1>
<p>
Luigi Galvani shows in the late 1700s that an electrical stimulus causes a frog 
leg to move.
</p>
<p>
Kollicker &amp; Mueller in 1885 lay the motor nerve of a frog leg with its leg 
over a beating heart and observe that with each beta, a kick in the leg is 
produced.
</p>
<p>
Ludwig &amp; Waller (1880s) show that a heart's electrical activity can be 
monitored on the skin surface.
</p>
<p>
Einthoven drills some holes into the poles of a U-shaped permanent magnet, then 
draws a Ag-coated wire through them.  He then attaches to the Ag-coated wire 
some wires that attached to skin.  The wire in the magnet is observed to vibrate 
or oscillate in a rhythm typical of the beating heart.  Einthoven also wants a 
written record of what occurs, so he places a lamp and photographic scrollable 
paper on either side of the wire.  Its shadow produces the first EKG recording 
in 1901.

</p>
<p>
A general principle of EKG recording is that, as the interior of tissue/cells 
becomes positively charged during a depolarization wave, and the depolarization 
wave proceeds towards a positive electrode, an upward deflection is registered 
on an EKG machine.
</p>
<h1>Principles</h1>
<p>
An excitable part of the heart muscle located in the upper, posterior wall of 
the right atrium, it is responsible for generating the primary rhythm of the 
heart.  The <b>SA node</b> depolarizes at a regular rate, and this causes a wave 
of depolarization to pass through both atria.  This atrial depolarization wave 
is observed on the EKG as a concave down curve, called a <b>P wave</b>.  This is 
followed by contraction.
</p>
<p>
   <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/pwave.gif" alt="the P wave in the EKG">
</p>
<p>
The wave also passes to another part of the tissue called the 
<b>atrioventricular</b> (<b>AV</b>)<b> node</b>.  This connects a conducting 
system between the atrial electrical network and the ventricular.  The 
depolarization is slowed at the AV node, but then passes on to the <b>Bundle of 
His</b>, which conducts the depolarization very rapidly to a split of the 
conductile tissue, to the <b>left</b> and <b>right bundle branches</b> located 
in the ventricular septum.  The impulses then pass to the terminal Purkinje 
fibers which penetrate into the myocardial walls enveloping the ventricles.
</p>
<p>
<img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/qrscomplex.gif" alt="the QRS complex of the EKG">
<p>
This entire ventricular depolarization process is seen as a set of waves called 
the QRS complex.  The Q wave is the first downward deflection from isoelectrical 
activity, and is usually not seen in the healthy heart. This followed by an 
upward stroke called the R wave, then followed by the downward S wave.  N.B.: 
if the wave that starts from baseline is upward, it is automatically designated 
as an R wave&mdash;there is no Q wave&mdash;and the following wave sweeping 
downward and below baseline is the S wave.  This is the nomenclature for any EKG 
trace on any electrical lead.  It works very consistently.
</p>
<p>
<img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/twave.gif" alt="the T wave of the EKG">
</p>
<p>
Finally, the ventricles are observed to repolarize, which is seen as the T wave 
on the EKG.  Atrial repolarization effectively gets lost in the QRS complex and 
is not really to be seen.
</p>
<p>
 <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/qswave.gif" alt="the QS wave of the EKG" >
 </p>
<p>
Sometimes no R wave is observed at all, just a downward peak where the 
ventricular depolarization occurs.  The is called a QS wave since it can not be 
understood whether it is either a Q wave or perhaps an S wave.
</p>
<p>
The electrodes are placed on the skin in strategic locations. Three sets of 
<i>limb</i> <i>leads</i> are placed on the right and left arms and on the left 
leg.
</p>
<p>
 <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/einthoven.gif" alt="Einthoven's triangle">
</p>
<p>
Another set of limb leads similarly exist, called <q>augmented</q> limb leads. 
To see the trace it is necessary to augment the voltage, and so the leads were 
called by their discoverer (E. Goldberger) Augmented Voltage Foot 
(aV<sub>F</sub>), Augmented Voltage Left (aV<sub>L</sub>), Augmented Voltage 
Right (aV<sub>R</sub>).  To create the aV<sub>F</sub> trace, both the left and 
right arms are connected as a common negative ground, while the left foot is 
made positive. The net effect is to see observe electrical changes with the 
vector up and down the body axis.  In other words, the electrical vector is 
perpendicular to the common negative.
</p>
<p>
   <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/avaxes.gif" alt="the atrioventricular axes">
</p>
<p>
When you combine the electrical vectors of all six limb leads,
you find that they cover the ability to trace every 30&deg;
of the body.
</p>
<p>
   <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/allaxes.gif" alt="all the axes of the leads">
</p>
<p>
The <b>chest</b> or <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> also number six,
and are given the designation V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, ...,
V<sub>6</sub>.  The electrode, which is always positive, is
placed along different positions of the chest near the heart
to cover the anatomical position of the heart.  The leads are
placed around the chest in a way that their vectors pass through
a common center, which is the AV node of the heart.
</p>
<p>
Note that the plane formed by the limb leads is sometimes called the 
<q>frontal plane.</q>
</p>
<p>
 <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/chestleads.gif" alt="Chest leads">
</p>
<p>
The positive lead of all chest leads are placed on the chest around the heart as 
shown in the figure.  The sixth lead (V<sub>6</sub>) is actually placed around 
the side.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/precordaxes.gif" alt="precordial axes">
</p>
<p>
Note that the plane formed by the chest leads is often called the 
<q>horizontal plane.</q>
</p>
<p>
   <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/axesrecord.gif" alt="record of the axes">
</p>
<p>
In observing the a beat cycle of each of the chest leads on the EKG, there is a 
gradual change in the amplitude and polarity of electrical activity.  Lead 
V<sub>1</sub> shows a mainly negative QRS complex, while V<sub>6</sub> shows a 
positive complex.  This indicates that in the horizontal plane, the ventricular 
depolarization wave (indicated as the QRS complex) is toward the V<sub>6</sub> 
lead and away from the V<sub>1</sub> lead.
</p>
<p>
Note that V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>, being largely to the right of the 
heart, are called the <q>right</q> chest leads, and V<sub>5</sub> and 
V<sub>6</sub> are called the <q>left</q> chest leads.
</p>
<p>
The V<sub>3</sub> and V<sub>4</sub> leads are placed so that they line up over 
the intraventricular septum (<q>septal</q> leads), with the V<sub>3</sub> lead 
towards the AV nodal region and the V<sub>4</sub> lead closer to the apical 
(inferior) region of the septum.
</p>
<h1>Examination of Five Important Parameters</h1>

<h2>Rate</h2>
<p>
The first important parameter is to measure the number of beats or electrical 
cycles.  The normal rate is somewhere between 60-100 beats per minute, a rate 
set by special myocardium known as the <b>sinoatrial</b>, or <b>SA</b>, 
<b>node</b>.  This is located in the upper-posterior wall of the right atrium. 
A rate established by the SA node is called <i>sinus rhythm</i>.
</p>
<p>
When the rate set by the sinus node is less than 60 per min. and it is 
established that this rate is pathological (not normal for the individual under 
examination), this condition is called <b>sinus bradycardia</b>.  Note that this 
rate is less than 1 per second.  When the rate is greater than 100, this 
condition is called <b>sinus tachycardia</b>.
</p>
<p>
There are many special areas, or <b>nodes</b>, in the myocardium of the heart 
which can act as autonomous pacemakers because of the way the heart is 
structured.  A heart rate established by one or more of these nodes instead of 
by the SA node is said to originate from an <b>ectopic focus</b>.  It is not 
necessary for the SA node to be dysfunctional or damage for a rate to be set by 
an ectopic focus or by ectopic foci. However, in cases where an SA node is 
damaged such that it loses its ability to establish the set rate, the duty of 
setting the heart beat is taken over by an ectopic focus or by foci.
</p>
<p>
In the atria, there are several potential foci which have an inherent rate of 
between 60-80 per min, usually slightly less than the rhythm set by the SA node. 
The AV junction into which the bundle of His forms also possesses cyclic 
depolarizing activity, at a rate of 40-60 per min.  A rhythm established solely 
by the AV junction is called an <i>idiojunctional rhythm</i>.
</p>
<p>
The ventricles also have several nodal areas in their tissue, although the 
cyclical rate of depolarization falls off a great deal.  The inherent rate in an 
idioventricular rhythm would be 20-40 per minute.
</p>
<p>
A lesion to myocardium in areas containing any ectopic focus could cause 
accelerated cycling originating from the node, imposing the greater rate on the 
heart in preference to the SA node rhythm, despite the SA node being normal. 
Such rates are serious conditions and can approach 150-250 per min.
</p>
<p>
Determination of rate from an EKG can be done by following these easy steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Look for an R wave falling on a 0.2 second period (thick) line.
<li>Count from there the thick black lines in the following sequence
    up to the next R wave:  300, 150, 100, 75, 60, 50.  Likely you
    will see the next R wave prior to the 6th thick line. Try to
    remember this counting sequence.
<li>If the R wave falls on or very near a thick line, the rate
    will be that line.  If the R wave is in between, you can
    say that the rate will be between those numbers.
</ol>

<p>
If an R wave fell on the next thick line after using a marker starting R wave, 
that would be a beat every 0.2 second, or 5 beats per second, which is 300 beats 
per minute.  The next line is double the period, but half the rate, or 150 beats 
per minute.  The next line is triple the period, or a third of 300.  The fourth 
line is 4 times the period, or a fourth of 300, or 75.  Hence we can say that 
the sequence is 300 / x, where x is the next line down.
</p>
<p>
One problem with the above is that is has less statistical power than the method 
described below.  If you calculate the period between a randomly selected set of 
R waves, you are basing the rate only on the period of a single cycle.
</p>
<p>
A better method in that it determines a pseudo-average of the heart rate is to 
mark a number of EKG cycles and then calculate the period it takes them to 
occur.  Marks on the EKG strip occur at 3 seconds and make an easy visual cue 
regarding the passage of time.  If 3 cycles occur over a length of 2 marks, or 6 
seconds, then multiplying by 10 shows the rate is 30 per min.
</p>
<h2>Rhythm</h2>
<p>
Determining the rhythm is largely deciding whether a rhythm observed is regular 
or irregular, and where the rhythm originates.  Normally the rhythm is from the 
SA node. Specialized conduction pathways radiating from the node follow into the 
atrial myocardium.  They also ramify into the myocardium of the atrium, causing 
the atria to beat in a synchronous manner as the wave of depolarization passes 
over the tissue.  The conduction pathways all converge toward the AV node in the 
supraventricular septal region (see figure).
</p>
<p>
 <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/tracts.gif" alt="Heart nerve bundles and tracts">
</p>
<p>
The depolarization wave slows as it passes into the AV node.  Note that
the AV node and the AV junction are distinct (the AV junction and
the bundle of His are the same entity).  No foci for pacemaking
exist in the node itself, but are found in the junction.  Nodal
tissue continues and extends into the His bundle, which bifurcates
into the left and right bundle branches.  They extend to the length
of the intraventricular septum toward the apex, and then ramify
into conduction radiations called Purkinje fibers.  The fibers
represent the terminal endings of the specialized conduction
pathway, contacting with the myocardium.  The conduction system
of the His bundle and bundle branches is extremely rapid.
Impulse conduction in this special tissue if faster per unit
length than for any impulse transmission occurring in other
tissue structures.
</p>
<p>
 <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/hisbundle.gif" alt="Bundle of His and bundle branches">
</p>
<p>
With the understanding of impulse transmission and the source of rhythm,
we can look at rhythm itself.
</p>
<p>
A normal rhythm is really a series of EKG cycles that occur with approximately 
equally spaced periods.  There is a consistent presentation with respect to time 
and depolarization appearance of the waves.
</p>
<p>
An <b>arrythmia</b> is anything deviating from the normal rhythm. Arrythmias can 
be considered in several categories:  (1) irregular rhythms, (2) <q>Escape</q> 
or premature beats, (3) rapid ectopic rhythms, and (4) heart blocks.
</p>
<p>
<i>Irregular rhythms</i> show variations in rate and in the EKG signature. 
<b>Sinus arrhythmia</b> is a condition seen usually in the cycle of respiration, 
in which rate increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration.  All 
P waves are identical in appearance, which is a clue that all beats originate 
from one node, which must be the sinus node.  Hence the signature doesn't change 
but the rate does.
</p>
<p>
The rate may also appear to increase and decrease in a cyclical fashion as well, 
but this may not be coincident with respiratory cycles.  In this case, the P 
waves from one to another are likely to be different in appearance too.  If they 
are all different from one to another, this means that sinus rhythm is lost or 
is not in effect control, and that many foci in the atria likely are responsible 
for the observed beat. This condition is called the <b>wandering pacemaker</b>. 
If the average rhythm is found to exceed 100 per min rate, the condition is 
likely <b>multifocal atrial tachycardia</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Atrial fibrillation</b> is marked by an EKG in which normal QRS complexes 
occur at an irregular, perhaps semi-regular rate, but no P waves are observed. 
The baseline may look extremely noisy if the signal is especially amplified. 
Atrial fibrillation is usually caused by the continuous, rapid firing of 
multiple foci. When the AV node recovers during the normal cycle, it does 
transmit a normal depolarization wave to the ventricles, which beat in a 
coordinated manner.  Atrial contraction is erratic however.  Whenever P waves 
are discernible in a trace, atrial fibrillation can be ruled out.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Escape</i></b> or <b><i>premature beats</i></b> result from the usually 
normal depolarization discharge of an ectopic focus responding to its natural 
rhythm. It occurs because a too long pause has occurred in the node normally 
responsible for pacemaking.  Lesions in the SA node are usually suggested with 
the appearance of escape beats found to originate in atrial foci. The EKG shows 
extended periods from R to R, with a normal QRS complex in the beat following. 
If a P wave looks different in the cycle following the elongated period than the 
one preceding, it is likely to be an atrial escape beat.
</p>
<h3>Escape Beats</h3>
<p>
An <i>AV junctional escape beat</i> occurs after perhaps an even longer pause 
than would occur had there been an atrial escape beat.  If such a beat occurs, 
there are no P waves observed.  Any slow rate (40-60 per min) occurring in an 
individual with no P waves present indicates pacemaking set strictly by an AV 
junctional rhythm.
</p>
<p>
A <i>ventricular escape beat</i> may also be observed after an especially long 
pause in the rhythm.  There will be no observable P wave, and the QRS complex 
will not appear normal at all.   What complex that do appears shows peaks 
widened period indicating a slowness of impulse transmission, since impulses 
origniating in ventricular myocardium would be extremely slow.
</p>
<h3>Premature beats/contractions</h3>
<p>
<b>Premature</b> beats are not truly escape beats although they originate from 
an ectopic focus.  They are beats that occur earlier than expected.
</p>
<p>
<i>Premature atrial beats</i> will be noted by the presence of a P wave that 
differs from the P waves in preceding cycles or in the cycles considered to be 
part of a normal rhythm. Premature beats with P waves different from one another 
indicate multiple foci may be involved.
</p>
<p>
<i>Premature junctional beats</i> will be marked by an absence of P waves 
although their QRS complexes should appear normal, if slightly widened (longer 
in duration).  In some cases, <b><i>retrograde conduction</i></b> can occur with 
premature junctional beats.  P waves may be apparent as inverted waves appearing 
just before or after a QRS complex, or they may appear within the QRS altering 
its appearance slightly.
</p>
<p>
<i>Premature ventricular contractions</i> or<i> premature ventricular 
complex</i> (P.V.C.) originates entirely within the ventricular myocardium and 
causes the appearance of an abnormal complex, with long duration.  The complex 
is not different in appearance than in a escape ventricular beat, just that it 
is premature.  A long pause will follow PVCs as the ventricle 
re-polarizes/recovers in a way not typical of the repolarization process. It 
will be notices that the amplitudes on these complexes with beats in ventricular 
foci are larger and deviations from baseline are longer compared to the smaller 
QRS of the normal beat.  This is because ventricular depolarization along the 
bundle branches and into the ventricles is split between a right and left and 
with depolarization going in the opposite directions.  This tends to lower the 
amplitude of the changes observed in the leads.
</p>
<p>
It is important to trace the appearance of each PVC that may be present on an 
EKG to see if they are identical or there are differences in the trace.  This 
will establish if PVCs are unifocal or multifocal.  PVCs are generally an 
indication that the coronary blood flow is insufficient, and more than 6 PVCs 
occurring per minute indicates severe pathology.  Other causes of PVCs may be 
inadequate oxygenation (blood flow is good, but oxygen tension is low) or 
because of certain drugs such as stimulants.
</p>
<p>
PVCs occurring every other beat to a normal beat with regularity is a condition 
called <b>ventricular bigeminy</b>. PVCs occurring once in between every two 
normal beats is <b>ventricular trigeminy</b>.   And one PVC for every three 
normal beats is <b>ventricular quadrigeminy</b>.  In these cases, PVCs appear to 
be <q>coupled</q> to normal beats. When a ventricular focus seems to alternate 
with another pacemaker (usually the sinus node), this condition is called 
<b>ventricular parasystole</b>.  Sometimes a single focus will be the source of 
PVCs seen to fire in rapid succession, an indication of a very serious condition 
(an infarction is likely).  But more serious is multifocal PVCs, since they are 
likely to mask for most of time any normal rhythm that may be occurring. 
Multifocal PVCs tend to degenerate over time into <b>ventricular 
fibrillation</b>, and would indicate impending infarction processes.
</p>
<p>
A type of PVC that requires especially close observation is the PVC that occurs 
on top of a T wave of a normal beat (the <q>R on T</q> phenomenon).  This PVC 
has occurred before the ventricles could adequately repolarize, it indicates 
particularly electrically irritable tissue which will likely because a problem 
in arrhythmia.
</p>
<p>
While the sinus node is normally responsible for pacing, it may happen that an 
impulse does not originate from the node and the beat is <q>escaped.</q>  The 
sinus node may once again resume the pacing.  This condition would be 
characterized as <b>sinus block</b>.  However, if it is determined that the 
sinus node has lost its ability to pace at all, the condition becomes <b>sinus 
arrest</b>.
</p>
<p>
Rapid ectopic arrhythmias can be classified according to rates that they assume. 
<b>Paroxysmal tachycardias</b> are rhythms with rates between 150-250 per 
minute.  <b>Flutters</b> show discernible cycles on an EKG but are extremely 
rapid at 250-350 per minute.  <b>Fibrillations</b> are essentially rapidly 
discharging foci which provide no coordinate cycling, but the total number of 
discharges, whatever the source, exceed 350 per minute.
</p>
<h3>Paroxysmal tachycardias</h3>
<p>
<i>Paroxysmal tachycardia</i> really means <q>sudden rapid heart rate.</q>  It 
should be distinguished from sinus tachycardia that may occur in response to 
stress, exercise, or use of medication.  <i>Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia</i> 
results from an ectopic focus, and it assumes the rhythm.  The P waves should be 
distinguished from the sinus nodal P waves.  If paroxysmal atrial tachycardia 
with a 1:1 block, in which there  s a P wave with no QRS followed by P wave with 
normal QRS, this pattern is typical of digitalis toxicity. The block occurs at 
the AV node.  In particular, if there is hypokalemia, administering potassium 
should be helpful.
</p>
<p>
<i>Paroxysmal</i> (<i>AV</i>) <i>junctional tachycardia</i> can occur to, but 
with the absence of P waves generally. P waves may be observed if retrograde 
conduction is occurring. In that event they are likely observed just before or 
after the QRS complexes.  Both paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and paroxysmal 
junctional tachycardia are lumped into the category <b>paroxysmal 
supraventricular tachycardias</b>, since the focus originates in places other 
than the ventricles.
</p>
<p>
<i>Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia</i>, also called just ventricular 
tachycardia, is a rapid rate with PVC-like traces having a consistent pattern. 
A normal supraventricular rate is still likely, and might be seen by distinct P 
waves seen between certain abnormal complexes.  Also in rare instances, a 
depolarization cycle will appear different and probably be a case where a 
regular beat penetrated into the ventricular system while the ventricles 
repolarized.  With <q>V Tach,</q> emergency medical care is necessary as there 
may be something wrong with coronary blood flow or the tissue is poorly 
oxygenated.
</p>
<h3>Flutters</h3>
<p>
<i>Atrial flutter</i> is typically caused by an ectopic
focus in the atria.  It is observed as a rapid succession
of P waves, most not generally accompaned by QRS complexes.
QRS complexes do occur usually at a regular rhythm,
in which case a depolarization wave properly penetrated
the AV node, probably because the node finished a normal
repolarization cycle.  The P waves are all likely to look
identical since the condition is unifocal.  The succession
of flutter waves will look to be a sawtooth pattern.
Atrial flutter is distinguished from paroxysmal atrial tachycardia
with block  largely because there are apparent baselines
in the latter condition and largely because of the apparent
differences in rate (150-250 per min in the latter, &gt;250 in flutter).
</p>
<p>
<i>Ventricular flutter</i> is characterized by an EKG trace
with complexes appearing pretty much like undulating sine waves.
This flutter never lasts long and degenerates into ventricular
fibrillation or total arrest.  In ventricular flutter, it is
not possible to fill the ventricles with blood and there is
no real cardiac output.
</p>
<h3>Fibrillations</h3>
<p>
Fibrillations are clearly discharges from multiple foci, since no single focus 
could recover for discharge at such a rapid rate.  Muscular contraction does not 
occur in any coordinated sense, so the condition is unproductive. <i>Atrial 
fibrillation</i> can be observed on the EKG as a series of normal appearing QRS 
complexes with irregular rhythm.  There are no P waves, but the baseline is not 
exactly flat.  The QRS complexes occur irregular as some signals from the atria 
penetrate into the otherwise normal ventricular conduction system.  Note the 
ventricular rate in atrial fib may be slow or fast depending on the sensitivity 
of the AV node to stimulation, but it is always irregular in rhythm. 
<i>Ventricular fibrillation</i> is caused by multiple foci, some or all of them 
discharging rapidly or collectively discharging somewhat rapidly but not in 
phase.  The EKG trace will appear with no detectable pattern. Amplitudes will 
differ, depending on the responsiveness of the myocardium to stimulation.  In 
general, the amplitude falls off with time as the myocardium dies.
</p>
<h3>Asystolic conditions</h3>
<p>
<b>Cardiac arrest</b> can be characterized as three types, but they all have in 
common that there is no cardiac output. One is <i>ventricular fibrillation</i>, 
discussed above. A second is <b><i>cardiac standstill</i></b> or 
<b><i>asystole</i></b>, in which no electrical activity is seen on an EKG.  The 
third type is <b><i>electromechanical dissociation</i></b> (EMD), in which an 
EKG shows weak electrical activity with a regular trace, but the myocardium is 
too moribund to respond mechanically.
</p>
<h2>Heart Blocks</h2>
<p>
<b>Heart Blocks</b> are signified by the apparent retardation or prevention of 
an electrical conduction.  They can be traced on an EKG to occur after the point 
of the sinus node, AV node, or in the bundle branches, or as a <i>hemiblock</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sinus blocks</i> may occur as a result of a lesion in or outside (but on the 
conduction pathway) of the sinus node. The presence of a long gap about two 
cycles in duration indicate a missed sinus beat.  The rate may resume at a 
normal pace.  An escape beat may occur but not always; it is identified by the 
appearance of the P wave.
</p>
<h3>Atrioventricular Blocks</h3>
<p>
<i>Atrioventricular blocks</i> are more common and are characterized as 
occurring in three degrees.  <b>1&deg; AV block</b> is characterized merely as a 
long delay in ventricular depolarization and not by a missed ventricular beat. 
It is the consistent (regular) occurrence of a prolonged PR interval exceeding 
0.2 seconds (the travel between thick lines).  The P-R interval is measured from 
the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex. This interval is 
usually much less than 200 millisecond. It is possible that the average P-R 
interval falls less than 200 ms, but the appearance of some cycles with 
prolonged P-R intervals may signal an impending true block.
</p>
<p>
Two types of <b>2&deg; AV block</b> are observed. The <b>Wenckebach 2&deg; 
block</b> shows a consistent pattern of ever increasing P-R intervals between 
successive cycles until, after one P wave, there is no QRS complex observed (a 
missed ventricular beat).  This pattern is repeated, as shorter P-R intervals 
become longer ones and then there is a missed beat.  This pattern is also called 
<i>Mobitz I</i>.  The other type of 2&deg; AV block is <b>Mobitz II 2&deg; AV 
block.</b>  This is seen merely as a frequent missing QRS complex with regular 
P-R intervals rather than gradually increasing P-R intervals. The frequency of 
missed ventricular beats is characterized as <b>2:1 AV block Mobitz II</b> if a 
QRS complex is missed every other beat, meaning 2 P waves for every 1 QRS. A 3:1 
AV block Mobitz II means that a QRS complex occurs after seeing three P waves, 
or three atrial beats for every ventricular beat.  An atrial beat rate (as 
measured by P waves) could be 90-100 per minute, but the ventricular rate could 
35-40 per minute (just faster than an escape rhythm in the ventricles) in a 3:1 
block.
</p>
<p>
<b>3&deg; AV block</b> is also called <q>complete</q> block.  Sustaining the 
ventricular rhythm may originate in one of two places in this case.  If there is 
no block from the AV junction, an independent ventricular beat rate is 
established with normally appearing QRS complexes but at a rate of 40-60 per 
minute.  If there is a lesion in the conduction pathway from the junction 
however, escape ventricular beat establish the rhythm. The ventricular 
depolarization complexes are PVC-like although they are in fact escape beats. 
The complexes may all look the same since one particularly sensitive focus in 
the ventricles will assume the main beat. A ventricular escape beat will be 
distinguished from junctional pacing largely because the rate is slower and 
because of the vast differences in the appearance of QRS complexes.  However, at 
times the trace of the ventricular depolarization complex looks different in 
either a junctional or ectopic ventricular rhythm because a P wave from the 
independently beating supraventricular focus is superimposed on the trace.
</p>
<h3>Bundle Branch Blocks</h3>
<p>
Lesions in the bundle branches can lead to a block of conduction to either the 
right ventricle (<b>right bundle branch block</b>) or the left ventricle 
(<b>left bundle branch block</b>).  Bundle branch blocks are somewhat easy to 
spot.  They are the occurrences of very wide QRS complexes with peak splitting 
of the R wave (R and R&prime; wave).  This occurs because the ventricle subject 
to the block depolarizes late as it receives the depolarization wave from the 
other ventricle myocardium rather than down the rapid conductive pathway.  In 
some cases it may only be a delay rather than complete block of the lesioned 
pathway.  The split peaks are actually manifestations of two QRS complexes 
superimposed on one another.  In the normally conductive system, they are in 
phase.  But with the delay, they ventricular depolarizations are out of phase. 
The duration of the entire QRS is longer than 120 ms. Note that in checking the 
QRS width, it is better to check the limb leads rather than the chest leads 
since their amplitudes cause greater deflection of the machine needle, and the 
needle responsiveness lags in a manner that improperly reflects the time of 
certain events.
</p>
<p>
It is important to note that bundle branch block accompanied by a paroxysmal 
supraventricular tachycardia can produce a trace that looks much like 
ventricular tachycardia. Carefully examine the trace of all leads to distinguish 
these conditions and consider that bundle branch block was identified prior to 
the occurrence of any type of tachycardia.
</p>
<p>
How does one distinguish right from left bundle branch block? The chest leads 
reveal which branch is blocked. V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> are the right 
chest leads, V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> are the left leads. After observing 
that all leads show a widened QRS complex to indicate a potential bundle branch 
block, the appearance of R-R&prime; peak splitting in the <i>right</i> chest 
leads signals <i>right</i> bundle branch block.  There should be no apparent 
splitting in the left chest leads.  Conversely the appearance R-R&prime; peak 
splitting in the <i>left</i> chest leads indicates <i>left</i> bundle branch 
block; the right leads should show no splitting.  Why is this true? If there is 
right bbb, the right leads will be sensitive to depolarizations occurring on the 
left side of the heart while there is no electrical activity in the right. As 
the depolarization wave moves from the left ventricle there should then be a 
second wave of activity slightly greater in amplitude as it passes over the 
right ventricle over which the lead sits.  The left chest leads on the other 
hand will sense only the depolarization of the left ventricle, with its more 
massive mass while the delayed polarization of the right ventricle is seen as a 
long continuation of the tail of the R wave.  It is possible that a split R 
waves can occur in only one chest lead, and these may be hard to see.
</p>
<p>
Note that while it is possible to identify Q-wave infarctions (discussed below) 
on EKG, when left bundle branch block occurs, its Q wave is obscured and cannot 
be understood.  For this reason, infarctions must be identified by means other 
than an EKG.  Also with the presence of bundle branch block, it is difficult to 
understand the true Mean QRS vector (Axis) or venticular hypertrophy.
</p>
<h3>Wolff-Parkinson-White</h3>
<p>
There are in some persons accessory conduction pathways that bypass the usual AV 
junction to the interventricular bundle branches.  These accessory pathways can 
manifest as a potentially pathologic condition in which ventricular 
depolarization proceeds without the usual delay.  That is, the accessory pathway 
short-circuits the usual depolarization route.  The P-R segment in this case is 
not flat, but usually immediately following the P wave, the trace ascends in a 
convex arc toward the R peak, such that the Q wave is indistinct. This arcing 
trace (an ascent on the appropriate leads) is called a <q>delta wave.</q>  There 
is in effect a shortened P-R interval and prolonged QRS complex. It represent 
premature depolarization of the ventricles.
</p>
<p>
Where the ventricular and atrial walls meet, there is an accessory bundle of 
Kent which may underlie the occurrence of WPW.
</p>
<p>
WPW is important because people with such accessory pathways may suffer from 
paroxysmal tachycardia by one of two mechanisms:
</p>
<ol>
<li>the reverse of WPW can occur when re-entrant  premature
depolarization of the atria may occur when ventricular
depolarizations penetrate through these accessory pathways;
<li>any supraventricular tachycardia, not always necessarily
resulting in ventricular tachycardia, can now make ventricular
tachycardia possible via the accessory pathways.  As far as
the latter, atrial arrhythmias may be isolated when accessory
pathways do not complicate matters.
</ol>

<h2>Axis</h2>
<p>
The mean QRS vector or Axis is the net direction of the depolarization waves 
passing throughout the myocardium. As the QRS represents the entire period of 
ventricular depolarization, and the ventricles make up a large amount of the 
muscle mass, this is typically used to indicate the axis.
</p>
<p>
The depolarization route proceeding from the AV junction travels down the bundle 
branches which move toward the apex of the heart and then ramify in many 
branches to smaller fibers which line the endocardial surface. The 
depolarization then proceeds across the wall toward the epicardial side of the 
myocardium. The left ventricular wall is also thicker than the right ventricular 
wall, and so ought to account for a higher magnitude of the signal.  In addition 
there is a net direction, from left to right, within the septum itself, despite 
the presence of the bundle branches.
</p>
<p>
The sum of the vectors in a tissue block, both in direction and magnitude, 
provides the net QRS vector.  The vector origin is at the AV node, as that is 
where the ventricular depolarization sequence originates.  The vector usually is 
downward and to the left from the anatomical position. In assigning the 
direction, the angle is computed with the 0&deg; mark pointing to the body's 
left and proceeding clockwise in the frontal plane.  Hence the typical QRS 
vector falls between 0&deg; and +90&deg;.  Generally angles in the plane are 
represented as 0&deg; to +90&deg; to 180&deg; for positive angles, and 0&deg; to 
&minus;90&deg; to 180&deg; for negative angles.
</p>
<p>
Determination of a vector can entertain many possibilities:
</p>
<ol>
<li>it can represent a <b><i>displacement</i></b> of the heart,
a rotation of its mass from the typical angle.

<li>it can indicate <b><i>hypertrophy</i></b>, particularly
left ventricular hypertrophy, as changes in transmural mass
affect vector magnitude and direction.

<li>perhaps most important, it can reveal <b><i>infarction</i></b>
of tissue, since necrotic tissue is essentially nonconductive.
</ol>

<p>
In general the axis will point <i>toward</i> hypertrophy and <i>away</i> from 
the site of infarctions.  An axis can only be reliably determined from a 12-lead 
EKG.
</p>
<p>
In determining the vector, it is important to remember that the depolarization 
wave is a movement of positive charge toward an electrode positive with respect 
to an electrode poised on the other side of the depolarization direction. If the 
QRS on lead I is swung mostly positive on the chart, then knowing that the limb 
lead is left arm more positive than the right arm, we can understand that the 
axis at least points between +90&deg; and &minus;90&deg;. The analysis of the 
other leads will now narrow down the angle.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes checking only one lead will suggest an abnormality. Right axis 
deviation would be an axis between +90&deg; and &minus;90&deg;, through the 
180&deg; angle.  This is outside the usual range.  Inspection of limb lead I 
alone, with a mostly negative QRS complex, would immediately indicate right axis 
deviation.
</p>
<p>
Lead aV<sub>F</sub> is another useful lead for inspecting.  It splits the 
0&deg;&mdash;180&deg; axis into a negative superior half and positive inferior 
half.  If the depolarization axis falls in the normal range, the QRS on 
aV<sub>F</sub> should show a mostly positive swing.  If QRS is mostly negative, 
the axis is swung to a superior direction.
</p>
<p>
The combination of a postive QRS in aV<sub>F</sub> and in limb lead I by itself 
indicates an axis within the normal range of a depolarization vector.  A 
positive QRS in lead I and a negative QRS in aV<sub>F</sub> indicates <i>left 
axis deviation</i>. And any negative QRS in lead I encompasses all indications 
of <i>right axis deviation</i>.  It should be noted that when lead I QRS 
complexes are negative combined with a negative QRS in aV<sub>F</sub>, this is 
often called <i>extreme right axis deviation</i>.
</p>
<p>
Depolarizations which occur in an Axis perpendicular to any limb lead 
effectively are seen as <b><i>isoelectric</i></b> traces.  Normally a flat 
baseline is expected, but in reality, a very small deflection of the QRS of the 
lead most perpendicular to the axis is seen. The integrated areas of the 
deflections upward and downward from the baseline of the trace would be 
approximately equal (or alternatively, summing all the peak areas such that 
negative peaks produce negative areas and positive swings positive areas would 
add to zero or close to it).  It is often useful to inspect the lead with the 
most isoelectric character in its trace, as that would be 90&deg; to the QRS 
vector.  In the typical trace, where the axis falls within the normal range, 
that means that leads aV<sub>L</sub> and III should show the most isoelectric 
character.
</p>
<p>
The determination of the axis so far has been from the 6 limb leads, giving a 
two-dimensional plane for the vector.  However, including the 6 precordial 
(chest) leads will provide a third dimension which can be clinically important. 
Lead V<sub>2</sub>, placed just left of the sternum in the 4th costal 
interspace, is located virtually anterior to the heart.  In a typical trace, the 
QRS complex of lead V<sub>2</sub> is predominantly negative.  This is because 
the massive left ventricle is positioned posteriorly, i.e., the septum of the 
heart is not oriented such that a transverse section would indicate a posterior 
to anterior crossing.  Rather the septum is very obliquely angled such that the 
right ventricle is located more anterior the left ventricle. Since the left 
ventricular wall is a larger component of the net depolarization vector, the QRS 
axis is therefore angled posterior to the body.  Hence the net axis is to the 
left, is inferior, and is posterior.
</p>
<p>
Lead V<sub>2</sub> is a chest lead quite critical in understanding the 
differences in anterior and posterior left ventricular wall infarctions.  As for 
the other chest leads, the trend in the healthy heart is for the right chest 
leads to have generally negatively oriented QRS complexes, and for the left 
chest leads to show very positive QRS traces.  Leads V<sub>3</sub> and 
V<sub>4</sub> represent the transitional zone as they tend to be isoelectric.
</p>
<p>
Cardiologists may refer to changes in the axis in the horizontal plane (the 
plane formed by the chest leads) as either <i>clockwise</i> or 
<i>counterclockwise</i> rotations, the rotational direction relative to the 
patient. Consider that you are looking at the heart of the patient from the feet 
of the patient, and if the axis moves to the patient's right, you would see it 
as a counterclockwise rotation.  A shift of the horiztonal plane component to 
the right of the patient, a counter-clockwise rotation, would be seen in leads 
V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> as more positive traces in the QRS relative to 
the usual. Note that shifts in the Axis in the frontal plane seen by the limb 
leads is <b>axis deviation</b> while shifts in the horizontal plane seen in the 
chest leads is <b>axis rotation</b>.
</p>
<p>
Another vector important in understanding cardiac
physiology is the T wave (ventricular repolarization) vector.
The angle (direction) of the vector is pretty much determined
on the same principles as determining the QRS, from the
12 lead EKG, although you can get by with 6 leads too.
Generally with the angle of the T wave vector is more
than 60&deg; from the QRS vector, a pathological condition
is indicated.
</p>

<h2>Hypertrophy</h2>
<p>
Hypertrophy essentially describes a thickening of the muscle mass, although it 
is really a dilation.  For example, when a tissue mass composed cells 
hypertrophies, there is no change in the number of cells such as through active 
cell division and mitosis.  Rather the volume of the cells, each of them, is 
what has increased.  In cases where tissue has enlarged and it is due to the 
number of cells which has increased rather than their size, then the condition 
is <b>hyperplasia</b>.
</p>
<p>
Chest lead V<sub>1</sub> is ideally positioned (just to the right of the sternum 
in the 4th costal interspace) over the atria and provides the best information 
about changes to atrial muscle mass.  If atrial hypertrophy obtains, then the P 
wave of the lead will likely be <i>diphasic</i>, meaning that significant 
positive and negative deviations from the baseline are seen.  In generally, P 
waves trace out only along one side of the baseline.
</p>
<p>
From the P wave in the trace, one can ascertain which atrial chamber is 
hypetrophied.  Normally if the initial component of the diphasic P wave is 
larger, this indicates a right atrial hypertrophy.  Recall that the SA node is 
located posterior to the right atrium and that conduction proceeds along bundles 
to the left atrium, while at the same time the right atrial wall myocardium is 
beginning its depolarization.  Even if a P wave is <i>not</i> diphasic, a P wave 
amplitude larger than normal (greater than 2.5 mm on the EKG strip), right 
atrial hypertrophy should be suspected.
</p>
<p>
If the terminal component of a diphasic P wave is large (in period and 
amplitude), sweeping negative in lead V<sub>1</sub>, then left atrial 
hypertrophy should be considered.  Left atrial hypertrophy has many causes, 
among which are mitral valve stenoses.
</p>
<p>
Ventricular hypertrophies can be assessed in the QRS complexes not surprisingly. 
Here again the precordial lead V<sub>1</sub> can indicate a problem.  Normally 
the S wave in V<sub>1</sub> is prominent and negative in the lead, in 
consideration of the 3-dimensional axis in the healthy heart.  The R wave sweeps 
positive slightly. With <i>right</i> ventricular hypertrophy, the R wave is now 
seen to be prominent and the S wave is minimal. Recall that the right ventricle 
is oriented more anterior to the left ventricle in the chest cavity, and that 
the larger component of the mean QRS axis is influenced by the normally larger 
left ventricle.  In right ventricular hypertrophy, the right ventricle now 
<q>competes</q> with the left to serve as a major component of the net vector. 
The vector oriented previously posteriorly, may now be oriented anteriorly upon 
determination of the net vector.  With right ventricular hypertrophy, we are 
likely to observe right axis deviation (in the frontal plane) and 
counter-clockwise axis rotation (in the horizontal plane).
</p>
<p>
Other chest leads will also reveal right ventricular hypertrophy.  From 
V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>4</sub>, the R wave will be seen to be more prominent 
while the S wave become slightly more prominent.
</p>
<p>
Left ventricular hypertrophy will be accompanied by both left axis deviation and 
clockwise axis rotation.  A prominent clue to this condition are not transitions 
in the from-baseline sweeps as seen in right ventricular hypertrophy, but rather 
in the amplitudes of all the chest leads.  Because there is now a much larger 
than normal left ventricular wall mass, the depolarization vector should be now 
larger in magnitude.  This shows up on the trace as R (or S, for negatively 
sweeping complexes) waves being several millimeters longer than normal, and 
slightly wider QRS complexes, in view that the depolarization period should be a 
little longer. Lead V<sub>1</sub> will have an obviously larger S wave, while 
lead V<sub>5</sub> will show a larger than usual R wave.  Lead V<sub>5</sub> 
when ideally positioned is the chest lead closest to the left ventricle, and so 
is in the best position for assessing the magnitude of left ventricular 
depolarization.  Lead V<sub>1</sub> is the lead positioned (ideally) the 
farthest away, and so its S wave will be most negative.  As a rule if the sum of 
the amplitudes of the R wave of V<sub>5</sub> and the S wave of V<sub>1</sub> is 
greater than 35 mm on the strip, left ventricular hypertrophy should be 
suspected.
</p>
<p>
The T wave also provides the final clue to left ventricular hypertrophy.  With 
this condition, the T wave is both <i>inverted</i> and <i>asymmetrical</i>.  As 
far as its asymmetry, the T wave appears a continuation of the QRS complex, 
sweeping slowly/gradually to its apex, then returning to baseline rapidly.  The 
T wave represents ventricular repolarization.  The left venticle is still larger 
than the right ventricle in the healthy heart although not hypertrophied.  Now 
the left ventricle is much larger than the right ventricle, and an asymmetry in 
the repolarization process is all the more apparent in the T wave.
</p>
<p>

   alt="T wave inversion and asymmetry in hypertrophy">
</p>
<p>
<b>Ventricular strain</b> is a hypertrophy-associated condition that can be 
observed in the EKG strip.  In ventricular strain the ST segment deviates from 
baseline (is depressed) and is not flat (it is humped).  The strain of the 
ventricle is understandable in that hypertrophy may cause structural changes, 
such as increasing resistance of the valves, or it may indicate increased 
vascular resistance in atherosclerotic conditions. Hypertrophy of the muscle 
mass is an attempt to compensate. The figure below generally illustrates the 
appearance of the trace.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/ventstrain.gif"
  alt="ST segment humping and depression in ventricular straining">
</p>
<p>
As a review of how hypertrophy is understood in the EKG, note very well the 
importance of lead V<sub>1</sub>. Its P wave will be the most significant since 
the lead is positioned most closely to the atria relative to any other.  The P 
wave may be diphasic in which the magnitude of one component or another 
indicates the atrial chamber affected.  In right ventricular hypertrophy, the R 
wave sweeps more positive (it normally shows a negative S as the most prominent) 
than even in V<sub>2</sub> or successive leads.  And in left ventricular 
hypertrophy, the magnitude of the V<sub>1</sub> lead S wave is used in 
determining the condition along with the V<sub>5</sub> lead R wave magnitude.
</p>
<h2>Infarction</h2>
<p>
The most common cause of myocardial infarctions is either arterioslcerotic 
plaques with occlude a coronary artery, or by a clot formation around such a 
plaque which can occlude the artery.  Less common causes can be overexertion or 
overexercise, especially in the unconditioned (unfit) individual, drug use, or 
bacterial or viral infections (or sometimes parasitic infection).
</p>
<p>
Although infarctions can occur in any part of the heart, in the atrial or 
ventricular myocardium, the most common areas subject to infarction are in the 
left ventricular areas.  The left ventricular myocardium works harder than 
perhaps any other region of the myocardium, as it is responsible for moving 
blood throughout the body, and the body's vessels provide stiff resistance to 
the heart's pumping action.  This is one reason why the left ventricular wall is 
thicker.  The thickness of a myocardial wall is proportional the blood supply it 
will require from the coronary arteries.  When the coronary blood supply is 
restricted or partially occluded, the myocardial mass in the greatest proportion 
is likely to suffer.
</p>
<p>
Physicians think of acute myocardial pathologies as a <q>triad letter 'I'</q> of 
conditions: <b><i>ischemia</i></b>, <b><i>injury</i></b>, and 
<b><i>infarction</i></b>, in which any three can be present without the other.
</p>
<p>
<i>Ischemia</i> refers to any condition in which a blood supply has been reduced 
to the point where a tissue or cells therein suffer from a pathological change. 
Ischemia in the ventricle or ventricles can be seen as <i>inverted symmetrical T 
waves</i>.  There may be no infarction present, but ischemia is a minimal 
diagnosis.  The chest leads are the best to check for T wave inversion, although 
the inversion should also be seen in limb leads as well.
</p>
<p>
<i>Injury</i> will indicate the acuteness (the immediate seriousness) of an 
infarct.  The EKG trace in this circumstance shows significant ST segment 
elevation (see figure).  The degree of ST elevation is an indicator of the 
severity (acuteness, extent) of injury.  It may be only a few millimeters or it 
may be ten or more millimeters.
</p>
<p><img
 src="imagesEKGinfoHTML/STelevation.gif"
 alt="ST segment elevation in injury">
<p>
When an infarction is recent (most acute) the ST segment will elevate to its 
highest level and will gradually return to baseline as the infarct heals.  If 
there are no Q waves a ssociated with the ST elevation, the myocardial 
infarction is called a <b><i>non-Q wave myocardial infarction</i></b>. It is 
generally an infarct with a small extent, but it could indicate the coming of a 
larger infarction.  With any ST segment elevation, serial enzyme studies should 
be ordered, as they will also fix the time of the infarct.
</p>
<p>
Conditions other than infarctions may also result in ST segment elevation and 
should be ruled out.  A <b>ventricular aneurysm</b> will elevate the ST segment, 
but in this case the trace never returns to baseline and remains elevated. 
<b>Pericarditis</b> can similarly affect an ST segment elevation, but the T wave 
that follow is not near nor is returned to the baseline.  Look for flat or 
concave ST segments followed by T waves too far from the baseline. Moreover, the 
P wave of the following cycle may be slightly lifted from the baseline as the 
trace slowly gradually returns to baseline.  Examine all leads to perceive the 
nature of the ST segment and the relationship of the T wave to baseline.
</p>
<p>
Where ST segment <i>depression</i> is observed, several conditions are also to 
be considered.  (1) If the patient is on digitalis therapy, consider digitalis 
toxicity immediately.  In fact, monitoring the ST segment on the EKG of a 
patient on digitalis should be considered standard practice for this kind of 
treatment.  (2) Sometimes patients experiencing angina show ST segment 
depression, but this resolves when the angina does.  (3) Patients with coronary 
ischemia will show ST segment depression when exercised in a Stress Test.  The 
depression of the segment may last the duration of the exercise.  This would 
indicate a positive test for ischemia.  (4) Subendocardial infarctions (not 
transmural) will also show depressed ST segments. The segment appears as a 
classical flat line very distant from the baseline leading to the T wave, which 
starts off the baseline.  (The end of the T wave usually returns to baseline.) 
Subendocardial infarctions are also non-Q wave infarctions, and although not 
transmural, they may signal an impending larger infarction.
</p>
<p>
With any ST segment elevation or depression that is not transient in existence, 
enzyme studies should be ordered.
</p>

<h3>Q-Wave Myocardial Infarctions</h3>
<p>
Myocardial infarctions are usually diagnosed by the presence of significant Q 
waves, which are normally absent in most leads.  (Recall that a Q wave is the 
first <i>downward</i> deflection from baseline following a P wave.  Any wave 
that begins upward is automatically called an R wave, and there is <i>no</i> Q 
wave.  A downward wave following an upward wave would be called an S wave.)  Q 
waves are barely noticeable in the healthy heart (look at limb leads I and II, 
and chest leads V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> as examples).  The presence of 
tiny Q waves represents septal depolarization.
</p>
<p>
Q waves become significant when (1) the amplitude of the Q wave is equal to or 
greater than 0.33 of the sum of the Q and R wave amplitudes OR (2) the duration 
of the Q wave is greater than 40 milliseconds (a travel of 1 mm on the strip). 
For the first case, determine the R wave amplidtude, say 10 mm, and the Q wave 
amplitude, say 5 mm, then calculate:  5 mm Q wave / (5 mm Q wave + 10 mm R wave) 
= 0.33.  Here the Q wave is judged to be significant and a myocardial infarction 
is likely. Although amplitude calculations remain important in discussing Q-wave 
myocardial infarctions, specialists now consider the duration of Q waves to be 
more important.
</p>
<p>
Proper understanding of Q-wave infarctions comes from examining all 12 leads. 
Examine all leads but the aV<sub>R</sub> limb lead closely for the size and 
duration of Q waves. The reason aV<sub>R</sub> is excluded is because its 
apparent first downward wave is not a Q wave but an R wave.  It sits opposite 
lead II in the frontal plane and gives misleading information regarding Q wave 
phenomena. In examining all leads, it is good practice to note which leads show:
</p>
<ol>
<li>significant Q waves,
<li>ST segment elevations or depressions, and
<li>T wave inversions, alone or in combination.
</ol>
<p>
Q waves in chest leads V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>, and 
V<sub>4</sub> signify an <b><i>anterior</i></b>ly oriented infarction.  Normally 
these leads always begin with an upward and not downward trace, hence there are 
no Q waves.  Leads V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> normally have tiny Q waves 
and so should be excluded in this particular analysis.  Infarctions in the 
anterior are likely to involve the right ventricle because of the heart 
orientation.  Q waves that appear prominent particularly in the leads 
V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> may involve septal infarctions (this is the 
<q>anterior</q> wall of the left ventricle), according to some cardiologists.
</p>
<p>
Hence the chest leads most anterior in the horizontal plane should show 
signficant Q waves.  Why?  The net QRS vector has now shifted to a more 
posteriorly oriented direction in the horizontal plane, as the anterior portion 
is necrotic and electrically dead.  This greater orientation to the posterior 
would mean negative deflections on the EKG of the anterior (right and center) 
chest leads.  Depolarization waves no longer sweep toward them (making such a 
sweep positive from the baseline on the trace) as they are situated over dead or 
electrically nonresponsive tissue.  Hence the first wave on these leads is not 
R, but Q.
</p>
<p>
Q waves present in limb leads I <i>and</i> aV<sub>L</sub> indicate 
<b><i>lateral</i></b> wall infarctions.  The lateral wall of the heart is the 
wall <i>leftmost</i> in the heart. Lead I is in an ideal position to understand 
left-right changes in depolarization vectors as it falls on the 0-180&deg; axis. 
Lead aV<sub>L</sub> is only 30&deg; of this axis, and is useful as well.  With 
lateral wall infarctions, the net QRS axis shows axis deviation to the right and 
rotation counterclockwise.  Right side depolarization (not necessarily right 
ventricular depolarization) is likely to proceed more rapidly than left side 
depolarization, which contains the infarcted region. The Q wave in these leads 
indicates rapid depolarization vector to the right followed by a more slowly 
evolving depolarization to the left.  This means that there are R waves present, 
indicating a wave toward leads I and aV<sub>L</sub>, but that it evolves more 
slowly.
</p>
<p>
Applying the principles learned so far as what would generate Q 
waves&mdash;initial negative sweeps from the baseline&mdash;what leads would one 
examine in the case of <b><i>inferior</i></b> wall infarctions? Typically any 
leads which with their positive pole oriented inferiorly relative to the 
negative pole. This is because the net QRS vector follows a wave travelling 
superiorly, and would cause a negative sweep. The limb leads ideally suited to 
examine this phenomena are leads II, III, and aV<sub>F</sub>.
</p>
<p>
In general anterior infarctions show traces on appropriate leads which are 
mirror images of posterior wall infarctions on those identical leads.  The 
prominent Q waves and ST segment elevation in chest leads V<sub>1</sub> and 
V<sub>2</sub> which indicate an <i>acute</i>, <i>anterior</i> wall infarction 
would show opposite traces (sweeping R waves and ST segment depression) in the 
case of an <i>acute</i>, <i>posterior</i> wall infarction.  Note particularly 
that R waves are usual in chest lead V<sub>1</sub>, but in the healthy heart are 
of small magnitude.  In posterior wall infarction, the amplitude is larger. 
However, do consider the possibility of right ventricular hypertrophy in the 
absence of other indicators of infarction.  Be prepared to distinguish as well 
acute, posterior wall infarctions, typically accompanied by ST segment 
depression in the right precordial leads, from anterior subendocardial 
infarctions, which also show ST segment depressions. A classic (and fun?) test 
for diagnosing acute posterior wall infarctions is to mount the traces of the 
right precordial leads (V<sub>1</sub> through V<sub>3</sub>) on a board, turn 
the board upside down, and then view the traces from a mirror.  You should see 
in effect Q waves with ST segment elevation, which would otherwise indicate 
anterior wall infarction.  But since this is a mirror image, it must be 
posterior wall.
</p>
<p>
In review, chest leads V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> are signals to anterior 
(Q waves with ST segment elevation) or posterior (larger than usual R waves with 
ST segment depression) wall infarctions.  Be careful not to overlook the hard to 
spot posterior wall problem.
</p>
<p>
Recall also that diagnosis of infarction difficulties is complicated when left 
bundle branch block is present. This disturbs calculation of the true QRS vector 
so necessary in determining infarctions by EKG.  Left ventricular depolarization 
is delayed, and Q waves are obscured if they are present.  In rare cases where 
there is a septal infarction accompanied by left branch bundle block, Q waves 
may show up on the chest leads suggesting an anterior infarction.
</p>
<h4>A Little Anatomy</h4>
<p>
Two coronary arteries, <i>right</i> and <i>left coronary arteries</i>, emerge 
from the aorta at the point where it joins the heart.  They emerge on the side 
of the aorta closest to the pulmonary artery, actually bisecting the axis plane 
between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The right coronary artery supplies 
the right ventricle and wraps around to the posterior wall; moreover, the right 
coronary artery is the principle supply of blood to the rhythm foci of the 
heart, the sinus node, the AV node, and the AV junction (Bundle of His).  The 
left coronary artery bifurcates to become the <i>circumflex</i> branch and the 
<i>anterior</i> <i>descending</i> branch arteries. The circumflex supplies the 
lateral wall, while the anterior descending artery supplies most of the anterior 
wall.
</p>
<p>
The physiological importance of this anatomical arrangement now follow. 
Posterior wall infarctions resulting from coronary artery disease suggest 
problems (occlusions) with the right coronary artery, at one time considered to 
be a minor artery in the blood supply of the heart. Because this artery supplies 
the vital rhythm centers, a posterior wall infarction can alarm the physician to 
the possibility of dangerous arrhythmias developing, since these nodal tissues 
receive the same blood supply. Hence posterior wall infarctions are taken much 
more seriously.  Indeed acute posterior wall infarctions are associated with 
arrhythmias more than other infarctions.
</p>
<p>
With the inferior wall (the base of the left ventricle), the blood supply can be 
from the right or left arteries. This is largely a matter of ontogenic 
development in the individual.  One side of the arterial system <i>dominates</i> 
the other, a fact determined during fetal/embryonic development and can differ 
in individuals.  The <i>dominance</i> of the right or the left regarding the 
inferior wall supply can be determined reliably from angiographic studies or 
perhaps by echocardiograms.
</p>
<h3>Hemiblocks</h3>
<p>
One depolarization block not discussed in the section on rhythms was the 
<b><i>hemiblock</i></b>.  The <i>left bundle branch</i> supplies the larger 
ventricular mass in the left ventricle with its depolarization routes. Distal to 
the separation of the right and left bundle branches where they join to form the 
bundle of His is a bifurcation of the left bundle branch into and 
<i>anterior</i> and <i>posterior division</i>.  A hemiblock is a block of either 
one of these divisions.  They are very much associated with infarctions since 
coronary occlusions are usually responsible for hemiblocks.
</p>
<p>
Consider the blood supply to the ventricular conduction
system.  The right coronary artery supplies the AV node
and Bundle of His.  It can <i>also</i> supply some
ramifications of the posterior division of the left
bundle branch.  The anterior descending branch of the
left coronary artery however supplies most of the blood
to the bundle branches themselves and to the anterior
division of the left bundle branch.  Occlusion of this
branch of the left coronary artery would likely result
in manifest right branch bundle block and a hemiblock
of the anterior left bundle branch.  In an <b>anterior
hemiblock</b> (a block of the anterior division of the
left bundle branch), there is usually an associated
myocardial infarction;  the QRS is slightly longer
(100 to 120 milliseconds) and limb lead I will show a
Q wave while lead III will show a very prominent
(wide and/or deep) S wave (this is often designated as
Q1S3).  Anterior hemiblock can be most reliably diagnosed
when previous EKG traces are available.  The reason is
that pre-existing sources of left axis deviation,
such as left ventricular hypertrophy, a <q>horizontal
heart,</q> or and inferior wall infarction must
be ruled out.  About 50% of patients showing anterior
hemiblock go on to develop anterior wall infarctions.
Anterior infarctions do usually cause anterior hemiblock.
</p>
<p>
Infarctions of the anterior wall caused by anterior
descending branch occlusions will usually result in
anterior hemiblock and in right branch bundle block.
Patients with left axis deviation toward &minus;40&deg;
to &minus;60&deg; should be suspected of having anterior
hemiblock.  Note that inferior wall infarctions can also
result in left axis deviation, but this may not be
associated with anterior hemiblock.
</p>
<p>
The occurrence of <b>posterior hemiblock</b> is rare in that, as mentioned, it 
receives a dual blood supply from the right and left (via the anterior 
descending branch), and it is short in length.  Normal or slightly widened QRS 
complexes may be present, but leads I and III will be mirror images of anterior 
hemiblock, that is, a Q wave is in lead III and an S wave in lead I (S1Q3). 
This shows a right axis deviation.  After determining that an inferior wall 
infarction is present, it is important to scrutinize leads I and III carefully 
for indications of posterior hemiblock.
</p>
<p>
Some experts believe the lateral wall infarctions and posterior hemiblock are 
equivocal when only a single EKG is available.  However, a careful history and 
examination of previous EKGs, a consideration slender body builds which tend to 
show right axis deviation, pulmonary disease, and right ventricular hypertrophy, 
among other conditions, need to be ruled out.
</p>
<p>
Bifascicular (<q>bi-bundle</q>) blocks can occur in many combinations in the 
ventricular conduction system. Associated right branch bundle block with 
anterior hemiblock, or r.b.b.b. with posterior hemiblock, or both anterior and 
posterior hemiblock, which is effectively left branch bundle block, can show on 
the EKG trace either <i>permanently</i> or <i>intermittently</i>.  In an 
evolving crisis, the fascicles (bundles) of the conduction system generally show 
signs of intermittent block but may go on to become blocked permanently as the 
tissue loses vitality. Examination of blocking patterns (Mobitz II, runs of 2:1 
AV conduction) suggest that an external pacemaker may be necessary.
</p>
<h1>Miscellaneous Effects</h1>
<p>
EKG traces are affected by a variety of conditions other than those mentioned. 
However, these effects can be accounted for by careful history taking, physical 
examination, and appropriate lab testing.
</p>
<h2>Pulmonary Status</h2>
<p>
Severe <b>emphysema</b> is a condition that can cause low voltage (reduced 
amplitudes) of all waves in all leads of the EKG.  (Low voltage readings can 
also be present in hypothyroidism and chronic constrictive pericarditis.) 
Moreover, right axis deviation can be present as well.  The latter is true 
because the right ventricle experiences greater vascular resistance because of 
the nature of the disease, and tends toward hypertrophy.  The presence of this 
right ventricular hypertrophy is indicated by a largely negative QRS in lead I.
</p>
<p>
<b>Pulmonary embolism</b> is also observed in the traces
of particular leads.  In particular, one sees:</p>
<ol>
<li>a large S wave in lead I
<li>depression of the ST segment in lead II
<li>a large Q wave and an inverted T in lead III
</ol>
<p>
These are all symbolized by S1Q3T3 (although some turn the T upside-down).  This 
is also called <i>acute cor pulmonale</i>.  Inverted T waves may also be seen in 
precordial leads V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>4</sub>, and transient right branch 
bundle block may be associated with the condition (seen in the right chest leads 
as R-R&prime; waves).
</p>
<p>
Why are these patterns seen in pulmonary embolism? Note the significant left 
axis deviation indicated by study of leads I, II, and III (the R waves in leads 
I and II and the Q wave in lead III).  This can be followed by a wide S wave in 
lead I (wide R in lead III).  It seems that depolarization follows a rapid 
leftward course, a slower rightward course more apparent when the left side has 
depolarized.  The rightward axis is probably perpendicular to lead II.  What 
might cause a slower right side depolarization?  Perhaps changes in myocardial 
excitability related to mechanical changes from an increased pressure placed on 
the pump in producing a force against the vascular resistance in the pulmonary 
system.  The larger wave in leads I and III which follow suggest a right axis 
deviation.
</p>
<p>
As for the depressed ST segment in lead II, consider what flat ST segments 
deviating from the baseline may represent. They may represent the trailing edge 
of a slowly advancing depolarization wave along the axis of the lead where the 
segment deviation occurs.  In other words, the front edge of a depolarization 
wave moves rapidly and shows as an R or S wave, but the trailing edge moves more 
slowly and represents a <q>wave</q> but with a flatter, even baseline-parallel 
slope.  Hence a QRS with ST segment elevation may in fact represent a biphasic 
depolarization of the ventricles.  In ST segment changes in myocardial 
infarction, the infarcted tissue itself is electrically dead.  However the 
tissue on border or periphery of the infarcted tissue is altered or changed, 
namely <i>weakened</i> or <i>injured</i>, and although electrically conductive, 
it is only weakly electrically conductive.  The depolarization wave will pass 
over weakened tissue at a rate (speed) much slower than would healthy tissue. 
The explanation for why this occurs is complex and can be understood by membrane 
depolarization changes at the molecular level.  Nonetheless, ST segment 
deviation from baseline essentially uncovers a slower depolarization wave 
through weakened tissue.
</p>
<p>
In pulmonary embolus, the depressed ST segment indicates a slower depolarization 
wave (with extreme right axis deviation as its direction) proceeding from the 
apex to atrial side.  This might indicate that the right side depolarization is 
a longer process than the left side, although we are not looking at fascicular 
conduction blocks here.  This might indicate a lower level of excitability in 
the right side myocardial mass, again perhaps induced by mechanical changes 
caused by increased pressures necessary to overcome greater resistance.
</p>
<p>
As for the inverted T wave in lead III (normal in leads I and II), this would 
indicate a leftward (normal) but superiorly-oriented T wave.  Hence we see now a 
right-side, left-side difference in repolarization as well, perhaps affected by 
the asymmetric depolarization rate as well.
</p>
<h2>Electrolyte Status</h2>
<p>
Since myocardial electrical excitability depends on electrolyte movements across 
membranes, changes in the relative concentrations of electrolytes across 
membranes will likely affect the response of the tissue to electrical 
excitation.  Recall that depolarization across the membrane occurs by a 
depolarization event which causes an influx of Na+ ions into the cell.  The 
difference of charge across a membrane when the concentration of ALL ions is 
considered is such that the intracellular medium more negative (by about 70 mV 
in electrically excitable tissue) than the extracellular medium.  With the 
influx of sodium across the medium, translated parallel to the length of the 
membrane as if a propagating <q>current wave</q> and mediated by <q>fast 
opening</q> sodium channels which likely respond to changes in voltage (i.e., 
voltage-gated sodium channel proteins) from adjacent membrane regions, the 
influx of sodium causes the membrane potential difference to produce a slightly 
more positive interior.  The cell/tissue is in the excited state (depolarized). 
Repolarization is now affected by (the same?) channel proteins which now open to 
permit potassium ions to move toward their chemical potential.  The outward 
movement of the larger radius K+ ion causes a shift back to the electrical 
potential constituting the repolarized state.  The cell is no longer refractory 
to stimulation.
</p>
<p>
A typical electrolyte problem is hyperkalemia.  The elevated serum potassium 
also affects repolarization.  The inability to repolarize quickly affects 
(reduces) the excitability the myocardial tissue.  In moderate hyperkalemia the 
EKG shows wide and  flat P waves, a widened QRS, and tall peaked T waves.  With 
extreme hyperkalemia, the QRS widens even further.  The reduced excitability of 
the myocardium therefore shows itself in slower depolarizations of the atria and 
ventricles, as the periods of the phenomena are lengthened.
</p>
<p>
Hypokalemia is different story, but not the mirror image. The hypokalemia  can 
also result in a difficult repolarization process in that intracellular 
potassium may become very depleted.  In a moderate stage, the T wave flattens 
and perhaps widens.  Moreover, a following <b>U wave</b> is seen.  When the 
hypokalemia is severe, the T and U waves merge to form a wide repolarization 
curve, showing how slow repolarization phenomena are occurring.  In generally 
the rate of beats should fall as well.
</p>
<p>
Calcium changes are also observed on the EKG as well. Recall that calcium ions 
are necessary released during depolarizations to bind to proteins responsible 
for muscular contraction.  They are not necessary in creating the 
depolarization/repolarization wave itself, as its concentration is very small. 
In hypercalcemia, the QT interval shortens a great deal, meaning that 
repolarization happens faster upon observing depolarization. In hypocalcemia, 
the QT interval is prolonged.  Why? Excitable tissue like muscle is different 
from nervous tissue in that the tissue undergoes depolarization which leads to 
physical changes in cell volume and structure (this really doesn't happen in the 
nerve).  Repolarization in the nerve is immediate when compared to muscular 
repolarization (from microseconds after depolarization in nerves to hundreds of 
milliseconds in muscle).  Repolarization should lead to associated relaxation 
phenomena.  Since calcium ion is important in contraction of the muscle, and if 
we assume that contraction of the muscle must occur to a point where it can 
trigger a repolarization event, then changes in calcium ions will likely affect 
the time it takes to produce that sufficient contraction.
</p>
<p>
Digitalis is a drug that produces a stronger contraction of the heart muscle 
(positive inotropic effect) but has the side of effect of causing sinus 
bradycardia (a negative chronotropic effect).  In leads where there is no 
demonstrable S wave, one can see a concave up- or downward trace following the R 
or Q wave (depending on lead).  This concavity is the <q>digitalis effect</q> 
and not an S or R wave.  This is true even with therapeutic levels of digitalis.
</p>
<p>
In digitalis <i>excess</i>, conduction system blocks are a primary feature. 
Sinus node block is not uncommon, but retardation or block of the AV node is 
also typical. In addition other types of AV block may occur and even by 
associated with a tachycardia.  A low serum potassium can however can exaggerate 
the true nature of digitalis excess.
</p>
<p>
With digitilas <i>toxicity</i>, the EKG shows a whole different set of symptoms. 
Premature ventricular contractions, ventricular polygeminy (bigeminy, trigeminy, 
etc.), ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillations of the atria and/or 
ventricles.  This is because the drug alters the myocardium in ways that create 
many ectopic foci, which account for the varieties of arrhythmias.
</p>
<p>
Quinidine is another useful drug with a narrow therapeutic index (i.e., the 
difference in concentration of the drug that produces the desired therapeutic 
effect and the concentration that produces unwanted toxic side effects is small 
or narrow).  The drug's effect is that it slows the depolarization and 
repolarization waves through the myocardium.  It can cause signature changes in 
the EKG.  The P wave is wide and notched.  The QRS complex is wider (longer in 
duration), ST segment is off baseline (flat and slightly depress), the Q-T 
interval is also widened, and a U wave is present following the T wave.  This is 
quinidine in therapeutic levels.
</p>
<p>
In quinidine with toxic levels present, a ventricular tachycardia called 
<i>torsades de pointes</i>  is present. This is a sine wave-like pattern (there 
may be notched peaks in the waves) which show a superimposed sine wave pattern 
of longer period with respect to the changing amplitudes of the peaks.  This is 
because of a ventricular ectopic focus formed from the toxic levels.  The 
situation is normally self-resolving but can be dangerous if quinidine toxicity 
is above borderline.  A drug to establish a supraventricular rhythm even though 
it may be tachycardic, may be indicated.  Or a temporary pacemaker might be 
installed.
</p>
<h2>Pacemakers</h2>
<p>
Battery-operated external pacemakers are constructed in a way that either 
stimulate the atria in sinus blocks or the ventricles when complete AV block is 
the problem.
</p>
<p>
In rare cases, a pacemaker wire may be surgically implanted sown to the outside 
of the left ventricular wall (the <i>epicardial</i> pacemaker).  With 
<i>transvenous</i> pacemakers, an electrical wire in a catheter is passed into a 
major vein and guided to the right side of the heart.  With either kind of 
pacemaker, the discharge of the pacemaker itself is a spike (not a wave) on the 
EKG, a spike just preceding the QRS complex which follows in ventricular 
pacemakers.  With catheter-type pacemakers, the appearance of the QRS complex in 
various leads actually indicates where the tip is resting in the right 
ventricular endocardial surface.  The ideal position for the tip is the apex of 
the right ventricle, since in normal conduction the depolarization wave emerges 
from the apex at the start. Lead I will show a positive QRS complex while lead 
aV<sub>F</sub> will show a negative complex in this position.  This would appear 
to be a left axis deviation.   If the tip has been placed in a <q>mid inflow 
tract</q> nearer the tricuspid valve, leads I and aV<sub>F</sub> will both show 
positive QRS complexes (indicating a normal axis).  And if the tip has been 
placed just below the pulmonary semilunar valve, lead I will show a negative 
QRS, indicating some kind of right axis deviation.  In all traces, one can 
determine a pattern which appears to be left branch bundle block, but this 
phenomena merely exists because the tip stimulates the right ventricle first, 
with left ventricular depolarization delayed.  Epicardial pacemakers show split 
R peaks as well, but the phenomenon appears as right branch bundle block.
</p>
<p>
<b>Demand</b> pacemakers are smart pacemakers.  These pacemakers only discharge 
when they sense an arrhythmia, such as a PVC, or a rate change.  Some pacemakers 
pace the atria (as for a case of permanent sinus block).  Others are P 
wave-triggered pacemakers, which are ventricular pacers that have the ability to 
take as input the P waves to determine the discharge rate. This would tend to 
imitate the natural occurrence of cycling. And some pacemakers are what are 
called <q>sequential AV pacers</q>:  these pacemakers are programmed to 
stimulate first the atria, then after a brief time the ventricles.
</p>
<p>
Today there are also pacemakers which can trigger cycling through intact skin 
(apparently working on the same principle that people electrocuted have their 
excitable tissues disrupted). The pacing spike produces by the dermal pacemakers 
is longer in duration on the EKG, reflecting a need to use an impulse of longer 
duration to stimulate the heart.  Such pacemakers would only really be useful in 
emergency situations where immediate surgery is not possible.
</p>
<h2>Heart Transplantation</h2>
<p>
Heart transplant procedures are done in such a way that parts of the atria of 
the recipient are retained as the surgical knife does not remove this tissue; 
they are used nonetheless as flaps to be sutured to the atria of the donor.  The 
heart is cut where it attaches to the caval veins and across the diameters of 
the aorta and pulmonary artery.  With the donor heart, virtually the entirely 
tissue is retained, including the donor's sinus node.  Hence the recipient 
has both his sinus node and the donor's.
</p>
<p>
What shows up on the EKG is quite interesting.  The recipient's sinus node 
discharges and a P wave shows on the EKG as the wave passes over the 
recipient's atrial remnants.  This wave however does not propagate to the 
donor heart.  Instead the donor heart shows a sinus rate independent of the 
recipient beat.
</p>
<p>
In a <i>heterotopic</i> heart transplant, the recipient's heart is not 
removed at all.  A donor heart is merely attached in such a way that takes over 
the pumping responsibililty.  This arrangement is temporary usually.  The 
recipient heart is not necessarily without function, and the EKG will show a 
bizarre trace of QRS complex which alternate in orientation (this is because the 
two hearts are placed in opposite orientations).  P waves and T waves in the 
trace may be unascertainable.
