Principles of Project Management

<p id="subtitle">
Very Basic Introduction

<div class="contentblock">
<h1>Who, What &amp; Why of The Project</h1>
<h2>Three Components</h2>
Project has three (3) main components
<ol>
<li>Scope<br>
Describes desired results or products
<li>Schedule <br>
Establishes start and end dates or project work
<li>Required Resources <br>
Specifies the people (number and qualifications), money/funds, and any other
resources
</ol>
All three components interact!

<h2>Project Diversity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Size: large or small with respect to budget and time, might take days to 
years or range from a few thousand to millions of dollars
<li>Number of People: might be thousands or just the project developer
<li>Formality: might be set by legal contract or informal agreement
<li>Business or personal: could be organization's <q>drive</q> or just an 
event for small number of people
</ul>

<h2>Four Stages of Project</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start<br>
The need for project is generated, evaluated, framed.  A detailed plan is
drafted / finalized and, at end of this stage, an approval may be necessary.
The plan may be a draft with estimates of time and resources and initial list
of individuals in the project.
<li>Organization / Preparation<br>
This must formally specify desired results, work to do, time, cost, other
resources required.  The key risks of the project should be given here.
<li>Implementation <br>
The project team and support systems are put to work according to plan, and 
tasks are monitored, controlled, managed for quality.  Work output may be
monitored, including determiantion of results/deliverables, and use of progress
reports, in addition to specifying frequency and content of periodic communications.
<li>Closing <br>
<ul>
<li>Project results assessment
<li>Customer approvals
<li>Project team transitioned to other assignments
<li>Financial accounts closed
<li>other post-project evaluations: lessons learned
</ul>
</ol>

<h2>What A Project Is Not</h2>
A <b>project</b> must be distinguished from other terms.
<p>
<b>Process</b>. A series of routine steps to perform a function: budget process,
procurement process.  Processes are not one-time activities achieving a specific
result but rather define how a function is done in every instance.  Processes
become parts of projects
<p>
<b>Program</b>. A set of goals that actually give rise to projects.  Programs
are not ended or completely accomplished.  One or more projects may be used to
help achieve a program goal.

<h2>Five Processes Used In Project Management</h2>
<ol>
<li>Initiating: clarify business need, define high level expectations
and resource budgets, identify individuals/groups playing role in project
<li>Planning: project scope, time frames, resources and risks are detailed,
including approaches to communication, management of external purchses of 
goods &amp; services
<li>Executing: project team established and managed, communication with
project stakeholders, implementation of project plans
<li>Monitoring &amp; Controlling: performance tracked, taking corrective 
actions where warranted, getting desired results achieved
<li>Closing:  ending project activities
</ol>
Process performances require information, communication, commitment
<p>
In the figure below, the 5 processes that support the 4 stages of the project
life cycle are shown.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/5ProcessesIn4Stages.png"
  alt="The 5 processes in the 4-stage life cycle of projects">

<h3>Initiating Processes</h3>
In the initiation process, the questions <q>Should we do it?</q> and
<q>Can we do it</q> must be answered.  If either is not yes, the project
need not proceed to Organization/Preparation (2nd of 4) stage.

<h4>Benefit-Cost Analysis</h4>
<p>
This kind of analysis useful to decide whether to undertake a project or 
which of several projects to undertake. It helps to frame project objectives
and to determine before and after measures of project success and estimates
of use of resources.
<p>
Cost analysis should examine all phases.  These may be non-recurring
(labor, capital investment, some operations and services) or recurring
(personnel changes, supplies, materials, maintenance, repair).  Cost analysis
must include potential costs for not doing project, or when project fails,
and opportunity costs (those if spent doing a different project successfully).
<p>
Analysis should determine how far into the future to look, since technology
and obsolescence are factors.
<p>
Always do an information search to see if a B/C analysis like it has been 
done elsewhere, and make notes for review.
<p>
Compute a <dfn>net present value</dfn> (NPV) as the excess of expected benefits
over estimated cost in today's dollars, which should account for <b>inflation</b>
and <b>lost return on investment</b>. Factors that must go into the NPV calcuation
should include <dfn>discount rate</dfn> (future value of $1 in today's dollars
with inflantion and lost return on investment factored) and <dfn>allowable
payback period</dfn> (time for anticipated benefits and estimated costs).
The project <dfn>internal rate of return</dfn> for each payback period must be
calculated also (value of discount rate that would yield NPV = 0)

<h3>Planning Processes</h3>
<p>
The detailed plan is here and these processes must be addressed (these are 
covered in their own detail below)
<ul>
<li>Overview of Reasons for project
<li>Detailed description of intended results
<li>List of all constraints
<li>List of all related assumptions
<li>List of all required work
<li>Breakdown of the roles
<li>Detailed project schedule
<li>Needs for personnel, funds, and nonpersonnel resources (such as equipment,
facilities, and information)
<li>Description of how to manage any significant risks and uncertainties
<li>Project communications
<li>Ensuring project quality
</ul>
<h3>Executing Processes</h3>
<p>
This involves two phases:  preparing to execute and performing the execution.
<p>
Preparation involves
<ol title="Preparation">
<li>Assign roles to person or people (group): agreements must be negotiated
with people and their managers to get availability.
<li>Introducing team members to each other and to the project, and start the
interpersonal relationships with each other.  Help them appreciate overall
purpose of the project and how the different parts will interact and support
each other.
<li>Explaining tasks to all team members; describe to all team
members what work they're responsible for producing and how the
team members will coordinate their efforts
<li>Defining how the team will perform its essential functions: Decide how
the team will handle routine communications, make different project
decisions, and resolve conflicts. Develop any procedures that may be
required to guide performance of these functions.
<li>Set up necessary tracking systems: Decide which system(s) and
accounts youâ€™ll use to track schedules, work effort, and expenditures,
and set them up.
<li>Announce the project to the organization: Let the project audiences
know that your project exists, what it will produce, and when it will
begin and end. 
</ol>

<p>
Peforming involves
<ol title="Performing">
<li>Doing tasks: perform work in plan
<li>Assure quality: Continually confirm work and results conform to
requirements and applicable standards and guidelines
<li>Manage team: Assign tasks, review results, and resolve problems.
<li>Develope team: Provide needed training and mentoring to improve team members' skills.
<li>Share information: Distribute information to appropriate project
audiences
</ol>

<h3>Controlling &amp; Monitoring Processes</h3>
<p>
The following tasks essential to these processes:
<ul>
<li>Compare performance with plans: collect information on outcomes,
schedule achievements, and resource expenditures; identify deviations
from plan; and develop corrective actions.
<li>Fix problems that arise: change tasks, schedules, or resources to
bring project performance back on track with the existing plan, or negotiate
agreed-upon changes to the plan itself
<li>Keep everyone informed: tell stakeholders about the team's
achievements, project problems, and necessary revisions to the established
plan
</ul>

<h3>Closing Processes</h3>
<p>
Get clients' approvals of the final results.
<ul>
<li>Close all project accounts (if time and money is being charged to
special project accounts).
<li>Help team members move on to their next assignments
<li>Hold a post-project evaluation with the project team to recognize project
achievements discuss lessons which can be applied to next project
</ul>

<h2>Project Manager's Role</h2>
<p>
Project managers must be pro-active. Do not wait for a problem to arise.
<ul>
<li>It is more important to get the job done right than try to be everyone's 
friend
<li>You must motivate other people who were chosen as right for the job
rather than try to do the job yourself
<li>The manager must also help people develop to where they can perform task
with highest quality
<li>Must try to minimize unexpected problems and situation with responsive
planning, timely countol but problems must be dealt with promptly to minimize
impact on project
<li>The ideas of the project must be explained to team members rather than
spending too much time working on ideas of the manager
<li>Managers must have a cool head in crises and choose best action, and keep
team on task in implementing solution
<li>Project manager must be good at facilitating team interaction rather than
depend on self-reliance and self-motivation
<li>Managers are better off properly monitoring team members performance rather
than leaving them alone for too long
<li>Managers should not assume that the team member will be motivated all the
time, but have the team member contact the manager when problems arise.
</ul>

<h1>Project Scope</h1>
<p>
Projects must have a <dfn>Scope Statement</dfn>.  This should have:
<ul>
<li><b>Justification</b><br>
How and why project came to be, the business
need(s) it addresses, the scope of work to be performed, and how it will
affect and be affected by other related activities
<li><b>Objectives</b><br>
The products, services, and/or results project will produce (also referred to as deliverables)
<li><b>Product scope description</b><br>
The features and functions of the products,
services, and/or results project will produce
<li><b>Product acceptance criteria</b><br>
The process and criteria for accepting completed products, services, or results
<li><b>Constraints</b><br>
Restrictions that limit what can be achieved, how and when it can be achieved, 
and how much achieving it can cost
<li><b>Assumptions</b><br>
Statements about how uncertain information will be addressed
as it is conceived, planned, and performed in project
</ul>
<p>
Documents supporting the Scope Statement include
<ul>
<li><b>Market requirements document</b>: formal request to develop or modify a product; 
this document is typically prepared by a member of your organizationâ€™s sales and 
marketing group and may lead to the creation of a project. However, in its 
original form, this document reflects only the desires of the person who wrote 
it and does not reflect an assessment of whether meeting the request is possible 
or in the company's best interest, nor is it a commitment to meet the request.
<li><b>Business requirements document</b>: Description of the business needs that a 
requested product, service, or system must address.
<li><b>Technical requirements or specifications document</b>: Description of the 
characteristics that the products and services produced must have.
<li><b>Project request</b>: written request for a project by a group within the 
organization. The project request indicates a desire for a project rather than a 
mutual agreement and commitment to perform it.
<li><b>Statement of work</b>: narrative description of products, services, or results 
to be supplied by a project.
<li><b>Project profile</b>: document that highlights the key information about a 
project (sometimes also called a project summary or a project abstract)
<li><b>Project charter</b>: document issued by upper management that formally 
establishes a project and authorizes the project manager to use organizational 
resources to perform project activities
<li><b>Work order</b>: written description of work that people or groups within your 
organization will perform in support of your project. The signed work order 
focuses on work performance rather than overall project outcomes.
<li><b>Contract</b>: legal agreement for providing specified goods or services
</ul>

<h2>Knowing Why Project Being Done</h2>
<p>
Identify who initiated the project and that person's need and expectations.
Ask the person assigning you the project who originated the idea: if not the
assigner, then ask who gave assignment to him or who was involved with it.
Try also consulting with those who are needed to support the project or who may
benefit from it.
<p>
Distinguish the <i>drivers</i> of the project who tell you what you should do from
 <i>supporters</i> of the project who tell you what you can do.
<p>
 <i>Project champions</i> are those in the organization with an executive position
who are behind the project. Ask drivers and/or supporters who they are. Try
to get answers from them as well.
<p>
Results of the project may not be used by those asking it be done. Try to 
identify who uses the results of the project (might be creation of product or
service). Find out how they will use them. In every way the project or pre-project
planning should try to get information/feedback from the potential user of 
project result.
<p>
After understanding the project requirements, make sure 
<ul>
<li>activities fo project accomplish true desired results
<li>monitor performance during and at end of project to ensure real needs are
met
<li>realize when needs are not met do that suggestions to modify or cancel can
be done
</ul>
<p>
In determining the needs of the people who know about project goals, let them
speak at length, take note of contradictions, have them clarify anything vague,
confirm information from two or more independent sources, and have them 
indicate the relative importance of each need.
<p>
Prioritize the needs with following qualifiers:  MUST, SHOULD, NICE TO
<p>
Make sure there is an understanding of <a href="#riskmanagement">risk 
management</a> both to determine whether a project should move forward or to
raise alarms about a project in the process of moving forward.
<p>
<b>Research</b>.  Part of the research will be to look at past projects both
failures and successes that have elements of the considered project.  This may
include projects that were aborted at the evaluation stage.  Documents such
as newsletters or memos in the organization intranet may be the place to find 
them.  Is there a project management office (PMO)? Finance office (has cost
data on projects)? Procurement office (data on goods and services)?
<p>
Try to obtain several sources for single item of information, and ensure agreement
from independent sources. Distinguish the primary versus the secondary sources
<p>
Sources in writing are the most preferable: meeting minutes, correspondence,
email, project reports, budgets, long-range plans, B/C analyses, market requirement
docs
<p>
When interviewing someone, try to have another person present to have the same
interpretation or understand the differences.
<p>
Write down all information from personal meeting and share the notes with 
others present to ensure correct interpretation and reminder of agreements made
<p>
For the project's audiences, plan on two meetings:
<ol>
<li>In the first, there is thinking of issues. Time is then spent thinking about
initial discussions and working up new ideas
<li>The second meeting is opportunity to clarify ambiguities or inconsistencies
from 1st meeting
</ol>
<p>
Make sure to do <b>active listening</b>.
<p>
In talking with others, compare their perceptions and opinions with written,
factual data.

<h2>Knowing Where Projects Starts and Stops</h2>
<p>
The scope must be clear about where the project starts and ends.  If for 
instance the project is to develop a new product, the scope description can be
<p class="text">
This project entails designing, developing, and testing a new product.
<p>
If ambiguous, make sure the scope also states what the project does not do:
<p class="text">
This project will not include finalizing the market requirements or launching
the new product.
<p>
Be careful of hidden inferences: if a product is to be designed and developed,
is there to be market research done as well to determine product characteristics?
<p>
Confirm the scope with the drivers and supporters of project. In one example,
a competitive acquisition of certain equipment involved developing a plan
including selection of vendor, awarding a contract, and production and delivery
of equipment. The boss thought it would cost less than $25,000 and take less than
two months, but the full plan was 6 months and $500,000.

<h2>Stating Objectives</h2>
<p>
<b>Objectives</b>, or <b>deliverables</b>, are the outcomes that the project
produces.  Objectives will have the following included elements:
<ul>
<li><b>Statement</b>:  brief narrative of what is to be achieved
<li><b>Measures</b>: indicators used to assess achievement
<li><b>Performance specs</b>:  values of each measure that define success
</ul>
<p>
As an example, suppose the project is to reformat a report that summarizes
monthly sales activity. The project objective is framed in table below:
<table class="left">
<caption>An Illustration of a Project Objective</caption>
<tr><th>Statement <th>Measures  <th>Performance Specifications
<tr><td rowspan="4">A revised report that summarizes monthly sales activity
 <td>Content
 <td>Report must include total number of items sold, total sales revenue,
  and total number of returns for each product line.
<tr><td>Schedule
 <td>Report must be operational by August 31.
<tr><td>Budget
 <td>Development expenditures are not to exceed $40,000.
<tr><td>Approvals
 <td>New report format must be approved by the vice president of sales,
 regional sales manager, district sales manager, and sales representatives.
</table>
<p>
What about setting a range of values rather than specific target value?
But setting a range avoids the issue. It's always better to set one value
that will please the project audience.
<p>
In developing the objectives:
<ul>
<li>Be brief in description: if it takes a whole page, most won't read it and
it may have too many interpretations if too long
<li>Avoid technical jargon and acronyms: because terms and acronyms might be the
same and have different meanings. Express objectives in clear language.
</ul>
<p>
Make sure the objectives are <u>SMART</u>:
<ul>
<li><b><u>S</u>pecific</b>: define clearly and in detail with no room for
misinterpretation
<li><b><u>M</u>easurable</b>: measures and performance  specifications to
show how objectives met
<li><b><u>A</u>ggressive</b>: objectives should be challenging and stretch
people beyond comfort zones
<li><b><u>R</u>ealistic</b>: objectives that team believes it can achieve
<li><b><u>T</u>ime sensitive</b>: specify a date when objectives are achieved
</ul>
<p>
Objectives should be controllable: the manager and team must believe they can
influence success of objective, committing 100% to achieving it, or it becomes
a wish, not objective
<p>
Make sure all objectives are identified, since if not specified, no one works
to achieve it.
<p>
Drivers and supporters must agree on project objectives.  Drivers agreement
gives confidence, while those of supporters will work hard to achieve them.
<p>
Those who give the project to the manager, and those who may want the project
to accomplish certain results will require that the other objectives not 
described be thought of by the manager.  In probing to identify all objectives,
consider objectives falling in three categories:
<ol>
<li>physical products or services
<li>effects of products or services
<li>general organizational benefits not being the origina reason for project
</ol>
<p>
As an example, suppose IT department will purchase and install software pkg
which searches and analyzes info in parts inventory database. Here are
objectives for this project:
<ul>
<li>physical product or service: the completed installation and integration
of the new software package
<li>effect of product or service: reduced inventory storage costs because of
timelier ordering enabled by new software
<li>general organizational benefit: use of new software with other company
databases
</ul>
<p>
When objectives are quite specific and clearly defined, there may be some
resistance to setting them. But the drivers have expectations requiring well-defined
objectives, so the project is more likely to succeed if they are quite specific.
Note that people will give something like the following reasons for avoiding
specificity in objectives:
<ul>
<li>Creativity will be stifled if there is too much specificity<br>
While creativity should be encouraged but the question is where and when.
The important point is that the manager wants to know what people <i>do</i> expect
from the project, not what they <i>may</i> expect from it.
<li>Project requires research and new development and one can not know today
what can be accomplished<br>
This excuse indicates that objectives are guarantees, but they are not: they
are targets. When a task is undertaken for the first time, it is not known if
it is possible and how long it will take or how much it wil cost. But what is
to be achieved must be stated and what is thought possible. Objectives can change
as project moves forward.
<li>What if the interests or needs change?<br>
Targets are understood based on what is known and expected today.  If conditions
in the future change, objectives may need to be revisited to check for 
relevance and feasibility and whether they must be changed or abandoned.
<li>The person pushing the project does not know what he specifically wants the
project to achieve<br>
Then ask the project requester to come back when that person knows better, or
the activity will be a waste of time and resources.
<li>Specific objectives help to determine when success has been obtained but 
they also make it easy to see where it has not happened<br>
While true, the objectives help to determine whether there are certain results
that have been obtained, and indicate additional work to make sure they have
been obtained.
</ul>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>
In this part of the project the manager notes that not everything is perfectly
possible and must describe real and potential difficulties in advancing the
project.  Consider the following types of constraints:
<ul>
<li>Limitations: these are restrictions that other people place on results 
to be achieved, time frames to be met, resources to be used, and the approach
to tasks
<li>Needs: requirements stipulated by the manager that must be met to be 
successful
</ul>
<p>
Look more closely at the types of limitations:
<ul>
<li><b>Results</b>: products and effect of the project. A limitation would be
that an item cost no more than $xxx per itme to produce, or that a new book
be no more than xxx pages in length
<li><b>Time Frames</b>: the when of results must be produced. It may not be
possible to say when a project must be delivered, only that someone sets a date
<li><b>Resources</b>: type, amount/number and availability of resources for 
completing project. This includes people, funds, equipment, raw materials,
facilities, information, etc.
<li><b>Activity Performance</b>: Strategies for performing different tasks.
As an example, someone may direct a user manual be reproduced for a system the
project is developing and it may not be known what the manual will look like,
how many pages it is to be, copy count needed, and time/date needed...only that
the printing department must do the work
</ul>
<p>
It is important to avoid vague limitations. For example a vague time frame
is <q>Finish project ASAP</q> and soon the audience is demanding the project
result. The proper limitation is <q>Finish the project by close of business
on 30 June.</q>
<p>
Here is an example of a vague resource limitation: <q>Person A can work 
part time in May on the project.</q> How long can Person A juggle assignments
in the period when that person has no idea how long each will take?
<p>
In examining the project limitations, the fact-finding involves looking at
all possible sources of information:
<ul>
<li>Consult the audiences
<li>Review relevant written materials
<li>Note the source of any identified limitation
</ul>
<p>
There are two ways to address limitations in the Scope Statement.  One is to
incorporate limitations directly in the project plan, such as dates the project
must be complete: if a project driver says the project should be complete by
one date, the manager may want to have it complete by one month earlier.
Project limitations can create risk too, which should be identified in the 
Scope Statement.
<p>
<b>Needs</b>. At the earliest stage of project drafting, situations and conditions
for success should be decided.  These are usually resource-related.  For example
as for personnel the project might need a technical editor for 40 hours in 
month of August. Or for budget, perhaps $10,000 needed for computer peripherals.
Or perhaps one needs access to test laboratory in month of June.

<h2>Dealing with Unknowns</h2>
<p>
Often identifying issues and questions during project planning does not offer
the true way in addressing them. Suppose one issue is not having final,
approved budget for project.  In this case assume the $50,000 budget will come,
but plan to spend up to and not more than the $50,000. Develop the budget well
and justify it for that amount.
<p>
Suppose another issue is the time for getting authorization to do the work.
Assume that the authorization is to start on 1 August, and plan that nothing 
starts before that date, and explain why the project must start on 1 August.

<h1>Stakeholders &amp; Involving Right People</h1>
<p>
The first phase of project planning is identifying the right people and all the
people.  Without the first, important information may be missed. Without the 
second, someone may feel insulted, complicating the project.
<p>
Identification of the project audience follows this:
<ul>
<li>what persons or groups <b>support</b> the project
<li>what persons or groups <b>are affected by</b> the project
<li>what persons or groups <b>are interested in</b> the project
</ul>
In this identification process, manager must know <b>whether</b>, <b>when</b> 
and <b>how</b> to involve these people.  Develop the following lists:
<ul>
<li><b>Stakeholders</b>. Those supporting and affected by project.
<li><b>Distribution</b>. Identifies those getting copies fo project communications.
For those not supporting, interested in, or affected by project, have them
remove themselves from the list.
<li><b>Team members</b>. These people are under direction of project manager.
</ul>
<p>
Organize individuals or groups into categories listed below. Checkboxes for those
applying to more than one category might be used.
<p>
First consider those internal to the organization:
<ul>
<li><b>Upper management</b>: Executive-level management responsible for
the general oversight of all organization operations
<li><b>Requesters</b>: The person who came up with the idea for your project and all 
the people through whom the request passed before you received it
<li><b>Project manager</b>: The person with overall responsibility for successfully
completing the project
<li><b>End users</b>: People who will use the goods or services the project
will produce
<li><b>Team members</b>: People assigned to the project whose work the project manager
directs
<li><b>Groups normally involved</b>: Groups typically involved in most projects in the 
organization, such as the human resources, finance, contracts, and legal
departments
<li><b>Groups needed just for this project</b>: Groups or people with special 
knowledge related to this project
</ul>

<p>
Now consider those external to org:
<ul>
<li><b>Clients or customers</b>: People or groups that buy or use your organizationâ€™s
products or services
<li><b>Collaborators</b>: Groups or organizations with whom you may
pursue joint ventures related to your project
<li><b>Vendors, suppliers,</b> and <b>contractors</b>: Organizations that provide
personnel, raw materials, equipment, or other resources required
to perform your projectâ€™s work
<li><b>Regulators</b>: Government agencies that establish regulations and
guidelines that govern some aspect of your project work
<li><b>Professional societies</b>: Groups of professionals that may influence
or be interested in your project
<li><b>The public</b>: The local, national, and international community of
people who may be affected by or interested in your project
</ul>
<p>
An important point of the audience list is that there may be countless names.
Not all of these may ever be involved in the project.  The audience list is
not a list that requires involving people in the project, only that there may be
instances where people are not involved.
<p>
Support groups in the audience list may include those that affect facilities,
finance, human resources, information services, legal services, and procurement
and contracting, quality, security, and project management within the project.

<h2>Guidelines for Completing &amp; Updating Audience List</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Identify each audience by position description and name</b><br>
Don't just identify a group within the organization, but find a representative
by name and position that might be the liaison.
<li><b>Speak with a wide range of people</b><br>
The people selected for contact or support should be from every group
necessary to the success, with different disciplines and levels of seniority
or length of service.
<li><b>Allow sufficient time to develop your audience list</b><br>
Develop the contact/personnel list at early in project planning, and use people
to identify more people/audiences.
<li><b>Include audiences who may play a role at any time during your project</b><br>
Be sure to name and describe people who are initially thought not to be
involved in the project. It may happen later they will be involved
<li><b>Include team members' functional managers</b><br>
On the list should be the people to whom the project manager and team members
report. They control the time/schedule of the manager and team members, thus
making them automatically involved in project in that way.
<li><b>Include a personâ€™s name on the audience list for every role she plays</b><br>
If a person will wear more than one hat / role in the project, identify all
those roles in a table of the project
<li><b>Continue to add and remove names from your audience list throughout your 
project</b><br>
The audience list will be dynamic: that is, names will be put on and they may 
be removed.  Project supporters, drivers, and team members will mention names
that should be added to the list possibly.
<li><b>When in doubt, write down a personâ€™s name</b><br>
Write down a person's name and contact information if it comes up as part of
the planning of the project. Put them in a list of <q>possibles</q> until the
plan is finalized
</ul>
<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>
Templates will be useful in developing projects. A template for an audience
list may be particularly useful.  In making a template use these guidelines:
<ul>
<li><b>Develop templates for frequent tasks and for entire project</b>. As examples,
a template to award contract competitively or printing a document.  The same
can be done for generating audience lists.
<li><b>Focus on position descriptions rather than names of previous audiences</b>.
If an accounts payable manager is required, write that down rather than 
 <i>Bill Miller</i> , who might happen to be one.
<li><b>Develop and modify audience templates from prior successful projects rather
than initial plans looking good but lacking key info</b>.  Make sure to use a
list revised during a previous project, since an initial list from that project
may have omitted those coming on during the project
<li><b>Have the team members brainstorm for possible audiences without showing
them a template</b>. Don't use any guidance or restrictions in requesting the
brainstorm, since it increases chances that people will not be overlooked.
<li><b>Templates should be starting, not ending points.</b> Any template shown
to the team should be given with instructions it is not final. Critically examine
the template
<li><b>Let past project experiences be reflected in a template</b>. Use a 
post-project evaluation to review, critique and modify an audience list for 
the project ahead. <b>Observers</b> are interested in the activities and results
of the project and could be affected in the future.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Grouping The Audience</h2>
<p>
Classify the list members.  <b>Drivers</b> will define the results of the project
and the project is being performed for them. <b>Supporters</b> are involved in
the tasks or providing resources.
<p>
Note that the drivers can be supporters: the vice president of sales driving
a project for a revised monthly sales report will have to transfer funds to 
sales department who will develop the report.

<h2>When To Involve</h2>
<p>
Remember the 4 stages of the project life cycle (1: Starting, 2: Organization
&amp; Preparation, 3: Carrying Out Work, 4: Closing).
<p>
Now consider where the classified audience comes in.
<p>
Drivers are involved from start to finish. At the start involvement is heavy
as their desires and the manager's assessment of feasibility determine objectives
and whether the project will start.  During organization and preparation, 
the involvement is moderate to heavy as drivers are consulted on needs and 
expectations; as well as getting approval.  In the stage where work is carried
out, the involvement level is moderate: the drivers are introduced to the team
so they needs and interests are discussed;  additionally communication with the
drivers of project status is done.  In the closing of the project, the drivers
once again take a heavy involvement as they assess the results and determine
whether needs and expectations are met.  They also give feedback as to how 
performance is improved for future projects.
<p>
Supporters also work in all 4 stages of the project. At the start, they have
moderate involvement as they help the manager in determining the feasibility 
of the project; if supporters identified later, they should confirm the feasibiilty
of previous expectations.  During organization and preparation, supporter 
involvement is heavy as they are major contributors to project plan.  They 
will determine approaches, schedules, and resources, and they must commit to the
plan.  In carrying out the work involvement is also heavy: the managers
familiarizes all supporter with the work, indicates how they will work together.
Supporters should decide how they communicate and resolve conflicts.  In closing
the project, they are also heavily involved as they conclude their tasks and
report on their success/accomplishments.
<p>
With observers, project results are shared but involvement is minimals at
all 4 stages of the project.  Observers are receivers of information about the
project rather than providing input.  If they provide input they should be
classed as a driver or supporter.

<h2>How to Communicate With These Participants</h2>
<p>
There are various ways to deal with communications
<ul>
<li>One-on-One Meeting<br>
These can be formal or informal discussions with one or two other people
and can clarify special issues of interest
<li>Group Meetings <br>
These are planned sessions for some or all team members and audiences
<li>Informal written correspondence <br>
These are notes, memos, letters and email communications and rather informal.
Very good at documenting what's going on
<li>Formal information-sharing vehicles <br>
These would include project newsletters or sites on the intranet of the
organization, useful to share information which can be shared with larger
audiences.
<li>Written approvals <br>
These serve as project decisions on the technical approach and for formal
agreements on commitment to product, schedule, resource
</ul>
<p>
It helps to involve people early in project planning especially if they play
larger role later on: they should be in the planning stage anyway, and they
will reserve time for the project to be done later on.
<p>
<b>Checking with legal</b>.  In some cases it may be necessary to ask the legal
people if a person can be involved in the project if they are potential bidders
to a project and there is a conflict of interest (charges of favoritism). Do that.
<p>
<b>What's In It For Me</b>. Every audience will have this in mind and a project
manager must be ready to talk about why it is in an audience's best interest to
do the project.  It may be necessary to remind people of the benefits of doing
a project.

<h2>Confirming Authority</h2>
<p>
Managers must verify that people on the project have authority to make decisions,
provide resources, spend funds, give approvals.
<p>
As part of describing each person on the project, include a column in the table
on roles and tasks the ability to approve or authorize resources, expenditures,
work approaches.  Be specific about what authority a person has: can the person
approve expenses up to $5000 or for all purchases?  If a person needs another
person's approval, record the name, position and authority of that person.
<p>
Have any member of the project justify the authority: look for written policy,
procedure, guideline, job description of that authority. Remove assumptions!
<p>
Ask about whether a person has ever been overruled on an exercise of authority,
and the history of using that authority.
<p>
Ask about a member's change in position within the hierarchy of the organizaiton
and understanding of what authority and levels of decision-making. Ask person
to give information about authority.

<h2>Power and Interest</h2>
<p>
Project audience members have the impact on a project with respect to having
power they can exercise and the interest in exercising that power.
<p>
Power means an ability to influence the action of others.  This is either
<dfn>ascribed power</dfn>, which is power defined in the job description 
as supervisory roles over subordinates, or <dfn>achieved power</dfn>, which 
is ability to induce others based on respect gained professionally or the 
affinity one has for another.
<p>
Interest refers to something a person cares or is curious about and how much
attention is given by the person to the project.
<p>
Levels of power and interest can be described as either <i>high</i> or <i>low</i> ,
with 4 possible combinations for each audience member on a grid such as the 
one below.  This grid informs the manager what to do with these particular
audience members.
<p>

<h1>Details of Structuring Project</h1>
<p>
Keys to successful project planning and performance: <b>Completeness</b> and
<b>Continuity</b>.  This section deals with breaking down project into 
manageable pieces.
<p>
Important here is developing a logical framework to define all work to 
complete the project. A major aspect is not leaving any pieces out to the 
last minute in project planning.

<h2>Think in Detail: Decomposition</h2>
<p>
Often projects underestimate both time and resources for what is to be done
and that is because they neglect what all needs to be done.  Projects must
be broken down into component deliverables: the process of doing this is 
called <dfn>decomposition</dfn>.  Deliverables, or objectives, can be 
intermediate or final products or results of the project.
<p>
For example in the project involving report creation, there are at least
three deliverables:  (1) draft, (2) draft revision &amp; review, (3) final
version.  The final version itself will have two deliverables: a handwritten
and printed version.
<p>
In decomposition, follow two guidelines
<ol>
<li>Allow no gaps:  identify all components of the deliverable.  If a final 
version has its own components, break those down as well.
<li>Allow no overlaps:  for example, a draft written by the manager or 
project team should be separated from a review/revision of the draft by a
senior member or supervisor
</ol>

<h2>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</h2>
<p>
Project planning requires thinking about the details while making sure to see
the forest from the trees.
<p>
Generally a project with many details should be hierarchically outlined and 
subdivided into many activities or tasks.  One approach is the <dfn>Work
Breakdown Structure</dfn>. At the top is the element that is the project.
At the lowest level of detail is the <dfn>work package</dfn>. In between are
levels that have elements called <i>phase, subprojects, work assignments,
tasks, subtasks,</i> and <i>deliverables</i> .
<p>
Levels are number in WBS: 1, 2, 3, 4, .... At Level 1 is the project.
Level 1 is composed of two or more Level 2 components. Each Level 2 component
is composed of two or more Level 3 components.  Level <i>n</i> is the 
work package level.
<p>
An example of WBS suffices: suppose a new training program is to be developed
and presented.  The followin steps are taken:
<ol>
<li>What are the major intermediate or final deliverables to meet the project
goals? <br>
For a training program it might be
<ul>
<li>a statement for the training program
<li>design for the program
<li>notebooks for participants
<li>instructor who gives training and might need to be trained
<li>testing of the program
<li>presentation of the program
</ul>
<li>Divide each of major deliverables into component deliverables (more 
specificity, more detail) <br>
In the example choose the <i>statement for training program</i> : what would
be the intermediate deliverables to create the statement? These might be
<ul>
<li>interviews of potential participants
<li>review of materials discussing needs for program
<li>report summarizing needs the program will address
</ul>
<li>Divide each of the work pieces into component parts <br>
Suppose starting with <i>interviews of potential participants</i> : now what
deliverables are necessary to complete the interviews?  These may be the 
following:
<ul>
<li>selected interviewees
<li>questionnaire for interview
<li>schedule for interviews
<li>completed interviews
<li>report of interview findings
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
There may be necessary even further divisions in working out the details for
these deliverables.  Be prepared to be very complete.
<p>
When is it necessary to stop in getting the detail?  Ask 4 key questions:
<ol>
<li>Does the deliverable require two or more intermediate deliverables to 
produce?
<li>Can resources for the work to produce deliverable be accurately estimated
(these are personnel, equipment, raw materials, consumable, funds, facilities,
information, etc)
<li>Can time required for producing deliverable be accurately estimated?
<li>If the work assigned to produce deliverable, is there confidence the
person will understand exactly what to do?
</ol>
<p>
If the answer is "Yes" to #1 <b>or</b> "No" to any one of #2 to #4, the 
deliverable should be broken down to further components.
<p>
Ultimately detail by WBS is a judgment call.  But here is another approach
to WBS subdivision: do either of the following apply?
<ul>
<li>Component will take longer than two calendar weeks to complete
<li>Component will require much more than 80-person hours to complete
</ul>
<p>
If so, consider further subdivision into other components.
<p>
In particular if a time of 2-3 months is estimated to finalize requirements
for a new product, these finalized requirements should have more detail, such
as a weekly monitoring of progress of the finalization or other means to 
show this process is on schedule.
<p>
<b>Assumptions</b>. At some point it may be difficult to get much detail
when there are certain unknowns.  This requires making assumption on the 
unknowns, but being prepared to alter project plans when the assumptions
prove false and other realities arise. It may be prudent to develop sections
of the project plan that are activated when one set of assumptions proves
true when the others are false.
<p>
<b>Action Words for Describing Activities</b>. Activities will comprise a
work package, and the titles of these activities should conform to use
of action verbs.  For instance in a draft report creation, it might be
useful to write <i>Design and handwrite the draft</i> as the activity for the
deliverable.
<p>
<b>Time/Duration</b>. Important in a WBS is to achieve time estimates, since
project drivers need these for scheduling or even deciding whether to proceed.
<p>
<b>Conditional Work</b>.  Some deliverables are hard to gauge because it
depends on things going right in the first iteration. For example, in 
preparing a report, there are revisions to be done and these may repeat 
cyclically until all revisions meet approval. There is no way to estimate
when these occur.  In this case, the deliverable <i>Approved Report</i> may 
be written as a deliverable and a reasonable duration assigned to it.
It might even be assumed that the number of revisions is known, so each
revision can be an intermediate deliverable.
<p>
<b>The Long Term Project</b>. Use the <dfn>rolling wave approach</dfn> with
long-term project.  This means that plans are not static but reviewed periodically
for purposes of refining. This review deals with knowledge acquired about 
matter that were previously marked as <q>uncertain.</q>  The approach is as
follows:
<ol>
<li>The first 3 months of work should be broken down in components that 
take no more than 2 weeks to complete
<li>Remainder of project is done in less detail, generally by describing project
in work packages estimated to be between 1-2 months in duration
<li>After first 3 months passes, revise initial plan to find detail in the 
next 3 months whose components take 2 weeks or less to complete
<li>Modify all future work based on the 3 months that have passed
<li>Throughout the project, revise the plan by repeating these steps
</ol>

<h3>Displaying the WBS</h3>
<p>
Five possible ways can be used to subdivide the WBS components:
<ol>
<li><b>product components</b>: floor plan, training manuals, screen design
<li><b>functions</b>:  design, launch, review, test
<li><b>project phases</b>: initiation, design, construction
<li><b>geographical areas</b>: Region 1, northwest
<li><b>organizational units</b>: marketing, operations, facilities
</ol>
<p>
The first three are often used.  In choosing a scheme, consider the following
questions:
<ul>
<li>What higher level milestones will be most meaningful in reporting progress?
Perhaps it is when a section of a draft report is done rather than the whole
draft.
<li>How will responsibility be assigned? For example, perhaps one person is
assigned the draft/review/final report of a section of the report, or that
person is actually responsible for only the drafts of three sections.
<li>How will the manager and team members actually do the work?  For example
the draft/review/finalizing of Section 1 is separate from Section 2. Or
perhaps all sections are drafted together first, then reviewed together, then 
finalized together.
</ul>

<h3>Top-Down or Brainstorming the WBS</h3>
<p>
Use one of two approached in developing the WBS.
<p>
<b>Top-Down</b>. This starts with being very hierarchical and ensuring that
all levels defined systematically.  Use this when there is a good idea of
how the project work is done before actual work begins.
<p>
<b>Brainstorming</b>. The work and deliverables are actually sketched out first,
then organized or grouped into categories.  Use this when there is no clear
sense of the project at the outset. Later the deliverables are organized into
categories.  All of these deliverables are likely to be Level 2.  Continue to
brainstorm each of the Level 2 into Level 3 components.  Now go to the 
Top-Down approach to discover any deliverables or work components overlooked
in categories created.

<h2>Work Categorization</h2>
<p>
It may be prudent to develop more than one WBS presentation to see which works
the best. As an example, a community wants to open halfway house for substance
abusers and the work in the treatment facility has two schemes, one is to
classify work by product component and the other is by function.  The two 
schemes, product component at top, function at bottom are shown below:

<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/WBS-product-components.png"
  alt="Work Breakdown Structure using product components">
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/WBS-functions.png"
  alt="Work Breakdown Structure using functions">
<p>
At the lowest level of the WBS, both must contain lowest level components
or work packages. If the project was developed using the functions approach,
it may be realized that planning for staff recruiting, buying staff supplies,
and planning for community training were forgotten.  After identifying
overlooked components, include them in either WBS presentations. But upon
completing the planning, choose one WBS or the other!

<h2>Labeling the WBS</h2>
<p>
Large project sizes may benefit from labeling in order to keep track of 
relationships and better coordination.  This labeling has the form of 
section chaptering: for example, one deliverable might be
<p style="font:bold 125% Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;text-indent:10%;">
<b>1.5.7.3 Order Materials</b>
<p>
where first digit (1) is Level 1 (the project), second digit (5) is Level 2,
and the last digit (3) represents the work package level.
<h2>Displaying WBS</h2>
<p>
There are different formats to show the WBS, with three shown here:
<ol>
<li>Organization Chart format <br>
also called <i>hierarchy diagram</i> and <i>graphical view</i> , this shows levels as 
a hierarchical format.  As it requires much space, it is less effective for
larger WBS displays
<br><img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/WBS-orgchart.png"
  alt="Work Breakdown Structure displayed as organization chart">
<li>Indented Outline format <br>
This presents the more complex in a way to read what is going on, but it 
is possible to get lost in details of a large project with this format and
understand how to fit pieces together
<br><img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/WBS-indented-outline.png"
  alt="Work Breakdown Structure displayed as indented outline">

<li>Bubble Chart format <br>
The bubble chart may be effective in brainstorming the details of the small
or large project. First create a large center bubble to represent the project
with level number. Only bubbles connected to this bubble can be Level 2 numbers
and using X.X.X.X labeling write their headlines. Continue breakouts for 
Level 3 components and so on.
<br><img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/WBS-bubble-chart.png"
  alt="Work Breakdown Structure display as bubble chart">
</ol>
<p>
Consider using a combination of formats for large projects.  For example
Levels 1 and 2 can be shown in the organization chart while details below 
Level 2 are shown in indented outline format
<p>
Don't use a bubble format outside the project team. Use one of the other
or the combination.

<h2>Improving WBS Quality</h2>
<p>
Get agreement with everyone in the project on the WBS.  Have them critique
the WBS. For those coming in later, they too should look at the WBS and 
offer suggestions or warnings.  Have everyone ask questions if they do not
understand the WBS.
<p>
Incorporate the WBS from similar previous projects. Consult people who worked
on these projects.
<p>
Maintain a current version of the WBS. When WBS elements change (add, delete,
edit), present a new WBS.
<p>
Incorporate assumptions to deal with unknowns in the WBS. Follow the updating
rule when uncertainties become certain.
<p>
The WBS identifies project deliverables, it does NOT identify or is structured
to show chronological order.  There are other ways of showing the project
schedule.

<h2>WBS Templates</h2>
<p>
WBS templates have been developed based on experiences with certain types of
projects. Templates get modified to reflect changes in the deliverables
typical for certain project types. Templates save time and completeness problems
during brainstorming.  Templates are starting points for planning though and
are not cookie cutters for what must be done.
<p>
In making templates, work on the entire project and on frequently performed
tasks. So there will be project templates and task templates.  Templates should
be for projects that worked and not from initial plans that looked good.

<h2>Risks Identified in Detailing</h2>
<p>
Risks occur in projects where there is a lack of information, an unknown.
Unknowns fall into two categories:
<ol>
<li><b>Known unknown</b>: <br>
Information required that someone else has
<li><b>Unknown unknown</b>:
Information required but is understood or thought not to exist
</ol>
<p>
With the first category, a task is created to get the information and assimilate
it. With the latter however, one or more of the following strategies is used:
<ul>
<li>Insurance is obtained to minimize damage occurring if something does not
turn out as expected
<li>Contingency plans are makde to follow if there is something unexpected
<li>There is an effort to influence what the information eventually is
</ul>
<p>
A known unknown might be data stored containing a list of company clients;
if it exists is not known to the project, but others know if it does if it really
does.  an unknown unknown is whether the data stored was damaged or deleted
somehow: it may be discovered that it was damaged or deleted, and so no one
can understand that.
<p>
In the case of the company clients, a contingency plan might be developed in 
which names are randomly selected using a statistician help rather than 
software that provides a randomized list.  Another plan might be to set up 
conditions so that data could not be damaged by ensuring the environment is
free of damaging materials.
<p>
<b>Documentation of the WBS</b>. For all the work packages (lowest level
WBS components), it will be useful to produce a <dfn>WBS dictionary</dfn>
available to all team members.  This dictionary should contain at a minimum:
<ul>
<li>WBS component title and ID code: these must uniquely identify
<li>Activities included: all activities necessary to create the deliverable
identified in work package
<li>Work detail: narrative description of work processes and procedures
<li>Schedule milestones: events in component's schedule
<li>Quality requirements: characteristics desired of deliverables produced
in the component
<li>Acceptance criteria: these criteria must be met for deliverable to be 
acceptable
<li>Required resources: people, funds, equipment, facilities, raw materials,
information, etc
</ul>

<h1>Details of Project Scheduling</h1>
<p>
Projects have deadlines and durations. The deadline may be imposed without 
really having any thought given to it, which durations are the well-considered
estimates of how much time is really required.

<h2>The Network Diagram: Illustrating the Work Plan</h2>
<p>
The amount of time for project completion requires knowing
<ol>
<li><b>Sequence</b>: the order in which to perform activities
<li><b>Duration</b>: how long each activity requires
</ol>
If a project requires ten activities to complete, and each takes a week, one
can not tell how long it takes. It may take only one week if all activities
are started simultaneously and the resources are available.  Or it may take
as long as 10 weeks if the activities can only be done sequentially.  For 
small projects, the scheduling might be done in the head, but for larger ones,
an organized method is required.
<p>
The <dfn>network diagram</dfn> is a flowchart that shows the order in which 
the project activities are performed. A network diagram allows trials of 
different strategies before the work is begun. A network diagram has three
elements:
<ol>
<li>milestones
<li>activities
<li>durations
</ol>

<h3>Milestone</h3>
<p>
A significant occurrence in the life of a project is the <b>event</b> or 
<b>milestone</b>. These mark the start or the end of one or more activities.
For example, it might be the approval of a draft report or the beginning of
a design process.

<h3>Activity</h3>
<p>
This is component of work performed during the course of a project.  Unlike
milestones, they take time and use resources.  Action verbs are used to 
describe them: design report or conduct survey

<h3>Duration</h3>
<p>
These are the total number of work periods required to complete an activity.
Many factors go into determining the duration.  It is the time required to
complete the activity that includes a part of the duration being delay: 
for example, if a boss spends one hour reading a draft report only after that
report was sitting in the inbox for 4 days 7 hours, then the duration is
5 days.
<p>
The <dfn>work effort</dfn> is a different computation, and is the amount of
time a person needs working full time on the activity to complete it.  Suppose
4 people work full time over 5 days to complete the activity. The duration is
5 days, but the work effort is 20 person-days.

<h3>Drawing The Network Diagram</h3>
<p>
Date determinations are made more clearly with the network diagram.  The
 <i>activity-on-node</i> technique (also called <i>activity-in-box</i> or 
 <i>precedence diagramming method</i> ) used three different symbols to describe
the three different elements:

<ol>
<li><b>Boxes</b> <br>
Used to represent activities and milestone. When duration is 0, it is a milestone.
When duration &gt; 0, it's an activity. In some network diagrams, the box
lines are thicker or double-lined or otherwise distinguished
<li><b>Letter <i>t</i> </b> <br>
The <i>t</i> represents the value for <q>time</q> (duration).
<li><b>Arrows</b> <br>
These represent direction of the work flow from one activity or milestone to
next.
</ol>
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/network-diagram.png"
  alt="network diagram example">
<p>
Another network diagram format is the <i>activity-on-arrow</i> , also called the
 <i>classical approach</i> , <i>arrow diagram</i> , or <i>PERT chart</i> .
Milestones are represented by circles which activities are represented with
arrows. The nodal form is most used today however.
<h3>Reading A Network Diagram</h3>
<p>
To draw and interpret a diagram, use the following two rules:
<ol>
<li><b>Rule 1</b>: after finishing an activity or reaching a milestone,
use the arrows to proceed to the next activity or milestone.
<li><b>Rule 2</b>: before an activity can be started or milestone reached,
all activities must be completed and milestones reached for all arrows pointing
to that activity to be started or milestone reached
</ol>
<p>
Consider the diagram below. From <i>Start</i> work can proceed with either 
 <i>Activity</i> 1 or <i>Activity</i> 3, or both can be begun at the same time.
Rule 1 is an <i>allowing relationship</i> : the activities can be started but there is
no requirement that they be started.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/network-diagram-traversal.png"
  alt="network diagram traversal">  
<p>
According to Rule 2, work can start on <i>Activity</i> 2 as soon as work on 
 <i>Activity</i> 1 is complete, as that is the only leading to <i>Activity</i> 2.
Rule 2 illustrates a <i>forcing relationship</i> .  If arrows from three activities
led to <i>Activity</i> 2, all three of those activities must be complete before work
on <i>Activity</i> 2 can begin.

<h3>Network Diagram Interpretation</h3>
<p>
Important features of the diagram allow schedule determination:
<ul>
<li><b>Critical Path</b>: A sequence of activities taking the longest time to
complete
<li><b>Noncritical Path</b>: A sequence of activities that can be delayed while
still finishing project in shortest possible time
<li><b>Slack Time (Float)</b>: Maximum time of delay for an activity allowing
for finish in shortest possible time
<li><b>Earliest Start Date</b>: Earliest date in which activity can be started
<li><b>Earliest Finish Date</b>: Earliest date by which an activity can be finished
<li><b>Latest Start Date</b>: Latest date an activity can be started while still
being able to finish in shortest possible time
<li><b>Latest Finish Date</b>: Latest date an activity finishes while still 
finishing in shortest possible time
</ul>
The critical path method (CPM) allows determination of the project's overall
schedule. Project duration is determined by the critical path, so any means
to shorten that path shortens the duration.  Activities in the critical path
require the closest monitoring since delays in them delay project completion.
More than one critical path is possible if they have the same time.
<p>
Critical paths may change as the project progresses. Activities in noncritical
paths can become delayed to the point where they fall on a new critical path.
<p>
Analysis of duration begins with a <i>forward pass</i> : this is a start-to-finish
analysis of the duration of each activity along each path.  In the diagram above
there are three paths. The earliest start and finish dates are weeks 1 and
5 for <i>Activity</i> 1. The earliest start and finish dates are weeks 6 and 6
for <i>Activity</i> 2, which takes a week to do.  In the path involving 
Activities 3 through 5, it is clear when the earliest start and finish dates
for 3 and 4, but not for 5. Activities 3 and 4 can be completed in 4 weeks, but
because Activity 1 requires 5 weeks and it must be complete in combination
with Activities 3 and 4, 3 and 4 will be done for a whole week before Activity
5 can be started.  Thus the earliest start week for Activity 5 is week 6.
Continued analysis shows that the project duration will take a total of 7 weeks,
and this is the critical path: Start &rarr; Activity 1 &rarr; Activity 5 &rarr;
End. Note the critical path has thicker arrows.
<p>
In the <i>backward pass</i> is a finish-to-start analysis that permits determination
of delays along certain paths that still permit finishing in the shortest
possible duration.  In this analysis, the following points are determined:
<ul>
<li>Activity 5 must be started by week 6 in order to finish by week 7
<li>Using Rule 2, Activity 5 can not start until activities 1 and 4 are
complete, and so activities 1 and 4 must be finished by start of week 6
(or end of week 5).
<li>This requires that Activity 4 be started at beginning of week 3
<li>Activity 3 must be finished by start of week 3
<li>Activity 3 must be started by week 2 beginning
<li>Activity 2 must be started by week 7
<li>Activity 1 must be finished by end of week 6
</ul>
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/network-diagram-earliest-latest-start-finish-dates.png"
  alt="network diagram earliest and latest start and finish dates">  
<p>
With the completion of the forward and backward passes, all the earliest
and latest start and finish dates for milestones and activities is complete.
The diagram shows a complex set of dates and when.  In addition each activity
should have a slack time associated with it. Slack times are computed using
one of two methods:
<ol>
<li>Subtract earliest possible start date (ES) from the latest allowable 
start date (LS)
<li>Subtract earliest possible finish date (EF) from the latest allowable
finish date (LF)
</ol>
<p>
Activities with a slack time of 0 will form a component of the critical path.
Importantly, slack time is really associated with a sequence (path) of activities
rather than just one activity: the reason is that one activity's delay takes
away the slack time of another activity.
<p>
Two types of slack can be identified:
<ol>
<li>Total slack: the total amount of time a schedule activity may be delayed
without delaying the project end date or a schedule constraint. This is what
is generally considered slack.
<li>Free slack: The time a schedule activity may be delayed without delaying
the early start of any immediately following schedule activities
</ol>
<p>
To understand these, consider Activity 3 is scheduled for start at week 1
beginning and Activity 4 to start at week 3 beginning. Activity 3 can be
delayed for start by 1 week and Activity 4 will still be starting at week 3.
Thus the free slack is 1 week for Activity 3.  The total slack is also 1 week,
because Activity 3 can not accept a delay of more than 1 week if the project
is to finish in week 7.

<h2>Precedence</h2>
<p>
The general rules and procedures for creating network diagrams were discussed
above. The following discusses how to create and analyze network diagrams
for your project.
<p>
The discussion of precedence is about knowing in what order to perform activities.
A <dfn>predecessor</dfn> is an activity or milestone that determines when work
on another activity can begin (the activity that follows the predecessor is
called the <dfn>successor</dfn>).  Four relationships determine the 
predecessor-successor order:
<ul>
<li><b>Finish-to-start</b>:  predecessor must finish before successor can start
<li><b>Finish-to-finish</b>: predecessor must finish before successor can finish
<li><b>Start-to-start</b>: predecessor must start before successor can start
<li><b>Start-to-finish</b>: predecessor must start before successor can finish
</ul>
<p>
The Finish-to-start precedence relationship most commonly used, and so it is
case that predecessor must finish before successor activity can start or 
successor milestone can be reached.
<p>
Activity order determination is done according to following:
<ul>
<li><b>Mandatory dependencies</b>: any relationship that must be observed for
project success
 <ul>
 <li><b>Legal requirements</b>: laws and regulations at federal, state, and local
levels may require an approval process, such as drugs whose safety and efficacy
being demonstrated in clinical trials before the drug can be distributed and sold
 <li><b>Procedural requirements</b>: organizational policies and procedures
require some activities before others, such as approving a software development
design before the coding can proceed
 <li><b>Hard logic</b>: some activities must absolutely occur before others 
such as pouring a foundation to a house before house frame can be erected
 </ul>
<li><b>Discretionary dependencies</b>: any relationship that is chosen but not
required or mandatory
 <ul>
 <li><b>Logical dependencies</b>: this is the <q>hard logic</q> trait of the
mandatory dependency: writing chapter 2 must be done before writing chapter 3
of a book or manual because many of the notes for chapter 2 are needed to write
chapter 3
 <li><b>Managerial choices</b>: these are instances where work on activities
is arbitrary, and it may be the case that activities are done in letter order
(e.g. activity C done before activity D)
 </ul>
<li><b>External dependencies</b>: this is the case where the start of a project
activity requires completion of an activity outside the project. An example
is where a device being developed must be tested, but the testing cannot begin
because the device must be ordered and installed by another department whose
activities are not incorporated into the project
</ul>
<p>
<b>Immediate predecessors</b>. These are activities that proceed directly from
start of project. Decisions on whether to do them are one of two ways:
<ol>
<li><b>Front-to-back</b>: start with any and all activities that can be performed
as soon as project begins
 <ol>
 <li>Select 1st activity or activities to perform at project start
 <li>Decide other activities to be performed when first ones are finished
 <li>Continue until all activities are considered
 </ol>
<li><b>Back-to-front</b>:  decide instead on activites to be done last and
then move backward toward the beginning.
 <ol>
 <li>Identify last activities to be performed
 <li>Decide activities to be complete right before start of work on the last
 activities
 <li>Continue until all activities are considered
 </ol>
</ol>
<p>
In following these steps, have a table ready that is like the one below:
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/Immediate-Predecessor-Table.png"
  alt="table of immediate predecessors">  
<p>
Note that the precedence is not determined on the availability (if and when)
of resources, but rather the nature and requirements of the activity.
Consider that Activities A and B can be done at same time, but that it may be
the case that the same person works on them. Do not alter the ND for them to 
be done sequentially because it may later be the case another person is brought
on to do the other activity.
<p>
In doing small projects, write names of activities and milestones on sticky notes,
but for larger projects using integrated project management software.
<p>
<b>Example of Precedence</b>. The table below shows the project of picnic
preparation and its required activities.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/Picnic-Project-Example.png"
  alt="table of activities for project picnic">
It is decided that 7 activities are involved in picnic preparation for picnicking
at a local lake on Saturday which forecasts sunny and mild weather.  This
project is developed with the following constraints:
<ul>
<li>All activities cannot begin before 8 a.m. Saturday
<li>All 7 activities must be done for project to complete
<li>No changes as to who is present can be done during each activity
<li>There are two lakes to choose from, each in opposite directions from the
starting point of travel, and so a decision of which lake is required before
beginning a drive
</ul>
<p>
It should be noticed that the activities do not show the actual order of 
performance. Immediate predecessor evaluation has not been done.
<p>
Some things are clear: eggs must be boiled before egg sandwiches can be made.
The car must be loaded before driving can occur. All simple logic.
Other considerations also appear logical: a decision on the lake must be done;
after agreeing on the lake, drive to bank to get money; after getting money
from bank, buy gasoline. When agreeing on the lake, at the same time, the
friend begins to boil eggs; and after they are boiled, sandwiches made; and while
the sandwiches are made, perhaps you get the gas and return for loading of the
car.  These relationships are shown in the table below.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/Picnic-Immediate-Predecessors.png"
  alt="example of table of immediate predecessors using picnic">
<p>
This table is now used to make the ND. The steps to follow are:
<ol>
<li>Begin with labeling the Start milestone
<li>Locate activities with no immediate predecessors, which can all be started
after project Start: in this case only Activity 5 has no immediate predecessors.
<li>Draw the relationship from Start to Activity 5
<li>Now find all activities that have the first activity as their immediate
predecessor: Activities 2 and 7 precede Activity 5, so draw boxes with arrows
connecting them
<li>Find activities that have Activity 2 as predecessor (Activity 6) and 
Activity 7 as predecessor (Activity 3)
<li>Repeat the process in the previous step to make new relationships
<li>Now draw the box representing the End milestone from the activity that is
clearly last (Activity 4).
</ol>
<p>
The completed ND looks like the one below:
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/Picnic-Network-Diagram.png"
  alt="picnic network diagram">
<p>
The critical path must be assessed to determine project duration (57 minutes).
The next question is if any activities can be delayed and still get to the 
lake in 57 minutes. Because Activities 5, 7, 3, 1, and 4 are on critical path,
they cannot be delayed.  Activities 2 and 6 are not on the path and can be
done at same time as 7 and 3. Activities 7 and 3 take 20 minutes, while 2 and 6
take 15 minutes, so their total slack time is 5 minutes.
<p>
After getting to the activities from the WBS, now is the time to develop the
project schedule:
<ol>
<li>Identify immediate predecessors for all activities <br>
These define structure of ND
<li>Determine personnel and nonpersonnel resources for all activities <br>
The type, amount, and availability of resources affect duration of each activity.
<li><a href="#estimate-duration">Estimate durations</a> for all activities <br>
<li>Identify all intermediate and final dates that must be met
<li>Identify all activities and milestones outside the project affecting 
project activities <br>
After identifying external activities and milestones, appropriate dependencies
can be set
<li>Draw the network diagram (ND)
<li>Analyze the diagram to identify all critical paths and durations and 
identify slack times in noncritical paths
</ol>
<p>
Be careful of <q>backing in</q> to the schedule: which is to start at end of
project and working back to beginning to identify activities and estimate
durations.  This increases chances of not making the schedule because
<ul>
<li>activities are missed because focus is on meeting time constraint and not
identify all required work
<li>duration estimates end up on what activities are allowed to take rather
than what they are required to take
<li>the order of proposed activities may not be the most effective one
</ul>
<p>
Time constraints.  Suppose the analyzed project has duration estimated at
3 months, but client wants it in 2 months.  The critical path will be re-evaluated
as follows:
<ul>
<li>Recheck the original estimates for activity duration: has the activity 
been clearly described? was past performance/experience used as guide? 
have other experts/consultants reviewed and validated estimates? have the people
who will do work been asked if estimates are good?
<li>What about using more experienced personnel?  Can get more work done in less
time, thus reducing critical path length
<li>What about different strategies in performing activities? Perhaps an activity
done internally in org takes 3 weeks, but outside contractor can do it in 
2 weeks.
<li>Fast tracking, which is performing tasks at the same time normally done
sequentially: clearly this shortens time, but it might increase risk of a redo,
for which one must be ready
</ul>
<p>
In the picnic example, suppose the 57 minute plan is unacceptable because
friend wants to get to lake in 45 minutes.  12 minutes must be shaved.
If the drive takes 30 minutes, one might speed and get there in 18 minutes.
But that entails a risk. For reducing time, perform following steps:
<ol>
<li>Find the critical path and make activity modifications to reduce durations
until the critical path time falls so that another path becomes critical.
<li>Now shorten both critical paths until a 3rd path becomes critical.
<li>Continue shortening all critical paths to make other paths critical.
</ol>
<p>
Another approach is to try to do activities simultaneously, taking them off the
critical path. In the picnic example, the sandwich-making activity might
be done by the friend in the drive to the lake. This rearrangement of the ND
ends up creating two critical paths of 52 min (see below).
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/ND-change1.png"
  alt="picnic network diagram change 1">
<p>
The activity of getting money from the ATM can be paralleled with the activity
of gassing up the car, saving an additional 5 minutes.  And the decision of
going to the lake can be made at the same time the car is loaded, saving 2 
minutes.  These changes are reflected in the ND below.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/ND-change2.png"
  alt="picnic network diagram change 2">
<p>
This analysis gets complicated in that there is a price to pay for doing activities
faster.  The price is increased time in planning the detail and interrelationships
because there is no allowance for mistakes.  Assumptions grow in number and this
increases risk something can go wrong.  in this picnic example, assumptions
include being able to get to a gas island at 8 a.m., customers are long in the
queue at the gas station, the ATM is available within the scheduled time, 
the decision on the lake does not decay into an argument, the friend can make
sandwiches with making a mess of the car.
<p>
Activity subdivision. Often in project planning, an activity is really dividable
into more specific activities that form a sequential chain.  The activity of
boiling eggs involves preparing to boil (remove pot from shelf, take eggs out
of fridge, put water and eggs in pto, put pot on stove, turn on heat) which takes
3 minutes; the boiling of the eggs in water is a 2nd subactivity taking 7 minutes,
for a total of 10 minutes.  As for sandwich making, there is preparing to 
make the sandwiches (getting bread, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes from fridge,
wax paper from drawer, putting bread on wax paper..estimated 7 minuties) then
making the sandwiches (eggs from pot, shelling them, slicing egg, putting on
bread, slicing sandwich, wrapping...estimated 3 minutes).
<p>
With this reconfiguration of the egg sandwich making, the critical path is 
reduced to 13 minutes from 20.

<h2 id="estimate-duration">Estimating Activity Duration</h2>
<p>
Activities should be estimated for the duration they actually require.
<p>
They are not estimated for how long someone wants it to take, nor how long 
someone says that it must take.  Overly optimistic or unrealistic short
duration estimates can cause an activity to take longer than necessary because
<ol>
<li>Unrealistic estimates create appearance of meeting schedule targets, so
alternative strategies are not considered that increase chances of completing
project successfully
<li>With unrealistic duration estimates, team members may not try to achieve 
them, resigning themselves to an inevitable delay and not being motivated to
meet an impossible deadline
</ol>
<p>
The factors in estimating duration involve past experience, expert opinions, 
and other sources of information and knowing the components involved in the 
activity:
<ul>
<li><b>Activities performed by people</b>: these require the physical and mental
activities of people, such as report writing, equipment assembly, brainstorming
for ad campaign
<li><b>Activities performed by nonhuman resources</b>: things that information
systems (computers) or machines do, like software testing, report printing on
high-speed copy machine
<li><b>Physical processes</b>: physical or chemical reactions, such as curing
concrete, drying paint, laboratory chemical reactions
<li><b>Time delays</b>: time in which nothing happens, such as needing to
reserve conference room two weeks before holding a meeting
</ul>
<p>
Duration estimates also require knowing the resource types.  Not all copy 
machines copy at the same rates as an example. For each resource type, 
it is important to determine <b>capacity</b> (productivity per unit time) and 
<b>availability</b> (date a resource is available).
<p>
Sources of information for helping in predicting duration include looking as
past records in projects with similar activities, consulting people who have
performed similar activities, people who will be working on these activities,
and experts familiar with the activity type even if they have not performed
the activity that is described exactly.
<p>
Additionally, it is important to have a very accurate description of the 
activity (minimize technical jargon and use full descriptions fo work processes).
<p>
Subdivide activities until the lowest level activity estimates are 2 weeks or
less.
<p>
Define the start and end points of an activity clearly.
<p>
Minimize use of fudge factors:  this is an added amount of time to the activity
for the purpose of being safe.  Fudge factors make project managers lazy in
thinking through the activity. Moreover an activity that really only takes 2 weeks
but uses a 50% fudge factor to make it 3 weeks will not really get done within
2 weeks ever.
<p>
<b>Hard-to-Estimate Activities</b>. Some activities are hard to find a duration
for. No one has ever done them before, or they will be done in the future,
or they have a history of unpredictability.  In this case, make the best estimate
by using approaches and guidelines discussed here.  Monitor these activities
quite closely to find clues that affect initial estimate. Update the project
schedule as soon as changes become known.

<h3>PERT</h3>
<p>
The <b>Program Evaluation and Review Technique</b> (PERT) is a network analysis
methodology that considers duration of an activity as a random variable with
probability of the variable having different values described by a beta
distribution.  The characteristics of the beta distribution provide for an
 <i>average value</i> ( <i>expected value</i> ) on duration of activity from 
three time estimates
<ol>
<li><b>optimistic estimate ( <i>t</i> <sub>o</sub>)</b>: 99 times in 100 the duration
will be &ge; <i>t</i> <sub>o</sub>
<li><b>most likely estimate ( <i>t</i> <sub>m</sub>)</b>: <i>n</i> times in 100, 
where <i>n</i> is the greatest value of all possible numbers, duration 
is &ge; <i>t</i> <sub>m</sub>
<li><b>pessimistic estimate ( <i>t</i> <sub>p</sub>)</b>: 99 times in 100 the duration
will be &le; <i>t</i> <sub>p</sub>
</ol>
The expected value <i>t</i> <sub>e</sub> will be computed as:
<p class="eqn">
 <i>t</i> <sub>e</sub> = ( <i>t</i> <sub>o</sub> + 4 <i>t</i> <sub>m</sub> + 
 <i>t</i> <sub>p</sub>) &divide; 6

<h2>Project Schedule Display</h2>
<p>
As the ND does not specify project schedule, unless activities on critical path,
it is time to display the project schedule.  The ND gives info to develop 
the properly displayed schedule.  Schedules are presented in different formats:
<ul>
<li>Milestone list: a table showing milestones and dates to be reached
<li>Activity list:  table showing activities with dates for start and end
<li>Combined milestone / activity list:  this table presents the combination
<li>Gantt chart: Timeline showing activity start and end position
<li>Modified Gantt chart: the Gantt chart with milestones shown too
</ul>
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/project-schedule-displays.png"
  alt="displays of project schedules">
  
<h1>Project Personnel</h1>
<p>
Project success depends on an ability to get qualified people to perform the
project work.  In planning, the projects required results and major deliverables
are first determined.  The WBS further details intermediate and final deliverables.
Then activities must be determined to create the deliverables in the work
packages.  A determination of the skills and knowledge people must have follows.
<p>
For each activity, the skills and knowledge required is determined.
The next step is to confirm the people have those skills and knowledge.
Additionally the person must have the interest to do the activity.
<p>
In the first stage, complete the list of all project activities and decompose
all work packages.  Check the WBS dictionary: unique name, identifier code,
duration, predecessors, successors.
<p>
Skill and knowledge requirements for the activity can be determined from 
activity descriptions and consulting subject-matter experts, HR people, and
people with past experience on similar projects and activities.
<p>
Part of the determination requires talking to the people who assign staff to
the project, and learn if they have a skills roster, or to learn how they 
determine skills and knoledge. This same scheme can be used with the S&amp;K
requirements written into the project.
<p>
Two items of information are required for determining if a person has qualifications
for the project:
<ol>
<li>Required level of proficiency in needed skills and knowledge
<li>whether the assignment requires a supervisor while having the level of 
skill and knowledge, or working alone to apply the skills and knowledge,
or managing others who apply the skills and knowledge
</ol>
Consider this description to be ( <i>X, Y</i> ), where X is the required 
level of proficiency of skills &amp; knowledge and has values:
<ol>
<li> = basic level of proficiency
<li> = intermediate level of proficiency
<li> = advanced level of proficiency
</ol>
and where Y is the required working relationship when applying the skill or
knowledge and has possible values of:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li> = does not entail managing others using skill or knowledge
<li> = entails managing others using skill or knowledge
</ol>

<h2>Skills Matrix</h2>
<p>
In every case the project manager must have an accurate assessment of the 
S&amp;K even if the team members are not chosen by the manager. The skills 
matrix gives information about who can do what and also importantly who is
interested in doing an activity even if they may not have the experience of
skills.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/skills-matrix.png"
  alt="skills matrix">
<p>
Be sure to ask if the organization already has Skills Matrices.

<h2>Human Resources Matrix</h2>
<p>
With a Human Resources Matrix, the amount of time a person must spend on the
project is tabulated.  This is called the <i>work effort</i> or <i>person 
effort</i> . Effort is given as person-hours, person-days, etc.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/human-resources-matrix.png"
  alt="human resources matrix">
<p>
The HR Matrix should specify skills and knowledge, position name or title, 
and the name of the person doing the work.  Skills and knowledge descriptions
should be as precise as possible to ensure getting the right person for the 
job. It is okay to specify names and position titles, but often a specific
person might be unavailable or a person of such a title is not fully 
descriptive.
<p>
For all work packages, estimate work effort that must be done by each person
and enter estimates into HR Matrix.  Detail all direct and indirect work:
all director work is about the activity completing the work package such 
as writing a report, meeting with clients, doing lab test, designing new
logo. All indirect work is things like training, preparing periodic activity-progress
reports.
<p>
In accounting for the work effort, use any history that indicates the actual
work effort on a similar activity, given the work package has been done before.
Consider whether people who did the work before have the qualifications and 
experience of those who will work on the project; that the other resources
for the past project are available for the present project; and that the time
frame was similar to the one anticipated for the project.
<p>
The person to do the work should also weigh in with an estimated work effort 
as well: by this they improve their understanding of the activity, they assess
what their skills, knowledge and prior experience are for the work package,
and they increase their commitment to the activity. These people should also 
be involved in the initial planning.
<p>
Consulting other experts on work effort should be done if they are available
and can improve the estimation.

<h2>Productivity, Efficiency, Availability in Work Estimates</h2>
<p>
Productivity is the results (work product) of a person per unit time spent 
on that activity.  Factors affecting productivity include skills and knowledge
(raw talent and capabilities), prior experience, sense of urgency, ability to
multitask (hitting a roadblock and not doing anything in frustration over that),
quality &amp; setup of work environment to enable productivity.
<p>
Efficiency is the proportion of time a person spends on project work relative
to other organizational duties, which can include professional duties such as
attending nonproject meetings, handling incidental requests, reading technical
journals, in addition to personal activities such as going to restroom, getting
drink of water, chatting with co-workers.
<p>
Availability is the time person is at work and not on leave: vacation days,
sick days, holidays, personal days, mental health days, admin leave, etc.
<p>
It is essential to reflect efficiency in the work estimates: perhaps time
sheets exist to compare estimated work effort to actual work effort.
<p>
Difficulties in estimation may arise if people spend overtime doing the
activity but are not allowed to record that overtime (perhaps they are salaried
workers); or if people fill out their time cards later, they may inaccurately
estimate how much time they spent on a project work package.
<p>
<b>Personal Estimates of Work Effort</b>. Ask people first to estimate how
much time it would take to do the work effort at 100% efficiency, with no 
interruptions. Then get the estimate he figures factoring in inefficiency.
Suppose a person estimates 30 person-hours to do a job, and you believe he
is 75% efficient, then estimate the work effort at 40 person-hours.
Use the table below as a guide as how many hours of work effort are involved
depending on efficiency and availability.
<table class="td-center">
<caption>Person-Hours Available for Project Work</caption>
<tr><th rowspan="2"><th colspan="3">Productive Person-Hours Available
<tr><th>100% Efficiency <br>100% Availability
   <th>75% Efficiency <br>100% Availability
   <th>75% Efficiency <br>75% Availability
<tr><td class="left">1 person-day <td>8  <td>6  <td>4.5
<tr><td class="left">1 person-week <td>40 <td>30 <td>22.5
<tr><td class="left">1 person-month <td>173 <td>130 <td>98
<tr><td class="left">1 person-year <td>2,080 <td>1,560 <td>1,170
</table>
<p>
Reminders:
<ul>
<li>Work packages should be defined clearly without too much technical jargon
and good descriptions of associated work prcesses
<li>Subdivide the work: the estimates of lowest level activities should be
two weeks or less
<li>Updates with change: re-evaluate work-effort estimates when personnel or
task assignments change
</ul>
<h2>Ensuring the Meeting of Resource Commitments</h2>
<p>
This is about identifying resource overloads and resolving them when work 
effort is scheduled for a task that may be divided and involve multitasking.
The fist thing is planning of initial allocations of effort/time  and even whether
activities will overlap (be done at same time).
<p>
This involves the use of the HR Matrix and of creating a Person-Loading Graph
or Chart for even individual in the matrix.  This is also called a Resource
Histogram.  The person-loading graph is shown below with a Gantt chart: it shows
peaks and valleys and potential overloads visually.  The person-loading chart
is in tabular format and show exact work-effort values.
<table class="center">
<caption>Planned Duration and Work Effort for Three Activities</caption>
<tr><th style="width:6em;">Activity
  <th style="width:6em;">Duration (In&nbsp;Weeks)
  <th style="width:10em;">Work Effort (In&nbsp;Person-Hours)
<tr><td>Activity 1  <td>3   <td>60
<tr><td>Activity 2  <td>2   <td>40
<tr><td>Activity 3  <td>3   <td>30
</table>
<p>
In the table above Activity 1 takes 3 weeks, Activity 2 takes 2 weeks,
and Activity 3 takes 3 weeks.  Activity 1 will take 50% of the 3 week 
available work time and the same for Activity 2 over its 2 week duration,
while Activity 3 will take 25% of the work time.  As efficiency is already
accounte for in these estimates, the activities will be completed with time
to do non-project work.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/person-loading-graph.png"
  alt="person-loading chart or graph + Gantt chart">
<p>
The Gantt chart was discussed before and shows each activity as a horizontal
bar along a horizontal axis showing the whole of the project duration divided
by weeks with the start and end of each work package.  This chart shows
activity overlap, indicating the intention to work on more than one activity
at a time.  Thus instead of consecutive work requiring a duration of 3 + 2 + 3
= 8 weeks, the plan is to complete all activities within 5 weeks.
<p>
The Gantt chart reveals that Week 3 has one person working 50 hours: if that
is not manageable, a different schedule must be revised.
<p>
The person-loading chart should have a Total column on the right which totals
the person-unit-time for each individual. It should have a Total row on the
bottom that totals the person-unit-time for each subdivided period, which might
be day, week, month usually.  The bottom-right cell of the table should have
the total person-unit-time that sums the right column and bottom row in agreeement.
<p>
Use the grand total sum to develop the budget for personnel at the weighted
labor rates.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/multiproject-person-loading.png"
  alt="Combining person-loading charts into one from multiple projects">
  
<h1>Resource Planning &amp; Budget Development</h1>
<p>
Planning for non-personnel resources is vital since the unavailability of these
resources result in costly delay and a reduced commitment to the project from
team members.
<p>
As part of the paperwork in this resource planning, these will be developed:
<ul>
<li>Nonpersonnel Resources Matrix
<li>Nonpersonnel Resources Usage Charts
<li>Nonpersonnel Resources Usage Summary
</ul>
<p>
The NPR matrix displays inforomation for every work package in the WBS.  In the
example below, for each work package in the WBS, the time of resource usage
for computers, copier, and testing lab are given for three work packages in the
project. The shaded column for computers will be broken down by use each week
in the project in the table further below.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/nonpersonnel-resources-matrix.png"
  alt="Non-personnel resources matrix">
<p>
Resource usage amounts are computed by requiring information such as the 
capacity of a resource to make the product in a unit of time, and compute that
from the total amount of product needed.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/specific-nonpersonnel-resource-usage-chart.png"
  alt="Specific nonpersonnel resources usage example">
<p>
Finally the use of resources broken down by time periods is shown in the 
personnel summary usage chart. This helps in planning for when a resource
must be available during a long term project.
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/personnel-summary-usage-chart.png"
  alt="Non-personnel resources usage summary">

<h2>Project Costs &amp; Budgets</h2>
<p>
A <dfn>project budget</dfn> is a detailed, time-phased estimate of all resource
costs for the project. Producing a budget goes from rough estimates initially 
to more detailed ones at approval stage. Revisions are likely while the
project is underway.
<p>
Budgets include <b>direct</b> and <b>indirect</b> costs. Direct costs are
costs for resources solely used for the project, and include:
<ul>
<li>Portions of salaries paid to team members for time spent on project
<li>Materials, supplies and equipment specifically acquired for the project
<li>Travel (time/cost) spent in the performance of project work
<li>Any subcontracts providing support exclusively to the project
</ul> 
<p>
Indirect costs are those for resources supporting activities outside the project
and not identifiable or chargeable exclusively to any single project.  These
include
<ul>
<li>Overhead: products and services not attributable to the project or 
subdivided or allocated to project directly.  Employee benefits, office space
rent, general supplies, and costs of furniture, fixtures, and equipment fall
in this
<li>General and administrative costs: these are generally any costs to keep
the organization moving: salaries of the contract department, finance department,
top management and fees for accounting &amp; legal.
</ul>
<p>
An example of direct costs to produce a company brochure would include
<ul>
<li>labor: salaries for team member and project manager to pay for hours spent
on producing brochure
<li>materials: special paper stock
<li>travel: driving around to find firms that design the brochure cover
<li>subcontract: services of a company to provide cover art1
</ul>
<p>
Indirect costs for producing the brochure are:
<ul>
<li>employee benefits: annual/sick/holiday leave; health & life insurance;
retirement plan contributions
<li>rent: cost of office space that is place for brochure production
<li>equipement: computer for composing brochure
<li>management &amp; administrative salaries: manager and staff pay for personnel
that keep company going
</ul>

<h3>Three Stages of The Budget</h3>
<p>
In the first stage is the <b>rough order-of-magnitude estimate</b>.  This estimate
can be based on costs of similar prior projects (or from activities part of
the project whose detailed costs are known). These are highly approximate.
These estimates are about what someone wants to spend rather than what project
will really cost, and the final can be double this estimate.  Detail at the
work package level is not done.
<p>
In the second stage is the <b>detailed budget estimate</b>.  This involves
a more detailed itemized estimate for all project activities in the WBS with
costs for each work package.
<p>
The third stage is the <b>completed, approved project budget</b>. The budget
has been seen and revised at many levels by those involved in the planning,
and now it has been signed off as part of the decision making for proceeding
or not on the project.

<h3>Moving The Budget Through Project Life Cycle</h3>
<p>
The budget determination process is completed by the first two stages involving
project start and organizing and preparing. In carrying out the work, the 
approved budget is consulted as formal agreements for equipment use, facilities,
vendors and other resources get underway.
<p>
Where budget revisions can occur in a project include:
<ul>
<li>Personnel on the project are more or less experienced than expected
or described, saving or losing money as the case may be
<li>Prices for good and services have changed (increased)
<li>Required nonpersonnel resource become unavailable
<li>Clients modifying or adding results to the project
</ul>
<p>
Always obtain approval where necessary for any changes to an approved budget
before beginning the work. Especially do not commence work packages where
their estimates have been changed and not approved.
<p>
Be vigilant about spending during the project work package and report differences
to clients and drivers.
<p>
In the 2nd stage of budget estimation, the detailed approach can be done
from the bottom-up, determining each package in the WBS, or from the top-down
in which there may be a target budget for the project and there is an effort
to fit costs at lower levels in the WBS.
<p>
With the bottom-up approach
<ol>
<li>Start with finding <b>direct labor costs</b> for
each work package. This requires knowing the hourly salary and the work package's
hours of work effort. The actual salary of the person can be used to get the
most reliable estimate, or the average salary of people with a particular job
title can be used.
<li>Estimate <b>direct costs</b> for non-personnel resources: material, equipment,
travel, contractural services, etc.
<li>Now compute the <b>indirect costs</b>. Often this is computed as a fraction
of the direct costs; this fraction is determined usually once a year by dividing
the estimated indirect costs by the estimated direct labor costs for the coming
fiscal year.
</ol>
<p>
Consider an example: the company brochure will be produced with project manager
spending 200 person-hours at $30/hour and another person (Mary) spending 100 person-hours
at $25/hour. Stationery costs will be $1000. Travel costs to go to venoors
and get supplies are $300. A vendor will get $5000 for artwork. The organization
has 60% rate of indirect costs to the direct costs.  The table below represents
the project estimated budget:
<p>
<img src="imagesProjectManagementHTML/example-bottom-up-budget-estimate.png"
  alt="Example of a bottom-up estimate of a project budget">
<p>
The top-down approach might be used after a bottom-up evaluation is done.
Suppose all work packages for developing a new type of equipment are determined 
and the total is $100,000. At Level 2, these are design = $60,000, 
development = $15,000, testing = $5000, and production = $20,000. But experience
with similar projects shows that design is 40% of the budget, not 60% as shown
above. If the $60,000 is sound, then this is for a project of $150,000, not
$100,000.
<p>
One of two approaches can be taken:  one is to scale down the design to $40,000,
or the other is to request another $50,000 for the project and proportionate it.
<h3>Two Options on Indirect Cost Estimation</h3>
<p>
Indirect costs generally divided into (1) Overhead and (2) General and 
Administrative. The finance people in the organization fix the rates.
<ul>
<li>Separate Percentages
 <ol>
 <li>Overhead rate = Projected Overhead Costs / All Projected Salaries Direct Costs
 <li>General &amp; Administrative rate = All projected general and administrative
 costs / Sum of all salaries (direct cost basis), overhead, other direct costs
 </ol>
<li>Single Percentage
<br> Rate = all projected overhead costs / all project salaries as direct cost
</ul>
<p>
Some organizations have <i>weighted labor rates</i> which combine the hourly
salary with the indirect costs built in.  If a salary is $30/hour and indirect
cost rate is 50%, then the weighted labor rate is $45/hour.

<h1 id="riskmanagement">Risk and Its Management</h1>
<p>
Especially for large and/or complex projects, there should be a discussion
and formal expression of where things can go wrong and how they will be 
handled. Potential risks must be identified and described immediately in the
draft stage since these will be considered in whether the project goes forward.
<p>
<dfn>Risk</dfn> is possibility that a product, schedule, resource target or 
result may not be obtained or achieved. There are occurrences of something
unexpected and adverse, and there are non-occurrences of things planned.
Project risk is magnified when
<ul>
<li>project durations are long(er)
<li>there is a delay (time gap/period) between preparation and beginning the
work
<li>there are inexperienced people on the project (including manager)
<li>there is a newness to the technology
</ul>
<p>
Risks can be <b>negative</b>, which is a <i>threat</i> to the project, detrimental
to achieving an objective and perhaps causing a missed deadline.
<p>
Risks are also seen as <b>positive</b>, which is an <i>opportunity</i> , which
have beneficial effects on project objectives and assist in task completion.
<p>
<dfn>Risk management</dfn> is defined as:
<ul>
<li>process of identifying possible risks
<li>assessing potential consequences
<li>developing and implementing plans to minimize negative effects
</ul>
<p>
In all cases monitor for occurrences of noted risks and explain to audience
before project start.

<h2>Risk Factors</h2>
<p>
A <dfn>risk factor</dfn> is a situation that may give rise to one or more risks
to the project. It does not cause the effect of the risk, but it increases
chances something may happen that will be the result of the risk.
<p>
One risk factor is taking on a project which has not been done before (the 
risk of using a first timer). There is a stronger possibility that activities
that should be performed are overlooked, or time and resources are underestimated.
<p>
The most difficult aspect of risks is identifying them and how to overcome
or deal with problems.  The table below identifies possible risk factors in 
each or all of the life cycle stages of a project.

<h2>Risk Identification</h2>
<p>
After risk factors have been recognized, then specific risks can be identified
from them. For example, if a new technology is being used, how can it cause
the product, schedule or resource target to be unavailable or miss a deadline?
New technology produces different risks:
<ul>
<li>product risk: a new tech may not produce desired results
<li>schedule risk: new tech may require longer activity durations
<li>resource risk: existing facilities and equipment may not be adequate in
supporting new tech
</ul>
<p>
Risk identification involves these steps
<ul>
<li>reviewing past records of problems in similar situations
<li>
</ul>
