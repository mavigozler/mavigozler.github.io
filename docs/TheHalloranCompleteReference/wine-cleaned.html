    <p id="title">Fortified Wines</p>
    <p>
      From Beedell, S.,
      <i>Wine Making and Home Brewing</i>
      , (London: Sphere Books, Ltd.), 1969.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <u>must</u>
      and
      <u>fermentation</u>
      : ill the must into the fermentation bottles two inches from the bung.
      Keep some in another bottle to fill in case of a violent first
      fermentation. Keep the fermentation jars at about 65� F. If the
      fermentation stops, possible reasons are (a) the temperature was too high
      or low, (b) the sugar was too little or much, (c) there was too much acid,
      (d) there was too much yeast starter, or (e) too much alcohol was added if
      a fortified fermentation was intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the fermentation is done,
      <u>rack</u>
      it several times to begin to introduce clarity. Siphon and then top it up
      in a clean jar. If there is no brew available to top it, water and a
      little sugar will do. Cork it and leave it for 2 months. Rack it off
      again, leaving the sediment. Top up the bottle and then re-cork. In three
      months, rack it into bottles and cork those. If it is still hazy
      (unclarified), then there is too much pectin. If a gallon jar is
      available, take out one pint and work in a teaspoon of pectozyme. Leave in
      a warm place for 4 days before pouring it back into the jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wine can be
      <u>fined</u>
      by using the store-bought variety or by beating one-half of an egg white
      into one-half pint of wine, which will clear 6 gals. Alternatively, egg
      shells baked in a slow oven until brittle, followed by crumbling them into
      a powder, and then adding a pinch to a bottle will clear wine in a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Bottling</u>
      is done in clean sterilized bottles. Fill by siphoning; leave a 1 inch
      long air space in the neck so that a small gap remains between the cork
      and the wine. Corks should be dipped and treated in 1 pint of boiling
      water with 1 teaspoon of glycerine added.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Correction</u>
      and
      <u>blending</u>
      of the wine can be done with dried bananas (1 lb./gal. wine). Leave there
      for 4 days in the first gallon. The bananas can be re-used, but the
      racking should be longer each time they are re-used. Sometimes the wine
      can be topped by blending with a wine of too acidic or too sweet quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortification of wine is done by adding brandy or gin before the
      fermentation has quite finished. If the fermentation has finished, the
      added alcohol will not blend properly. This is how imitation port and
      sherry are made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real sherry is made by deliberately allowing the air to oxidize the wine;
      a sherry yeast must be used as well. Campden tablets are never used in
      this process. Do not rack after fermentation, but let the brew sit for 2
      months, then rack and add brandy, gin, vodka, or whiskey in 1 part to 15
      parts brew. Rack into an oak cask, tightly bunged, and leave as long as
      possible. Sweet sherry requires adding sugar in stages, but not
      immediately after fermentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Port is made strong and sweet and red from adding elderberry, blackberry,
      or black currant. Add spirits during fermentation to inhibit it, then rack
      and bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping records of the production process may help. Enter the recipe in
      detail, indicating operation, date of operation, the container, the
      specific gravity at the time, and any remarks.

      Wherever syrup of sugar is called for, boil 2 lb sugar in 1 pt water,
      stirring consisently.
      <br />
      Wherever acid is called for, juice 8 lemons or use 1 oz. of citrate (must
      be slightly bitter).
    </p>
    <p>For tannins, tea is usually added.</p>

      Boil honey in water, pour into large container, cool and add the fruit
      juice, nutrient and yeast. After fermentation, rack, mature, and bottle.
      Allow 12 months before drinking.

    <h1>COWSLIP MEAD</h1>
    For every gallon of water, add 2 lb honey and boil 45 min, skimming
    occasionally. Take 1 pt of the mixture, slice into it a large lemon, and
    pour the rest into a large container followed by 1 gallon of cowslip heads.
    Stir well, cover, and set in a warm place for 24 h. Stir in lemon liquor, 2
    sprigs sweet briar (optional), ¼ oz yeast dissolved in a little honey.
    Ferment for 4 days, strain into fermentation jars and cover. Bottle when
    done.

    <p>
      Boil the honey in water for 1 hr, skim, and allow to cool to lukewarm. Add
      all other ingredients except the lemon rind, and follow with yeast
      starter. Put the must into a fermentation jar, drop in the rind and allow
      to ferment in a warm room at even temperature. Rack and bottle.
    </p>
    <h1>SWEET MEAD</h1>
    Work up the same as dry mead, but use 4 and ½ lb honey. ½ lb of white sugar
    is added as a thick syrup after about 10 days.

    <table>

        <tr><td>2 tablets of yeast nutrient</td></tr>
        <tr><td>champagne yeast</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Made in the same fashion as dry mead until the bottling stage. Pour into
      champagne bottles (this is absolutely necessary), prime with 1 tsp of
      sugar and a tiny bit of yeast to start the fermentation in order to make
      gas. Corks must be wired down. Care should be taken when re-opening. 12
      month bottling is needed. Chill when serving.

      Simmer herbs and spices in water for 30 min, pour on to the honey.
      Continue as for regular mead by adding nutrient, acid, then yeast. Ferment
      well covered for 1 day before straining into fermentation jar.
