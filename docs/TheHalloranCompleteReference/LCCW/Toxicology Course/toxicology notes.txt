* hydrogen sulfide
* nitrogen oxides (NxOy)
* ozone
* sulfur oxides (SxOy)
* CO2
given in ug/m3 or ppm by volume

Particulate Pollutants
fine solids or liq droplets suspended in air
* dust: particles ca. 100 um dia from coal dust, ash, sawdust, cement, grain dust
* fumes: suspended solids < 1 um dia from metallurgicla process (Zn or Pb oxides)
* mist: liq droplets about 2 um dia (sulfuric acid mist)
* smoke: solid particles from 0.05 - 1 um from incomplete combustion
* aerosol: liq or solid particles (< 1.0 um dia) suspended in air or another gas

Sources
Natural -- volcanoes, forest & prairie fires, dust storms, oceans (aerosols making salt particles); plants & trees: hydrocarbons ("blue haze" is from volatile organics
reacting with atmosphere) and pollens and spores

Anthropogenic -- fossil fuel combustion, industrial processed, mining & drilling. Pollutants are fly ash, smoke, sulfur & nitrogen oxides, and CO and CO2

Indoor -- heating & cooking, pesticides, tobacco smoking, radon, gases from people and animals.

Pollution of Air

Carbon Monoxide -- has 210 times more affinity for Hb than O2.  5% COHb will cause cardiovascular effects.  At 100 ppm (0.01%) will cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, breathing difficulties.  At 1000 ppm will be fatal.

Sulfur oxides
from combustion of coal (soft coal has highest levels).  Adheres to air particles, often inhaled and causing acidic irritation of respiratory tract tissues.

Nitrogen oxides
NO2 is in photochemical smog and a pulmonary irritant, causing edema and hemorrhage.

Ozone
Formed in photochemical smog from UV light on NO2:
NO2 + UV -> NO• + O• (free radical)
O• + O2 -> O3•
This is tropospheric ozone (between 0-10 miles above surface. Stratospheric ozone protects from UV.  CFCs are contributing to loss of ozone in catalytic way:  Cl• + O3 -> ClO• + O2   ClO• + O• -> Cl + O2:  net O3 + O -> 2 O2

Hydrocarbons and VOCs
50% of HC and VOCs are biogenic from trees while other is combustion or vapor from gasoline. Gas pumps have VOC recovery devices to reduce pollution.

Lead
Pb impairs renal function, interferes with blood cell development, impairs nervous system, cause mental retardation and blindness.  Lead is inhaled or ingested.

Solid Particles
Coal, clay, glass, asbestos, and minerals produce dust and fibers that can scar or cause fibrosis in lungs.  Pneumoconiosis is a condition in coal miners from coal dust.  Silicosis is from breathing in silica-containing dust.  Asbestosis from asbestos fibers.

ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

Vegetation
Pollutants can cause bleaching in plant tissue.  Changes in forest ecosystems, altering species dominance, including forest pests.

Domestic Animals
Animals in human food change might ingest pollutants in forage.  Particularly the problem of feed containing arsenic, lead, and molybdenum. Fluorides from phosphate fertilizer production and derivatives damage cattle livestock, because phosphate rock has up to 4% fluoride released to air and water.  Fluorosis in animals seen as mottled or soft teeth, osteofluoritic bone lesions, causing lameness and death

Building & Structures
Soiled or blackened by smoke or chemical attack.  Gases mixed with water cause acids dissolving stone.

METALS
Fall into three classes (1) suspected carcinogens (2) quite mobile in soil (3) food chain present

Lead: worry is in drinking water from pipes and solder in pipes.  Lead in hazardous waste sites as well as from leaded gasoline storage.

Arsenic:  pesticides (from past) used inorganic arsenic compounds from which it leaches. Fossil fuels contain arsenic.  Mine tailings and smelter runoff can contain arsenic.  High levels of arsenic cause abnormal skin pigmentation, hyperkeratosis, nasal congestion, abdominal pain.  Lower levels may be carcinogenic (skin, lungs, lymph glands).

Cadmium:  aquatic organisms accumulate it and contribute to food chain  Itai-Itai in certain areas of Japan related to Cd toxicity: combination of severe kidney damage and painful bone-and-joint disease and due to high Cd in rice.

Mercury: in 1950-60, Minamata Bay in Japan had high levels from chemical and plastics plants with Hg runoff.  Methylmercury increased because of mud bacteria, and fish and shellfish had high levels.  Infants developed cerebral palsy and mental development problems.

Water and soil pollutants include organochlorine pesticides: DDT, aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane not easily degradable.  Shrimp and fish can concentrate these 1000- to 10,000-fold.  Organophosphorous (malathion) and carbamate (carbaryl) pesticides more rapidly degradable.

Fertilizers contribute to presence of nitrates and phosphates.  Nitrates are more soluble and enter to runoff, while phosphates are absorbed and bound to soil particles.

Increases in nutrient (esp. phosphate) levels in water result in algal blooms and eutrophication, affecting light penetration in lakes and reduced dissolved oxygen.  This can result in fish kills and soil anaerobiosis.
Drinking water nitrates may lead to nitrosamine formation and methhemoglobinemia.  High nitrites are utilized by intestinal bacteria: they can enter blood and cause MetHbemia, and lead to anemia and blue baby disease.  Infants do not possess as much methemoglobin reductase as older children and adults.

VOCs are contaminants of groundwater, and include halogenated solvents and petroleum products, used in large amounts by industry for degreasing, dry cleaning, paint, and military.  These chemicals stored in underground tanks that erode or are spilled on soil surfaces.  Eleven VOCs are on EPA Priority List:  trichloroethylene (TriCE), toluene, benzene, chloroform, tetrachloroethylene (TetCE), 1,1,1-trichlorethane, ethylbenzene, trans-1,2-dichloroethene, xylene, dichloromethane, vinyl chloride.

Low MW chlorinated hydrocarbons occur as chlorination of water byproduct.  Trihalomethanes can occur (chloroform, for example), but the bromo- and chloromethane and ethanes can result too.  Cancer is associated with drinking halomethanes in cleaned tap water.

Soil and water also accumulated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols, cyanides, plasticizers, solvents.  PCBs were transformer coolants and chemically stable, breaking down slowly in tissues.

Dioxins affect water and soil.  TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) is extremely toxic and also found in herbicide 2,4,5-T

Regulating Exposure in Workplace
Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) establish concentrations typically of airborne pollutants.  Those under TLVs indicate daily repeated exposure in which there is no adverse effect.  TLVs are established by industrial experience, studies on humans and animals, and combinations of both.  TLVs can be set as follows:
1) TLV-time-weighted average (TLV-TWA) is concentration for 8-hour workday or 40-hour workweek.  Above limit exposure must be compensated by below limit exposure.
2) TLV-short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL) maximal concentration of exposure for up to 15 min continuously with no indication of irritation, chronic or irreversible tissue change, narcosis of a degree that might result in accident proneness, impair self-rescue, or affect work efficiency provided no more than 4 excursions per day are permitted and there is 60 min betwen exposure periods and dialy TLV-TWA not exceeded
3) TLV-ceiling (TLV-C) is the absolute instantaneous limit level.

Some toxicants will have a TLV-C defined, while others may have two or three categories.

BLVs are Biologic limit values defining amounts of substances to which worker may be exposed without hazard to health or well being.  Exposure might be determined by measurements on blood, urine, hair, nails or other body tissues or fluids.

IDLH is immediate danger to life or health, and may have conditions specifying exposure of 30 min or other such conditions.

Inhalation and skin absorption are the major routes to exposure.  Aromatic amines (anilines) and solvents such as CCl4 and benzene absorb via skin.

Cd accumulates in the body with a biologic half-life of 30 years.  >70% of Cd binds to RBCs but can accumulate in kidney and liver too (bound to metallothionein).

Cr toxicity is from hexavalent (Cr6+) absorption in lung and GI tract.  It causes dermatitis, ulcers on hands and arms, nasal septa perforation, larynx and liver inflammation and bronchitis.  Chromate can induce bronchogenic carcinoma (20 times greater lung cancer in chromate plant workers).  Trivalent Cr is poorly absorbed. Generally Cr is not accumulated and excreted in urine.

Pb is ubiquitous.  50% is absorbed in lungs, with 10% passing to circulation.  Organic lead has affinity for nervous tissue. 

Hg used in many systems.  It is used electrolytically in Cl2 and NaOH production.  Organic mercury is formed in shellfish and comes from contaminated fish.  Inorganic Hg usually inhaled, but metallic Hg absorbed in GI tract.  Hg salts will accumulate in brain and kidney.  Organic Hg absorbed by all routes

Benzene is ubiquitous as a solvent of many things. It appears to affect hematopoiesis and is an immunosuppressant.  It may cause leukemia.

Asbestos and its fibers are naturally occurring silicates.  Chrysotile is a form found commercially. and has many uses.  In respiratory system asbestosis shows as fibrosis, calcification, and lung cancer.

========
Classes of Toxicants: Use Classes

These toxicants apply to chemicals in current use, new chemicals developed for yuse, by-products in industrial processes, and chemicals involved in disposal too.

METALS

Metals are used everywhere, for making utensils and materials for machinery.  The metallic atom or ion has effects on biological tissues.  It may involve itself in enzyme inhibition or activation inappropriately (Pb displaces zinc in the delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratse enzyme, the first step in heme synthesis for hemoglobin and cytochromes).  It may associate with subcellular organelles or their membranes and disrupt function or structure.  They may induce carcinogenicity, perhaps by associating with DNA (As, Cr, and Ni are known carcinogens, and Be, Cd, cisplatin are suspected).  Cd and Hg are nephrotoxicants.  Organic metals (CH3Hg, organic Pb) can enter into nervous tissues, while inorganic Hg
might affect kidney.  The sex organs are under neuroendocrine and other hormonal control, so anything affecting those can affect endocrine and reproductive system.  Cd can cause testicular injury: degeneration, spermatogenesis inhibition, Leydig cell atrophy.  Acut metal dust exposure is a respiratory membrane irritant and chronic exposure can cause fibrosis and carcinogenesis.

The body has metal-binding protein in cytosol and extracellular space.  Cytosolic metal-binding proteins have many -SH groups and will sequester toxic metals to prevent interference with cytosolic processes.  Metallothionein is a 7 kDa protein regulating Cd, Cu, Hg, Ag, and Zn.  It is also secreted by hepatocytes and will sequester these toxic metals.

LEAD: ubiqutious, exposure in food, water, air; auto batteries, pipes, glazed ceramic food containers.  Pb salts absorbed in GI tract, respiratory system, and skin.  Hematopoietic and nervous tissues are targets.  In infants and you children with still developing neurological tissues, might lead to hyperactivity, poor mental develoepment.  Can damage arterioles and capillaries.

MERCURY:  occurs as elemental (HgO, Hg+, Hg2+) and organic (methyl and dimethyl mercury.  Hg0 absorbed as vapor but not by ingestion.  Organic mercury usually produced by sea animals and concentrated in fish.  Cultures with high dependency on seafood show organomercury poisoning.  Incident particularly in Japan where diet rich in seafood.  Organic forms can affect nervous system, while inorganic can cause nephrotoxication.

CADMIUM: found in Pb and Zn ore mining and smelters processing ores.  Industrial Cd used in paints, platics, batteries (nicad). Electroplating, and can be alloy.  Groundwater contamination usual route, but also in food crop fertilizers.  Can also enter humans through food chain (crops both grain and vegetable).  Acute exposure causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and inhalation causes edema and pneumonitis.  Slowly excreted with half-life of 30 years in body.  Accumulates mostly in kidney proximal tubules.  Often bound to metallothionein.

CHROMIUM:  typical in ores so obtained in mining, smelting, etc.  Used for stainless steel, other alloys, and pigments.  Very low levels in air, food, water.  Exposure usually occupational.  Trivalent Cr most common in nature, but hexavalent used in industry.  Cr(VI) not water soluble and absorbed more easily through cell membranes. Cr(VI) reduced to Cr(III) in boy and can complex with macromolecules;  the Cr(III) is believed to be more carcinogenic.

ARSENIC: levels usually low in air and water and major exposure due to food ingestion.  Present in high levels in water affecting Taiwn and South America and causes hyperkeratosis and hyperpigmentation.  Even higher levels cause blackfoot disease (gangrene in lower extremities).  80% of As compounds are pesticides, but also used in glassware, paints, pigments.  Arsine gas used in semiconductor industry.  As(V) used in organic and arsenate such as alkyl arsenate.  As(III) occurs as sodium arsenate and arsenic trioxide. AsH3 (arsine gas) is colorless and formed by acids on arsenic; it has TLV-TWA of 50 ppb (most toxic).  Soil bacteria can convert inorganic As to As(CH3)2, absorbed into shellfish and fish, then into human food chain. As(III) (arsenite) more lipid soluble;  binds to protein thiol groups.  Can accumulate in bones (phosphate replacement).  Acute exposure cases severe GI symptoms after 30 min to 2 h, with vomiting, watery and blood diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, burning esophageal pain.  Chronic exposure causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, hyperkeratosis and hyperpigmentation.

Treatments done with chelators and antagonists.  British antilewisite (BAL, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol) was used to combat arsenic-based chemical warfare.  Other chelators include DMPS, DMSA, EDTA, DTPA, DTC, and penicillamine.

Agriculture pesticides have wide use.  Arsenic was first used.  Pyrethrin in chrysanthemum was used. Roots of Derris plants produce a fish poison, rotenone also effective on insects.  Paris Green is a copper and arsenic salt mixture.

A.I. = active ingredient
REI = re-entry interval (for pesticide application sites)
PPE = personal protective equipment
Pesticide classification:
-- general: cause no unreasonable, adverse effects when used according to label and used by everyone
-- restricted: usable only by licensed individual
US EPA "category" uses:
-- Category I: highly hazardous, restricted use, with LD50 <= 1.0 mg/kg
-- Category II: moderately toxic with oral LD50 <= 500 mg/kg
-- Category III: nontoxic with oral LD50 <= 15 g/kg
US EPA also has carcinogenicity classifications

Organochlorine insecticides introduced in 1940s and 1950s and include DDT, methoxyclor, chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, toxaphene, mirex, and lindane.  They are neurotoxicants and disrput nerve impulses.  DDT was used to control typhus and malaria.  Rachel Carson wrote about Silent Spring in 1962 and its use eventually banned.

Organophosphorus insecticides are esters of phosphoric acid and thiophosphoric acid.  Typical are ethyl parathion [O,O-diethyl-O-(4-nitrophenyl)phosphorothioate].  Chlorpyrifos continues to be used as a termiticide. Parathion has a high mammalian toxcicity and led to development of malathion.  Action is to interfere with acetylcholinesterase.

Carbamate insecticides are esters of N-methyl and N,N-dimethyl carbamic acid (NH2-COOH).  Widely used is carbyryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate), used in agriculture and home gardening and applied as dust.  Aldicarb is an extremly toxic with oral and dermal entry routes.  Oral LD50 is 1 mg/kg (rat) and dermal LD50 20mg/kg (rabbit). Used on cotton, citrus, sweet potatoes.  Moves through soil profiles and contaminates groundwater.  Carbamates also target acetylcholinesterase although inhibition is reversible.

Botanical insecticides are plant extracts.  The alkaloid nicotine occurs in a number of plants and was first used in 1763.  It has oral and dermal absorption routes.  Oral LD50 of nicotine sulfate in rats is 83 mg/kg and dermal LD50 is 285 mg/kg. Acute poisoning can lead to death in a few minutes, resulting from respiratory failure (respiratory muscle paralysis). Pyrethrin and has six different esters and acids.  Toxicity is low and liver microsomal enzymes and esterases break it down.  Rat LD50 is 1500 mg/kg.  Pyrethroids are synthetic mimics that have longer half-lives and are more photostable.  Two classes of pyrethroids:  one depends on a cyclopropane ring and other is if ring is absent (e.g., fenvalerate).  They have low toxicity for mammals (30 grams per hectare).  Pyrethrins modify Na+ and K+ nerve channels, causing depolarizations.  Formulations include synergists such as piperonyl butoxide which inhibits cytochrome P450 that breaks down insecticide.

New pesticide classes that are not toxic to humans include the fiproles (fipronil), often applied to corn but is effective termiticide.  Chloronicotinoids are represented by imidacloprid applied to soil and controlling many insects including termites.

Herbicides
About 578 million pounds of plant pesticides were used in 1997, 47% of all pesticides used.  These are used at all stages: pre-planting, and both before and after crop emergence.  New families of agrochemicals include imidazolinones which target acetohydroxyacid synthase producing the branched chain amino acids, an enzyme only in plants.  Other chemicals are the chlorophenoxy compounds that make up the well known 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T which act on broad leaf plants.  Agent Orange is a mix of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and there is controversy of it having health effects.  While it was not those two compounds, it was a dioxin present in the manufacturing process, TCDD, very toxic to lab animals.  For male rats teh LD50 is 0.022 mg/kg and even lower for female guinea pigs. TCDD is a carcinogen in mice and rats, targeting liver.  It suppresses the immune system.

Triazines are also herbicides that can show up in surface and groundwater and eventually in drinking water.  Atrazine is used on corn and has a MCL of 3.0 ug/L, and shows up on waters from 1 to >130 ug/L.  Cyanizine and simazine have MCL of 4.0 ug/L.  Cyanazine use was stopped.  Concern with triazines is their carcinogenicity (US EPA Category C)

Bipyridylium family herbicides include paraquat, a water-soluble defoliant. Binds to soil particles and is inactivated.  Poisoning cases are often fatal though, due to accidental or deliberate digestion; toxicity related to lung injury.

Fungicides
Chlorothalonil (tetrachloroisophthalonitrile) is broad spectrum fungicide in urban environments. It is inexpensive and targets 140 species.  It is found in surface water and public drinking water.  Nontoxic formulations are available to general public.

Dithiocarbamates, which are sulfur derivatives of dithiocarbmamic acid and include metallic dimethyldithiocarbamates.  Mancozeb is a coordinate product of Zn and Mn ethylene bisdithiocarbamate.  Maneb is Mn ethylene bisdithiocarbamate.  These are crop fungicides for grapes, sugar beets, ornamental plants.  They will hydrolyze however to products such as ethylthiourea (ETU), a known carcinogen.

Rodenticides
Used to kill rodents that cause loss of grain and food in storage.  Poisons include warfarin (a coumarin) with LD50 3 mg/kg (rat); animals bleed to death in about a week.  Human warfarin poisoning is treated with Vit K.  Fluoroacetamide is a poisong with LD50 in rats of 15 mg/kg, acting rapidly and used in bait pellets and grains.  ANTU (alpha-naphthylthiourea), strychnine, and thallium salts are also used.  Most of these poisons are restricted use.

Fumigants
Extremely toxic gases used for stored products (esp. grains) and for killing soil nematodes.  All are restricted use.  Most effective is methyl bromide for sterilizing soil to kill insects, nematodes, and weed seed, and also used to fumigate warehouses.  Inhalation LC50 is 0.06 mg/L (15 min) in rat and 7900 ppm (1.5 h) human, causing respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, and central nervous system effects.  Since it depletes ozone, its used is phased out in 2005.  Chloropicrin (trichloronitromethane) is soil and space fumigant with LC50 of 150 ppm (15 min).

FOOD ADDITIVES & CONTAMINANTS
Some food additives have proved to be toxic when testing was more sophisticated.  Ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are antioxidants.

TOXINS
Note that a toxicant is any chemical of natural or synthetic origin capable of causing deleterious effect on living organism.  A toxin is a toxicant produced by a living organism with the same effect, a metabolic product that often used in defense.

Microbial toxins often have high molecular weight with antigenic properties.  Not all toxins are in this class and thus are called poisons.  Tetanus toxin, botulinus toxin, and diphtheria toxin are proteins or mucoproteins with enzymatic activity.  Some have beneficial purposes, e.g. Bacillus thuringiensis toxin targeting many crop insects.

Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites with important effects.  The Claviceps spp product ergot alkaloids, Aspergillus spp product aflatoxins, and fungi imperfecti (Fusarium) produce tricothecenes.  Ergot alkaloids are vasoconstrictors, and they can produce hallucinations (LSD).  Aspergillus affect grain (esp. maize) and peanuts, among other crops.  Turkey-X disease is manifestation of aflatoxin poisoning.  Aflatoxin B1 is a carcinogen that is activated by an enzyme.  Tricothecenes are sesquiterpinoid metabolites produced by Fusarium and Tricoderma.  They are very toxic for bacteria, fungi, and insects, and have potential in chemical warfare.

Algal toxins com from cyanobacter, dinoflagellates, and diatoms.  Shellfish and fish accumulate them, then poison humans and animals (can also cause fish kills).  The diatoms Pseudoanitzschia can produce donoic acid within mussels and then cause amnesic shellfish poisoining.  Alexandrium dinoflagellates produce saxitoxin which causes paralytic shellfish poisonining particular in west U.S.  Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning is a generally non-fatal sickness lasting several days and caused by a brevetoxin-producing Karenia brevis dinoflagellate. affecting shellfish in Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.  Diarrheic shellfish poisoning is also a nonfatal sickness caused by okadaic acid from the Dinophysis dinoflagellate (only two cases ever known in North America.  Ciguatera Fish poisoning affects 50,000 people in tropical/subtropical and related to consumption of reef fishes (grouper, snapper).  Cyanobacterial toxins rarely affect humans but kill livestock, other mammals, birds, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.  Biotoxins, cytotoxins, anatoxin, microcystin and nodularin are made by many blue greens such as Anabena, Aphanizomenon, Nodularia, Oscillatoria, and Microcystis.  Ambush predator toxins (Pfiesteria piscicida, and Toxic Pfiesteria Complex) were first found in 1991 in North Carolina and the toxins were not identified but are believed to be produced by dinoflagellates that cause fish kills and adverse human health effects.

Plant toxins (phytotoxins) are secondary plant products largely used as defenses against animals (insect, mammals).  This variety includes sulfur compounds, lipids, phenols, alkaloids, glycosides, and more.  These include cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, morphine, and cannabinoids.  Safrole is a component of black pepper and is carcinogenic.  Solanine and chaconine are cholinesterase inhibitors and possible teratogens and found in potatoes.  Quinines and phenols are abundant in all foods.

Animal toxins are abundant for many purposes.  These includes enzymes, neurotoxic and cardiotoxic peptides and proteins, biogenic amines, alkaloids, glycosides, terpenes, and more.  Bee sting venom has a biogenic amine (histamine), three peptides (apamine, melittin), and two enzymes (phospholipase A, hyalouronidase).  Formic acid, benzoquinone (and other quinines) and terpenes (citronellal) are irritants typically found too.
The Hymenoptera include ants, bees, wasps, and hornets and their bites and stings cause 5-60 fatal anaphylactic reactions each year in US.  Snake venoms have peptide toxins from 60-70 aa long which are both cardio- and neurotoxic with enzymes like phospholipases, peptidases, proteases, and other enzymes present.  Over 700 fish species worldwide are directly toxic or cause poisoning on ingestion.  The Sphaeroides puffer fish have tetrodotoxin (TTX) in the gonads, liver, intestine, and skin; death can occur in 5-30 min and fatality rate is 60% in which toxin is blocker of voltage-sensitive Na-channel.  TTX also found in some salamanders.

SOLVENTS

They have multiple effects on tissue and physiology, causing defatting or local irritation, or interfere with nervous system or hematopoiesis.  Solvents fall into different classes:

aliphatic hydrocarbons: hexane
halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons:  CH2CL2, CHCl3, CCl4, chlorinated ethylenes
aliphatic alcohols: methanol, ethanol
glycols, glycol ethers: ethylene & propylene glycols, methyl cellosolve (glycol ethers)
aromatic hydrocarbons:  benzene, toluene

THERAPEUTIC DRUGS

Cytotoxic agents include cancer treatment drugs.  Mephalen is a nitrogen mustard. Adriamycin is a antitumor antibiotic.  Methotrexate is an antimetabolite.  Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was a drug widely used but cause cervical and vaginal cancer in offspring of treated women.

DRUGS OF ABUSE

These include CNS depressants (ethanol, methaqualone [Quaalude], secobarbital.  CNS stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamine, caffeine, nicotine), opiates and opioids (heroin, mependine [demerol]), hallucinogens (lysergic acid diethylamide, phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol).

COSMETICS

Allergic reactions including contact dermatitis are the problems here.  Aromatic and azo amine dyes were highly toxic and irritant, as was the organometallics.  Bromates (cold wave neutralizers) can be toxic when ingested.  Ethanol is a solvent in hair dyes and perfumes.  Thioglycolates and thioglycerol are in cold wave lotions and depilatories.  Sodium hydroxide is a hair straightener.

===================

Absorption and Distribution of Toxicants

* Skin as barrier to most toxicants
* respiratory and GI tracts as routes of toxicant entry
* most rapid is lungs, least is skin
* factors in toxicant entry:  MW, pKa (ionization), octanol/water partition coefficient (log P)
* toxicant distribution factors: bulk flow transfer (bloodstream), diffusion
* disposition = term describing competition between distribution and elimination after absorption
* plasma protein transporters/binding: factors are plasma protein levels, competition with other binding substances, chemical nature of toxicant
* math models quantitate transport from one compartment to another
* pharmaco/toxicokinetics:  quantitation of time course of absorption, distribution, and elimination/clearance (by metabolism or excretion)
* two most important pharmacokinetic values are (1) volume of distribution and (2) systemic clearance
* pharmaco/toxicodynamics: study of biochemical and physiological effects of toxicants/drugs and determination of mechanism of action

Cell Membranes
Environment-[mucosa/skin]->interstitial fluid-[capillary membrane]->plasma
-[capillary membrane]->interstitial fluid-[target cell membrane]
->intracellular fluid-[subcellular/organelle membrane]->intraorganelle fluid
Membranes usually 75-angstrom thick.  Lipid-to-protein is 5:1 (myelin) whereas
mitochondrial membrane more proteinaceous (40% lipid).  For channel proteins pore diameters about 4 angstroms to allow small molecule movement across membrane.

Membrane transport mechanisms include:
1. passive diffusion -- across lipid membrane
2. filtration -- across aqueous pores
3. carrier-assisted transport
4. endocytosis - pinocytosis for liquids/phagocytosis for solids
Most drugs pass down a concentration gradient by passive/simple diffusion.  Solubility in lipid bilayer is essential.  pH differences across membrane are factors for ionized toxicants.  Substances with MW <= 200 will be affected by bulk diffusion of water (osmosis).  Inorganic ions are small by have large hydration spheres so must be actively transported.  Specific ions usually have specific channel proteins.

Passive diffusion described by Fick's law:  rate of diffusion = (D x Sa x Pc) / d * (Ch - Cl), where D is diffusion coefficient, Sa = surface area of membrane, Pc = partition coefficient of solute, d = membrane thickness, Ch and Cl are concentrations on both sides of membrane.  Diffusivity parameter itself is a function of toxicant solubility, MW, and conformation.  Partition coefficient is relative solubility in lipid versus water.

If toxicant transport is a first-order process, then dA/dt = kA.  If zero-order, then dA/dt = k (not dependent on concentration of A).  From Fick's law this is 

dA/dt = (D x Sa x Pc)(A1 - A2)/d

If A2 << A1, then dA/dt = C * A, where C = (D x Sa x Pc)/d.  What this equation shows is that Fick's law is really a 1st order description.  The rate constant can be computed in terms of half-life:  k = ln 2/t[1/2]

Volume of distribution = A (mass)/C(mass/volume)

Carrier-mediated transport can be passive or active (require energy/ATP).  This transport is a constant process, and not dependent on toxicant concentration, making it a zero-order process.  Note that when the toxicant is subsaturating, the process is initially 1st order, so this is described by a Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

Diffusion of toxicant is related to:
* molecular size/shape/weight
* solubility at absorption
* ionization degree:  function of Henderson-Hasselbach equation
* partition of ionized/unionized forms

Partition coefficients can be computed as follows:
P = Vw/Vo[(Cwo - Cw)/Cw]
where Vw,Vo are volume of aqueous and oil/organic phase, Cwo = concentration in aqueous phase BEFORE shaking, and Cw = concentration in aqueous phase AFTER shaking.  When P is lower, more soluble in water, and generally least permeable.  Log P = 1 considered skin penetrable.  A log P > 6 is a toxicant most likely to stay in membrane and not to cross.

Absorption & Routes
Extent of absorption is computed using concentration vs time plots and taking area under the curve (AUC) of thos plots.  AUC values can be computed for different routes: IV, oral, dermal.  Obviously intravenous is immediate and can be a reference.  Computer programs compute AUC by constructing trapezoids and computing area.  Absolute bioavailabilty (F) is computed as F = (AUC)route/(AUC)IV using same doses.  A correction is necessary if two different doses are used:  F = [(AUC)route * dose(i.v.)]/[(AUC)i.v. * dose(route)]

GI tract absorption is generally from intestine (pH 6.0) and stomach (pH 1-3).

Drugs/toxicants that are very lipid soluble are mixed as emulsions, and in the body mixed with bile acids (detergent-like molecules).  This creates micelles delivering substances to brush border of intestine.

Skin absorption has several possible pathways.  The intercellular pathway is one means in which toxicant moves through the spaces between cells of the skin although it is tortuous. Using Fick's law to account for skin thickness, diffusion is 10 times the measured thickness of the epidermis.  The transcellular pathway therefore is one traversing through cells and is not thought to be at all significant.  In the skin's pores such as the follicles, 
have a route, but that too is not appreciable.

Different parts of the anatomy have different penetrability:

scrotal > forehead > axilla >= scalp > back = abdomen > palm/plantar

The Respiratory System

Alveolar structure and composition is:
* type I pneumocytes, 40% of all cells but 90% of alveolar surface area
* type II pneumocytes, 60% of cells but 5% of surface area
* macrophages, 90% of all cells in the alveolar space
residual volume = amt of air remaining despite maximal expiratory force
Airborne toxicants will be either gases or aerosols.  The latter are basically particulates or larger particles in fumes.  Gas toxicants are mostly affected by their solubility in blood rather than ability to traverse absorptive membrane.

Blood proteins
* lipophilic toxicants will bind to alpha- and beta-lipoproteins
* metals may bind to globulins that bind iron (transferrin) or copper (ceruloplasmin)
* drugs that are acidic (negatively charged) will likely bind albumin
* drugs that are basic (positively charged) will bind alpha1-acid glycoprotein and beta-globulin
* 50% of total plasma protein is albumin

Much of drug binding is of the high affinity/low capacity kind, whereas toxicant is not very specific for high affinity binding

=========  

TOXICANT METABOLISM

Xenobiotic metabolism in humans involves liver enzymes

* cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases (CYP)
* flavin-containing mono-oxygenases (FMO)
* alcohol, aldehyde dehydrogenases
* amine oxidases
* cyclooxygenases

Most metabolism occurs in the liver.  Most xenobiotics are lipophilic.  Transformations take place in two phases usually:

Phase I:  polar reactive group is introduced into the molecule to enable it to become Phase II substrate.  Phase I enzymes are CYPs, FMOs, hydrolases.  These are mono-oxygenations forming reactive intermediates taht are potent electrophiles reacting with nucleophilic substituents.

Phase II: the substrate is conjugated with bulky substituents such as sugars, sulfates, amino acids to increase water solubility, targeting it for excretion.
Sometimes the reactive intermediates may be more toxic than the parent.

PHASE I REACTIONS

These are all oxidative generally:

* mono-oxygenations in microsomes
* oxidations in cytosol and mitochondria
* co-oxidations in prostaglandin synthetase reaction
* reductions
* hydrolysis
* epoxide hydration

CYP P450 mechanism:
1. Cyt-Fe3+ + R --> [Cyt-Fe3+=R]
2. NADPH ==NADPH-CytP450 reductase==> [e-] + Lipid ==> Lipid-OOH 
3. [e-] + [Cyt-Fe3+=R] --> [Cyt-Fe2+=R]
4. side reaction:  [Cyt-Fe2+=R] + CO --> [Cyt-Fe3+=R|=CO]
5. backside reaction:  [Cyt-Fe3+=R|=CO]  ==light==> [Cyt-Fe2+=R]  + CO
6. [Cyt-Fe2+=R] + O2 --> [Cyt-Fe2+=R|=O2]
7. [Cyt-Fe2+=R|=O2] <---> [Cyt-Fe3+=R|=O2(-)]   superoxide anion equilibrium with Fe
8. NADH + cyt b5(ox) ==NADH-cyt b5 reductase==> cyt b5(red)
9. repeat reaction (2)
10. [e-] from 8 or 9  + [Cyt-Fe3+=R|=O2(-)] --> [Cyt-Fe2+=R|=O2(-)]
11. [Cyt-Fe2+=R|=O2(-)]   <---> [Cyt-Fe1+=R|=O2]  iron | O2 molecule equilibrium
12. 2H+ + [Cyt-Fe2+=R|=O2(-)] --> H2O + [Cyt-Fe3+=R|=O]
13. [Cyt-Fe3+=R|=O] --->  ROH + Cyt-Fe3+    loopback to 1
7b. [Cyt-Fe3+=R|=O2(-)]  --> Cyt-Fe3+   + O2(-)
7c. [Cyt-Fe3+=R|=O2(-)]  --> Cyt-Fe3+   + H2O2

Mechanism shows that there are one electron movements from iron to oxygen atom to activate it.  At one point, protons react to take an O atom, leaving a reactive O atom behind, which then modifies the substrate R.


Numerous tissues contain Cyt P450 of various types, with liver containing the broadest for xenobiotics.  Cyt P450 enzymes also modify endogenous compounds.  Various types of CYP enzymes can be separated using chromatogroaphy, reaction with different antibodies, differences in substrate specificity.  To maintain activity during purification, glycerol, DTT, and low amount of deterget (Emulgen 911) are necessary.  Enzymes are generally cloned and expressed now to obtain large amounts of recombinants.  Test reconstitutions include (1) CYP pure (2) NADPH-CytP450 reductase (3) phosphatidylcholine (4) NADPH (5) O2  (6) substrate such as benzphetamine. Rates comparable to microsomes.  Addition of cyt b5 may be helpful too.  All CYPs are active on mulitiple substrates, but with different rates/specificity.  By 2002, 1925 genes were identified in CYP family.

Genotyping is "CYP" + Arabic numeral for family + letter for subfamily + Arabic numeral for isoform in subfamily.  Genes are italicized, whereas gene products (proteins) are not.  Isoforms in a family share usuall 40% aa identity.  Within subfamilies, sequence identity usually 55% with mammalian genes, 46% for nonmammalian. Genes in a subfamily lie on same chromosome and same gene cluster, and are non-segregating, indicating isoforms are from gene duplication.  Sequences with < 3% divergence are considered allelic variants

The evolutionary biology of CYP genes has been classed in great detail.  Some notes
CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 have differences and similarities.  CYP1A1 prefers neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) while the A2 isform prefer polyaromatic and heterocyclic amines and amides.  This CYP1 family prefer highly planar molecular structures and they activate procarcinogens and mutagens such as benzo[a]pyrene, aflatoxin B1, dimethylbenzanthracene, beta-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl, 2-acetylaminofluorene, benzidine.  Naphthalene could form an epoxide which is hydrolyzed for form naphthols and their diols.

Dealkylation reactions often occur with -OH introduced on aliphatic to create unstable methylol group, with the leaving of an aldehyde, which can be detected using the Nash reaction.
S-dealkylation may involve thioether formation (methylmercaptan, 6-methylthiopurine), but initial attack may be sulfoxidation created by FMO rather than CYP.

N-oxidation forms hydroxylamines (-NHR --> -N(OH)R), oximes (R=NH --> R=NOH), and N-oxides.  The latter often done with FMOs and not CYPs.

Oxidative deamination may involve oxidation of carbon attached to amine (N) group, producing carbinol amine, with the result of a carbonyl (keto, aldehydyl) product and ammonia.  This carbinol dehydrates to an imine C=NH which is oxidized to an oxime C=NOH and loses water to form the ketone.

=======================

Flavin Monooxygenases  (FMO)

Secondary and tertiary amines like N(CH3)3 and NH(CH3)2 are metabolized to N-oxides not by CYPs but FMOs.  FMOs use NADPH and O2 like CYPs.  Cloning & sequencing show six isoforms from FMO1 to FMO6, having 50-60% protein sequence identity across species.  Orthologue identity is >82%.  FMO1 is found in human embryos but not expressed after birth.  FMO2 is not functional in Caucausians and Asians because of stop codon; it is function in 1 in 4 blacks and maybe Hispances. FMO3 is predominant in adult humans, but not in neonates.  Polymorphic forms can create loss of function leading to a fish odor syndrome.  FMO4 transcrips found in several species but no protein ascribed to it.  FMO5 found in low expression in humans and may not participate in xenobiotic metabolism.  FMO6 is recently discovered so little info available.

Generally FMOs target soft nucleophiles in substates (N, S, P, Se atoms).  Some substrates are physiological/natural:  trimethylamine, cysteamine, methionine, cys-S-conjugates.  Most result in detoxications but bioactivation of toxics can occur.  FMO products go on to be CYP substrates quite often.  As both FMO and CYP are in microsomes and use same substrates, it is possible to distinguish CYP from FMO action by heating at 50° for 1 min since FMO more heat labile.  Alternatively the CYP inhibitor N-benzylimidazole can be added, or an inhibitory antibody to NADP cytochrome P450 reductase included.

Note that FMO can oxidize nicotine to nicotine-1'-N-oxide, while another route is CYP then aldehyde dehydrogenase to make cotinine.

=======================

Oxidations Outside the Microsome

Other enzymes in mitochondria and cytoplasm may metabolize xenobiotics

1. Alcohol dehydrogase (ADH).  Uses NAD+ to convert any alcohol to aldehdyes or ketone, and is a reversible enzyme.  It can utilized NADP+ but at slower rate.

2. Aldehyde dehydrogenase.  Also uses NAD+ to finish job of converting more poisonous aldehyde to carboxylic acid.

3. Amine oxidases.  Monoamine oxidases are mitochondrial flavoproteins found in liver, kidney, brain, intestine, and platelets.  Primary amines are oxidized utilizing O2 and H2O to produce an aldehyde from the primary amine, with ammonia, and H2O2.  Diamine oxidases work on molecules with TWO primary amines, such as cadaverine, but altering only ONE Of the amines.  The latter enzymes contain copper and are soluble pyridoxal-phosphate enzymes.

Cyclooxygenase Co-oxidation

Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturate fatty acid in which a hydroperoxy endoperoxide is formed called prostaglandin G2, which is metabolized to PG H2, all catalyzed by same enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX) [also called prostaglandin synthase].  It is a microsomal membrane enzyme found highly in lung tissues but also in kidney and seminal vesicle, a glycoprotein with subunit mass of 70 kDa and one heme persubunit.   The PG G2 --> PG H2 conversion involves a co-oxidation under the control of a peroxidase, and can utilize xenobiotics.

The COX protein has two isoforms:
* COX1 is found in nearly all tissues and constitutively expressed
* COX2 is inducible and involved in inflammatory response
Oftne tissues low in CYP are high in COX, and so COX may affect aromatic amind in these organis leading to carcinogenesis.
Co-peroxidation can activate some substrates, producing free radicals in the substrates.  In some cases peroxyl radicals are formed.


========================

Reductions

Nitro, diazo, carbonyl, disulfide sulfoxide, alkene, and pentavalent arsenic may be subject to reduction rather than oxidation.

Nitro groups are targeted by CYP using NADPH but this will be inhibited in oxygen presence.  Some believe a flavoportein reductase might be involved since high FAD or FMN catalyze the nonenzymatic reduction of nitro groups

Azo reduction occur also with CYP/NADPH in anaerobic environment (CO inhibition indicates CYP action).  Intestinal microflora may do the job since mammalian systems are poor.

Disulfide reduction is largely achieved using glutathione reductase with glutathione.  The GSSG product is recovered by NADPH reduction.

Carbonyl (ketone/aldehyde reductases) are NADPH-dependent cytosolic low MW proteins found in the organs (liver, brain, kidney, and other tissues).

Sulfoxides are reduced by soluble thioredoxin-dependent enzymes in liver usually

==================

Hydrolysis

Carboxylesterases and amidases are ubiquitous.  Many enzymes hydrolyze both esters and amides.
Esterases are divided into A-, B-, and C-types.  A-esterases target arylesters and particularly organophosphates.  B-esterases are largest and most important are inhibited by organophosphates irreversibly: they include carboxylesterases, amidases, cholinesterases, monoacylglycerollipases, arylamidases, targeting endogenous and xenobiotic substrates.

=============

Hydrration of Epoxides

Animal epoxide hydrolases form trans-diols, while bacterial hydrolases form cis-diols.
