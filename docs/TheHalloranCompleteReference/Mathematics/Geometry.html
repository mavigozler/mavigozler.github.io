Geometry

<div class="contentblock">
<h1>Transformations</h1>
<p>
If you are familiar with vector graphics software applications like Adobe
Photoshop, you can take geometric objects you have created on the canvas and
you move them, turn them, flip them, and re-size them.  These processes have 
special names: 
<ul>
<li><b>translation</b><br>
To move an object without changing the length of the lines or arcs that
compose the object, nor changing any angular relationships between the lines
or arcs.  If the object were something you could hold in your hand, it would be
like taking in your hand, and moving in any direction.  This is a change in
the <b>position</b> of the object.
<li><b>rotation</b><br>
This is effectively a translation but in a circular motion that changes the 
position of the object while not changing the length of line segments or arcs
or the angular relationships between them.  The rotation has a point on the 
coordinate system that is the point or axis of rotation.  This can be the origin
of the coordinate system, that is (0, 0), but it need not be.  The rotation can
be clockwise, with a value in degrees or radians that is greater than zero 
(&gt; 0&deg; or &gt; 0), or it can be counter-clockwise, with a value in degrees
or radians that is less than zero (&lt; 0&deg; or &lt; 0)
<li><b>reflection</b><br>
This is flipping of the object along a line that creates a mirror image, with
all coordinates forming the vertices of the object having the same distance from
the line as the coordinates forming the vertices of the mirror image.
<li><b>scaling</b><br>
This re-sizes the object in the form, with the result image either larger
(enlargement) or smaller (reduction).  Scaling in optics is basically a 
magnification of the object from a point called the <b>focus</b>.  Rays extend
from the focus to the vertices of the object.  An image can be created at any
point along the rays, but the vertices of the image must retain the same 
angular relationships.  In this way, the lengths of line segments or arcs
change by proportionally by the same <em>factor</em>.
</ul>
<p>
In discussing transformations of geometric figures, the term <b>object</b> is
used to refer to the original geometric figure.  In some geometry texts, the
term <b>preimage</b> is used;  understand that the word <b>object</b> will be
used instead because it is consistent with the terms used in optics, in which
objects and images are transformations created by optical lenses.

<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>
An object is described by the coordinates of its vertices, connected by line
segments and arcs.  In translation, all the vertices move up or down, left or
right simultaneously, or with the same magnitude.  This means that the length
of all lines and arcs that connect the vertices and form the figure are preserved,
along with their angular relationships.  The size of the object does not change,
nor is it spun in a circular motion about an axis.
<p>
The description of the translation operation is simply:
<p class="mathml-center">
`(x + Deltax, y + Deltay)`
<p>
where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) coordinates of the 
object (original figure) and &Delta;<i>x</i> and &Delta;<i>y</i> indicate the
movement or displacement of the translation.
<p>
&Delta;<i>x</i> indicates movement along the <i>x</i> axis, so it is left-right 
or horizontal movement. &Delta;<i>x</i> would be positive (&Delta;<i>x</i> &gt; 
0) if translation is to the right, and negative (&Delta;<i>x</i> &lt; 0) if 
translation to the left. If &Delta;<i>x</i> is zero (&Delta;<i>x</i> = 0), then 
the image will not be offset from the object to the left or right.
<p>
&Delta;<i>y</i> indicates movement along the <i>y</i> axis, so it is up-down 
or vertical movement. &Delta;<i>y</i> would be positive (&Delta;<i>y</i> &gt; 
0) if translation is upward, and negative (&Delta;<i>y</i> &lt; 0) if 
translation is downward. If &Delta;<i>y</i> is zero (&Delta;<i>y</i> = 0), then 
the image will not be offset from the object either upward or downward.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/translation.png" style="float:right;"
  alt="translation process shown for quadrilateral">
<table style="font-size:70%;margin-right:0.5em;margin-left:-2em;" class="td-center">
<tr><th>Object Vertex  <th>Object Coordinate  
  <th>Operation <br>`(x + Deltax, y + Deltay)`
  <th>Image Vertex  <th>Image Coordinate
<tr><td>A  <td>(&minus;1, 2) 
   <td rowspan="4">(<i>x</i> + 3, <i>y</i> + [&minus;1])

<tr><td>D  <td>(&minus;4, 2)     <td>D&prime; <td>(7, 1)
</table>
<p style="clear:right;">
In the example shown to the right of the table above, the object is the figure
colored blue, a quadrilateral with four vertices labeled <i>A</i> through <i>D</i>.
The image is the figure colored red with four vertices labeled 
<i>A&prime;</i> to <i>D&prime;</i>.  (In general, the object vertices will be
labeled with uppercase letters, while image vertices will have corresponding
uppercase letters with the prime character &prime;.)
<p>
The object was moved three units to the right, and one unit down to produce the
image.  In the table, the operation is notated simply as 
<span class="mathml-inline">`(x + 3, y &minus; 1)`</span>.  This description of
translation is shown as <b>coordinate notation</b>.
<p>
It is not at all necessary to visualize or see the image at all to get its 
coordinates.  The only thing necessary is to add 3 to all the <i>x</i> values of all
coordinates, then subtract 1 from all the <i>y</i> values of all coordinates.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/find-translation-rule.png" style="float:left;"
  alt="find the rule for translation process shown for triangle">
<p style="margin-left:1em;">
Now suppose you are shown the object (blue) and image (red) visually in the
figure at left.  You are told to find the rule for the translation process, 
expressed in coordinate notation.  The solution is to look at only one vertex,
say <i>B</i> in the object, and then its corresponding vertex <i>B&prime;</i> 
in the image.  B is (7, 1) and let's notate this as 
`(x_1, y_1)`, and 
B&prime; is (3, 2) and let's notate this as `(x_2, y_2)`.  The value of 
&Delta;<i>x</i> is going to be the difference between <i>x</i> value of the image 
coordinate from the <i>x</i> value of the object coordinate, or 
`Deltax = x_2 - x_1`.  In <i>B</i> to <i>B&prime;</i> coordinates, this is
`Deltax = 3 - 7 = -4`.  For &Delta;<i>y</i>, it is the difference between the
y values of the object and image coordinates: `Deltay = 2 - 1 = 1`.  The translation
rule is then written as:
<p class="mathml-center">
`(x, y) -> (x - 4, y + 1)`
<p>
<b>Isometry</b>.  Translation produces two figures, the object and the image,
which are <b>congruent</b>.  Congruent geometric figures have all lines and angles
exactly identical or equal.  The word <i>isometry</i> is Greek-derived and
has two parts: <i>iso-</i> meaning <q>equal</q> or <q>same,</q> and <i>metric</i>
meaning <q>measure.</q>  So translation is a process that is isometry.
<p>
<b>Vectors</b>.  A vector is a mathematical quantity (not merely a number) that
has two properties:
<ol>
<li><b>magnitude</b>: This is a number representing a length.  Note that it is
NOT a length between two definite coordinates, and that is because a vector is
translatable or movable.  That means that the coordinates are not themselves
properties of the length of the vector.  Coordinates are used to compute the
magnitude of the vector, but they are not properties or necessary to the vector
<li><b>direction</b>: Vectors have two ends and can be thought of as being 
arrows. The one end of a vector is the tail of the arrow and is called the 
<b>initial point</b>. The other end of a vector is the arrow head and is called 
the  <b>terminal point</b>. The direction of the vector is the angle of the 
terminal  point of a vector in relationship to a reference axis, 
which is the <i>x</i> axis.  The angle measure can be given in degrees or in
radians.   The angle measure is positive (greater than zero) when the vector
angle is taken as a counter-clockwise difference from the <i>x</i> axis, and
negative when taken as a clockwise difference.
</ol>
An important feature of vectors is that they have <em>two</em> components.
One is <b>horizontal</b>:  this component is itself really a vector too, and it points
either right if the vector points in any angle to the right, and it points to 
the left if any part of the vector points left.  The other is <b>vertical</b>: 
this is also a vector pointing upward or downward, depending on how the vector
points.  The component form of a vector is represented by left and right 
angle brackets, &#9001; and &#9002;, and they contain the length of the 
horizontal  and vertical components just like an <i>x,y</i> coordinate (but 
they are NOT coordinates!).  In the figure below, the component form of 
`vec(FG)` is `<<5, 3>>`.  Note also that a vector is notated symbolically with
an arrow over the character(s) representing the vector.  Typically a vector is
only labeled with one letter, either lowercase or uppercase.  But in the example,
it is labeled as the joining of two coordinates, <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>, from initial point 
to terminal point.  It is vital to remember thought that a vector does not
include specific coordinates among its properties
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/vectors.png"
 alt="the appearance of a vector and its components">
<p>
Look at the figure below.  To show the translation of the blue triangle, three
vectors all with the same magnitude and direction are positioned with initial
point on the vertices of the object.  The image is reconstructed by drawing 
line segments connecting all the terminal points of the vectors.  This shows
that vectors are not really described by the coordinates, since all three 
vectors differ in initial points and terminal points.
<p>

 alt="vectors used to cause the translation">
<h2>Matrices</h2>
<p>
A <b>matrix</b> (plural <b>matrices</b>) is an advanced understanding of 
mathematics that can be used to describe transformations (translations, rotation,
etc) of geometric objects.  Before showing how that's done, let's look at the
<i>terms</i> that are used to describe the <i>properties</i> or <i>structure</i> 
of a matrix.  A matrix is shown below.
<p class="mathml-center">
`|(a_11, a_12, a_13, a_14),(a_21, a_22, a_23, a_24),(a_31,a_32,a_33,a_34)|`
<p>
A matrix is composed of <b>elements</b> `a_(ij)` where <i>i</i> is the <b>row</b> 
of the element and <i>j</i> is the <b>column</b> of the element. The element 
itself can be a real number, say 3, but it need not be: it can be a variable 
such as <i>x</i>, or it can be an expression (one or more operations on real 
numbers or variables), such `7 / (z + 10)`. A matrix also is described by its 
dimensions; for a two-dimensional matrix, it is an <b><i>r</i> &times; <i>c</i>
</b> matrix, where <i> r</i> is the count of rows and <i>c</i> is the count of 
columns. The matrix above is a 3 &times; 4 matrix.
<h3>Matrix Used To Define Coordinates of Geometric Object Vertices</h3>
<p>
In geometry, matrices are used to define the coordinate values of the vertices
of an object.  In the figure below, in part labeled (b), the four coordinates
<i>A</i> through <i>D</i> of a quadrilateral are shown in a 2 &times; 4 matrix.
In fact, for any polygonal object, the matrix will be a 2 &times; <i>n</i> matrix
where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices.  The <i>x</i> values of the coordinates
for the vertices are in row 1 (top row), while the <i>y</i> values are in row 2
or bottom row.
<p>
A point can be defined by a matrix too, and it is a 2 &times; 1 matrix, with again
the x value at 
<h3>Operations: Adding and Subtracting</h3>
<p>
Operations on two matrices perform the operations on their corresponding
elements.   This requires that the two matrices have the same dimensions.
Let's look at addition:
<p class="mathml-center">
`|(a_11,a_12),(a_21,a_22)| + |(b_11,b_12),(b_21,b_22)| =
|(a_11+b_11,a_12+b_12),(a_21+b_21,a_22+b_22)|`
<p>
There are several things to see here. One is that matrices can form an equation. 
Recall that equations are special relationships composed of mathematical 
expressions. The sum of two matrices is shown as one expression. Another thing 
importantly seen here is that a result matrix shows the addition of elements 
that have the same row and column position. The result matrix element values are 
the sum of elements having the same row and column position.
<p>
The subtraction of two matrices should by now be very intuitive:
Let's look at addition:
<p class="mathml-center">
`|(a_11,a_12),(a_21,a_22)| - |(b_11,b_12),(b_21,b_22)| =
|(a_11-b_11,a_12-b_12),(a_21-b_21,a_22-b_22)|`
<p>
The figure below shows matrices with actual numbers being added and subtracted.
Note very well that the dimensions (<i>r</i> &times; <i>c</i>) are the same 
and it is required.  In the examples below, an intermediate matrix shows the
operations to make sure that the result matrix has the correct values (especially
on subtraction).  The intermediate matrix is a legitimate matrix since elements
can be mathematical expressions.  But the result matrix is the simplified
matrix.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/summing-subtracting-matrices.png"
 alt="matrix operations:  adding and subtracting two matrices">

<h3>Using a Matrix To Show Translation</h3>
<p>
You have learned two important things now:
<ol>
<li>the elements in a 2 &times; <i>n</i> matrix are used to 
define the coordinates of the vertices of a geometric object
<li>how to add matrices, and that the matrices must have the same dimensions
</ol>
You now combine these two concepts to do translation using matrices.
When you add the 2 &times; <i>n</i> <b>object matrix</b> to a 2 &times; <i>n</i> 
<b>translation matrix</b>, you get a 2 &times; <i>n</i> <b>image matrix</b>.
This is different from the coordinate notation 
`(x, y) -> (x + Deltax, y + Deltay)` that you learned above.  But the result is
the same, except we use this new tool of matrices to do it.
<p>
Look at the example below:
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/matrix-translation.png"
 alt="matrix operations:  using the translation matrix">
<p>
One thing is vital to the translation matrix:  its <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values in the 
elements must be identical, or else it is not a translation matrix, because
it does not follow the rules of translation, which requires that the image
be congruent (or an isometry) of the object (preimage).
<p>
If you were asked what the equivalent of the translation matrix is in coordinate
notation, then you would show:
<p class="mathml-center">
`|(-1,-1,-1),(3,3,3)|:\ \ \ \  (x,y) -> (x - 1, y + 3)`
<p>
Okay, given the coordinate notation for translation of 
`(x, y) -> (x + 5, y - 2)`, what is its translation matrix?

<p id="xlat-matrix" class="mathml-center no-display">
`|(5,5,5),(-2,-2,-2)|`
</div>
<h3>Multiplying Matrices</h3>
<p>
Multiplying matrices is different from adding and subtracting them.
<p>
<b>Counts of rows and columns in the two multiplied matrices and in the result 
matrix.</b> For one thing, the two multiplied matrices are <strong>not</strong> 
required to have the same dimensions, but the number of columns of the first 
matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix. That is, if you have 
a matrix <b>A</b> with <i> m</i> &times <i>n</i> dimensions (that is <i>m</i> 
rows and <i>n</i> columms), then matrix <b>B</b> must have <i>n</i> rows. Matrix 
<b>B</b> can have any number of columns. The result matrix, <b>AB</b>, have the 
count of rows of the first matrix <b>A</b> and the count of columns of matrix
<b>B</b>.  To summarize:
<p class="mathml-center">
`bbA\ (m xx n) * bbB\ (n xx p) = bb(AB)\ (m xx p)`
<p>
You will now learn why the columns of the first matrix must equal the rows
of the second matrix.  Here are two 2 &times; 2 matrices multiplied to each 
other to get the result matrix after the equal sign:
<p class="mathml-center">
`|(a_11,a_12),(a_21,a_22)||(b_11,b_12),(b_21,b_22)|=
|((a_11)(b_11)+(a_12)(b_21),(a_11)(b_12)+(a_12)(b_22)),((a_21)(b_11)+(a_22)(b_21),(a_11)(b_12)+(a_22)(b_22))|`
<p>
It is difficult to understand the pattern of multiplication from such a dry
presentation as above.  So look at the pattern of how the elements of the 
2 &times; 2 matrices are multiplied, and the results summed to get values.
Below, colored line segments connect the elements that are multiplied, and then
the two products are summed.  The position of the sum is located in the colored
box.  The colored arrows are suppose to show that the elements involved in 
multiplication that produce the result element intersect each other:
<b>the first matrix row elements are used to multiply the second matrix column 
elements, and the result goes where the intersection is</b>.

<p>
The multiplication of two 2 &times; 2 matrices is shown below:
<p class="mathml-center">
`|(2,0),(-1,3)||(1,2),(-1,-3)|=
|((2)(1)+(0)(-1),(2)(2)+(0)(-3)),((-1)(1)+(3)(-1),(-1)(2)+(3)(-3))| = 
|(2,4),(-4,-11)|`
<p>
There are four matrices shown above, with the two multiplied, then an 
intermediate that shows the operations done, and then the result or simplified
matrix.
<p>
In the figure below, two 5 &times; 5 matrices, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, are 
multiplied. To compute the row 2 column 2 element in matrix <b>C</b>, multiply 
the row 2 elements of first matrix (<b>A</b>) to the column 2 elements of second 
matrix (<b>B</b>). Take the leftmost element of matrix 1 and multiply it to 
topmost element of matrix 2. Now multiply the element to the right to the 
element that is next one down. Repeat this pattern to get five products, and now 
sum them up. The figure below is among the many ways that you can view matrix 
multiplication.

<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/more-matrix-multiplication.png"
 alt="matrix multiplication: showing now the first matrix row intersects the second matrix column">
<p>
Okay, test yourself now.  For each of the questions below, show the product
(or result) matrix for the multiplication.
<ol class="space-list">
<li>`|(1,-1),(2,0)||(2,1),(0,1),(-1,3)|`
<li>`|(1,-1),(2,0)||(2),(1)|`
<li>`|(1,0)||(2),(-1)|`
<li>`|(1,-1),(2,0)||(2,1,0),(1,-1,3)|`
<li>`|(-2,1),(3,-1)||(1,0),(0,1)|`
</ol>
<ol id="matrixmult-answers" class="no-display">
<li>multiplication is not possible!  Did you remember to do the test of dimensions?
The number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the 
second matrix.  There are two columns in the first matrix, so there must be
two rows in the second matrix, but there are three.
<li>The first matrix has two columns, and the second matrix must have two rows,
and it does. So the test is met. Let's do the multiplication: <br>
`|(1,-1),(2,0)||(2),(1)| = |((1)(2)+(-1)(1)),((2)(2)+(0)(1))| = |(1),(4)|`
<br>
And this is a good result:  A 2 &times; 2 multiplied to 2 &times; 1 must produce
a 2 &times; 1 matrix, and we see this.
<li>The first matrix has one row, so the second matrix must have one column,
and this is true so the operation is possible.<br>
`|(1,0)||(2),(-1)| = |(1)(2)+(0)(-1)| = |2|`<br>
This is the expected result:  a matrix with one row and one column.  It should be
clear that when the first and second matrix are interchanged, 
`|(2),(-1)||(1,0)|`, this violates the dimensionality rule and no multiplication
is possible.  The means that unlike the multiplication of two numbers, which
is commutative (that is, `a xx b = b xx a`), multiplication of matrices are
not commutative.
<li>The multiplication is allowed and it should result in a 2 &times; 3 matrix<br>

<p style="margin-top:0.5em">
`\ \ = |(1,2,-3),(4,2,0)|`
<li>A 2 &times; 2 multiplied to another will produce the same:<br>
`|(-2,1),(3,-1)||(1,0),(0,1)| = 
|((-2)(1)+(1)(0),(-2)(0)+(1)(1)),((3)(1)+(-1)(0),(3)(0)+(-1)(1))| = |(-2,1),(3,-1)|`
<br>Note that the result matrix is the same as the first matrix, and there is a 
reason why.  The second matrix has a diagonal of 1 values.  This is called 
the <b>identity matrix</b>.  It is the equivalent of multiplying a plain real
number by 1:  you get the number as the result.

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>
It's already been indicated that reflections are mirror images.  They can be
reflections of points, line segments, lines or polygonal objects.
<p>
The reflection is typically around or about a line.  The line of reflection
can be vertical or horizontal or actually at any line.  The line of reflection
can pass through a point, the line segment, the line or the polygon, or it
can be some distance from the object reflected.
<p>
When a line of reflection passes through a point, it produces the point itself
at the same position.  If the point is away from the line of reflection, draw
a line from the point to the line of reflection that is perpendicular.  The 
reflected point is on the perpendicular that is the same distance from the 
original point but on the opposite side of the reflection line.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/reflection-on-points.png"
 alt="reflection of points">
<p>
In the reflections of the polygons below, one passes through the polygon 
(the vertical one) while another passes through a vertex without passing 
through the polygon (the horizontal one).  The image overlaps in one case,

<h2>Rotations</h2>
<p>
Rotations of geometric objects (points, line segments, lines, polygons) 
are described by two properties
<ol>
<li>An <b>axis</b> or <b>center</b> of rotation occurs.  Everything spins on that axis.
<li>The <b>angle</b> of rotation:  this is value measured in degrees or radians
that specifies the quantity of the turn.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Manual Rotation</b>.  Drawing programs like Adobe Photoshop allow you to specify
an axis of rotation and the angle, so it is made easy.  But before computers,
it had to be done manually with a protractor.  The protractor is a semicircle
with angle marks, and a straight edge that has a ruler.  How does one manually 
rotate an object to produce its image?  In the figure below, the object shown
is rotated 120&deg; to produce an image (because 120&deg; &lt; 0, that means
a counterclockwise rotation).
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/manual-rotation.png"
 alt="manually rotating an object">
<ol>
<li>The axis or center of rotation is placed where desired.
<li>A ray is extended from the axis of rotation <i>P</i> to one vertex of the 
polygon <i>A</i>.
<li>Another ray is drawn at a 120&deg; angle counterclockwise from the `bar(PA)`
<li>The distance from point <i>P</i> to point <i>A</i> is measured using the 
protractor.
<li>Now measure the same distance from point <i>P</i> to a new point 
<i>A&prime;</i> along the ray that is 120&deg; from the `bar(PA)` ray.
<li>The process of making new rays for all vertices and their 120&deg; angle
rays is repeated, along with measuring distances from the axis of rotation.
</ol>
<h3>Rotations Around The Origin</h3>
<p>
The following rules are true for rotations of 90&deg; where the axis of 
rotation is (0, 0), the origin.

<h2>Compositions of Transformations</h2>

<h2>Symmetry: More on Reflection</h2>
<p>
Symmetry returns the discussion back to reflections.  Lines of symmetry 
are also lines of reflection, but they are special cases of lines of reflection.
A line of symmetry can pass through a polygon and the reflection on one side
must be the mirror image on the other.
<p>
The three hexagons below all have different counts of lines of symmetry.
Hexagon (a), with one pair of the sides longer than the other two pairs,
has only two lines of symmetry.  Hexagon (b) is a regular hexagon, with all 
sides equilateral and equiangular.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/hexagon-symmetry.png"
 alt="symmetry of three different hexagons">
 
<h3>Rotational Symmetry</h3>
<p>
Here's how to find rotational symmetry:
<ol>
<li>Look at the figure or polygon to be rotated (turned).
<li>Now rotate the figure or polygon counterclockwise.  There one of two
points where you will stop rotating when:
 <ol>
 <li>the figure or polygon looks identical to the figure or polygon before
rotation started
 <li>the rotation has reached 180&deg;
 </ol>
<li>Note the angle of rotation when you stopped
<li>Stop rotating completely when you have reached 180&deg;
</ol>
In general, the angles of symmetry will be 180&deg; &divide; <i>n</i>, where
<i>n</i> is the number of times you stopped.  If you stopped twice, it will be
90&deg; and 180&deg;.  If you stopped <i>n</i> = 3 times, it will probably be
60&deg;, 120&deg;, and 180&eg;.  If you stopped not at all before reaching 180&deg;,
the polygon has no rotational symmetry.
<p>The figure below has two angles of rotational symmetry at 90&deg; and 180&deg;,
but not at 45&deg;.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/symmetry-rotational.png"
 alt="rotational symmetry demonstration">
<p>
What is the rotational symmetry of a parallelogram?  A regular octagon?
A trapezoid?
<p>
A parallelogram will rotate 180&deg; before it looks like itself.  A regular
octagon will stop four times, including at 180&deg;:  so the rotational
symmetry is 45&deg;, 90&deg;, 135&deg;, and 180&deg;.  A trapezoid will turn 
the 180&deg; and never look like itself, and has no rotational symmetry.


<h2>Dilations: Understanding Scaling</h2>
<p>
Scaling a polygon involves first placing a point out of the plane of the polygon.
This point can be called the <b>focus</b>.  While the position of the focus 
might be anywhere, for simplicity, a line extending from the focus to the
perpendicular of the plane should pass through the area of the polygon, best
within the geometric center of the polygon (this can often be found by 
creating all lines of symmetry and finding where they intersect at a common point.
<p>
Now extend rays (or vectors) from the focus through the vertices of the 
polygons.  Construct a polygon image which will be similar to the object polygon,
with the vertices of the polygon image on the rays extending from the focus, and 
the plane of the image polygon parallel to the object polygon.  This is shown
in the figure below.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/dilations.png"
 alt="rotational symmetry demonstration">
<p>
A value that is a scaling factor <i>k</i> is defined.  If <i>k</i> = 1 then it
is the position of the object polygon itself on the rays from the focus.
If <i>k</i> &lt; 1, then it is an image polygon between the focus and the object polygon,
and it represents a <b>reduction</b>  of the object  as a similar polygon.
If <i>k</i> &gt; 1, then it is an image polygon where the object polygon is between the
image polygon and the focus.  This represents an <b>enlargement</b>.
<p>
A scaling (dilation) can occur with the image polygon encased by or encasing the
object polygon.  In the figure below, an object with interior angles preserved 
is created by doubling the lengths of the sides.  In this case, it is obvious
that <i>k</i> = 2, since an enlargement occurred, and the doubling of the lengths of
the sides doubled the object size.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/dilations.png"
 alt="rotational symmetry demonstration">
<p>
Now consider an object now shown visually but defined by a 2 &times; <i>n</i> 
matrix.  Its lengths are increased by a scale factor of 4.  The following
operation is defined:
<p class="mathml-center">
`k|(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4),(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)| = |(kx_1,kx_2,kx_3,kx_4),(kx_1,kx_2,kx_3,kx_4)|`
<p>
The example below shows this operation:
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/scalar-matrix-multiply.png"
 alt="multiplying a matrix by a scalar">
<p>
Note that the value of <i>k</i> is not within a matrix.  It is a scalar, and
not a matrix.  If it were a matrix, then it would violate the dimensionality
requirement for matrices being multiplied, and would not be allowed.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/scalar-matrix-multiply.png"
 alt="multiplying a matrix by a scalar">
In the example below, a reduction occurs, and it moves toward the origin of
the coordinate system.  What would cause the reduction to occur in a way that
does not move towards the origin?
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/dilation-scalar-matrix-example.png"
 alt="multiplying a matrix by a scalar for reduction">
<p>
In the image below, a two-step transformation occurs.  The labeling of the 
triangle suggests that a translation occurs first:  5 to the right, then 1 up.
Coordinate notation is `(x, y)->(x + 5, y + 1)`.
<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/scalar-composition.png"
 alt="a translation then an enlargements"> 
<p>
The matrix expression is better, since it also defines the coordinates:
<p class="mathml-center">
`|(5,5,5),(1,1,1)| + |(-4,-2,-2),(1,2,1)| = |(1,3,3),(2,3,2)|`
<p>
This operation thus yields a triangle with coordinates (1,2),(3,3),(3,2).
<p>
Determine the coordinates of the dilation (scaling) of the following polygons:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>`A(-1,1),B(2,1),C(1,2); k = 3`
<li>`A(-4,4),B(-4,8),C(0,4); k = 1/4`
</ol>
<p>
The best way to calculate the values quickly is first to convert all the 
coordinates to a 2 &times; <i>n</i> matrix.  Then do a matrix multiplication
using the scale factor (as a scalar).  Then convert the resulting matrix back
to the 

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>`A(-1,1),B(2,1),C(1,2) ->` show in matrix form `-> |(-1,2,1),(1,1,2)|`<br>
 multiply by the scale factor:<br>
   `3|(-1,2,1),(1,1,2)| = |((-1)(3),(2)(3),(1)(3)),((1)(3),(1)(3),(2)(3))| = |(-3,6,3),(3,3,6)|`<br>
 and now show in coordinate form for easy plotting:<br>
 `A'(-3,3),B'(6,3),C'(3,6)`
<p>The object and its image are plotted below. You can see how the scaling done

<p>
<b>Proof</b>.  In the figure on the right, there are three squares
(<i>UVTQ</i>, <i>RNSV</i>, and <i>MNPQ</i>) and two rectangles
(<i>MRVU</i> and <i>VSPT</i>).  We already know from postulates above that
the area of a square is the square of the length of its side.  The figure
shows the following:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>Area <i>UVTQ</i> = <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>
<li>Area <i>RNSV</i> = <i>h</i><sup>2</sup>
<li>Area <i>MNPQ</i> = (<i>b</i> + <i>h</i>)<sup>2</sup>
<li>Area <i>MRVU</i> = Area <i>VSPT</i>
</ol>
<p>
From this, we see that area <i>MNPQ</i> is the sum of these areas:  
area <i>RNSV</i> + area <i>UVTQ</i> + 2 &times; area <i>MRVU</i>.
This says area `(b + h)^2 = b^2 + h^2 + 2 xx R` where R is the area of
polygon <i>MRVU</i>, a rectangle.  Let's solve for <i>R</i>:
<p class="mathml-center">
`(b + h)^2 = b^2 + h^2 + 2 xx R` <br>
`b^2 + 2bh + h^2 = b^2 + h^2 + 2 xx R`
<p>
Subtract `b^2` and `h^2` from both sides, and divide by 2 on both sides:
<p class="mathml-center">
`R = bh`
<p>
This says the area of MRVU is `bh`, which is what was to be proved.

<b>Proof</b>.  The parallelogram <i>PQRS</i> can have its height drawn from

parallelogram, whose area has already been shown to the product of the base and
the height.  Since it took two triangles to create the area of the parallelogram,

a triangle must be half the area of its parallelogram.

<b>Proof</b>. In the figure at left, trapezoid <i>PQRS</i> has been divided to 
contain two triangles, red-colored <i>PQR</i> and blue-colored <i>PRS</i>. The 
area of triangles have already been shown to be `1/2bh` where `b` is the base 
and `h` is the height. It is clear that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of 
the area of the two triangles. Triangle <i>PQR</i> has an area of `1/2b_2h` and 
the area of triangle <i>PRS</i> is `1/2b_1h`. (Recall that if the line segment 
`bar(PQ)` is extended so that it forms a perpendicular from point <i>R</i>, this 
segment can be seen as a height of the triangle from the vertex (<i>R</i>) 
opposite the base (segment `bar(PQ)`).  Therefore:

`text(trapezoid )PQRS text( area) = 1/2b_1h + 1/2b_2h = 1/2h(b_1 + b_2)`

<p>
<img src="imagesGeometryHTML/kite-area-proof.png"
   style="float:left;margin-right:1em;"
  alt="kite area proof"> 
<b>Proof</b>.  The figure at left shows a kite-type polygon <i>PQRS</i>, and it is
clear that the kite is two congruent triangles, the red-colored <i>PQR</i> triangle
and the blue-colored <i>PRS</i> triangle.  The two triangles have a common base
`bar(PR)` whose length is `d_2`.  The height of triangle PQR is &frac12; the
length of `d_1`, and this is true for triangle <i>PRS</i> too.  So applying the
triangle area theorems:
<p class="mathml-center">
`text(area of )PRS = 1/2(1/2d_1)d_2 = 1/4d_1d_2`
<br>
`text(area of )PQR = 1/2(1/2d_1)d_2 = 1/4d_1d_2`
<p>
Since the area of PQRS is the sum of the two areas:
<p class="mathml-center">
`text(area of )PQRS = text(area of )PQR + text(area of )PRS = 1/4d_1d_2 + 1/4d_1d_2 = 1/2d_1d_2`
<p>
The rhombus is a special case of a kite in which the diagonals bisect each
other at their midpoint.  So the proof of an area of a rhombus is just a special
case of a kite being the area of two isosceles triangles instead of two 
scalene triangles.

  alt="proof of ratio or area to length"> 
<b>Proof</b>.  Consider two <i>similar</i> rectangles at right, one with short
side (height) of length 10 meters and the other with its short side having length
4 meters.  We can suppose the long side of the 10-meter short-side rectangle
is <i>x</i>.  Because they are similar, the long side of the 4-meter short-side
rectangle must be 4/10<i>x</i>.  Since the area of a rectangle is the product
of its long side and its short side, then:
<p class="mathml-center">
`text(area of 10 m rectangle) = 10x` <br>
`text(area of 4 m rectangle) = 4(4/(10)x) = 16/10x = 1.6x`
<p>
The ratio of the sides of the bigger-to-smaller `= 10/4`.  The ratio of the areas
is `(10x)/(1.6x) = 10/1.6 = 100/16`.
<p>
We can see that the relationship of the ratio of the length of sides when squared
is equal to the ratio of the areas of the polygons:
<p class="mathml-center">
`10/4 -> (10/4)^2 = 100/16`
<p>
And so the theorem is proved.

<h2>Areas of Regular Polygons</h2>
<p>

<p>
A regular polygon is one constructed such that all its sides have equal lengths.
The diagram shows a regular polygon inscribed within a circle.  The center
of the polygon is the center of the circle, and the radius of the polygon is
the radius of the polygon is the radius of the circle.
<p>
The distance from the center to any side of the polygon is called the <b>apothem</b>
of the polygon, and is the height to the base of an isosceles triangle in which
two radii are the legs.
<p>
The central angle of the polygon is formed by two radii drawn to consecutive
vertices of the polygon.  This angle can be found by divding 360&deg; by the 
number of the sides.

<b>Theorem</b>.  The area of a regular <i>n</i>-gon with side length <i>s</i>
is half the product of the apothem <i>a</i> and the perimeter <i>P</i>,
so `A = (aP)/2`, or `A = 1/2a * ns`
<p>
<b>Proof of the Area of a Circle</b>.  A regular polygon has <i>n</i> sides of equal
length <i>s</i> with height of the apothem <i>a</i>.  But suppose n increases to the thousands
and millions, and even to infinity.  The apothem <i>a</i> becomes the radius of the 
circle, and side <i>s</i> goes down towards zero length.  We know that 
circumference of a circle is 2&pi;r.  We also know that the length of a side of
a polygon with <i>n</i> = &infin; sides has <i>s</i> = 2&pi;r/n, meaning <i>ns</i> = circumference
of circle.  The area then becomes `A = 1/2a * ns = 1/2(r)(2pir) = pir^2` given
what happens as `n -> oo` and <i>a</i> becoming <i>r</i> and <i>ns</i> 
becoming the circumference.  And so the area of a circle is proved as the area
of infinitely smaller triangles approximating its area.


<h2>Use Geometric Probability</h2>
<p>
The <b>probability</b> of an event occurring can be described with words, but
in mathematics, it is described with values.  These values range from 0 to 1.
If something has a probability <i>P</i> = 1, then the event is <i>certain</i> to
occur.  If something has a probability <i>P</i> = 0, then it is <i>impossible</i>
for it to occur.  If something is as equally likely to occur or not occur, the
<i>P</i> = 0.5.
<p>
A <b>geometric probability</b> is a ratio that involves geometric area such as 
length or area.

If `bar(AB)` is a segment that contains segment `bar(CD)`, and point <i>K</i>
is chosen at random on `bar(AB)`, the probability of point K being on 
`bar(CD)` is the ratio of length of `bar(CD)` to length of `bar(AB)`.

If <i>J</i> is a region containing region <i>M</i>, and a point <i>K</i> is 
chosen at random within region <i>J</i>, the probability of it being in region 
<i>M</i> is the ratio of the area of <i>M</i> to the area of <i>J</i>.
