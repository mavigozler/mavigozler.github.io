<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
An <b>antigen</b> is a substance that stimulates antibody formation and has the
ability to bind to an antibody. A <b>hapten</b> is a generally low MW
nonantigenic substance that when combined with another particle, the combination
can be immunogenic and elicit antibodies.
<p>
An <b>antibody</b> is a glycoprotein called an immunoglobulin produced by
B lymphocytes in response to an antigen.  The stimulation may be monoclonal
or polyclonal. Monoclonal antibodies are derived
from a single B-cell clone and are produced as a single class of immunoglobulin with
specificity unique to the antigenic stimulus. Polyclonal antibodies are mixture
of monoclonal antibodies, but all antibodies react with the antigen, perhaps
multiple antibodies.  Antibodies produced in response to antigens from another
species are called <b>heteroantibodies</b> or <b>xenoantibodies</b>.
<b>Alloantibodies</b> are formed in response to antigens from individuals
of the same species.  <b>Autoantibodies</b> are produced by the body's immune system
against <q>self</q> antigens.  Antibodies facilitate phagocytosis and microbial
killing, and by neutralizing toxic substances. They also combine with antigens
on cell surfaces, which results in either intravascular or extravascular
destruction of the target cells.
<p>
An <b>epitope</b> is the part of an antigen that reacts specifically with an
antibody or T-cell receptor. <b>Agglutination</b> is the clumping of
particulate antigens by antibodies specific for the antigens. <b>Affinity</b>
is the tendency that an epitope has for combining with the antigen-binding site
on an antibody molecule. <b>Avidity</b> is the strength of the bond between the
antigen and the antibody. <b>Sensitivity</b> is the smallest amount of antigen
or antibody that can be detected. <b>Specificity</b> is the ability of an
antibody to bind to an antigen with complementary determinants and not to an
antigen with dissimilar determinants.

</table>
<p>
Igs are glycoprotein substances secreted by antigen-stimulated B cells.
All Ig structures have two heavy chains and two
light chains joined by varying numbers of disulfide bonds. <i>Heavy chains</i>
determine <b>isotype</b> or <b>class</b>. The 5 Ig classes are
IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM . Each Ig molecule has either
two &&kappa;; or two &lambda; light chains.
<p>
<b>IgA</b> exists as monomer in serum and as a dimer in body secretions. It is
predominant Ig in tears, saliva, sweat, breast milk, and respiratory tract,
genital, and intestinal secretions. IgA bind Ags to inhibit binding to mucous
membranes. Confers immunity from mother to infant through breast milk. Normal
serum IgA 77 to 400 mg/dL.
<p>
<b>IgD</b> is a monomer with unknown function. Serum IgD normals 3-5 mg/dL.
<p>
<b>IgE</b> is monomer, its F<sub>c</sub> binds to receptors on mast cells and
basophils. It is elevated in parasitic infections and in Type I allergic
reactions. Normal serum IgE is 17-450 mg/dL.
<p>
<b>IgG</b> is predominant Ig in adult. 4 subclasses IgG1 through IgG4. Binds
complement, has roles in opsonization and antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC), neutralizes toxins. Crosses the placental barrier
Precipitates and agglutinates in vitro. Normal serum values 591-1,965 mg/dL.
<p>
<b>IgM</b> is largest of Igs as a pentamer.  Binds complement, neutralizes
toxins, agglutinates antigens in vitro. The 1st Ig produced in antigne response.
Normal serum values are 50 to 311 mg/dL.

<p>
<b>Complement</b> is  group of proteins produced by mononuclear
phagocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and some endothelial cells.
Precursors are numbered 1 to 9, and subcomponents given letters a to e when
produced in cleavage.  Function is tod disrupt microbial cell walls,
mediate inflammation, regulate phagocytic activity and the metabolism of immune
complexes.
<p>
Activated by two pathways.
<ol>
<li><b>Classic pathway</b> requires IgG or IgM for activation:  see table and
figure for steps
<li><b>Alternate pathway</b> is instead triggered by polysaccharides and
lipopolysaccharides on the surfaces of certain target cells (rather than Abs)
On some microorganism there are mannose-containing glycoproteins which
interact with the mannan-binding lectin (MBL), which then binds to a
MBL-associated serine protease (MASP), and this complex activates C2, C3,
and C4, very similar to classical pathway.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Anaphylotoxins</b> are the small fragments (C3a, C4a, C5a), which attract
and activate different types of leukocytes. They increase vascular permeability,
cause contraction of smooth muscle, induce histamine release from basophils
and mast cells, and release chemotactic factors at infection sites. C5a is the
most potent, followed by C3a and C4a.

structure linked by the J chain at the Fc fragment. The sIgA molecule has a
dimeric structure, plus joining (J) chain, plus secretory component. Shown is
the dominant IgA<sub>2</sub> subclass.
</div>
<p>
<b>Membrane attack complex.</b>  Both pathways converge at activation of
C5, with C5 to C9 being the common pathway, forming the membrane attack complex.
The C567 complex acts on C8 and C9.  C8 and C9 insert into the cell membrane
to open a hole and induce cell lysis.

<h2>CELLS AND TISSUES OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>
Certain surface antigens on cells of immune system have been identified as
<b>clusters of differentiation (CD)</b>.
<p>
In the fetus, cells from the presumptive bone marrow migrate to the thymus
to become T lymphocytes.  They function in cell-mediated immune response.
Subpopulations of T cells are identified by CD markers:
<ul>
<li>T helper cells (T<sub>h</sub>) are CD4<sup>+</sup> and produce IL-2, IL-3,
GM-CSF, and IFN-&gamma;.  They activate B cells and stimulate other T cell
subpopulations.
<li>T suppressor cells (T<sub>s</sub>) are CD8<sup>+</sup> and produce factors
inhibiting other T cells.
<li>Most cytotoxic T cells (T<sub>c</sub>) are CD8<sup>+</sup> also and
secrete lymphotoxins and release perforins, targeted to cells observed as foreign.
<li>Delayed-type hypersensitivity T cells (T<sub>DTH</sub>) are CD4<sup>+</sup>.
 They secrete <b>macrophage chemotaxin</b> and <b>macrophage migration
inhibition factor</b> (MIF).
</ul>

</table>
<p>
Interaction with a specific antigen by a T lymphocyte receptor stimulates a
blastic transformation into a large lymphocyte.  This divides into small
and medium lymphocyte populations.  Note that these T lymphocytes also
proliferate with other mitogens:  concanvalin A (ConA), phytohemagglutin A (PHA),
pokeweed mitogen (PWM)
<p>
<b>B lymphocytes</b>.  Mature B lymphocytes secrete Ig. Cells develop in
bursa-derived bone marrow and localize to secondary lymphoid (nodes and spleen).
Several stages of maturation of B cells.  The stem cells of B and T lymphocytes
possess TdT enzyme.  The MHC proteins are effectively products of the immune
response (Ir) genes.  Pre-B cell activity includes the Ig gene rearrangments
and H chain expression.  Before the B cells mature, light genes are then
rearranged.  The light and heavy chains combine to form an IgM molecule that
attaches to the surface membrane (sIgM).  B cells can be activated by a set
of mitogens:
<ul>
<li>Lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria
<li>Protein A from <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>
<li>PHA
<li>PWM
<li>Phorbol myristate
<li>Anti-IgM antibody
</ul>

<p>
Lymphocytes which are neither T or B type are usually killer cells (K), natural
killer cells (NK), and lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). It is not known
whether they are distinct cell types or one type with multiple functions. K
cells express Ig receptors and lyse target cells by ADCC. NK cells have the
natural ability to kill tumor cells. LAK cells use IL-2 to help lyse tumor
cells.
<p>
Phagocytes play a major role in the immune system. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes
(PMNs) include eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils. Eosinophil granules
contain antimicrobial agents. Basophil granules contain histamine and heparin,
which play a role in anaphylactic reactions. In neutrophils are two types of
granules, primary and secondary. Primary granules contain myeloperoxidase (MPO)
and lysozyme. Secondary granules also contain lysozyme. Neutrophils respond to
chemotaxins produced at sites of inflammation. These chemotaxins include
complement C5a component, bacteria formylpeptides, and arachidonic acidm
etabolites from damaged cell membranes. Ingestion of microbes and particles by
phagocytes is promoted if they are coated with Ig molecules or C3b
(opsonization).
<p>
<b>Monocytes and macrophages</b>. Circulating monocytes respond to chemotaxins,
leave the circulation, enter the tissues, transform to macrophages. Macrophages
essential to antigen processing and presentation. Macrophage surface receptors
include complement C3b-binding integrin Mac 1-CR3, Ig-binding F<sub>c</sub>
receptors, and C3b and C4b binding CR1, and the class II MHC receptors.
Macrophages also secrete numerous cytokines: IL-1 (T cell activator), IL-6 (B
cell activator), TNF-&alpha; with antitumor and antibacterial cell action and
autocrine for stimulation of IL-1 and IFN gene expression. The <b>endothelial
leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM-1)</b> is also involved in diapedesis
(migration of cells into tissues from the circulation). Other cells involved in
antigen presentation include dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and B
lymphocytes.
<p>
Lymphoid tissues are found throughout the entire body: spleen. thymus, thoracic
duct, lymph nodes, bone marrow, Peyer's patches, tonsils, and appendix. The
highest concentration of T cells is found in the thymus. The highest
concentration of B cells is found in the bone marrow.

<h2>IMMUNITY</h2>
<p>
May be natural or acquired. <b>Natural immunity</b> is present at birth, and
protect against and aids in recovery from disease. It is also involved in
rejection of transplanted tissues/organs. It is also involved in a inflammatory
response that includes a cellular response involving phagocytic cells. In the
acute phase of inflammation, proteins in plasma are involved in healing:
C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, and fibrinogen.  <b>Acquired or specific
immunity</b> is a response by the presence of a foreign antigen to develops
into production of antibodies, and with memory cells.  This immunity might be
passive (resulting from transplacental transfer or injection of antibody) or
by immunization or exposure to disease.  This immunity is cell-mediated and
humoral.

<h2>IMMUNE RESPONSE (IR)</h2>
<p>
Immune response is cell-mediated and humoral, although one may be stronger than
the other.  <b>Humoral immunity</b> involves Ig production by B lymphocytes.
Since complement is activated by Ig molecules, it may be considered part of
humoral immunity.
<p>
Three phases in humoral response:
<ol>
<li><b>Antigen elimination</b> by phagocytosis, in which most is processed in
minutes but complete removal might be months or years.
<li>The <b>primary response</b> is a period of 5-15 days required to enable the
production of antibody to meaningful levels in the serum. Antibody titer
increases, plateuas, then falls. IgM is the first Ig to form.
<li>The <b>secondary response</b> is when a second or any subsequent exposure
which then involves a massive and rapid (2-4 d) response producing IgG. The
titer is higher and retained for much longer.
</ol>
<p>
The cell-mediated response is perhaps more important in viral and fungal
infections and in infections caused by acid-fast bacilli (mycobacterum) This
response involves macrophages, T<sub>c</sub>, and NK cells. Antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) involves cytotoxic cells with F<sub>c</sub>
receptors (esp. NK cells) releasing chemicals that lyse IgG-coated cells. <b>
Cytokines</b> are protein messengers, many of which play role in CMI.
Lymphokines include IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, GM-CSF, &beta;-cell growth factor 2
(BCGF-2), macrophage activating factor (MAF), MIF, IFN-&gamma;. Monokines
produced by monocytes include IL-1 and TNF-&alpha;.

<h2>MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX</h2>
<p>
MHC is involved in transplantation rejection.  Moreover antigen-specific T cells
require a portion of antigen bound to MHC gene products.
<p>
MHC found on human chromosome 6.  MHC has role in intercellular recognition
and discrimination of self/nonself, is required in humoral and cell-mediate
immune responses.  The MHC set of genes determine repertoire of Ags that the
T<sub>H</sub> and T<sub>C</sub> can respond to, so it determines disease
susceptiability and autoimmunity.
<ul>
<li><b>Class I MHC</b> are glycoproteins found on most nucleated cells. Class I molecules
present antigenic peptides to T<sub>C</sub> lymphocytes.
<li><b>Class II MHC</b> are glycoproteins found on antigen presenting cells (APC).
<li><b>Class III MHC</b> consists of secreted proteins with immune function.
</ul>
<p>
MHC alleles are inherited as two sets, one set (<b>haplotype</b>) from each
parent. Each haplotype contains the three classes. Class I and II each have a
set of gene loci: three Class-I (B, C and A) and three Class II (DP, DQ and DR)
loci. Thus an individial can inherit six Class I specificities. Similarly, the
individual will also inherit DP and DQ genes and express both parental antigens.

</table>
<p>
Class I MHC are expressed in virtually all cells of the body.  Platelets
express Class I HLA-A and HLA-B antigens.  Each Class I MHC is specific for
antigens between 8-10 aa long.  All proteins of a cell are processed into
peptides, and these are transported to the ER where peptides are associated
with class I MHC.  These are presented to CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes.
<p>
Class II MHC are expressed in B lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes, monocytes,
macrophages, dendritic cells, early hematopoietic cells, and some tumor
cells.  Peptides processed by phagolysosomes (usually) which are 13-18 aa long
are bound to the class II MHC and presented to CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphcytes.
<p>
Class III MHC molecules consist of secreted proteins with immune function.
They have a role in immune response and Ag presentation and are not structurally
related to MHC-I and MHC-II molecules.
<ul>
<li>Complement components C2, C4a, C4b, and factor B
<li>Steroid enzymes 21-hydroxylase enzyme A and 21-hydroxylase enzyme B
<li>Inflammatory proteins TNF-&alpha; and TNF-&beta;.
<li>Heat shock proteins such as HSP70.
<li>These are not related structurally to the MHC-I and MHC-II molecules.

The potential diversity of the human MHC locus is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Class I MHC-known alleles = 60 A &times; 110 B &times; 40 C = 260,000 combinations
<li>Class II MHC-known alleles = 4 DP &times; 6 DQ &times; 488 DR = 12,000 combinations
<li>Total possible combinations = 260,000 &times; 12,000 = 3,120,000,000
</ul>
<p>
The clinical significance of HLA is that tissue transplanation will have
increased survival of patient and decreased risk of graft vs. host disease
(GVHD) if HLA and MHC matching is done.  If a recipient is retractile to random
donor platelets, then platelet transfusion matching is useful.  HLA compatibility
has strongest influence on long-term kidney survival:  HLA is also useful in
bone marrow matching.  It is also done for paternity testing.  HLA typing also
indicates risk for diseases:  for examply HLA-B27 is found in &gt; 9 in 10 cases
of ankylosing spondylitis, and on 1 in 10 normals.
<p>
MHC-II molecules are two chains, &alpha; and &beta;, each with epitopes on each
chain.  The DR &alpha;- and &beta; chains can combine in all possible combinations
from both parents (total 4).  If from same parent, it is called <i>cis</i>;
if mixed from parents, it is <i>trans</i>.  Additionally, there is more than
one &beta; chain from DR, adding more complexity.
<p>
<b>Microcytotoxicity test</b>.  Leukocytes from donors and recipient are distributed
to microtiter plate.  Antibodies to MHC-I and MHC-II are added to different
wells.  Complement is then added to wells, and uptake of vital dyes is allowed
to occur.  If the antibody to MHC react with the MHC on the surface of the cell,
then addition of complement will induce membrane porosity, and the vital dye
enters.  A cell taking up dye has the MHC type.  In addition, a reaction
of donor cells and recipient cells with anti-HLA-A antigen must be tested.
<p>
<b>Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)</b>.  Lymphocytes from a potential donor
must be x-irradiated or treated with mitomycin C and will serve as stimulator
cells.  If the presence of donors stimulates recipient T cells to activate,
they begin proliferation which is measured by radioactive thymidine uptake.
This test is better because it determines a direct biological response likely
to indicate rejection response.

<h2>HYPERSENSITIVITY</h2>
<p>
This is an enhanced immune reaction to an antigen. Immune reactions are
classified into four different types, depending on their pathophysiology (see
table). Types I, II, and III are humoral (i.e., antibody mediated), and type IV
hypersensitivity reactions are cell-mediated.
<ul>
<li><b>Type I</b> reactions are <b>immediate-type hypersensitivities</b>
ranging from mild food
allergies to anaphylactic shock. Ags complex with IgE, attach to basophils or
tissue mast cells, and cause histamine release and the synthesis of leukotrienes
C4, D4, and E4. Although Type I reactions can be systemic, most
are localized. Examples include urticaria (hives), hay fever, bronchial asthma,
food allergies.
<li><b>Type II</b> reactions are <b>cytotoxic</b> responses: complement-fixing IgG or
IgM complex against cellular or tissue antigens, often those on WBCs and platelets.
Conditions include hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR), hemolytic disease of
the newborn (HDN), immune thrombocytopenia, and certain drug allergies
<li><b>Type III</b> reactions are <b>immune complex reactions</b>:
IgG and IgM form soluble complexes with their Ags, which are deposited in
interstices and cause neutrophil migration into space and local tissue damage.
Complement is also activated and contributes to inflammatory response.  Examples
include immune glomerulonephritis, serum sickness, arthus reaction.
<li><b>Type IV</b> reactions are <b>delayed-type hypersensitivity</b> reactions.
CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes
react with foreign antigen, release lymphokines that attract PMNs, monocytes,
and macrophages. These cells then release proteases, collagenases, cathepsins,
and TNF?, which mediate inflammation. Examples include tuberculin skin test
and Contact dermatitis
</ul>

</table>


<h2>AUTOIMMUNITY</h2>
<p>
Observed when self-tolerance fails.  Autoimmunity requires participation
of the MHC biomolecules. While it can involve both MHC-I and MHC-II, most
are related with the MHC-II HLA system.  HLA typing can be used to predict
automimmunity potential.  Autoimmunity can be seen with sequestered antigens,
which are not normally selected when selfness is determined, but later they
are exposed and induce immunogenic reaction.  It can occur when foreign
antigens interact with self antigens, and the compbination induces an Ab which
can react with self alone (cross-react).  Altered self antigens, the alteration
being denaturation or other chemical change, and the antibodies induced can
cross react with native.  Mutations of immunocompetent calls might occur in
which they are inactivated against self.  T cell dysfunction might occur
also leading to an inabiity to control immune response.

<p>
Autoimmune disease can be systemic or organ-specific (see table).
Organ-specific autoimmune diseases include virtually any organ:
<ul>
<li>hematologic disorders:  paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, warm autoimmune
hemolytic anemias (AIHAs). immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)
<li>endocrine disorders:  Graves' diseases. Hashimoto's thyroiditis,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
<li>neuromuscular disorders:  myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis
<li>renal disorders:  Goodpasture's syndrome, tubulo-interstitial nephritis
<li>gastrointestinal disorders:  pernicious anemia, primary biliary cirrhosis
</ul>
<p>
Systemic diseases are characterized by widespread involvement. Autoantibodies
are not confined to any one specific organ. Examples include:

<ul>
<li>rheumatoid arthritis (RA): characterized by the presence of abnormal
circulating IgM autoantibodies known collectively as rheumatoid factor (RF).
These antibodies react specifically with the F<sub>c</sub> portion of IgG
molecules (anti-F<sub>c</sub>-IgG IgM). RF may also be seen in patients with
chronic hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), syphilis,
hypogammaglobulinemia, or hypergammaglobulinemia. Testing for RF includesa
latex fixation, latex agglutination (commonly used test; considered positive
for RF if the titer is at least 20), sheep red cell agglutination, and
quantitation of IgM RF

<li>polymyositis: characterized by inflammation and degeneration of skeletal
muscle. The autoantibodies are antinuclear antibodies (ANA), RF, and anti-Jo-1.
</ul>
<p>
<b>SLE</b> is also a system automimmune disease quite well characterizied.
It is a rheumatic disorder that is characterized by the presence of
circulating immune complexes. Most commonly seen in women and persons of
African descent. More than half of SLE patients develop characteristic rash or
other skin abnormalities. Other common symptoms include myocarditis,
lymphadenopathy, glomerulonephritis, and serositis.  SLE may be idiopathic or
drug-induced.  Drugs (e.g., procainamide, phenytoin, methyldopa, penicillin,
sulfonamides) may
cause lupus-like syndrome. ANA are present and may persist for months
after the drug has been discontinued.
Antibodies to native or altered self-antigens are produced
and form circulating immune complexes Ags. Typically these are nuclear Ags,
esp. DNA itself.  Complexes are deposited in various organs and cause inflammation,
which eventually results in tissue injury.
<p>
ANA react with proteins of the nucleus, DNA, or
histones. In general, they are neither organ-specific nor species-specific, and
they can cross-react with nuclear material from humans or animals. Although
ANAs can be demonstrated in disease-free, healthy individuals, they are most
often associated with various systemic rheumatoid diseases. ANAs formed
in SLE are usually IgG, but may be IgM or IgA. Several different antibodies to
DNA and DNA components may be seen in SLE:  anti-ds DNA, anti-ss DNA,
anti-RNA, anti-extractable nuclear Ag, Smith (Sm) antigen, microsomoal antigens,
anti-histone, anti-deoxyribonucleoprotein (LE factor)
<p>
<b>ANA testing</b> makes use of fluorescent antinuclear antibody to check
indirect immunofluorescence:  mouse or rat liver cells are fixed and the patient
serum added.  Then FITC-conjugated antihuman IgG is added to react.
Immunohistochemistry used peroxidase-conjugated antihuman globulin might be also
used.  The staining reaction is characterized in different ways:  homogeneous,
periperhal, speckled, nucleolar, or anticentroeric (might be more).
<p>
<b>LE cell test</b> often seen in SLE patients and also in patients with other
autoimmune disorders: e.g., RA, scleroderma, polydermatomyositis. LE factor
seen in &gt; 95% of cases with SLE. With LE factor present, neutrophils will
phagocytose homogeneous nuclear extrats of lymphcoytes and neutrophils. True LE
cells must be distinguished from rosette formation (several neutrophils
attempting to engulf one nucleus) and tart cells (monocytes phagocytizing whole
cells or nonhomogenous nuclei).

<h2>IMMUNODEFICIENCIES</h2>
<p>
Immune deficiencies are problems related with
phagocytic cells, B lymphocytes, a combination of T and B lymphocytes, and the
complement system.
<p>
<b>Phagocytic cell deficiencies</b> result in a decreased ability
to phagocytize and kill bacteria.
<p>
<b>Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)</b> is a genetic disease characterized
by ineffective killing of bacteria by neutrophils resulting from defect in
cytochrome <i>b</i>, which is necessary for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
production. NBT staining of neutrophils is used to determine whether peroxide
is generated. Patients with CGD suffer from recurrent infections caused by
catalase-positive bacteria and yeast and fungi. Treatment includes the use of
GM-CSF or G-CSF and IFN-&gamma; .
<p>
<b>MPO deficiency</b> is a most common autosomal recessive disorder.
MPO in primary granules is
decreased or absent with no impairment of phagocytosis.
Fungal killing is more seriously impaired. Although otherwise healthy patients
with MPO deficiency do not have an
increased frequency of infection, diabetic cases may be suspectible to
<i>Candida</i> sp infections.
<p>
<b>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency</b> can impair the
neutrophil aerobic metabolism, also with lower peroxide generation.  This leads
to recurrent infections.
<p>
<b>CR3 (iC3b receptor) deficiency</b> is a rare, autosomal recessive trait
characterized by decrease or absence of complement component receptor
on neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. These receptors are responsible for
adherence-related functions. Abnormalities result in defective margination and
diapedesis of neutrophils, impaired chemotaxis, and ineffective phagocytosis.
T lymphocytes adhere poorly to target cells. Clinically, there is an increased
frequency of bacterial infections, a decreased inflammatory response, and neutrophilia.
<p>
<b>Specific granule deficiency</b> is autosomal recessive failure of granule
formation in neutrophils during myelopoiesis, and so severe, recurrent
bacterial infections are consequent.
<p>
<b>Chediak-Higashi syndrome</b> is genetic disorder caused by abnormal fusion of
primary granules in neutrophils.  During phagocytosis, degranulation.  In addition
to recurrent bacterial infections, there is characteristic albinism and
extreme photosensitivity.
<p>
<b>Lazy leukocyte syndromes</b> include:
<ul>
<li><b>Job syndrome</b> (hyperimmunoglobulin E), causing poor chemotaxis and
recurrent skin infections and abscesses.
<li>Tuftsin deficiency. Tuftsin is a chemotaxin that also improves phagocyte
motility, engulfment, and oxidative metabolism. Affected persons experience
recurrent bacterial infections.
<li>Actin dysfunction is a problem with actin resulting in decreased cell
motility and chemotaxis, with consequence of recurrent bacterial infections.
</ul>

<p>
B-lymphocyte immunodeficiencies may be inherited or acquired. These may be &gt;
50% of all immunodeficiencies. Affectedness varies widely, depending on the 
class of immunoglobulin that is deficient. Deficiency in IgD would likely be
less devastating than in IgG, which is 75-85% of total Ig.
<ul>
<li><b>Bruton's agammaglobulinemia</b> is sex-linked disorder affecting
usually very young males who pre-B marrow cells fail to mature, and few mature
B cells circulate.  SPE shows significantly reduced &gamma;-globulins.  Treatment
may require gamma globulin preps.
<li><b>Common variable hypogammaglobulinemia</b> is acquired disorder where
1 or 2 Ig classes are deficient. Total Ig shows normal but results from increase
in Ig class to compensate for deficient Ig class.  Selective IgA deficiency is
an example.  Usually IgG deficiencies manifest in infection susceptibility.
<li><b>Neonatal hypogammaglobulinemia</b> is a temporary developmental delay
in neonatal immune system maturity that self-corrects between age 6 and 12 months
as the infant's immune system is stimulated.
</ul>

<p>
T lymphocyte immunodeficiencies make up a minor fraction of immunodeficiencies
(7%), usually affecting B cell function also. Disorders may be acquired or
inherited.
<ul>
<li><b>DiGeorge syndrome</b> is a defect in embryonic development of thymus
gland which includes other endodermal development problems.  T lymphocytes may
be deficient or normal.  There is high CD4:CD8 ratio, with normal humoral but
deficient cell-mediated responses.
<li><b>Nezelof syndrome</b> is an autosomal recessive problem resulting in
complete athymic development.  The most important consequent is extreme
susceptibility to viral and fungal infections, often fatal in these cases.
This is the result of a loss of cell-mediated immunity.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Combined B and T lymphocyte immunodeficiencies</b> result in both humoral and
cell-mediated problems and are most serious.
<ul>
<li><b>Bare lymphocyte syndromes</b> are those with MHC-I or MHC-II, or both.
CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte counts are low, and B and T cell activation does
not occur.
<li><b>Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID)</b> are either autosomal
recessive or X-linked traits, causing severely low T and B lymphocyte counts
<li><b>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)</b> causeed by HIV-1 or
HIV-2.  More detail after list.
</ul>
<p>
AIDS results from a decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphcytes, target by HIV
types.  5% of B lymphocytes are also infected.  HIV transmission is by sexual
contact or by parental means (transfusion of infected blood, or by HIV-contaminated
product injection).  Possibly other body fluids.  HIV infection progresses in
three stages:
<ol>
<li><b>Primary stage</b>: many months to years.  Might be initial flulike
illness, then no symptoms or chronic lymphadenopathy for years.
<li><b>Intermediate stage</b>: seen as <b>AIDS-related complex (ARC)</b>.  Symptoms
occur but there are no opportunistic infections.
<li><b>Final stage</b>:  AIDS, observed usually within 2-10 years after
initial infection. Opportunistic infections are common and include
<i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> pneumonia, candidiasis, and histoplasmosis.
</ol>
The pathophysiology involves
<ul>
<li>CD4:CD8 ratio is reduced 2:1 to 0.5:1
<li>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts reduced, function impaired
<li>Abnormal B cell activation
<li>Macrophage and NK cell functions impaired.
</ul>

<p>
<b>HIV infection testing</b>.  Tests to detect HIV antigens, anti-HIV antibodies,
HIV RNA genome, and HIV DNA exist.  If HIV Ags are present, then there is active
infection.  In antigen testing, monocytes are isolated and stimulated in
culture, and culture supernatants are tested for antigen presence outside the
influence of antibodies.  ELISA products are able to examine plasma, serum, CSF,
and culture fluids to detect HIV Ags.  Additionally immunofluorescence assay
(IFA) can be used to detect HIV antigen expressed in infected cells.
<p>
Antibody presence indicates prior or orgoing exposure. Anti-p24 IgM form 6-8
weeks postinfection, and anti-p24 IgG form weeks later. Other antibodies form
againt env products gp160, gp120, gp41 and polymerase p31, p51, p66. The ELISA
is a screen test to detect. Confirmatory testing must be done on positives
(screen tests should not give false negatives where possible). A western blot
is typical as a confirmatory test (again a false positive is possible).
Anti-HIV Ab also can be done with IFA, RIA, radioimmunoprecipitation.
<p>
Both ISH and filter hybridization used for viral RNA using cells or their
extracts of peripheral blood samples.  Southern blots have also been used.
PCR has been used in RNA and DNA tests.


<h2>Techniques In Immunology And Serology</h2>
<p>
Agglutination assays are Ag-Ab reaction producing visible aggregation.  Tests
are simple and often most sensitive.
<ul>
<li><b>Flocculation tests</b>.  Principally a test for Ab when Ag is added to
form precipitate.  Visible agglutination occurs.
<li><b>Latex agglutination</b> is when Ab is coated to latex beads
to enhance the senstitivity of agglutination.
<li><b>Direct bacterial agglutination</b> is when bacterial preps are added to
look for agglutination to indicate antibody presence.
<li><b>Hemagglutination</b> tests used to detect antibodies to RBC antigens.
<b>Passive</b> or <b>indirect</b> hemagglutination tests adsorb soluble Ags
on to RBC membranes, and then Abs present cause RBC agglutination.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Agglutination inhibition assays</b> are very sensitive and can detect small
amounts of Ag. <b>Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays</b> involves
preincubating Ag with Ab and with RBCs:  if agglutination occurs, then Ab is
already bound to Ag, and this is a negative result.  Other assays may use
a latex particle assay.
<p>
<b>Precipitation assays</b> are mixtures of Ag and Ab present that result in
precipitation.  The Ag and Ab concentations for pptn are <b>equivalence
zones</b>   If either is present in excess, no pptn occurs, leading to a
false negative.
<p>
<b>Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion method</b> uses Ags and Ab solutions placed
in well cutout in agar or agarose gels through which the solutions can diffuse.
The Ab is placed in center well, and Ags are placed in peripheral wells.
Lines form  between the 3 wells.  At the point Ab and Ag meet, a precipitate
becomes visible in the gel.  The reaction pattern can be:
<ul>
<li>Identity: a single smooth precipitin arc
<li>Nonidentity:  two separate precipitin arcs would indicate that Ag and Ab
would not react with each other.
<li>Partial identity:  there are two lines that intersect, but one shows a
spur:  this shows that antigens have some common epitopes, but one of the
Ags has a unique epitope.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Radial immunodiffusion (RID)</b> is a single diffusion method that can be
used to quantitate immunoglobulins and other serum proteins. Samples are 
introduced into wells cut in agarose containing antiserum and allowed to 
diffuse, usually overnight. The diameters of the resulting precipitation rings 
correspond to the amount of antigen present.
<p>
<b>Electroimmunodiffusion</b> combines the speed of electrophoresis with the
sensitivity of immunodiffusion. <b>Countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE)
</b> is a double diffusion technique applying voltage to both Ag and Ab to move
them together, and seeing a precipitin arc when equivalence occurs. <b>Rocket
electrophoresis</b> . This technique applies an electrical charge to an RID
assay, resulting in rocket-shaped line of precipitation. The height of the
rocket is proportional to the antigen concentration.
<p>
<b>Immunoelectrophoresis (IEP)</b> is used to examine monoclonal gammopathies.
After serum or urine sample is electrophoresed in a gel medium, a trough is
cut in the agar parallel to the line of separated proteins. Monoclonal or polyclonal
antisera are loaded into the trough.  Two troughs generally cut on either side
of the electrophoreis lane:  one with control and other with patient sample
<p>
<b>Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE)</b>. Serum, urine, or CSF samples are
electrophoresed in an agarose gel, cellulose acetate impregnated with antiserum
is placed on the gel, which diffuses into the gel for immunoprecipitate.  This
too is used for monoclonal gammopathy.
<p>
The <b>radioimmunoassay (RIA)</b> is a rapid and sensitive method for detect
small amounts of Ag or Ab. There are dangers associated with this assay however.
<p>
The <b>radioallergosorbent test (RAST)</b> is an RIA method specifically
designed to measure antigen-specific IgE.  The <b>radioimmunosorbent test (RIST)</b>
is a competitive binding technique used to quantitate IgE.
<p>
<b>ELISA</b> is similar in principle to RIA and has the same sensitivity, but
uses an enzyme label instead of a radioactive label. HRP and alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) are most commonly used enzymes. ELISAs can be used to detect
extremely small amounts of antigen or antibody.
<p>
Immunoflourescence (assay) (IFA) used to identify antigens in tissue sections
or air-dried smears of peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates, touch preparations,
or fine needle aspirate samples.
<p>
The labeling of the detecting material can be direct (to the primary antibody)
or indirect (secondary antibody).  Fluorophores include FITC, but repeated
excitiation can lead to quenching.  Enzyme-mediated precipitants offer color
located at the sites where the enzyme reaction occurs.
<p>
<b>Turbidimetry</b> is the measure of incident light that remains that is not
scattered by a cloudy solution. Nephelometry is the measure of the light that
is scattered: detectors are placed at 30&deg; (forward scatter) or 90&deg;
(side scatter). In some cases, back scatter (from &gt; 90&deg; to &lt; 180&deg;)
is measured.  Any reaction producing a turdbid reaction can be measured.
<p>
Neutralizing antibodies can destroy the infectivity of viruses, which provides
the basis for assays that can determine the amount of viral antibody present.
These techniques are often used to detect antibodies against herpes simplex
virus Types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and echovirus.
<p>
Cellular function assays are not common in laboratory testing but might be used
in reference labs or large med centers.  Some are even obsolute.
<ul>
<li>ADCC assays use bacteria-infected tumor cells to assess the killing ability of NK
cells.
<li>The Boyden chamber uses chemotactic substances to assess the chemotactic response
of neutrophils.
<li>Cell-mediated monocytolysis uses tumor cells to assess the killing functions of
monocytes.
<li>Latex bead ingestion assesses phagocytic activity.
<li>Lymphocyte transformation tests assess the ability of lymphocytes to response
to mitogens or specific antigens.
<li>Lympholysis tests assess the ability of T<sub>C</sub> to lyse labeled target cells.
<li>Microcytotoxicity studies are used to detect HLA antigens and antibodies.
<li>Migration inhibition techniques determine the ability of lymphocytes to produce
chemotactic factors in response to granulocytes and monocytes.
<li>Mixed-lymphocyte cultures are used to assess the human leukocyte antigen D
(HLA-D) compatibility of donor and recipient lymphocytes.
<li>NBT reductase tests are used to assess the intracellular killing ability of
neutrophils.
<li>Phagocytosis assays mix bacteria with neutrophils to assess the cells' phagocytic
ability.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Flow cytometry</b> identifies (sub)populations of cells such as
reticulocytes, granulocytes, T cell subsets, B lymphocytes, etc. Fluorescent 
dyes (fluorescein, acridine orange, and phycoerythrin) are bound specifically 
to the cell marker of interest. Cells in suspension pass singly through a 
laminar-flow saline sheath. As the stained cells pass through a laser beam
(usually argon or krypton), the dye is activated, and the cell fluoresces. The
fluorescence is detected and collected by sensors placed at 90&deg; relative to
the source beam, and the information is processed by a computer

<h2>SYPHILIS SEROLOGY</h2>
<p>
Syphilis caused by the spirochete <i>Treponema pallidum</i>. Antibodies against
treponemal antigens and nontreponemal cardiolipin antigens (Wassermann
antigens) develop and elicit both cell-mediated and humoral response.
Transmission by sexual contact or by transfusion of infected (untested) blood
is route.  Can also be transmitted vertically from mother to fetus.  Disease
has four stage:
<ol>
<li><b>Primary (early)</b>: inflammatory lesions (chancres) appear 2-8 weeks
postinfection and last for 1-5 weeks. Serum positive in 9 in 10 cases after
3 weeks.  Predominantly IgM.
<li><b>Secondary</b> occurs 6-8 weeks after chancres appear. There is a
generalized rash; secondary lesions may develop in the eyes, joints, or central
nervous system (CNS). These lesions are highly contagious, but heal
spontaneously within 2-6 weeks. Serologic tests are positive in secondary
syphilis. Antibodies are mostly IgG.
<li><b>Latent stage</b> generally considered to begin after the second year of
infection. It remains contangious although no clinical symptoms and serologic
tests are still positive. After 4 years, syphilis is not usually contagious but
mother-to-fetus transmission still occurs.
<li><b>Tertiary stage</b> syphilis is characterized by granulomatous lesions
known as <b>gummata</b>. These lesions may develop in skin, mucous membranes,
joints, muscles, and bones, causing little or no clinical problems.
Approximately 80% of patients experience CNS involvement, which can result in
paralysis or dementia. Approximately 10% of patients develop cardiovascular
problems, which can result in aortic aneurysm.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Congenital syphilis</b>. Mother-to-fetus transmission occurs in 18th week of
gestation. Treatment before 18th week prevents, and treatment after 18th week
cures.
<p>
<b>Treatment</b> is the drug of choice, penicillin, with tetracycline or
erythromycin also used. Serology may but not always show negative. Treatement
in primary stage usually leads to serology being nonreactive ~6 months later.
Treatment in secondary stage usually lead to serology being nonreactive within
12-18 months. Some patients treated 10+ years after infection may always remain
seropositive.
<p>
<b>Syphilis lab testing</b>. Two types of antibody testing (treponemal and
nontreponemal). In nontreponemal antibodes, <b>reagin antibodies</b> react with
<b>lipoidal antigens</b> which are present in <i>T pallidum</i> infections;
this is a screening test.  Reagin tests include:
<ul>
<li>Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide test:  qualitative
agglutination test using heat-inactivated patient serum (CSF also possible).
Can be modified to be quantitative.
<li>Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test: also agglutination test reacting with
lipoidal antigens and cholesterol. Test employs charcoal to facilitate visual
interpretation. Plasma can be used, although serum (not heat-inactivated)
is preferred.
</ul>
Test results graded NR: nonreactive, WR: weakly reactive, or R: reactive.
Both false positives and negatives are known.  SLE, RA, infectious mononucleosis,
pregnancy, old age cause false positives.  Technical errors, low Ab titers,
and prozone phenomenon cause false negatives.
<p>
Direct treponemal Ab detection (not antireagin Ab) are used to confirm positive
screening tests, and to quantitate Ab titers.
<ul>
<li>Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS). A killed
suspension of <i>T pallidum</i> is mixed with patient sample, washed away, and
then incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-human Ig reagent, and observed
microscopically.  Make sure to use negative and positive control!
<li>Microhemagglutination assay for <i>T. pallidum</i> (MHA-TP):  RBC that are
coated with treponemal Ags are mixed with patient sample.  Agglutination indicates
positivity.
</ul>

<h2>Acute Phase Proteins</h2>
<p>
Synthesized by liver parenchyma, these plasma proteins increase significantly
during the acute phase of an inflammatory process.
<ul>
<li><b>&alpha;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin</b> serine protease inhibitor regulating
proteases causing lung damage and pulmonary inflammation. Deficiencies can be 
caused by heterozygous defect, with increased risk of liver disease, 
glomerulonephritis, and connective tissue diseases. Homozygous defects result 
in premature emphysema and liver disease.
<li><b>&alpha;<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin</b> is a protease inhibitor that plays
a role in the coagulation, fibrinolysis, and complement components of
hemostasis.
<li><b>Ceruloplasmin</b> is a major copper-transport protein.  Wilson's disease
is caused by its absence or deficiency
<li><b>C-reactive protein (CRP)</b> normally found in trace amounts in serum,
increasing 1000-fold in inflammation.  First of the acute phase proteins
to appear in injury or inflammation.  Can be use to monitor disease severity
and monitor therapy. Elevated levels occur rheumatic diseases (RA), bacterial 
and viral infections, burn injuries, malignancies, tuberculosis, and renal 
transplantation. Levels rise rapidly after myocardial infarction, correlate
with elevated CK-MB levels. Latex agglutination test most commonly used
for CRP testing.
<li><b>Fibrinogen</b> plays an active role in wound healing after tissue injury.
It is primarily responsible for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
<li><b>Haptoglobin</b> is a plasma protein binding free hemoglobin. Decreased
levels either result of intravascular hemolysis or decreased synthesis
secondary to liver disease. Haptoglobin levels increase 2- to 4-fold following
tissue injury.
</ul>

<h2>Hepatitis</h2>
<p>
generally any inflammation of the liver, but usually caused by a group of
viruses identified as hepatitis A through E.
<p>
<b>Hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis)</b> is caused by the hepatitis A virus
(HAV); transmitted most commonly through the fecal-oral route; seen in
epidemics where sanitation is poor. Raw shellfish from contaminated water can
also transmit the disease. Infections are almost always acute and self-limiting,
 and there is no carrier state. Symptoms are vague and relatively nonspecific
if present; patients may complain of fatigue, malaise, and anorexia. Jaundice
may be present, although most patients are anicteric. Many cases are
subclinical, especially those in children. Lab testing: Alanine a
minotransferase (ALT) elevated, as are other liver function tests. Total
bilirubin levels may be elevated. Anti-HAV Igs detectable by immunoassays: IgM
type develops in acute phase and last 3-12 months after disease onset; IgG
levels increase as IgM wane, persist in life, giving permanent immunity.
Household and sexual contacts of infected persons should receive immune
globulin injections within 2 weeks of exposure as a prophylactic. A recently
developed vaccine against HAV is now available.


<div style="float:right;width:25em;padding:1em;border:2px solid blue;margin:1em 0 1em 1em;">
<p>
<b>Order of Appearance of Hepatitis B Markers</b>
<ol>
<li>Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
<li>Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg)
<li>Hepatits B core antibody (HBcAb)
<li>Hepatitis Be antibody (HBeAb)
<li>Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb)
</ol>
</div>
<p>
<b>Hepatitis B virus (HBV)</b> was known as the Australia or hepa
titis-associated antigen. It is transmitted parenterally (IV drug use, blood
transfusion, product injection), through sexual contact w/ infected persons,
and cutaneous or mucous membrane exposure (needlestick, splashes into eyes,
nose or mouth). Incubation period is 2-3 months.  Infections can be
acute, chronic, or fulminant, or the patient may be a chronic
asymptomatic carrier.  Symptoms similar to HAV infections:
Jaundice may or may not be present.  95% of cases are acute:
acute cases can have complication of circulating HBV
antigen-antibody complexes causing polyarteritis, arthritis,
glomerulonephritis, pancreatitis, or cryoglobulinemia. Chronic cases can
progress to cirrhosis and later to hepatocellular carcinoma.  Lab testing:
Liver ALT levels peak approximately the same time
symptoms appear. Serology can identify and pinpoint stage of disease.
HBsAg appears 1 wk-2 mon post-exposure,  and about 2 wk-2 mon before
symptoms.  Declines during recovery from acute infection; its presence shows
acute or chronic disease.  Anti-HBS (HBsAb) presence indicates recovery and
immunity.  Anti-HBC (HBcAb) appears after ALT levels rise, and persists for life
as marker of previous infection.  HBeAg also appears with HBsAg and usually
declines in 2 weeks:  present with active viral replication: patient is most
infectious when it is present.  Anti-HBE (HBeAb) appears after the HBeAg
disappears, indicates resolving infection; usually indicate no complicating
liver disease, but will be present in chronic asymptomatic carriers.
Prevention is by avoiding high risk behavior (IV drug use, sexual contact with
infected people); HBV vaccine since 1982 (also protects against HDV, since it
requires HBV as a helper virus).
<p>
<b>Hepatitis C virus (HCV)</b> recently identified as non-A, non-B hepatitis.
Transmitted by parenteral route and sex contact with infected person. Average
incubation period is 7-8 weeks. HCV infections may be acute or chronic:
symptoms are similar to HAV and HBV. About half are chronic carriers. 1 in 5
cases develop cirrhosis, 1 in 5 cirrhotic HCV cases eventually develop
hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is also associated with immune complex
glomerulonephritis. Lab testing: Like HAV and HBV, elevated ALT levels.
Immunoassays used to detect anti-HCV antibody, although high number of false
positive. Also high number of false negatives, since sensitivity is only 70-85%
with post transfusion HCV, and only 50% of cases not related to transfusion.
Can take up to 12 months for patients to seroconvert. Serum or liver tissue
possibly analyzed by HCV RNA using PCR.  Prevention involves avoiding
high risk behavior as for HBV.  No HCV vaccine.
<p>
<b>Hepatitis D</b> is associated exclusively with HBV infections, either as a
co-infection or as a superinfection. It is seen most commonly in intravenous 
drug users and hemophiliacs. No vaccine is available. The only means of 
preventing hepatitis D infection is to prevent HBV infection.
<p>
<b>Hepatitis E</b> causes sporadic and epidemic hepatitis in developing countries
such as India, Pakistan, Africa, and Mexico. The disease clinically resembles 
HAV infections and is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. There is no 
chronic infection, and the hepatitis E virus is not associated with 
hepatocellular carcinoma.

<h2>Streptococcal Serology</h2>
<p>
<b>Streptococcus pyogenes</b> is a gram-positive coccus causing many human
infections, some with serious symptoms.  The M protein is a major virulence
factor with 60 serotypes of M.  Nearly all strains produce two hemolysins:
<ol>
<li><b>streptolysin O (SLO)</b> is an oxygen-labile enzyme that causes hemolysis by
binding to cholesterol in the RBC membrane. It is antigenic, and the presence 
of antibodies to SLO is an indicator of recent streptococcal infection.
<li><b>streptolysin S</b> is a nonantigenic, oxygen-stable enzyme. It causes hemolysis
by disrupting the selective permeability of the RBC membrane.
</ol>
The infections it causes includes:
<ul>
<li>skin
 <ul>
 <li>cellulitis:

 </ul>
<li>upper respiratory tract infections with symptoms of fever, sore throat,
and pharyngeal edema.
<li>scarlet fever:  a strain produces a erythrogenic toxin with characteristic
rash. Fever and sore throat are also seen.
<li>rheumatic fever (RF) is a complication consequent to upper respiratory
tract infections. All M serotypes causing pharyngitis implicated in
RF. RF results in damage to heart valves, and patients with rheumatic heart
disease have an increased risk of developing endocarditis and other cardiac
problems in later years.
<li>post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, possibly occurring after pharyngitis
or skin infections. Only a few M serotypes cause this type of glomerulonephritis.
Patients have an increased risk of developing renal failure later.
</ul>
<p>
Abs to streptococcal cell membranes xreact with myosin in cardiomyocytes, causing
heart damage.  AgAb complexes form at glomerular basement membrane and attract
inflammatory cells, causing renal tissue damage.
<p>
Lab testing for Streptococcus: streptolysin O induces antibodies called <b>
antistreptolysin O (ASO)</b> whose titer starts to increase ~7 d and peaks
after 4-6 weeks. The test is done with serial dilutions of patient sample,
streptolysin O, and group O RBCs. In controls without ASO, the cells hemolyze.
If the patient serum has ASO, there is no hemolysis. The highest dilution
showing NO hemolysis is the titer value, and expressed in Todd units.
The normal reference range is not ascertainable since ASO values vary widely
among healthy individuals.  Titers of &lt; 166 Todd units are found in most,
and drop after age 50 y.  Elevated titer is evidence of recent infection.
A 30% increase is of greater significance.  It can remain elevated for weeks
or months. ~80%-85% of cases of RF have increased ASO titers.
<p>
<b>Anti-DNAse B (AD-B)</b>  Deoxyribonuclease B (DNAse B) is a streptococcal
protein  An assay to check for DNase B neutralization demonstrates recent
infection.  AD-B is increased 15-20% in RF cases who do not show increased ASO
titers.
<p>
Other tests to detect streptococcal Ag exist which are designed to be rapid,
but are not sensitive (produce false negatives).


<h2>Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Serology</h2>
<p>
EBV is etiologic agent of Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and
most commonly, infectious mononucleosis (IM). Virus is ubiquitous; 80%-90% of
healthy adults have EBV antibodies. EBV infects B lymphocytes.
<p>
<b>Infectious mononucleosis (IM)</b> is an acute, self-limiting disease
typically in young adults. Symptoms are fever, sore throat, cervical
lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and mild hepatitis. WBCs become elevated with
circulating reactive lymphocytes with both relative and absolute lymphocytosis.
Incubation period 2-8 weeks.
<table class="td-left">
<caption>EBV Antigens and Antibodies</caption>
<tr><th>Antigen   <th>Description  <th>Antibody  <th>Description
<tr><td rowspan="2">Viral capsid antigen (VCA)
   <td rowspan="2">located in cytoplasm

  <td>IgG  <td>indicator of active disease

<tr><td>early antigen-restricted (EA-R)

     adults
<tr><td>Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)
  <td>in the nuclei of all infected cells
  <td>IgG  <td>develop slowly, persist for life
</table>
<p>
<b>Heterophile antibodies</b> are those produced by one antigen but cross-react
with others from different mammalian species. IM induces response for heterophile
Ig in 50-70% of cases, and these persist 4-8 week after infection.
<p>
Laboratory testing:
<ul>
<li><b>Monospot test</b>. An RBC agglutination test checking for heterophil
antibodies in infectious mononucleosis. Horse RBCs have the Forsman and IM Ags. 
Monospot is a slide test combining adsorption and agglutination. One drop of 
guinea pig kidney (GPK) emulsion is mixed with one drop of patient sample 
(undiluted serum) in on square of a slide, and one drop of ox RBC stroma (OCS) 
in another square with sample. Then horse RBCs are added to the squares with 
mixing. If agglutination occurs in GPK square and not in OCS, then heterophil
Abs are IM type.  Generally positive for IM 85% of cases which are VCA-positive.
<li>Davidsohn differential test can distinguish heterophile sheep cell
agglutinins in human serum caused by IM, serum sickness, and Forssman antigen.
Double dilutions of sample are mixed with sheep RBC to get a titer.
<li>Paul-Bunnell test can detect only the presence or absence of heterophile
antibodies. It cannot determine the specificity of the antibodies.
</ul>

<h2>Rubella Serology</h2>
<p>
Also know as German or 3-day measles, it shows as a rash, fever, and
lymphadenopathy.  Antiviral IgM appears within a few weeks, and the IgG
persists for life.  <b>Congenital rubella syndrome</b> is an infection of the
fetus resulting in pregnancy causing birth defects or even fetal death.
Testing for antirubella IgM indicates current or very recent infection.
If IgM is found in fetal circulation, this might indicate congenital rubella
syndrome.
<p>
Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) detects and quantitate rubella antibodies
(does not distinguish IgG from IgM).   A titer = 8 indicates recent infection.
Passive latex agglutination is faster and more convenient than HAI.
EIA are avaialable for accurate (unit-based) quantitation.  Immunofluorescence
also available.

<h2>Febrile Disease Serology</h2>
<p>
Antibodies to several microbes causeing fever and called <b>febrile
agglutinins</b> can be tested to assess status:
<ul>
<li>Brucellosis, <i>Brucella abortus</i>
<li>Paratyphoid fever,  <i>Salmonella paratyphi</i>
<li>Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Q fever, both caused by <i>rickettsiae</i>
<li>Tularemia, which is caused by Francisella tularensis
</ul>
Laboratory testing:
<ul>
<li><b>Widal's test</b>, for Igs to typhoid fever, tularemia, and brucellosis
<li><b>Weil-Felix test</b> for rickettsial diseases such murine typhus or
Q fever,  agglutination test for 
cross-reactivity of rickettsial antibodies with antibodies to the somatic
<q>O</q> antigens of the OX-19 and OX-2 strains of <i>Proteus vulgaris</i> and
the OX-K strain of <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>.  Titers &gt; 160 are significant.
</ul>

<h2><i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> Serology</h2>
<p>
<i>Borrelia burgdoferi</i> is a bacterium discovered by Dr. Willy Burgdorfer in
1982 who isolated the spirochetes from mid-guts of Ixodes ticks.  It is the
causative agent of Lyme disease.  The vector is the <i>Ixodes</i> ticks.
Ticks have a larval, nymphal, and adult stage.  The larval and nymphal stage
feeds on blood of white-footed mouse, while the adult feeds on white-tailed
deer.  Lyme disease can not only affect humans, but also dogs, horse, cattle.
<p>
Lyme disease has three stages:
<ol>
<li>Early infection: distinct expanding red rash (<q>bull's eye</q> or target
rash appearance): <i>erythema chronicum migrans</i> appears in 3 to 4 in 5 
cases of infected individuals 2 to 32 days after being bitten by infected tick.
Spirochetes can be isolated from the leading edge of the classic bull's eye
rash (erythema chronicum migrans) which usually persists up to 1 month.
<li>Dissemination stage:  days to weeks after initial infection. Spirochetes
spread by way of bloodstream to all tissues, and may embed and cause muscle
and joint pain, fatigue, chills and fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes,
secondary annular skin lesions.
<li>Chronic disseminated: intermittent episodes of joint pain often
misdiagnosed as arthritis. Other common clinical manifestations of this stage
can include meningitis, Bell's palsy, cardiac involvement, migratory pain to
joints, tendons, muscle and bone.
</ol>
Lab diagnostics:
<ul>
<li>patient history: Lyme diseases mimics so many other diseases.  Did patient
get exposed to ticks?  Is it endemic?
<li>serology:  Is a 4-fold titer detected between initial infection and 6-8 weeks
later?  IFA testing is avaible.  ELISA is available, but rule out false positives
from other spirochetes (syphilis).
<li>Western?  Southern?
<li>bacterial culture on Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) medium at 33&deg;.
<li>PCR is avaiable?
<li>flow cytometry:  Gundersen lyme test (GLT) (also known as the
borreliacidal-antibody test BAT) uses flow cytometry to detect borreliacidal
antibodies which helps eliminates crossreactivity and increases sensitivity.
</ul>
<p>
Treatment is with antibiotics:  doxycycline (semisynthetic derivative of
tetracycline), taken for a 4-6 weeks period.

<h2>Transplant Immunology</h2>
<p>
Types of grafts
<ul>
<li>autograft:  the donor and recipient of the tissue is the same person;
moving tissue from one site to another in the same patient
<li>isograft (syngraft):  tissue transferred between genetically identical
individuals
<li>allograft (homograft):  tissue transferred between genetically different
members of the same species
<li>xenograft (heterograft): tissue transferred between different species
</ul>
<p>
Grafts are accepted when angiogenesis (revascularization) and healing lead
to a repaired site in about two weeks.
<p>
Graft rejection occurs with two types:
<ol>
<li>first-set rejection occurs when a graft is sensed first time and
rejected by the immune system, which determines a non-self condition.  Occurs
within 10-14 d.
<li>second-set rejection occurs in the same way, but the tissue was encountered
previously and rejection more rapid (6 d).  The same mechanism is involved.
</ol>
<p>
Rejection occurs in two stages. Rejection is caused by response to alloantigens
on the graft. It is believed that both cell-mediated cytotoxicity and
delayed-type hypersensitivity are involved.
<ol>
<li>Stage 1 involves sensitization. CD4 and CD8 T cells recognize alloantigens
expressed on cells of the foreign graft and proliferate in response. The host T
helper cell becomes activated when it interacts with an antigen presenting cell.
Depending upon the tissue, different populations of cells within a graft may
function as antigen presenting cells.  Migration of passenger leukocytes from a
donor graft to regional lymph nodes of the recipient results in the activation
of T<sub>H</sub> cells in response to different Class II MHC antigens expressed
by the passenger leukocytes. These activated T<sub>H</sub> cells then induce
generation of cytotoxic T cells of which mediate graft rejection.
<li>Stage 2 is the effector phase:  Most cell-mediated reaction are DTH and
CTL-mediated cytotoxicty.  Less common is ADCC.
</ol>
<p>
Types of rejection reactions are:
<ul>
<li><b>Hyperacute rejection</b> happens inside 24 hours after
transplantation:  these are pre-existing antibodies specific for allogenic MHC
antigen.  Seen in repeated blood transfusions, repeated pregnancies, or
previous grafts.
<li><b>Acute rejection</b> are those reactions seen in first few weeks after
transplantation.
<li><b>Chronic rejection</b> occurs from months to years after
transplantation, and usually develops months or years after acute rejection 
has subsided. Mechanisms of chronic rejection include both humoral 
and cell-mediated response by the recipient.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Donor testing and tissue typing</b>. Tests performed on tissues donors
usually are
<ul>
<li>ABO/Rh
<li>CMV
<li>RPR
<li>FTA
<li>HbsAg &amp; HBcAg
<li>EBV
<li>anti-HIV 1 and 2
<li>HTLV I &amp; II
<li>parvovirus B19
<li>HCV
<li>HLA matching
</ul>
<p>
The donor and recipient must be typed and matched for ABO and HLA antigens.
HLA-identical donors have the lowest rate of rejection.
<p>
All allogeneic transplantation requires some degree of <b>immunosuppression</b>
if the graft is to take. The disadvantage is that immunosuppression is done to 
a degree to make the individual immunocompromised and more susceptible to 
infection. Many immunosuppressive measures attempt to slow the proliferation of 
activated lymphocytes. Any rapidly dividing nonimmune cells are also affected, 
therefore serious complications can occur including increased risk of cancer, 
hypertension, and metabolic bone disease.
<p>
Immunosuppressive drugs and measures include:
<ul>
<li>azathiprine (Imuran), a potent mitotic inhibitor
<li>cyclophosphamide disrupts the DNA chain
<li>methotrexate acts as a folic acid antagonist to block purine biosynthesis
<li>corticosteroids are antiinflammatory drugs that affect activated macrophages and
decrease the expression of HLA antigens
<li>cyclosporine reduces expression of IL-2R on affected lymphocytes
and decreases lymphokine production of T helper cells. Prevents T-cell activation
<li>FK-506 (tacrolimus), T cell inhibitor; less toxic to kidneys, liver and CNS
<li>total lymphoid irradiation
<li>specific therapy such as antilymphocytic globulin and anti-CD3
</ul>
<p>
Transplantable tissues and organs include:
<ul>
<li>cornea
<li>middle ear
<li>lung
<li>heart
<li>blood vessels
<li>pancreas
<li>kidneys
<li>bone
<li>bone marrow
<li>skin
</ul>
<p>
Living donors may donate one kidney, part of the liver, section of the pancreas,
or a lobe of a lung.

<caption>Tumor Markers</caption>
<tr><th>Tumor Marker  <th>Tumor Association
<tr><td>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
  <td>Elevated in patients with colon cancer, colitis, pancreatitis, prostate cancer
<tr><td>&alpha;<sub>1</sub>-fetoprotein (AFP)
   <td>Elevated in the serum of patients with liver tumors, and germ cell tumors

<b>Types of Tumors</b>
<ul>
<li>neoplasia: any uncontrolled growth of normal cells
<li>benign: not immortal, does not invade healthy tissue extensively
<li>malignant: immortal, progressively invasive, CANCER, invades normal tissues
<li>carcinoma: tumors that arise from endodermal or ectodermal tissue
<li>leukemia and lymphoma: malignant tumors of hematopoietic cells of the
bone marrow
<li>sarcoma: derived from mesodermal connective tissues
<li>metastasis: moves through the blood or lymph to new sites; small clumps
of cells that break off and spread where they continue to grow
<li>proto-oncogenes: genes that normally regulate the initiation and
execution of normal cell division
<li>oncogenes: the mutant forms of proto-oncogenes that contribute
to various tumor types or malignant transformation
</ul>
<p>
<b>Tumor-specific antigens</b> are not normally found on somatic cells but
result from mutations of genes. <b>Tumor-associated antigens</b> are not unique
to tumor cells, but antigen expression has been altered and can be expressed in
excess where it would not normally exist. <b> Oncofetal antigens</b> are
expressed on tumors normally in fetal cells: AFP and CEA are examples.
