Properties of Strong Anion/Cation-Exchange Resins

Note that DOWEX brand resins are cross-linked polystyrene resins with
pH-independent ion-exchange functions attached to them.  Crosslinking
is done by inclusion of divinylbenzene during the polymerization, and
ranges practically from 4-16%.  Cross-linking affects:
-- moisture content:  the more the cross-linking, the lower the
        inherent moisture content, since water gets squeezed out of the
        particle
-- capacity:  the dry volume-basis capacity actually decreases with increases
        in cross-linking percentage, but the wet volume-basis capacity
        actually increases with increased cross-linking.  This has to
        do with the fact that there is an effect of water crowding.
-- exchange kinetics (time to equilibrium):  cross-linking has a major
        effect on how fast the exchange process occurs.  This actually
        has to do with the accessibility of ions to the functional groups
        on the resin.  The more the cross linking, the greater the time
        necessary to reach equilibration.  Plots of %Completion to Equilibrium
        versus log(time) generally show straight lines, and the lines with
        progressively lower slopes have an increased %crosslinking.

Particle size also influences a couple of factors:
-- exchange kinetics:  same as in crosslinking.  The smaller a particle is
        the greater the overall surface area of the column.  This presents
        the mobile ion with greater opportunities to exchange, and so the
        time required to equilibration is shorter.
-- column flow:  large particles create more porous packings, and so flow
        rates are faster, and the method completed, but at the expense of
        not getting efficient exchange however!  Note that plots of the
        log(flow rate) vs. average particle size show a right hyperbola.
        Resistance to flow goes up tremendously when mesh > 100.

Column selectivity is influenced by size of solvated ion and the ability
of the ion to penetrate the resin.

Pore size is a function of:

    (1) total acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomer present (%T)
    (2) relative concentration of crosslinker to total monomers (%C)
    
Increasing %T decreases the pore size in general.  When %C = 5%, the pore
size is about the smallest it can be.  Either reducing or increasing %C
from this 5% value has the effect of INCREASING the pore size.

Serum Protein Electrophoresis
    Standard conditions are use a 0.05 M ionic strength barbital buffer
    at pH 8.6.  Five bands (zones) identifiable: albumin, alpha1, alpha2
    beta, gamma.  A sixth band of beta2 and complement C3 is potentially
    visible in very fresh serum and in a Ca2+-containing buffer.

    Intense staining bands from alpha to gamma region usually monoclonal
    gammopathy.

    The major protein in alpha2 is haptoglobin (HAP), in alpha2 is alpha1-
    antitrypsin (AAT), and in beta transferrin (TRF).  Any change in the
    isoform structure could lead to multiple bands, absent bands, or bands
    with altered mobility.  Interference with the mobility of albumin is
    possible when penicillin or salicylates are present or with high
    bilirubin or fatty acids.  AAT mobility is affected by thiols or
    Bence-Jones proteins.

    Other bands may appear which indicate elevations of proteins not
    normally seen.  AFP often increases 100-fold in tumors and is seen
    as a faint, sharp line between alpha1 and albumin.  Elevations of
    CRP may show as a band in the gamma region, and the lysozyme of a
    monocytic leukemia may be present in the post-gamma region.

    Changes in the ratios of various zones suggest certain pathological
    conditions:

        Nephrotic syndrome
             albumin and gamma with  alpha2.  Usually albumin has to
            fall by a third to be perceivable on the gel

        Acute Phase Reaction
             alpha1 caused by ATT and AAG increases and  alpha2 caused
            by HAP increases.  Increases only in the alpha1 may suggest
            chronic hepatitis or acute phase reactions accompanied by
            hemolysis; also estrogen therapy and pregnancy.

        Vasculitis, immune complex disease
             alpha2 predominates

        Iron deficiency anemia, high estrogen levels
            These conditions cause an  beta1, predominantly due to
            transferrin in the former condition.

        IgA increase secondary to cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis or
        respiratory tract or skin infections
            A bridging of beta and gamma bands suggests IgA increases.

        Immune reactions, chronic inflammatory disease, liver disease,
        disseminated neoplasms
            All these cause an increase in the gamma band relative area.
            Oligoclonals may be seen in chronic viral infections and in
            chronic hepatitis.

        Congenital or acquired immune deficiency
            Absence or decrease in the gamma distribution zone.

Individual Plasma Proteins

    ------------------------------------
    PreAlbumin & Retinol-Binding Protein
    ------------------------------------
    Both these proteins (pre-albumin 54 kDa; RBP, 21 kDa) are made in the
    liver and migrate ahead of albumin.  They don't have long biological
    half lives and are better indicators of protein malnutrition and liver
    function than transferrin or albumin.  Prealbumin is a transport for
    T4 and T3 (it binds T3 better).  RBP binds 1:1 with prealbumin to
    transport vitamin A (retinol).  Inflammation, malignancy, liver cirrhosis,
    and protein-wasting diseases of gut and kidney cause a fall in prealbumin.
    Abnormally high prealbumin can suggest Hodgkin's disease.  Serum RBP
    increases with chronic renal disease, and decreases with liver disease
    or malnutrition.  Since zinc is necessary for RBP synthesis, its
    deficiency can lead to low RBP and low total serum vitamin A.  Both
    pre-albumin and RBP are determined by nephelometry and RID.  The RI
    for adults is 10-40 mg/dl pre-albumin and 3.5-9.0 mg/dl RBP.

    -------
    Albumin
    -------
    Molecular weight is 66,000 with a pI between 4.0 and 5.8.  It has
    net anionic character at pH 7.4 (>200 neg charges per molecule).

    Makes up 40-60% of total plasma protein.  Its synthesis is regulated
    by both protein intake and by an upper plasma level.  Plasma half-life
    is 15-19 d.  Very little is normally excreted; however, an estimated
    glomerular filtration rate of 0.04% of the plasma total can mean
    that 3.6 g/d is excreted, although the observed rate is 0.1 g/d.
    It is likely that proximal tubule cells reabsorb and degrade albumin
    via the lysosome.  Most cells can take up albumin and degrade it to
    its constituent amino acids.

    Albumin can bind a number of substances:  nonpolar cmpds such as
    bilirubin and long-chain fatty acids.  Will also bind T4, T3, cortisol,
    aldosterone.  40% of serum calcium is bound to albumin.  Phenylbutazone,
    warfarin, clofibrate, and salicylate also bind to albumin strongly.

    ------------------------
    Alpha1-Antitrypsin (AAT)
    ------------------------
    MW 55,000 with pI 4.8 and 10-12% carbohydrate.  Makes up 90% of the
    protein in the alpha1 band.  (The other two proteins are AAG
    and alpha1-lipoprotein; these stain lightly because of either
    carbohydrate--in the case of AAG--or lipid interference--in the case
    of the lipoprotein).  AAT inhibits chymotrypsin, kallikrein, renin,
    urokinase, plasmin, and maybe thrombin.  The greatest inhibition is
    of neutrophil elastase and collagenase.  The protein does not inhibit
    well at pH less than neutral.

    The protein shows significant heterogeneity in one individual.  Control
    of buffer pH and type can reveal many bands.  33 allotypes have
    been characterized.  The MM homozygous type is found largely in the
    US (the notation is really Pi^MM--superscripted MM).  The Z and S
    proteins occurr in the following combinations:  ZZ, SS, SZ, MZ, and
    MS (all <1% in US population).  The difference between M, S, and Z
    is one amino acid between each other.  The activity of the phenotypes
    varies as well, the highest being MM (100%).  Relative to MM,
    ZZ is 15%, SS is 60%, MZ is 57.5%, and MS is 80%.  One genotype (Pi^--)
    produces no AAT at all.

    Significance of low AAT:  severe protein-wasting diseases, congenital
    deficiency, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.  Deficiency in
    non-M isotypes can result in early onset pulmonary emphysema.  The
    ZZ phenotype may also cause liver disease and a fatal juvenile cirrhosis,
    as this protein accumulates in the liver for unknown reasons.

    Significance of high AAT:  since the protein is an acute-phase reactant,
    it may indicate a generalized inflammatory condition (bacterial
    infection).

    The protein is no longer measured as a functional assay (elastase
    inhibtion) by nephelometric immunoassay using the anti-M antibody.

    ------------------------------
    Alpha1-Acid Glycoprotein (AAG)
    ------------------------------
    MW ~45,000 with low pI (2.7-3.5).  It is 45% carbohydrate, with
    hexose, hexosamine, and sialic acid functions.  Neuraminidase treatment
    followed by IEF shows polymorphism in the alpha1 region.

    The protein is thought to function in inflammation:  it is an acute-
    phase reactant elevated in infections and the like.  It may also
    serve to inactivate progesterone.  Although the liver is the primary
    organ of synthesis, AAG may be elevated in tumor growth.

    Can be measured by RID and nephelometry.

    ------------------------
    Alpha1-Fetoprotein (AFP)
    ------------------------
    MW 69,000.  It is made in the fetal liver and is the major plasma
    protein by 13 weeks in the fetus.  Maximal level is at 30 weeks and
    then declines.  At birth the level is 1%.  At 18 months and beyond
    the level is <2 ng/ml.  Its function remains unknown.

    AFP can be measured by RIA, EIA, and FPIA.

    -----------------
    Haptoglobin (HAP)
    -----------------
    A set of glycoproteins migrating in the alpha2 region.  Made of two
    pairs of alpha and beta chains linked by -S-S- bonds.  Alpha chains
    are of two types: a1 and a2, and a1 has variants a1F and a1S.  The
    F and S variants indicate 'fast' and 'slow' on gels.

    On electrophoresis three phenotypes are seen:  HAP 1-1 with a1 and b
    chains; HAP 2-1 with a1,a2, and b chains; and HAP 2-2 with only a2
    and b chains.  HAP 2-2 and HAP 2-1 can form oligomers with one another,
    while HAP 1-1 forms no oligomers.  With HAP 2-1, the molecular weight
    is 120,000 but as an oligomer is ~200,000.  HAP 2-2 is 160,000, but
    becomes 400,000 as an oligomer.  HAP 1-1 is about 80 to 85 kDa.  Among
    Europeans, HAP 1-1 is the greatest level, followed by HAP 2-1, then
    HAP 2-2.  Some black and Asian people have no HAP (HAP 0-0), although
    they show no disease states.

    The chief function of haptogloblin is in the binding of free oxy-
    hemoglobin in plasma, with a 2:1 Hb:HAP binding.  The binding is
    irreversible between HAP and the alpha change of Hb A, F, S, and C.
    HAP will not bind methemoglobin, heme, or forms of Hb with the alpha
    chain missing.  HAP therefore serves to prevent loss of Hb and loss
    of iron.  Sudden and severe hemolysis may deplete HAP levels for
    period of time, but levels return after a week.

    Hemopexin is a beta1 globulin (MW 70,000) which can bind free heme if
    it has become separated from the globin.  The complex is absorbed by
    the liver:  the Fe core is then bound to ferritin and the heme portion
    metabolized to bilirubin.

    Normally increases in HAP indicate acute phase reaction, but because
    HAP has a wide reference interval, it is usually necessary to take
    a baseline.  A low HAP may indicate a hemolytic episode or rapid
    hemoglobin turnover (hemolytic anemias, transfusion reactions, malaria).
    A typical hemolysis panel might include HAP, LDH, and plasma Hb levels.

    --------------------------
    Alpha2 Macroglobulin (AMG)
    --------------------------
    Estimated to have a MW of 625,000 to 800,000.  It is not able to pass
    out of the intravascular compartment as other serum proteins can.  It
    is 8% carbohydrate and has a pI 5.4.  Four subunits have been described
    as existing in a dimeric structure.

    It is not altered in acute phase reactions and is therefore not an APR.
    It binds many molecules and substances, particularly endopeptidases
    including carboxyl-, thiol-, serine, and metal-dependent proteases.
    It is therefore thought to be a general protease inhibitor.  Plasmin,
    pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and cathepsin D bind irreversibly.
    It is possible that AMG is important in the immunological and
    inflammatory process.

    It is synthesized in the liver and reticuloendothelial system.  Its
    half life is about 5.5 d, and about 10 min when bound with many
    proteases.

    It has little value clinically.  Elevations may be seen where albumin
    levels have declined (perhaps to compensate for the function of albumin
    to control osmotic pressure).  Increased levels can be observed for
    a variety of other conditions:  liver disease, diabetes mellitus,
    NTDs, atopic dermatitis, and Down's syndrome.

    -------------------
    Ceruloplasmin (CER)
    -------------------
    An alpha2 glycoprotein with MW 120,000-160,000 (probably 134,000).
    Believed to be a single polypeptide bound to 6-7 Cu atoms per molecule.
    Contains 10% carbohydrate being sialic acid.  A pI of 4.4, migrating
    in fast alpha2 region.  Seen in the stained band only when concentration
    is greatly elevated.

    CER has been found to have a oxidase activity towared polyamines and
    polyphenols (originally called copper oxidase).  CER actually catalyzes
    a Fe(II) --> Fe(III) transition, and this step is necessary for iron
    binding to transferrin at the cell surface.  It answers questions as
    to how this reaction occurs without formation of insoluble ferric
    hydroxide and without formation of superoxide or hydroxide radicals
    caused by a Fe(II) auto-oxidation.  CER is not a Cu-transport protein,
    neither losing nor gaining Cu after liver synthesis.  Cells which
    use copper in preparing Cu-dependent enzymes usually have the ability
    to take in CER and digest it to release its Cu atoms.  Monoamine
    oxidase, diamino oxidase, and ascorbate oxidase are Cu-dependent enzymes.

    CER may also have antioxidant activity along with the presence of
    transferrin.  This proteins may control oxygen radical buildup in the
    plasma.

    CER is a late-onset APR.  It may increase with infections, malignancy,
    or trauma.  Hodgkin's disease may elevate CER, and infections or
    obstructions of the biliary tract may likewise.

    The diagnosis of Wilson's disease depends on measuring CER levels:
    CER levels may be low and dialyzable plasma Cu high;  rapid treatment
    with Cu chelators must occur or the result is fatal.  Patients are
    often not diagnosed correctly:  the presentation is often unexplained
    liver disease, large liver and spleen, history of jaundice attacks,
    and signs of unexplained brain damage.  Liver biopsy will show
    excess Cu content. Neurological symptoms are more common in adults,
    liver problems in children.  The disease occurs in 1 in 50,000 to
    100,000 persons and is an autosomal recessive defect in copper
    regulation.  The major disturbances are a gross decrease in rate
    of incorporation of Cu into apoprotein and a reduction in biliary
    excretion of Cu.  Cu can accumulate in all tissues, but causes
    cirrhosis in the liver and damages the basal ganglia in the brain.
    This combination of liver/brain damage is called 'hepatolenticular
    degeneration.'  Deposits in the cornea lead to visualization of
    rings (Kayser-Fleischer rings).  K-F rings, a <10 mg/dl CER, high
    levels of plasma Cu (dialyzable), increased Cu in urine are all
    diagnostic where neurological involvement is seen and in 80% of
    the liver cases.

    ------------------------------
    Transferrin/Siderophilin (TRF)
    ------------------------------
    MW 77,000; a glycoprotein migrating in the beta region.  A single
    polypeptide chain with 6% carbohydrate and a pI between 5.5 and 5.9.
    Polymorphisms have been described.  Reversibly binds numerous
    polycationic metals:  iron, copper, zinc, cobalt, calcium.
    The binding is usually 1:2:1 TRF:Fe(III):X where X is an associated
    anion (typically HCO_3).  The Fe-binding affinity declines with lower
    pH solutions.  The Fe-TRF complex absorbs strongly at 470 nm.

    Synthesized in the liver and in part by the reticuloendothelial system,
    and in the ovaries and testes.  Half-life of 7 d.  Its synthesis is
    regulated by iron levels, and iron deficiency can cause elevated TRF.
    Its principal function is in the transport of iron to storage sites
    in the liver and reticuloendothelial system where it is incorporated\
    into ferritin and hemosiderin and to cell making hemoglobin, myoglobin,
    and cytochromes.

    TRF is elevated in Fe-deficiencies or in hypochromic anemia.  Saturation
    of TRF with Fe will be low.  Anemias due to poor incorporation of
    Fe into erythrocytes will show normal TRF or low TRF with highly
    saturated protein.  With Fe overload, TRF saturation may be exceed
    55% (normally a third is saturated) and may be as high as 90%.

    TRF levels falls in acute phase reactions, accompanied by declines
    in albumin, pre-albumin, beta lipoprotein.  Malnutrition and liver
    disease can reduce TRF levels.

    -------------------------
    Beta2 Microglobulin (BMG)
    -------------------------
    MW 11,800; found on the surfaces of all nucleated cells.  Produced
    by lymphocytes and tumor cells.  This protein is the light (or beta)
    chain of the HLA proteins.  It has no CHO moiety but one single
    -S-S- bond.  The half-life is about 1.5 hours.  It passes into the
    glomerulus but is not excreted but rather reabsorbed by proximal
    tubules and catabolized.

    High plasma levels suggest renal failure, inflammation, or neoplasms,
    particularly B lymphocytes.  The BMG assay is a reliable test also
    of renal tubular function.  Repetitive BMG assays help to monitor
    B cell tumors.  BMG in increased in the CSF in acute leukemia and in
    lymphomas of the CSF.  RIA is the method best used to measure BMG.

    ------------------------
    C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
    ------------------------
    Consists of five identical polypeptide subunits (not glycosylated)
    which form a disc-shaped cyclic polymer having MW 115,000 to 140,000.
    Migrates in the slow gamma to mid beta region, the position depending
    on the concentration of Ca ions in the buffer.  The protein may have
    little to no CHO.  The protein is normally present at 800 æg/dl, which
    is detectable only by sensitive immunochemistry. It is made in the
    liver.

    CRP was first described in 1930 as binding to the C-polysaccharide
    of Streptococcus pnemoniae cell walls, shown to be a protein in 1941.
    CRP is an important acute-phase reactant.  Levels rise particularly
    after myocardial infarction, stress, trauma, infection, inflammation,
    surgery, or neoplastic proliferation.  The level increases in 24-48 h
    and may be 2000-fold the normal.  CRP is normally useful however only
    for screening organic disease, assessing inflammatory conditions such
    as rheumatoid arthritis, checking for systemic lupus erythematosus,
    checking leukemia, or after surgery (when a baseline has been taken).
                                                                      
    -------
    Amyloid
    -------
    A translucent extracellular deposit stained by iodine and various other
    dyes, including and especially Congo Red.  With this dye, an apple-
    green fluorescence is observed under polarized light.  When the dye
    is administered intravenously, it is rapidly removed from the plasma
    and binds to amyloid deposits.

    Amyloid ultrastructurally is a twin fibril molecule showing
    characteristic periodicity and a minor rodlike P component (viewed
    end-on, it is a pentamer with hollow core).  The fibril is beta-pleated
    sheet protein extractable with water but not saline solutions.

CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORSIS NOTES

  Analysis of Inorganic Anions
  ----------------------------
    Using Waters CIA system, the anions are DIRECTLY detected if a Hg
    lamp using its 185 nm line is passed and detected.

    Waters' CIA system is undergoing tests for method validation in

    1) Standard Methods
    2) draft EPA Method 6500 (see Office of Solid Waste method manual
        SW-846, Update IV).
    3) Joint EPA-ASTM D-19 collaborative study for drinking water,
      waste water, and industrial process water analysis.
    Waters indicates change in anion selectivity by altering the following:
    1) OFM solution varied from 1 to 5 mM primarily
    2) electrolyte pH, added complexing agents, electrolyte ionic strength

    Waters' propietary EOF modifiers are:

      1. OFM Anion-BT is 20 mM tetradecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (TTAB)
      2. OFM Hydroxide is 100 mM of TTA as its hydroxide

    Waters says that at little as 100 ppb (S/N=2) using 75 um x 60 cm
    capillary loaded 30 sec by hydrostatic sampling is detectable.  With
    phosphate electrolyte and direct UV @ 185 nm, 200 ppb is detected.
    Cations are detected to 100 ppb with its IonSelect Low Mobility Cation
    Electrolyte.  With electromigration sample of high purity samples, as
    little as 1 ppb can be observed.

    Waters reports a method for INDIRECT detection of anions using the
    following:

    Electrolyte--
      4.7 mM sodium chromate
      4.0 mM TTAH
      10  mM CHES
      0.1 mM calcium gluconate
    System--
      75 um x 60 cm uncoated FS capillary
      15 kV negative power supply  (current starts 14 uA)
      capillary thermostated at 25 deg C
      loading 10 cm for 30 seconds hydrostatic
      read at 254 nm indirect; migration times should be calculated
        as midpoint of peak width; id with reference peak after normalizing
        migration time and time-corrected peak area

    Formate ion can interfere with detection of flouride since their times
    are close; presence of formate common in reagent water.  Add 5 mg/L
    formate to correct id of flouride.  When ions close in migration time
    and differences in concentration are 1:100 (Br to Cl, NO2 & NO3 to SO4),
    resolution may not be possible.

    phosphate appears to interact better with silica
    wall than other anions.  Erythropoietin is separated better in a 
    phosphate than an acetate or sulfate buffer system

  Analysis of Organic Anions
  --------------------------
    Use of phosphate-based electrolytes said to give more symmetrical peaks
    and enhanced resolution, with some loss in sensitivity (detection limit).
    Direct reading at 185 nm gives the better results.  With exception
    of SO4 (sulfate anion), all inorganic anions are active at this wave-
    length.  (Other Hg emission lines include 254, 280, 313, 365, 405,
    436, and 546 nm;  Zn emits at 214 nm;  Cd emits at 229 nm).

  Alkaline and Alkaline Earth Metals
  ----------------------------------
    Mobility of alkaline earth cations is proportional to the inverse
    of their ionic (crystal ion) radius.  The EOF vector is also proportional
    to the inverse of this radius.  Note that Cs(1+) and Rb(1+) cations
    stick tight to the silica wall.  Larger radius cations appear to
    be better at reducing EOF in a system.

    With Waters' CIA system, sub-ppm of ammonium, potassium, calcium,
    sodium, magnesium, and lithium are possible in drinking water to personal
    care products.

  Other Notes
  -----------
    In general, the greater the system electrolyte concentration, the lower
    the EOF.  EOF uniformly increases with increases in the operating
    voltage.  Also as the capillary diameter increases, so does the EOF.
    Note that with increased electrolyte, Joule heating is a possibility,
    and with changes in viscosity (decreased because of heating), EOF
    may rise as well.

    As far as different capillary materials, Pyrex shows a uniformly high
    EOF at all pH.  Fused silica EOF rises with increases in pH.  Teflon
    has a uniformly low EOF at all pH values.

    EOF can be changed by pH and by ionic strength, but it depends on 
    the buffer for the overall effect.  Decreasing the pH of Tris increases
    buffer ionic strength:  since both contribute to reduced EOF, a
    lowering of EOF should be dramatic here.  With borate, reduction in
    pH also lowers ionic strength:  there is no change in EOF therefore
    over a wide pH range.  Beyond its pKa, EOF declines (since the silica
    is largely ionized at high pH already, any increase in ionic strength
    should have strong effect on reducing EOF).  No reduction of EOF
    by reducing pH of NaBorate is seen when NaBorate is titrated with HCl.
    Why?  Because adding HCl to NaBorate increases ionic strength to
    balance the effects of a reduced pH.

    Use of organic solvents generally decreases EOF.  The effect is a result
    of increasing the pKa on the silica wall, requiring higher pH values
    for ionization.  Organic solvents tend to promote environments where
    ionization would be inhibited.  As the carbon number and concentration
    of an alcohol is increased, a uniform lowering of EOF is observed.

    Temperature as a variable has the effect of shortening analyte migration
    time.  It also affects selectivity of some substances.  For example, 
    changes in temperature alter the pKa of Bronsted-Lowry acids (increasing 
    the temp typically reduces the pKa).  Anions would become more ionized
    and cations less ionized.

    1. New EOF modifier (0.1 --> 10 mM)
    2. Use of hydrophobic reagent? (CTA-OH?)
        look at runs 227- using pyromellitate/hexameth/TEA + CTAH (0.2 mM)
        
    3. Increased electrolyte concentration?
    4. Capillary dimensions (longer?, thinner?)
    5. Voltage (15 vs 25, 30 kV)
    6. viscosity reagents:  MC, HPMC, triethanolamine
    7. pH changes -- more acidic pH, differences in acidity of HCl and HI
    8. Conversion of iodide to iodate:  effect of hypochlorite??

Other variables

Trace Enrichment Methods:
    1. Increase background electrolyte (for indirect UV detection)
    2. Decrease voltage to eliminate noise
    3. Use electromigration injection (15 kV 45 s) under isotachophoretic
       conditions (a slow ion like 70 æM octanesulfonate)
    4. Adjust capillary diameter

Sandell-Kolthoff-Warschimk assay (see Berichte der OGKC 8:13-15, 1985)

detection limit: 50 ng KI (?)

Equipment needed:
1. heating block with air/water trap under vacuum
2. colorimeter
3. thermometer
4. 13 x 100 test tubes
5. assorted flasks and bottles

--Stock Solutions--
1. Chloric acid:
   (a) 500 g potassium chlorate (KClO3) dissolved in
       910 ml water in 2 L flask.  Use heat to assist dissolution, this
       could take many hours, and the entire amount may not dissolve.
   (b) Add very slowly, at a rate of 15 ml/min and with constant stirring,
       375 ml of 70% perchloric acid (HClO4).  Store the solution overnight
       in the freezer.  Now filter w/ filter paper on a Buchner funnel.
       The filtrate is ~850 ml in volume.  Store in the refrigerator.

2. 5 N sulfuric acid:
    Add 139 ml concentrated sulfuric acid to ~700 ml water.  When cooled,
    bring up the volume to 1.0 liter.

3. Arsenious acid (H2AsO3):
    To 20 g arsenic oxide (As2O3) and 50 g sodium chloride (NaCl),
    add 400. mL of 5 N sulfuric acid, very slowly.  Add water to ~1. liter.
    Heat this to dissolve it.  Cool, now bring the water to 2.0 L.
    Filter if necessary, and store in a brown glass bottle at room
    temperature.

4. Ceric ammonium sulfate:
    Add 97 ml conc. sulfuric acid to ~800 ml water and let it cool a bit.
    48 g ceric ammonium sulfate (Ce(NH4)2SO4) is now added to this.
    Bring the solution up to 1.0 L with water.  Store in an absolutely
    light-tight bottle at room temp (stable for months).

5. Iodine standard:
    Use potassium iodate (KIO3).  Prepare a 1 ug/ml standard.  Note
    that 1.68 mg KIO3 = 1.0 mg of iodine atom.

--Method--
1. The urine sample is mixed/vortexed to suspend sediment, the 250 ul
    is pipetted to a test tube.
2. For the blanks and standards:  prepare water blank (250 ul water)
    and standards from 0-15 ug/dL.  All volumes must be 250 ul at the
    end.
3. To each tube add 750 ul chloric acid reagent.
4. Cook the tubes in a heating block set @ 110-115 degrees.  A trap should
    be set to collect perchloric acid fumes:  don't let HClO4 collect
    in a fume hood vent, where it precipitates and forms explosive salts!
    Heat the tubes for at least 50-60 min.
5. Let the tubes cool.  Make sure they are very cool or else the reaction
    will proceed too quickly.
6. Add 3.5 ml of the arsenious acid reagent.  Vortex, and let sit 15 min.
6. With a timer in hand, and timing the additions for the time it takes
    to read a tube in the colorimeter and proceed to another tube (about
    20-30 s?), add 350 ul of the ceric ammonium sulfate reagent.
7. Normally you wait 20 minutes to read.  In that interval, make sure the
    colorimeter/spectrophotometer is set 405 nm.

    A method from Waters

    6.77 g hydroxyisobutyric acid (HIBA) into 1 L plastic volumetric with
        500 ml water.
    ~6.4 mL 4-methylbenzylamine (MBA) is added to flask; do this in a hood
        because of the pungency (toxicity?).  Convert this to a weight
        figure if possible.
    After thoroughly mixing, add 5.28 g 18-Crown-6-ether.
    QS to 1 L with water.
    Solution stable for 1 month.

Hemoglobin Variant Analysis:

    CZE system of Bolger et al (1991)

    CIEF (many)
        Ferrenti et al (1991) use coated caps (15 uA constant; 206 nm detect;
            electromigration injection 5-10 s at 8 kV)

        Zhu et al (1991) polyacrylamide-coated caps with 2% ampholytes
            focus at 6 kV with 10 mM phosphoric acid (anod) and 20 mM NaOH
            mobilize at 8 kV with 280 nm detection

        Molteni et al (1994)
            'dynamic CIEF' in 75 um capillary; 10 mM phosphoric acid
             and 0.015% methylcellulose in anode buffer.
             4.5% carrier ampholyte (1:2 mix of 3.5-10 range:6.7-7.7 range)
             neg pressure inject 90 s (~25% column length)
             20 kV focus & mobilize simultaneous.  415 nm detection



Factors affecting EOF--
    Increases EOF or migration time:

    1. increasing [NaOH] in catholyte (major effect)
    2. shorter injection time
    3. lower phosphoric acid concentration
    4. increased ampholytes (give faster migration time)
    5. higher voltages
    6. capillary length change
    7. adjustment to viscosity-altering polymer (the higher concentration
        lowers EOF but improves resolution)

Hb CIEF Results/Notes:

    Tried Thormann group's method without any success.  Parameters altered
    or changed included: %conc of methylcellulose, ampholyte concentration,
    purge method, injection time.  Also three UV wavelengths monitored
    in addition to Hb.
