    <p>
      <b>Isotypes</b>
      . Human Igs injected into a rabbit will provoke formation of anti-human
      Igs in the rabbit. When the human serum is then electrophoretically
      separated and then the gel treated with rabbit antiserum, a number of
      precipitin arcs will form which correspond to a separate distinct Ig
      class. The dominant isotype is IgG, followed by separate arcs of IgM and
      IgA. IgD and Ige are below level of detection. Hence all isotypic
      determinants are shared by all members of a species. Anti-isotypic
      antisera must therefore be raised in another heterologous species.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Allotypes</b>
      . Antigenically distinct antibodies found in some members of a species but
      not all. These are inherited as simple Mendelian traits. A rough analogy
      is the ABO blood group: A-antigens can be present on red blood cells, and
      such individuals have anti-B antibodies. Rabbit IgG molecules exist in two
      allotypes: d11 and d12. Homozygous d11 rabbits (
      <i>d</i>
      11/
      <i>d</i>
      11) produce anti-d12 antibodies when injected with IgG molecules from a
      d12 rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Idiotypes</b>
      . If a rabbit IgG molecule is derivated with DNP or with KLH, the
      resulting different structure implies a different antigenic determinant.
      In allotypically identical rabbits, a second rabbit injected with the
      derivatized IgG, then only the DNP-determinant is foreign to that rabbit.
      Antibodies to that determinant are idiotypic. To test for idiotypic
      antiserum is easy: collect pre-immune serum from rabbit B before
      immunizing with derivatized Ig from rabbit A. There should be no reaction
      with the preimmune sera of iso- and allotypically matched rabbits, but
      precipitation should occur with the immune serum.
    </p>
    <p style="font-variant: small-caps">Cell-Mediated Immunity</p>
    <p>
      Tuberculosis was epidemic in the time of Pasteur and Koch. Koch isolated
      crude extracts of the bacterium causing tuberculosis, calling it
      tuberculin. While it never made a good vaccine, it was useful
      diagnostically: called the Mantoux test, about 0.1 μg of tuberculin or PPD
      (purified protein derivative) is introduced under the skin. If the
      individual has been exposed to the disease, and thereby sensitized, a red,
      slightly swollen lesion firm to the touch appears in about 10 hours and
      reaches a peak in 48-72 h. Because of the long duration in comparison to
      other immune reactions, the response is called
      <b>delayed-type hypersensitivity</b>
      . The lesions are marked cytologically by a large number of lymphocytes
      and macrophages. This DTH immune reaction could not be transferred to
      other individuals by serum alone, despite the presence of antibacterial
      antibodies. Only with the transfer of lymphoid cells is the acquisition of
      DTH possible, called adoptive immunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Transplantation immunity</b>
      . There are basically 4 kinds of grafts in transplantion:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Autografts</b>
        are grafts from one part of the animal's body to another. This grafting
        is seen with coronary bypass surgery and in the skin grafting of burn
        victims.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Isografts</b>
        or
        <b>syngeneic grafts</b>
        are grafts between syngeneic (or genetically identical) individuals.
        Grafts between monozygotic twins are isografts, and are not typically
        rejected. Highly inbred animals are syngeneic and capable of being
        donors for other members of their inbred strain. Syngeneic individuals
        (&gt;98% of loci homozygous) typically emerge after sufficient
        generations of brother-sister matings. Except for differences related to
        sex, the members of highly inbred strains have identical genomes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Allografts</b>
        (also called homografts) are grafts between nonsygeneic members of the
        same species, which means most grafting is of this type. The success of
        the graft depends upon suppression of the immune response responsible
        for detecting self and non-self.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Xenografts</b>
        (also called heterografts) are transplants from one species to another.
        Attempts at rejection of such tissue is generally not any more vigorous
        than that for allografts.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Graft rejection responses are characterized by two phases. In the first
      phase, for example, tissue from a mouse of the CBA strain is transferred
      to a BALB/c mouse. At first the tissue is revascularized, heals well, and
      appears to take. Then after 10-14 days, the graft is infiltrated with
      inflammatory cells and the blood supply breaks down. After a few days, the
      graft shrivels into a scab and is sloughed off. If now a second graft from
      the CBA strain is put on the same “sensitized” individual, the rejection
      is more rapid, called a seoond-set reaction: there is no
      revascularization, and the graft sloughs off in 5-6 days instead. If now a
      graft from a different strain (e.g., C57BL) is placed on the BALB/c mouse,
      the second-set reaction does not occur, but rather the first reaction is
      observed, being necessary to sensitize the animal to the new strain.
      Hence, CMI is specific as well as having memory (according to the
      second-set response).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Transplantation (histocompatibility) antigens (the H-2 locus)</b>
      . When tissues between two members of the same sex of the same highly
      inbred strain are grafted, rejection is not likely to occur. (Because the
      Y chromosome codes for histocompatibility antigens, male-to-female grafts
      are likely to be rejected by females.)
    </p>
    <p>
      When a CBA mouse is crossed to a BALB/c mouse, the offspring can accepts
      grafts from either parent, although neither parent can accept a graft from
      the offspring. The offspring must be heterozygous for histocompatibility
      antigens present homozygously in their parents (highly inbred), so they
      can therefore accept tissues without rejection. If the F
      <sub>1</sub>
      animals are self-bred to produce the F
      <sub>2</sub>
      generation, then what happens when the F
      <sub>2</sub>
      offspring receive grafts from the parents? Assuming a single locus
      histocompatibility gene, then it is expected that 3 out of 4 of the F
      <sub>2</sub>
      generation would accept grafts from either parent. This is because 2 of 4
      will be heterozygous for the locus, another 1 of the 4 will be homozygous
      for the antigen in the tissue, and the last one of the 4 will not be (and
      therefore reject the tissue). If histocompatibility is inherited in two
      (unlinked) loci, then 9 of 16 (or three-fourths-squared) progeny can
      accept from the parental types. This is simply a classical Mendelian
      inheritance calculation. For three unlinked loci, the fraction is 27 of 64
      or (3/4)
      <sup>3</sup>
      . Indeed, where
      <i>n</i>
      is the number of unlinked loci involved in histocompatibility, the
      fraction is (3/4)
      <i><sup>n</sup></i>
      . This technique was used as early as 1916 to estimate the number of
      histocompatibility gene loci in Japanese waltzing mouse, although the
      method used was different: the highly inbred waltzing mouse had an
      epithelial carcinoma which could be transplanted from member to member, so
      when the waltzing mouse was bred to a common mouse to produce F
      <sub>1</sub>
      progeny, which were subsequently self-crossed to produce F
      <sub>2</sub>
      . The F
      <sub>2</sub>
      were challenged with the tumor: only 1.6% died from the tumor, indicating
      that the parental types differed in 14 or 15 histocompatibility loci
      (0.016=(3/4)
      <sup>14.3</sup>
      ). Current analysis indicates that over 30 loci are present. Within each
      locus, several alleles have been identified as well, indicating a great
      complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of
      <b>congenic</b>
      mouse strains has helped a great deal in the understanding of
      histocompatibility and the immune system. To create a congenic mouse
      strain, a highly inbred strain A is bred to a different strain B, and it
      does not matter whether B is inbred or not. The F
      <sub>1</sub>
      offspring should accept grafts from the parent type A, and will accept
      from parent type B if B is inbred. F
      <sub>1</sub>
      progeny are then self-crossed and F
      <sub>2</sub>
      members are challenged with a tumor which grows in and kills members of
      strain A. Most of the F
      <sub>2</sub>
      will survive in this case since they will be homozygous for strain B
      alleles at at least one histocompatibility locus and will therefore reject
      the tumor as foreign. When survivors are backcrossed to parent type A,
      introducing a fresh set of A strain genes. Challenging the resulting
      progeny with the tumor should kill all of them since they have at least
      one histocompatibility allele from the A strain at all loci. Self-crossing
      these progeny with each other produce progeny which are then challenged
      with tumor. The survivors are then back-crossed to strain A, restoring
      homozygosity to all loci being selected for except for one, since there
      had to be one locus from strain B to reject the tumor. If this process is
      repeated 10 times more, mice should have &gt;99% of their genes derived
      from strain A (callec “background genes”). The survivors from the final
      self-cross will be homozygous for one histocompatibility locus derived
      from strain B. Inbreeding these survivors begins the congenic strain.
      Congenic strains are designated by indicating the background strain, then
      a period, then indicating the strain contributing the new locus (e.g.,
      “CBA.B10” is a congener carrying CBA background genes and a homozygous
      locus derived from C57BL/10.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the congenic strains A.B“X,” A.B“Y,” and so forth are now crossed with
      each other, then the offspring challenged with strain-A tumor, if the
      offspring survive, then the congenic strains must share the same locus
      since if they were at different loci, strain A alleles would be at every
      locus in the progeny, resulting in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose grafts are exchanged between two congeners: if accepted, the
      congeners share the same histocompatibility locus. If rejected then the
      alleles at that locus are different.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <img
        src="./imagesImmunologyRefHTML/Mouse_H2_Locus.gif"
        alt="structure of mouse H-2 locus"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Over 30 histocompatibility loci have been identified in mice (designated
      H-1, H-2, etc.). For all but one of the loci, allelic differences result
      in slow rejection of grafts, the process taking 20 to 300 days to
      complete. These loci are called minor histocompatibility loci. Allelic
      differences at one locus, H-2, however, cause rapid rejection (about 11
      days) of the first-set graft. The H-2 “locus” is in fact a set of closely
      linked genes involved in immune phenomena, found on chromosome 17 of the
      20 chromosome haploid set in mice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note in the figure illustrating the H-2 locus that several genes are
      enclosed between the H-2K and H-2D loci, with a region called the “I
      region,” for the
      <i>immune response</i>
      genes. These I region genes are important in induction, regulation and
      expression of a number of immune responses. Because the genes in the H-2
      locus are tightly linked, recombinants in the next generation are rare,
      and the locus tends to be inherited as a single block. The alleles in each
      of H-2 loci corresponding to a partcular mouse strain are denoted by
      lowercase letters. For strain C57BL/10, the allelic designation is
      <i>b</i>
      , for BALB/c the designation is
      <i>d</i>
      (which it shares with strains DBA/2 and NZB) and for CBA the designation
      is
      <i>k</i>
      (which it shares with strain C3H). Hence the haplotype for BALB/c would be
      designated H-2
      <sup>d</sup>
      and that for CBA is H-2
      <sup>k</sup>
      , and more narrowly, H-2D
      <sup>d</sup>
      refers to the allele in BALB/c mouse at the H-2D locus. Where BALB/c and
      CBA are crossed to produce heterozygous hybrids, the F
      <sub>1</sub>
      mouse is designated H-2
      <sup>d/k</sup>
      in its haplotype.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the I region of H-2 are a number of structural genes, called Ia
      (for “I-associated”) genes. These elements encode antigens necessary for
      responses to certain antigens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The products encoded by H-2 classed into three groups: classes I, II, and
      III. Classes I and II encode integral membrane glycoproteins, with class I
      including the H-2K, H-2D, H-2L, Qa and Tla loci. Class II molecules are
      encoded by loci in the I-A and I-E subregions of the I region. Class III
      molecules are encoded in the S subregion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking more closely at the H-2 locus function, the H-2K gene is the only
      functional gene within the K region, encoding one 45 kDa chain of a class
      I antigen expressed in every mouse cell, which associates with a smaller
      12 kDa protein called β
      <sub>2</sub>
      -microglobulin (encoded on another chromosome). The H-2K
      <sup>b</sup>
      allele has been sequenced, showing 346 amino acids in five domains. Three
      of these are extracellular and glycosylated, one spans the membrane, and
      the other is intracellular. It is estimated that the polymorphism for H-2K
      includes 100 alleles; most other structural genes in a species have only a
      few allelic forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The I region is subdivided into an I-A subregion, containing three
      structural genes A
      <sub>β</sub>
      , A
      <sub>α</sub>
      , and E
      <sub>β</sub>
      , which encode single polypeptides used to construct a class II antigen.
      Two kinds of class II antigens are encoded in general, with one controlled
      entirely by genes in the I-A subregion: A
      <sub>β</sub>
      and A
      <sub>α</sub>
      encode a 28 and 32 kDa protein, resp., which form two and one intrachain
      disulfide bonds and then associate (
      <i>cis</i>
      complementation). The E
      <sub>β</sub>
      gene is similar to A
      <sub>β</sub>
      in that it encodes a 28 kDa protein with two intrachain disulfide bonds,
      but to form the class II antigen it associates with the E
      <sub>α</sub>
      , encoding a 32 kDa single intrachain disulfide protein similar to E
      <sub>β</sub>
      , but in a different subregion (I-E). Polymorphism in all chains is
      significant, but especially with the β chains. Note that mice of certain
      haplotypes, e.g. H-2
      <sup>b</sup>
      , do not form E
      <sub>α</sub>
      E
      <sub>β</sub>
      antigens.
    </p>
    <p>
      While class I antigens are found in virtually every cell, class II
      antigens can be found only on immune system cells, primarily B lymphocytes
      and the cells, such as macrophages, that present antigen to lymphocytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The S region encodes the fourth component (C4) of the complement system.
      The D region encodes a class I antigen glycoprotein expressed on most
      cells of the body, and is considerably polymorphic with over 40 alleles
      identified by serotyping (&gt;100 are estimated). The H-2L antigen is also
      found in the D region, distal to the centromere with respect to the H-2D
      locus. Distal to these regions are the Qa and Tla (for
      “thymus-leukemia-antigen”) regions which are among 36 closely related
      genes in the BALB/c mouse. The Qa antigen appears in very low levels on
      lymphocytes, while the Tla antigen has been found in certain leukemic
      cells and on immature T cells in the thymus of certain mouse strains
      (hence the name). The function of these class I (~45 kDa) antigens remains
      unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Adoptive transfer of DTH</b>
      . In analyzing how DTH can be transferred, it is known that sensitizing
      one animal to an antigen causing DTH allows transfer of DTH (by collecting
      the T lymphocytes) to a syngeneic but naive (unsensitized) member.
      Transfer of these T lymphocytes (T
      <sub>D</sub>
      ) to an allogeneic member will not result in DTH transfer since transfer
      also depends upon histocompatibility: subsequent experiments indicate that
      the I region of the H-2 locus are important in recognition of self T
      cells, so sensitized T cells not having the same allelic A
      <sub>α</sub>
      A
      <sub>β</sub>
      or E
      <sub>α</sub>
      E
      <sub>β</sub>
      antigens will be restricted, no matter how useful to the allogeneic
      strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The biological significance of CMI</b>
      . One major function of CMI may be that it controls the presence of
      parasites (including viruses and bacteria) which may live
      <i>within</i>
      cells. While viruses depend upon replicating within cells, some bacteria
      ingested by macrophages survive phagocytic actions and continue to
      replicate inside the cell (mycobacteria,
      <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>
      , and a number of other organisms are capable of this).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The immune system</b>
      . The bone marrow and thymus are critical organs of the system. In 1961,
      researchers working independently discovered that neonatal thymectomy
      resulted in mice resulted in a profound lymphopenia with animals failing
      to reject allografts or develop DTH responses. The animal developed
      humoral immunity to some antigens, but not all. Experiments to be done
      with thymectomized neonates must be done rapidly, since within a few weeks
      they lose weight, suffer from diarrhea, and eventually succumb to a
      “wasting” disease. In germ-free environments, this does not happen. In
      other experiments with lethally irradiated animals, injection of bone
      marrow cells must be accompanied with thymus grafts in order to cause
      development of the proper retinue of lymphocytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thymus is composed of lymphocytes located within a medulla and cortex
      in the young animal. The cells of the cortex are rapidly mitotic and most
      (&gt;97%) eventually die in the cortex. Some cells however, along with
      mature cells in the medulla are immunocompetent, migrating to the
      peripheral lymphoid tissues, and are T lymphocytes able to conduct CMI.
      One useful animal model is the nude mouse, a hairless strain homozygous
      for the recessive gene
      <i>nu</i>
      (a single locus with pleiotropic effects producing the hairless and
      athymic mouse). The
      <i>nu</i>
      gene has been bred into several inbred strains. The thymus produces a two
      hormones, thymosin and thymopoeitin (49 aa long), which have been shown to
      restore cell-mediated immune functions in nude or thymectomized mice.
      Extreme stress, resulting in corticosteroid release, has been shown to
      cause involution of the thymus, sometimes making the organism subject to
      disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lymph nodes serve an important function in filtering materials entering
      the body. The lymphatic vessels and portals are quite large and accomodate
      large particulate matter. The node itself is surrounded by a capsule
      penetrated by several afferent vessels and a single efferent vessel which
      drains into a central duct, all eventually entering the blood stream. From
      the efferent vessel come lymphocytes and antibodies produced by plasma
      cells. Underneath the capsule is a subcapsular sinus which is lined with
      phagocytes used to process material coming in. Below the sinus is the
      cortex, dense with lymphocytes and macrophages organized into spherical
      nests of follicles. When stimulated by antigen, the follicles enlarge, a
      result of intense cell proliferation in the center of the follicle, the
      germinal center. Outside the follicle and the medulla is a paracortical
      area composed of T lymphocytes: thymectomized and nude animals show
      severely depleted paracortical areas. Bursectomized birds have normal
      paracortical areas but show no follicles.

      The spleen is divided into a red pulp and a white pulp. The red pulp is
      largely the result of collection of hemoglobin reclaimed from old red
      blood cells destroyed by the spleen. The white pulp is organized similarly
      to the lymph node, except the spleen filters blood and not lymph. For this
      reason, the spleen is the major organ involved in removing blood-borne
      antigens reaching the circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>T lymphocyte differentiation</b>
      . In mice, T cells express a cell surface protein called Thy-1 (also known
      as theta, Θ). Two allelic forms of Thy-1 antigen have been shown,
      designated Thy-1.1 and -1.2. Thy-1.1 occurs in a few inbred strains (e.g.
      AKR), while Thy-1.2 occurs in the most commonly used inbred strains. The
      difference in the alleles is due to a single amino acid. Treatment of
      mouse lymphocyte suspensions with anti-Thy-1 antibodies and complement
      effectively destroys all T cells present. In the spleen about 2/3 of all T
      cells express a surface antigen called L3T4, while the remaining T cells
      express two other antigens, Ly-2 and Ly-3, but not L3T4. The L3T4
      <sup>+</sup>
      -bearing T cells have been shown to proliferate in response to antigen
      presentation, elicit DTH reactions and help amplify humoral and CMI immune
      responses, while the Ly-2,3
      <sup>+</sup>
      subset of cells have been shown to be involved in cytotoxic activity and
      in suppression of immune reactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ly-1 antigen is expressed in large amounts in L3T4
      <sup>+</sup>
      cells, in lower amounts in Ly-2,3
      <sup>+</sup>
      cells. These differences have been exploited in preparing either L3T4
      <sup>+</sup>
      -rich or Ly-2,3
      <sup>+</sup>
      -rich lymphocyte suspensions: antibodies to Ly-1 plus complement destroy
      the former subset while anti-Ly-2 or anti-Ly-3 are used to destroy the
      latter. (Note that in some nomenclature, Lyt-1, Lyt-2, and Lyt-3 have been
      used to designate these antigens since it has been thought that they
      occurred in T cells, the t in Lyt, only. Ly-1 has been found in B
      lymphocytes, however, so this is incorrect. Ly-2 and -3 occur only in T
      lymphocytes.)
    </p>
    <p>
      During development, precursor T cells in the bone marrow do not express
      Thy-1 or Ly-1. As they migrate to the thymus, they begin to express Ly-1,
      Thy-1 as well as
      <i>both</i>
      L3T4 and Ly-2 &amp; -3, which are mutually exclusive in the mature T cell.
      This immature thymocyte (which is lethally susceptible to corticosteroids
      at this stage of development) also expresses a surface protein called TL
      antigen, for thymus leukemia antigen. This antigen is not present in
      mature T cells but is present in leukemic cells, immature forms of T
      lymphocytes proliferating in disease states. With maturation of the
      thymocyte (there is an increased resistance to the effects of
      corticosteroids), Ly-1 becomes differentially expressed in the cells,
      while the cell shifts either to expressing Ly-2,3 or L3T4. The thymocyte
      then migrates to peripheral lymphoid tissues.
    </p>
    <p>
      In
      <b>humans</b>
      , T lymphocytes differentiate as in mice, but the system of nomenclature
      has been based upon distinguishing cells with monoclonal antibodies to
      antigens. In 1984, a new system involved identifying antigens according to
      a numbered “cluster of differentiation” or CD. Immature human thymocytes
      express an antigen called CD1 in addition to CD4 and CD8. With maturation,
      CD1 expression is lost and differentiate into two nonoverlapping subsets:
      CD4
      <sup>-</sup>
      ,CD8
      <sup>+</sup>
      and CD4
      <sup>+</sup>
      , CD8
      <sup>-</sup>
      . The CD4
      <sup>+</sup>
      subset involves T cells which function in DTH reactions and in
      amplification of the humoral and CMI responses; its counterpart in mice
      appears to bet the L3T4 subset. CD8
      <sup>+</sup>
      cells are involved in cytotoxicity and immune suppression, and are
      equivalent to the Ly-2,3
      <sup>+</sup>
      cells in mice. Of further interest is the fact that mature human T cells
      carry receptors which bind to determinants on the surface of sheep
      erythrocytes (SRBCs), forming a rosette. This has been exploited to enrich
      T cells from other lymphocytes by taking advantage of the increased
      density of the rosette.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important antigen in human T cells is CD3, which is expressed at the
      time when the T cell expresses its specific antigen receptor. Expression
      of CD3 is indicative of acquisition of immune competence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>B lymphocyte differentiation</b>
      . Pre-B cells in the marrow are distinguished by the presence of large
      amounts of IgM heavy chains (the protein μ) in the cytoplasm. B cells are
      fully mature before leaving the marrow. In the maturation process, surface
      immunoglobulins consists of monomers of IgM (H
      <sub>2</sub>
      L
      <sub>2</sub>
      ). IgD molecules later appear as well. B cells also express on their
      surface receptors for the F
      <sub>c</sub>
      portion of IgG antibodies and for the activated form (C3b) of the third
      component of complement. When SRBCs are coated with anti-SRBC of the IgG
      class, they form rosettes with B lymphocytes (called the EA rosette; the T
      lymphocyte is called the E rosette). When SRBCs are coated with nonlysing
      concentrations of complement and anti-SRBCs, the rosette formed (called
      the EAC rosette) is a result of B lymphocyte C3b receptors combining with
      C3b.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mitogenic reactions</b>
      . Several substances have been shown to induce mitotic activity in resting
      lymphocytes. Such lymphocytes increase in volume and fill with ribosomes,
      becoming lymphoblasts. Plant lectins such as phytohemagglutinin (PHA) from
      the red kidney bean bind to both B and T cells, but only mature T cells
      are stimulated into mitotic activity. Concanavalin A from the jack bean
      has a strong mitogenic effect on both mature and immature T cells.
      Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in gram-negative bacteria are strongly mitogenic
      for many B cells in mice, but not in humans. LPS has no effect on T cells
      in either species. Human B cells will respond to a mitogen present in
      pokeweed (
      <i>Phytolacca americana</i>
      ), known as pokeweed mitogen (PWM).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is some data that lymphocytes are quite long-lived, with an average
      4-year life span. In that time, they traffic throughout the body. Their
      course may start in the lymph node. Once in the extracirculatory tissue of
      the node (or other peripheral lymphoid tissue), they may stay or leave via
      the efferent ducts into the central lymphatic ducts. The splenic
      lymphocytes in large part do not exit through lymph in this organ,
      preferring to leave via this organ's venules.. Those travelling through
      the lymph re-enter the blood stream in the subclavian vein, remaining in
      the circulation until coming to a site where they specifically can exit
      the bloodstream. This site is in the postcapillary venule, where
      endothelial cells forming the venule provide the signal for these
      lymphocytes to exit. The impetus to exit at any given site may be
      influenced by localized diseased states; so the signals sent by venule
      endothelium in large part may direct immune cells to where they are
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Other cells</b>
      . Macrophages and neutrophils are the major phagocytic cells in the immune
      system. Macrophages differentiate from monocytes into intensely phagocytic
      cells, using lysosomal fusion to fill the phagocytic vacuoles with various
      hydrolases. Foreign particles coated with antibodies or complement bind to
      the surface of macrophages, which carry the F
      <sub>c</sub>
      and C3b receptors as do B cells (EA and EAC rosetting is possible in
      macrophages, but the rosettes are engulfed by the phagocyte). Macrophages
      also express Ia
      <sup>+</sup>
      antigens, whose function is involved in stimulating other immune cells by
      presentation of the antigen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another population of immune cells are dendritic cells (called Langerhans
      cells in the skin). 1% of cells in spleen and lymph nodes are dendritic.
      These cells express Ia antigen and appear to be involved in eliciting
      cytotoxic and DTH responses (such as in the contact sensitivity of the
      antigen in poison ivy).

    <p>MAJOR ADVANTAGES</p>
    <p>Single homogeneous antibody to a defined antigenic determinant.</p>
    <p>Specific antibody can be used to study functional domain of molecule.</p>
    <p>
      Large quantities of antibody can be obtained since immortal cell lines can

      chromatography).
    </p>
    <p>MAJOR DISADVANTAGES</p>
    <p>Procedure is expensive and time-consuming.</p>
    <p>Well-equipped cell culture facilities required.</p>
    <p>
      The epitope recognized by the antibody may be shared among many different
      antigens not related to antigen of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hybridoma cell lines are frequently unstable because of chromosomal
      abnormalities developing during propagation or lines may be lost due to
      culture contamination.
    </p>
    <p class="1stP">
      It is necessary to screen antibodies on a large scale. In general, ELISAs
      and dot-blot immunoassays are used. Western blotting can also be used to
      define the presence of antibodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ELISA procedure.</b>
      Selection of microtiter plates is necessary since the antigen must be able
      to bind to plastic and be read well in a plate spectrophotometer.
      Round-bottom plates such as the Dynatech Immunlon #2 work well. The choice
      of pH, buffer, and antigen concentration for antigen binding plates will
      need to be tested. Depending upon antigen purity and nature, anywhere from
      0.1 to 10 μg/ml is a good concentration range. A basic buffer works for
      most coating operations (e.g. 0.1 M sodium carbonate, pH ~9.6). In a
      typical system, 50 μl of 1 ng/μl antigen is placed in coating buffer and
      incubated 6 hr at RT or ON at 4° and placed on a plate mixer. Plates are
      washed with assay/binding buffer of 20 mM PBS, pH 7.3, with 0.15 M NaCl +
      0.05% Tween-20. For blocking nonspecific sites, a similar buffer (pH 8.0)
      with 2% powdered milk can be used (4°/ON/with shaking). For detection of

      Development of a simplified method for subclass isotyping and screening

    <p class="1stP">
      Commercial isotyping kits employing ELISA-based methods are available, but
      require use of large amounts of antigen and antibody, which also leads to
      reproducibility difficulties. MAb screening typically uses ELISA,
      immunofluorescence tests, and dot-blots. The first two require large
      amounts of antigen and antibody, and immunofluorescence is expensive.
      Dot-blotting using commercial filtration apparatus is inexpensive but
      complicated. A simplified dot-blot method is described.

      <b>Method</b>
      . A pre-flamed 18-gauge needle is used to 104 small (8 x 13 holes) in the
      plastic cover (11 x 8 cm) of a pipet tip rack. This template is placed
      over a sheet of nitrocellulose and small holes are made in the NC with the
      needle. 1 μL volume of antigen is applied to each hole, the NC is
      air-dried, blocked with 10% nonfat milk, rinsed with water and placed
      between two filter paper sheets to remove excess liquid. Then 1 μL
      hybridoma supernatant is applied to different holes on the moist NC

      humidified chamber for 1 h then washed three times with 10 mM Tris, pH
      8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). MAb screening is done with

      Cells of immune system derived from undifferentiated cells in bone marrow.
      <i>Mononuclear</i>
      cells derive from the immature forms and show uniformly rounded or
      kidney-shaped nuclei, and they include
      <b>lymphocytes</b>
      and
      <b>monocytes</b>
      .
      <i>Polymorphonuclear</i>
      cells have segmented nuclei with a variable number of connected lobes and
      include the
      <i>granulocytes</i>
      <b>neutrophils</b>
      ,
      <b>basophils</b>
      , and
      <b>eosinophils</b>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Lymphocytes. Central to immune response. 6-15 μm in diameter. Nucleus
      encompasses most of cell volume, which is a distinguishing feature. These
      cells make up 20-50% of the WBCs in an adult peripheral blood smear.
    </p>
    <p>
      B lymphocytes comprise 10-20% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Maturation
      of B lymphocytes occurs in the Bursa of Fabricius in birds, but the site
      is unknown in humans. When activated by antigen presence, B lymphocytes
      differentiate into
      <i>plasma cells</i>
      , which have an oval shape, containing a round, eccentrically placed
      nucleus, and intense blue cytoplasm with Wright-Giemsa staining (most
      lymphocytes show pale blue cytoplasm). Plasma cells are rare in the blood,
      and usually locate to lymph nodes, spleen, and other sites of immune
      activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      T lymphocytes are 60-80% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. They are known
      to mature in the thymus, then circulate to the lymphoid organs. When
      activated these cells produce a number of lymphokines which regulate the
      immune response. There are many subpopulations of T cells:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        T
        <sub>h</sub>
        or T helper cells that are used in mediating the activation of B cells
        to produce antibody and to direct other T cells involved with
        cell-mediated immunity. These cells produce a marker called CD4, and are
        termed as such.
      </li>
      <li>
        T
        <sub>s</sub>
        or T suppressor cells which suppresses both humoral and cell-mediated
        immune activities. These cells produce a CD8 marker. There is some
        controversy as to whether they are a separate population of T cells.
      </li>
      <li>
        T inducer cells, which apparently induce the generation of mature T
        suppressor cells (CD4-positive).
      </li>
      <li>
        T
        <sub>cx</sub>
        or cytotoxic T cells, which play a role in immunity toward
        viral-infected and tumor cells, and are responsible for graft tissue
        rejection. These cells are mostly CD8-positive.
      </li>
      <li>
        T
        <sub>d</sub>
        or delayed-type hypersensitivity T cells, secreting lymphokines which
        direct an inflammatory response to bacteria, fungi, parasites, and in
        delayed allergic reactions These cells are CD4-positive.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <i>Natural killer</i>
      (NK) cells are large, granular lymphocytes which seem to be involved with
      the rapid lysis of viral-infected cells and tumor tissue, as well as
      involved with graft rejection. They are about 3% of peripheral blood
      lymphocytes, and they are distinguished from T and B cells because they
      lack the traditional markers (also called null cells sometimes for that
      reason).
    </p>
    <p>
      Monocytes are about 3-10% of the leukocytes in peripheral blood, with a
      large diameter (14-21 μm) and are marked with an indented bilobed nucleus
      and dull blue cytoplasm with occasional dense azurophilic granules and
      vacuoles in stained preps. The nucleus and cytoplasm occupy a 1:1 ratio.
      These cells differentiate into macrophages after leaving the bone marrow
      to reside in lymphoid tissue. Their chief function is as a phagocytic cell
      to remove all sorts of foreign invasions or detritus. They also secrete
      soluble factors (monokines) which stimulate the immune response. They are
      the main antigen-processing and -presenting cells, working intimately with
      T cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neutrophils make up the largest proportion (40-75%) of circulating
      leukocytes. They are 10-12 μm in diameter, with segmented nuclei having
      2-5 lobes connected by thin nuclear filaments. They stain a faint pink in
      Wright-Giemsa, with abundant azurophilic granules. They are one of the
      first lines of defense in nonspecific immune responses and are the major
      cell type in early acute inflammation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eosinophils are 1-5% and about the same size as neutrophils when mature.
      They have segmented nuclei, but are usually only bilobed. In Wright-Giemsa
      stain large orange-red granules are prominent features. These cells play a
      role in defense against parasites and in modulating the inflammatory
      response. Their numbers are elevated in persons with parasitic infections
      of with Type I allergic responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basophils are 0-2% of circulating WBCs with 8-10 μ diameter. The nucleus
      is segmented with between 2-4 lobes. Large bluish-black granules are found
      in the cytoplasm. Mast cells are similar in appearance to basophils, and
      both are involved in release of granular substances to promote
      inflammation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bone marrow is the site for cells to decide whether they will commit
      to form RBCs, platelets, monocytes, PMNs, or lymphocytes. Those that are
      lymphocytes will migrate then to primary lymphoid organs, either the
      thymus (for T lymphocytes) or the equivalent of the Bursa of Fabricius
      (for B cells). The thymus is known to be regulated by several hormones,
      thymosin and thymopoietin, and these control development of T cell
      maturation. As T cells mature, they proceed from the cortex of the thymus
      to its medulla. As for B cell maturation, it has been hypothesized that it
      occurs either in the liver or yolk sac of fetal life in humans (the Bursa
      of Fabricius is located in the terminal end of the gut in birds). From
      primary lymphoid tissue, these cells then migrate to secondary lymphoid
      tissue, namely the lymph nodes or spleen or other such organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spleen is an organ with many duties, removing effete cells from the
      blood, converting hemoglobin to bilirubin, and a repository for
      lymphocytes. The red pulp of the spleen contains erythocytes and
      macrophages (hence this area removes old RBCs and collects the iron). The
      white pulp is the center for immune activity, containing nodules called
      <i>follicles</i>
      , which are
      <i>primary follicles</i>
      representing resting B cell centers or
      <i>secondary follicles</i>
      representing activated B cell centers (
      <i>germinal centers</i>
      ). Activated B cells, besides some of them differentiating into plasma
      cells for antibody production, also rapidly divide so that some can serve
      as memory cells. In the periarterial sheath regions surrounding the
      follicles are abundances of T cells. The white pulp makes up 20% of the
      spleen by weight, but when infections are persistent and major, it can
      take up 50% of the spleen, resulting in splenomegaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lymph nodes serve as filters of lymph (extracellular fluid) and are
      significant repositories of lymphocytes. (The spleen can be considered one
      big lymph node for the blood.) Just underneath the capsule in the cortex,
      containing macrophages and B cells clustered into primary (resting) and
      secondary (activated) follicles. T lymphocytes are organized in the
      medulla and in the paracortical region within the cortex. Enlargements of
      nodes are often seen with infections or inflammation.

    <p>The Inflammatory Response</p>
    <p>Characterized by five classical signs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Redness</li>
      <li>Swelling</li>
      <li>Heat</li>
      <li>Pain</li>
      <li>Loss of function.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Involves two phases:</p>
    <p>
      <b>Vascular phase</b>
      . Initiated soon after injury. Mast cells and basophils migrate to injury
      site and release mediators like histamine; platelets also collect,
      releasing serotonin. The reaction occurs within minutes, these mediators
      well-known as vasodilators. Increase of blood flow to the injury site is
      necessary preparation to direct blood flow (and therefore direct other
      circulating defensive cells) to the site of injury. Other products which
      cause persistent vasodilation but are released usually hours later (6-12
      hours later) for a long-term vasodilation are complement C3a, C4a, and
      C5a, kinin (bradykinin), and coagulation products (fibrin split products).
      Prostaglandins/leukotrienes and products from bacteria, neutrophils, and
      other cells will prolong this vascular phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Cellular phase</b>
      . The purpose of the vascular phase is to prepare for the cellular phase.
      Red blood cells will form stacks (rouleaux) in the center of affected
      vessels, and WBCs are pushed to the periphery (margination). PMNs
      generally attach to the endothelium (pavementing), then move through the
      wall via fenestrations (diapedesis). They move to the injury site
      chemotactically. Neutrophils are the first present, moving to the site
      within 30-60 minutes. The phagocytize infectious organisms, cell debris,
      and immune complexes. They also release lysosomal contents extracellularly
      which can damage tissue and lead to pus formation. Eosinophils are seen to
      participate as well, involved in phagocytosis but dampening the effects of
      released inflammatory proteins. Macrophages follow the granulocytes,
      chemotactically led by bacterial products, by complement C5a, or by
      lymphokines. These cells move slower, beginning migration 4-5 h after
      injury and reaching a peak between 12-48 h. Like neutrophils, they also
      are involved with phagocytosis and clean-up of debris. Inflammation in a
      <i>subacute</i>
      stage may persist with a greater infiltration of macophages, eosinophils,
      and proliferating fibroblasts. Failure to resolve both acute and subacute
      inflammation leads to chronic stage inflammation, with activation of
      immune systems. Lymphocytes and plasma cells will be evident at the injury
      site, and scarring with loss of function is a likely result.
    </p>
    <p>Other Notes. Roles for Ig molecules.</p>
    <p>
      Complement can be activated by immune complexes in the classical pathway
      of activation. This not only serves to lyse organisms, but also to enhance
      inflammatory response. The initial step is the binding of C1q to the F��
      <sub>c</sub>
      portion of two adjacent IgG molecules which are both antigen-bound. The
      “antigen” of this sort is likely the wall of an organism in order to
      create the stereochemical arrangment for complement to bind. Complement
      binds to the C��
      <sub>H2</sub>
      region, best to IgG
      <sub>3</sub>
      , then followed by IgG
      <sub>1</sub>
      and IgG
      <sub>2</sub>
      . It does not bind to IgG
      <sub>4</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      The F
      <sub>c</sub>
      portion of antibodies has a receptor on phagocytic cells like macrophages
      and PMNs, which bind when the IgG molecule is bound to antigen, hence
      increasing phagocytic efficiency. This process is called opsonization. IgG
      <sub>1</sub>
      and IgG
      <sub>3</sub>
      are the subclasses mediating this response. C3b bound to immune complexes
      also serves an opsonization role.
    </p>
    <p>
      Binding of immune complexes to macrophages or NK cells usually prompts
      release of granular substances from these cells, the purpose of which is
      to destroy the antigen, hence another role for Ig molecules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ig molecules binding to a toxin often negate the action or pathologic
      effect of the toxin. In a similar way, antibodies “neutralize” viruses by
      binding a molecule on the viral surface which is essential for viral entry
      to a target cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      All subclasses of IgG can cross the placenta, with IgG
      <sub>2</sub>
      being least efficient of all subclasses. This provides immunity to the
      newborn for at least 6 months until the infant's own immune system takes
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>IgM structure</b>
      . Basically a pentamer of the IgG structure, but an extra C
      <sub>H4</sub>
      domain is present in the carboxyl terminal of the heavy chain (a μ chain).
      There are two subclasses, IgM
      <sub>1</sub>
      and IgM
      <sub>2</sub>
      . All subunits connected by a J chain. Very sensitive to structural
      changes by 2-mercaptoethanol treatment. It is more efficient at binding
      complement because of number of Fc portions. Also involved in antibody
      neutralization. Very efficient in agglutination reaction because of
      theoretically 10 binding sites (in reality, the molecule is pentavalent,
      presumably because of steric hindrance). IgM molecules are “early”
      antibodies, produced first after antigen exposure and the first seen in
      infants during their immune system development. Indeed IgM is useful
      indicator of infant immune system function since all IgM present in an
      infant is self-produced (it does not cross the placenta).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>IgA structure</b>
      . About 170 kDa, its heavy chains being α chains. It is the “secretory”
      Ig, present in saliva, tears, sweat, breast milk, and in most secretions.
      It is perhaps a first guard in preventing binding of antigens to mucous
      membranes and portals of entry. It is generally secreted as a dimer joined
      by a J chain, and containing a
      <i>T</i>
      (
      <i>transport</i>
      )
      <i>piece</i>
      or
      <i>secretory component</i>
      , which is thought to protect the IgA from proteolytic destruction. Two
      subclasses are known, with IgA
      <sub>2</sub>
      the predominant one. Also the light chains of this molecule are linked
      together by disulfide bonds rather than the heavy chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>IgD</b>
      . Having the same weight as IgG, the heavy chains are δ chains. It
      circulates at 3-5 mg/dl in the blood and its function is still unknown. It
      has been found on the surface of B cells as an antigen receptor, but all
      Ig classes do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>IgE</b>
      . About 200 kDa is size with ε heavy chains. It makes up only 0.004% of
      total circulating Ig classes (17-450 ng ml
      <sup>-1</sup>
      ), being the lowest. The ε chain also contains a C
      <sub>H4</sub>
      region as does the μ chain, this region able to bind to F
      <sub>c</sub>
      receptors on mast cells and basophils and mediating Type I allergic
      responses. It is thought to play a role in parasitic defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stem cells are thought capable of producing 1 to 100 million types of
      antibody molecules. Heavy chain genes are coded on chromosome 14. The
      coding for the chain involves three sets of genes: (1) 500-1000
      <i>variable</i>
      (Vh) genes; (2) about 5
      <i>diversity</i>
      (D) genes and 5
      <i>joining</i>
      (J) genes; and (3) a separate set of constant (C) genes for the constant
      regions. As B cells mature, DNA is known to be excised from these parts of
      the chromosome by recombination mechanisms. In addition, final processing
      occurs as a result of RNA splicing to produce the proper message.
      Recombination events are as follows: (i) a D gene is selected to join with
      a J gene to form a DJ juxtaposition; (ii) a Vh gene then joins a DJ
      combination to form VhDJ; (iii) a C
      <sub>μ</sub>
      is then joined to form a VhDJC
      <sub>μ</sub>
      gene construction in that order. This should then code for the heavy chain
      to be inserted into an IgM molecule. A B cell may express the VhDJC
      <sub>μ</sub>
      gene sequence prior to activation, after which it may undergo “class
      switching” which usually involves rearrangement of coding sequences to
      form a VhDJC
      <sub>γ</sub>
      sequence to produce IgGs. The VhDJ sequence will however remain the same,
      as this set of coding sequences provide specificity for antigen
      recognition. These rearrangements have diagnostic signficance for B cell
      malignancies and can be examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light chains are similarly structured at the chromsomal level as are heavy
      chains, except the D (diversity) set is not found. Kappa light chains are
      coded on chromosome 2 and the sets are ordered Vκ, J, and Cκ. Lambda light
      chains are produced on chromosome 22 and ordered with one Vλ, one J, and
      one Cλ.
    </p>
    <p>
      B cells express a surface Ig molecule (sIg) prior to activation when
      antigen binds. B cells can produce secretable Ig molecules with or without
      the aid of T cells. In a T cell-independent antibody response, a
      polyvalent antigen (large antigen with repeat subunits) is usually
      required. A “cross-linking” of sIg molecules then leads to a “patching”
      and then a “capping” (collection of sIg to one part of the surface in high
      density), followed by internalization. This apparently serves as a
      mitogenic signal, causing proliferation of the single cell clone. A large
      number of cells then differentiate to plasma cells (which lack sIg) and
      which secrete IgM molecules.
    </p>
    <p>
      The T cell-dependent antibody response is more typical. In this process, a
      macrophage engulfs the antigen and then breaks it down partially. The
      parts are then meshed with HLA-D (Ia) gene products (the MHC
      <sub>2</sub>
      class equivalent in mouse) and presented as a whole to T lymphocytes,
      namely T helpers. A T cell receptor is an Ig-like glycoprotein molecule
      also associated with a protein called CD3. The T cell receptor is is dimer
      of a 49 kDa α chain cross-linked to 43 kDa β chain, much like the heavy
      and light chains on circulating Igs. However, these chains are coded by V,
      D, J, and C genes on chromosomes 7 and 14, resp. Binding to antigen
      presented by macrophage plus secretion of IL-1 by the macrophage is
      required for activation of a T helper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activated T helpers will in turn produce IL-2 and other lymphokines. They
      will also express IL-2 receptors and surface Ia molecules. Autocrine
      binding of IL-2 to T helper IL-2R will stimulate proliferation of the T
      helper, producing more clones.
    </p>
    <p>
      B cell activation occurs either by direct antigen binding or by
      presentation of antigen from macrophages, T helpers, or other B cells.
      Proliferation of B cells is stimulated under the influence of IL-4 and
      IL-5 released by activated T helpers. Differentiation of B cells to plasma
      cells and secretion of Ig molecules appears to be directed by IL-5 and
      IL-6.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some activated B cells will remain as “memory” cells in the event of
      subsequent antigen exposure. Primary exposure to antigen is reflected in a
      long lag time until antibodies are produced in quantity (IgM peaks first,
      followed by IgG). The primary lag is 3-4 days. Production of IgG may
      follow initial IgM production 1-2 weeks after antigen exposure, peak in a
      few weeks, then fall over the next few months. With secondary antigen
      exposure, the IgM response follows the same time frame as in the primary
      response, but IgG is produced in much higher levels and decreases only
      after a very long time, often over several years. The antibodies also have
      a higher binding affinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diagnostically this time frame is of value. As IgM is an early antibody,
      detection of its presence may indicate ongoing infection (as with
      hepatitis A virus). IgG detection indicates either current or past
      exposure, although high IgG titers over normal often suggest ongoing
      antigen exposure (continued infection). Often tests which rely on
      detection of a disease through presence of the antibody yield false
      negative results if the measure is taken too early. Therefore it is often
      necessary to re-test a few weeks later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cell-mediate immunity by T
      <sub>cx</sub>
      cells is similarly mediated by presentation of antigen to T helpers and
      release of lymphokines by T
      <sub>h</sub>
      cells. T
      <sub>cx</sub>
      maturation/activation proceeds under the stimulation of IL-2 secreted by T
      <sub>h</sub>
      cells. When activated T
      <sub>cx</sub>
      bind to antigen via their receptors, there may be a simultaneous binding
      of CD8 (associated with the T
      <sub>cx</sub>
      receptor) to a class I HLA on the target cell. In some rare cases, CD4+ T
      <sub>cx</sub>
      cells appear to bind to class II HLA molecules on a target cell. In such
      instances, T
      <sub>cx</sub>
      then begin a massive exocytic release (in the region where binding is
      occurring) of cytolytic proteins: perforin, lymphtoxins, serine-type
      proteases.
    </p>
    <p>
      NK cell action proceeds similarly to T
      <sub>cx</sub>
      action except that prior antigenic sensitization (activation) is not
      required. Binding of the NK cell occurs on the target by an unknown
      mechanism and the same cytolytic factors are released. Another kind of
      killer cell has been identified in experiments of peripheral blood
      lymphocytes mixed with IL-2, called a lymphokine-activated killer or LAK
      cell. It has a higher cytotoxic capability, lysing freshly derived tumor
      cells (NKs only lyse such cells which have been passed repeatedly in in
      vitro cultures).
    </p>
    <p>
      Deficiencies in any part of the immune system produce disease, often
      special syndromes. B cell deficiences are seen in Bruton's congenital
      hypogammaglobulinemian, in selective IgA deficiency, and in transient
      hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy. T cell deficiencies are responsible for
      DiGeorge's syndrome and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Complex
      deficiencies of both B and T cells are seen in AIDS, severe combined
      immunodeficiency disease (SCID), ataxia telangiectasia, Nezelof's
      syndrome, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Phagocytic cell deficiencies can
      produce chronic granulomatous disease, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Job's
      syndrome, and myeloperoxidase deficiency. Disorders in complement
      (deficiencies in C3 and C8) may be seen in hereditary angioedema.

      <i>Monoclonal antibodies production</i>
      . Briefly summarized, the method requires mice and facilities for raising
      them; tissue culture facilities (sterile hood, standard cell culture
      quality buffers and water, humidified and atmosphere-controlled
      incubators, plastic and/or glass containers); a special myeloma cell line
      which is unable to express hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
      (HGPRT); materials to prepare medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin,
      and thymidine (HAT medium).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mice are immunized with the antigen of interest, i.e., the antigen for
      which MAbs are to be produced. The schedule of immunization depends on the
      type of antigen and perhaps the mouse strain used. Production of antibody
      may potentially be measured from the serum prior to attempting the rest of
      the procedure, in order to assure decent titers; immunity may occur in
      several days. The immunized mouse or mice are sacrificed and the spleen
      removed to sterile facilities. The spleen is minced and digested so as to
      produce single cell suspensions. This should include a large number of
      lymphocytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either immediately or after a brief period, cells are mixed with myeloma
      cells in the presence of a cell-fusing substance. This may be a virus
      (Sendai virus) or a chemical known to cause such fusion (PEG). Microscopic
      inspection should reveal the extent and efficiency of the fusion process.
      Cells with two nuclei which do not appear identical are heterokaryons;
      these will fuse to form synkaryons which hold the genomic information of
      the myeloma and lymphocyte (or other cell). Some of these will form stable
      hybrids capable of growing in culture. (Perhaps the use of mitogen or cell
      signalling reagent could induce more stable cells to form?) Generally 1
      hybrid in 200,000 spleen cells will form, which is about 300 to 500
      hybrids in a spleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selection of stable hybrids then begins with culture in HAT medium. The
      myeloma cell line is deficient in HGPRT, which is an enzyme part of the
      purine rescue pathway converting . The presence of aminopterin poisons
      enzymes that depend on dihydrofolates for their catalysis. This chiefly
      involves certain enzymes involved in the de novo synthesis of nucleotides
      for nucleic acids. If cells are supplied with certain precursors of
      pyrimidines and purines, they can make use of rescue pathways that exist
      to produce the necessary nucleotides for growth. Hypoxanthine can be
      converted to guanine by HGPRT, with guanine also convertable to adenine;
      thymidine can be incorporated and converted to thymidylates and
      cytidylates for growth. Any enzyme deficiency of the rescue pathways makes
      this impossible. Since lymphocytes carry all enzymes of the rescue
      pathway, fusion would enable myelocytes to grow in the hybrid. Myelocytes
      which do not fuse will not grow and eventually die unless placed in
      supportive medium. Lymphocytes which do not fuse will also die anyway
      since lymphocytes can not be cultured over several generations without
      being stably transformed. The stable transformation will occur as a result
      of the fusion. Therefore the medium should support only the hybrid cells,
      or hybridomas. At any rate, the hybrids will grow rapidly and “push out”
      any slower growing lymphocytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hybrid cells are then eventually selected for production of the desired
      MAb using a process of dilution and assay to screen for the antibody. Use
      of a fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) is likely to make screening
      rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the desired hybrid clone has been selected and purified to single
      cell providing a single clone, the antibody class and its avidity for the
      antigen needs to be assessed. A number of immunological/serological
      methods should be used to assess what the antibody can do. MAb can be
      purified on chromatography media. Cell supernatants can serve as a source
      of antibody, although greater amounts of antibody are produced from mouse
      ascites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Immunoprecipitation</i>
      . Antibody-antigen interactions which lead to the formation of insoluble
      precipitates are a feature of such reactions. Normally the antigen and
      antibody best precipitate when the antigen is polyvalent and the
      antibodies present are a mixture capable reacting with the different
      epitopes on the antigen (hence the population of antibodies is polyclonal)
      as is certainly true for antiserum. The ideal ratio of antigen to antibody
      for producing precipitation is about 1:1. This has been learned by varying
      amounts of antigen while keeping antibody constant (alpha method) and by
      varying antibody while keeping antigen constant (beta method). Gel
      diffusion methods wherein antibody and antigen are added to cut wells and
      allowed to diffuse allow definition of the regions of antigen excess
      (pre-zone or post-zone) and antibody excess (pro-zone) wherein
      precipitation is not possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest immunoprecipitation is solution methods, wherein antibody and
      antigen are mixed in a tube to produce a usually visible precipitate which
      falls out of solution. Use of gels to follow precipitation dates to the
      work of Oudin (1946). Agar, agarose, and polyacrylamide are media of
      choice, although starch, cellulose acetate, and other polymers are used or
      have been used. The Oudin technique specifically is a tube test in which a
      solution containing presumptive antigen is overlaid on a gel in which
      antibody is contained throughout. Precipitin bands are seen to form as the
      antigen diffuses into the gel: these zones correspond to equivalence
      zones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Single immunodiffusion of the Oudin kind is also done two-dimensionally,
      as a
      <i>radial immunodiffusion</i>
      test. One of two methods of radial immunodiffusion in lab practice is the
      Fahey-McKelvey method in which antigen is placed in wells of a gel
      containing antibody. The
      <i>rate of</i>
      the diffusion of antigen is proportional to its concentration in the
      solution. As antigen diffuses, the zone of equivalence is apparent as a
      ring in the gel outwardly expanding from the center of the well. Since a
      rate is determined, the method is timed and the diameter of the ring
      plotted logarithmically against concentration. A set of standards is
      usually necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mancini method has demonstrated that the area of the precipitin ring
      is directly proportionally to antigen concentration, and since the area is
      a geometric relation to the diamter of the ring, it is shown that antigen
      concentration is proportional to the diameter of the ring. With this
      method, the antigen is allowed to react “to completion” and antigen
      concentration plotted linearly against the square of the diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      With double immunodiffusion, both antigen and antibody are placed apart
      (no embedded in the neutral matrix) and allowed to react. Precipitin bands
      or arcs form in a manner dependent on the diffusion of antigen and
      antibody. Moreover, the bands tend to remain stationary once formed
      (unlike migrating precipitin zones in single immunodiffusion) largely
      because vectors for diffusion direction are opposite. The
      <i>Ouchterlony technique</i>
      is a two-dimensional double immunodiffusion technique in which antigen and
      antibody are placed in separate wells of a stabilizing gel medium.
      Precipitin bands form between the wells as the antigen and antibody
      diffuse to meet each other and form equivalence zones. Bands may form
      closer either to the antigen well or the antibody well depending upon (1)
      the inherent diffusibility of the molecule, in which size is a factor and
      (2) the concentration of the molecule which is diffusing. Hence, although
      antibodies may be much larger and therefore slower than the antigen with
      which they will react, if they are added at relatively high
      concentrations, they may “push” the equivalence zone away from the
      antibody well and back toward the antigen well. A variation exploited by
      Ouchterlony is placed a well at the center of other well equidistant to
      the well at the center and separated from each other by the same distance.
      This allows the testing of one antibody with multiple antigens or one
      antigen with multiple antibodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ouchterlony technique also can be used to identify identical antigens
      and antibodies. Suppose a three-well system in which there is antigen A
      and antigen B and antibodies to them (as pictured below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="./imagesImmunologyRefHTML/DiffusionPlates.gif"
        alt="3-well Ouchterolony diffusion plates with expected preciptin arcs"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      In illustration 1, the antibody reacts identically with antigen A and B,
      and we conclude that A and B must therefore be identical in terms of their
      ability to react with the antibody. A high concentration of antigen (both
      A and B) between their two wells does not permit the line of fusion to
      extend.
    </p>
    <p>
      In illustration 2, the lines intersect (do not fuse) and extend beyond. We
      can conclude that antigens A and B are most probably distinct, since they
      react differently to their antibodies. We also can conclude that more than
      one antibody is in the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In illustration 3, the antibody most likely is very specific to antigen A,
      but shows some cross-reactivity with antigen B. Hence, antigens A and B
      share some feature, but the antibody is better suited to recognizing
      antigen A. Partial intersections are however possible when two identical
      substances are present in widely varying concentrations.

      <i>Electrophoresis in Immunology</i>
      . It is well established that proteins from blood will separate in a gel
      medium under the influence of an electric field into several zones. These
      are used principally in understanding paraprotein disorders, for example,
      multiple myeloma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocket immunoelectrophoresis (developed by Laurell, 1966) is an adaption
      of a single immunodiffusion method. Also related to two-dimensional double
      diffusion methods is “crossed immunoelectrophoresis,” used as a
      qualitative and quantitative technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Counter immunoelectrophoresis</i>
      (CIEP) is a one-dimensional double diffusion-type method. An agar medium
      with high electroendosmosis potential is used. Neutral molecules and those
      with low net charge will show a net migration to the cathode (negative
      pole) in the polyanionic medium, as a result of cationic pull which draws
      buffer by osmosis to the cathode. Antibody is placed in an anodal well,
      antigen in a cathodally placed well. Assuming antigen is negatively
      charged and antibody neutral, the two should migrate toward each other and
      precipitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Immunoelectrophoresis</i>
      is the more common technique, of used to examine blood (serum) proteins.
      Developed by Grabar and Williams, serum is placed in a well and separated
      electrophoretically (the buffer is usually neutral or slightly alkaline,
      and the well is placed nearest the cathode as the proteins are more likely
      to be negatively charged). Under these conditions, mobility from highest
      to lowest toward the anode is albumin, alpha-1 globulin, alpha-2 globulin,
      beta globulin, then gamma globulin. Once electrophoresis is complete, a
      trough is cut from the gel extending the length and parallel to the
      electrophoretic axis. The trough is then filled with an antiserum. Double
      immunodiffusion is allowed to proceed as the antigens diffuse from the
      line of electrophoresis to meet the antibodies. Diffusion from the trough
      is more planar while that from the electrophoretic zones more radial. It
      is thus likely that arc rather than precipitin lines will form. Each arc
      that forms is characteristic of the proteins in serum, and a typical set
      of arcs is present in patients without disease and different from the set
      in patients with disease. This technique is both qualitative and
      semi-quantitative. In the sense of it being quantitative, the amount of
      protein present will determine how far away from the trough the precipitin
      will form; the higher the protein concentration, the more likely the
      antigen excess will lead to precipitin closer to the trough. Indeed, with
      gross antigen excess, an arc may not be apparent at all, but rather the
      tips of an arc may extend from the trough. The arc may also have a sharper
      edge on the antigen side, more diffuse on the antibody (trough) side in
      the case of antigen excess. Low levels of antigen may form diffuse arcs
      far away from the trough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gamma globulin fraction in particularly represents a large population
      of heterogeneous molecules (IgG), and so precipitin bands in IEP will show
      moderate curvature since diffusion is not strictly from a single point but
      more from an extended line. Homogeneous proteins such as albumin are more
      likely to separate in electrophoresis to a single point and radial
      diffusion will be more apparent; their precipitin bands are more likely to
      show pronounced curvature. Some arcs will show fusion or partial fusion of
      bands, reflecting identity or partial identity of the immune complex
      formation. Note the identity is immunological, but the molecules are
      clearly distinct since they have different electrophoretic mobilities. IEP
      is most useful clinically in the diagnosis of M-component paraprotein
      disorders due to multiple myeloma, Waldenstron's macroglobulinemia, benign
      monoclonal gammopathy, malignant lymphoma, Bence-Jones proteinemia and
      proteinuria, Franklin's disease, cold agglutinin disease, and other
      lymphoproliferative disorders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFEP) was described by Alpers &amp;
      Johnson in 1969 as a more rapid variation of IEP. Subsequent to
      electrophoresis, antiserum which is usually soaked into strips of agarose
      or cellulose acetate is applied on top of the electrophoretic line rather
      than into a cut-out trough (the antibody-saturated strip is overlain).
      After a time, a diffuse set of precipitin zones form and the zones can be
      fixed and stained as in IEP. Besides the shorter time to analysis, some
      systems show a higher degree of resolution.

    <p>
      <b>AGGLUTINATION</b>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      Agglutination is any observable clumping of particles. It is essentially
      two phase in immunochemical reactions, requiring the binding of an
      antigenic site to a multivalent antibody, and then stabilization of the
      binding by reaction with a polyvalent antigen which itself may be bound to
      one or more antibodies. Agglutination conditions are particularly
      sensitive to ionic strength, as polyvalent antigens are more likely to
      show net repulsion to one another in close proximity; the presence of salt
      (normal saline) is likely to reduce these repulsive interactions. In
      addition, stabilization of agglutinates may depend on solution viscosity,
      with the more viscous solutions providing the greater stability; hence
      added albumin may stabilize the agglutination reaction. Agglutination is
      also more likely with heteregenous populations of antibodies and
      polyvalent antigen than with monoclonal antibodies and antigens of small
      size.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term
      <i>complete</i>
      antibodies is used to refer antibodies able to complete both the primary
      and second phase of agglutination in agglutination in normal saline.
      <i>Incomplete</i>
      antibodies generally can complete the first or primary phase, but cannot
      stabilize the agglutination.
    </p>
    <p>
      IgM is essentially better at agglutinating than IgG because of its greater
      polyvalent nature. In some cases, IgG make serve to block agglutination by
      competing for binding sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hemagglutination</b>
      is the agglutination of erythrocytes as a result of some sort of immune
      complex formation. Hemagglutination is very temperature-dependent, and
      this may be due to changes in the erythrocyte membrane which expose or
      hide antigens. Incomplete hemagglutinating antibodies (IgG) usually show
      warm antibody behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agglutination in general is a rather sensitive technique, with as little
      as 3 ng per ml antigen able to initiate the reaction. Tube test
      agglutinations are usually graded by a subjective measure, or dilutions
      done to determine a titer (the titer is usually considered to be the
      reciprocal of the last dilution exhibiting the reaction). Agglutinations
      may also be instrumentally assessed as in a spectrophotometer or
      nephelometer. Specially treated or coated particles, such as latex, may be
      used to enhance the sensitivity of a particular method.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Active</b>
      or
      <b>direct agglutination</b>
      is the agglutination of the antigen with antibody itself. The antigen may
      be a large, polyvalent particle. Examples include ABO testing, where
      anti-A and -B antibodies are used to determine A and B antigens on red
      blood cells. The antibody is usually a complete (IgM) antibody which
      produces the agglutination without augmentation. Agglutination reaction
      enhancers may nonetheless be used: albumin to increase viscosity; dilution
      to hypotonic ionic strength; partial proteases such as bromelin, papain,
      or ficin to make particularly incomplete antibodies more “flexible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Passive</b>
      or
      <b>indirect agglutination</b>
      is augmented agglutination. Large particles, such as polystyrene or latex,
      may be coated with soluble antigen and then exposed to antibody. Red blood
      cells, bentonite, and charcoal have also been used for the inert particle
      matrix. Proteins and polysaccharides have an ability to adsorb to
      particles of this nature and can form the basis of producing an
      agglutinogen. Erythrocytes can be made “adsorptive” by special treatments
      with tannic acid, trypsin, bisdiazotized benzine, carbodiimide (CDI), and
      glutaraldehyde. Metal ions, such as Cr cations have also been used to
      enhance adherence of an antigen to particles. Erythrocytes prepared with
      antigenic coatings may need to be stabilized if stored by treatment in
      some fixative (formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde). With hemagglutinating tests
      especially, serum to be tested should first be incubated with untreated
      cells (cells not coated) to remove substances such as heterophile
      antibodies which can agglutinate and lead to false positives. A variation
      of passive agglutination is
      <b>reverse passive agglutination</b>
      . In this case, the particle is coated not with antigen but with antibody,
      and then exposed to antigen in the fluid. Reverse passive agglutination
      assays have been developed for rubella,
      <i>Hemophilus influenzae</i>
      ,
      <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>
      , group B streptococci, and several therapeutic drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Agglutination</b>
      /
      <b>hemagglutination inhibition</b>
      involves some sort of interference with an agglutination reaction. If the
      particle used is an erythrocyte, it is hemagglutination inhibition. Two
      types of inhibition are used. One detects soluble antigen: a patient
      sample varied by dilution is mixed with agglutinating antibody present at
      constant levels; there should be no agglutination in the absence of an
      antigen-coated particle; an antigen-coated particle (latex, RBC) is added;
      agglutination occurs in inverse proportion to the dilution of the patient
      serum, or it does not occur if the patient had the antigen present.
      Variations on this type of assay involve use of colloidal dye particles
      (Dispersed Dye Immunoassay or DDIA) or inorganic colloidal particles (Sol
      Particle Immunoassay or SPIA). Examples of this assay include hepatitis B
      surface antigen, chorionic gonadotropin, Factor VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second technique derives from a natural hemagglutinating ability of
      some viruses. Patient serum containing antibody to a hemagglutinating
      virus is added to a fixed amount of virus, or varying virus is added to
      constant sera. A suspension of uncoated erythrocytes are then added to
      determine agglutination. Rubella is one such virus which can agglutinate
      the red cells of newborn chickens. However, the hemagglutination
      inhibition assay for rubella is technically demanding, requiring several
      steps and standardization.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Coomb's antiglobulin-mediated agglutination</b>
      is very commonly used. The
      <i>Direct Coomb's</i>
      test, antisera to immunoglobulins (anti-IgG) or to complement (anti-C
      <sub>3d</sub>
      ) or both is added to a red blood cell suspension and agglutination is
      observed. This would occur in certain pathologies in which blood cells had
      been sensitized by in vivo binding of immunoglobulin or complement. This
      occurs in autoimmune-caused hemolytic anemias or in hemolytic disease of
      the newborn (Rh disease). The
      <i>Indirect Antiglobulin</i>
      or
      <i>Coomb's</i>
      test is used usually to detect nonagglutinating (incomplete) antibodies.
      Cells known to have the antigens of interest are mixed with patient serum
      and binding occurs without agglutination. Next, Coomb's reagent (anti-IgG
      or anti-C
      <sub>3d</sub>
      ) is added to produce agglutination. Indirect Coomb's tests is usually
      used to identify dangerous antibodies present in candidates for
      transfusion.
    </p>
    <p style="font-variant: small-caps">Complement Fixation</p>
    <p>
      CF can be used to detect either antigens or antibodies in principle, but
      are usually used to establish presence of elevated antibody levels. IgM
      and IgG subclasses 1, 2, and 3 can activate complement when bound to
      antigen in most (but not all) situations. CF is very sensitive since the
      reaction involves an amplification cascade (more sensitive than
      agglutination and precipitation, but less so than RIA, IFA, or EIA). The
      set up for CF is labor intensive and mostly done by special laboratories.
      CF has proved useful in the diagnosis of viral, rickettsial, and fungal
      infections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antigen and inactivated patient sample containing antibody are mixed with
      the limiting presence and standardized reagent complement. If antibody is
      present, antigen and antibody will form an immune complex and these in
      turn will “fix” or activate complement. Sheep red blood cells coated with
      anti-sheep RBCs (called “hemolysin” or amboceptor) are then added. If no
      antibody was present in the patient sample, complement components will
      remain in the mixture and now be fixed to the anti-sheep RBCs bound to the
      sheep RBCs. The complement will now form active substances which destroy
      the membranes of the RBCs, resulting in cell lysis (hemolysis). The
      combination of sheep RBC/anti-sheep RBC is often called EA, for
      <i>E</i>
      rythrocyte/
      <i>A</i>
      ntibody. The indicator here is that, as the presence of patient antibody
      goes up, hemolysis occurs less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Necessary considerations in using CF are the amount, type, and purity of
      the antigen used, the concentration and reactivity of complement, the
      concentration of red blood cells, and the quality and quantity of
      hemolysin. In addition, ionic strength, pH, incubation times and
      temperatures are also factors. Necessary controls would include incubation
      of patient serum, complement, and EA, and no antigen to ensure the patient
      sample contains no substance which interfere with the action of complement
      (otherwise a false positive is likely). Anti-complement activation factors
      include bacterial contamination of sample or lipids.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Nephelometry and turbidometry</b>
      . Both essentially measure formation of immune complexes or agglutination
      reactions by measuring light scattering produced as a result. Turbidometry
      however measures reduction in the transmittance of direct light (namely
      absorption produced by scatter). The photodetector is placed on the other
      side of the reaction chamber in direct line to the light path. Scatter
      causes less light to be observed at the detector, so the reduced signal is
      reported. Turbidometry is typically recorded in absorbance units.
      Nephelometry instead measures scattered light, light away from the
      incident beam. It is perhaps more sensitive since it measures increases in
      light detection from a level of no light detection. Direct measurement is
      in arbitrary units, but these data are usually compared against standards
      of known concentration and reported as such. Although in principle either
      antigen or antibody can be measured with these methods, antibody is added
      to unknown antigen to establish its level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light scatter is a function both of immune complex number (concentration)
      and size, increasing independently with both. It also is a function of the
      refractive index of the media and the wavelength and intensity of the
      incident light. Immune complex formation essentially amounts to solution
      precipitation, and addition of polymers such as PEG can stabilize the
      precipitation reaction and stabilize the light scattering signal. Early
      nephelometers were essentially fluorometers with filters being the same
      for excitation and emission; hence scatter was measured only at 90°. More
      sophisticated instruments today measure scatter at broad and reasonable
      angle (10-70°) and use the best monochromatic light sources (helium-neon
      lasers or quartz-iodide light). Light intensity must be controlled as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two types of nephelometry are used.
      <i>End-point nephelometry</i>
      is where antigen and antibody concentrations are chosen so that one is in
      slight excess of the other, depending on which reactant is being measured.
      <i>Kinetic</i>
      or
      <i>rate nephelometry</i>
      is where light scatter is measured at certain time points; the rate of
      light scatter changes is linearly correlated with the presence of one
      reactant or the other.
    </p>
    <p style="font-variant: small-caps">Immunofluorescence Assays</p>
    <p>
      <i>Fluorescence immunoassays</i>
      . The terms immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or fluorescence immunoassay
      (FIA) are generic terms to describes immunoassays in which fluorescent
      probes are used to follow antigen-antibody reactions. Coons et al. (1941)
      first used fluorescent probes for these kinds of reactions. Fluorescent
      labels must be capable of attaching to either antigen or antibody, they
      should be relatively stable (most, if not all, lose their inherent
      fluorescent character with time and with stimulation), they should emit at
      wavelength well above background signaling (i.e., noise), and they should
      have a high quantum yield (some molecules are variable in the amount of
      emissive photons relative to the number or intensity of excitatory
      photons).
    </p>
    <p>
      A necessary step is to attach the fluorescent probe either to antigen or
      to antibody to form the
      <i>conjugate</i>
      . Fluorescein is a commony used probe, and its isothiocyanate (FITC) is
      reactive with primary amino groups, of which there are plenty on most
      molecules, which includes proteins. Hence FITC could easily be conjugated
      to antibodies, but can also be conjugated to large antigens as well,
      whether protein or not. The decision to use a FITC-Ag or FITC-Ab conjugate
      depends on assay design. Other fluorescent compounds usually used are
      rhodamine derivatives, porphyrins, and phycoerythrin (a compound in
      algae).
    </p>
    <p>
      Immunoassays in general can be
      <i>homogeneous</i>
      or
      <i>heterogeneous</i>
      . Heterogeneous refers to the necessity of using an assay step which
      separates labeled conjugates which have reacted from those that have not
      reacted, whereas homogeneous assays require no such step. Since
      heterogeneous assays often use or require a particle or insoluble
      substance designed to achieve this separation, they are often called
      <i>solid-phase assays</i>
      as well, whereas homogeneous assays may be called
      <i>fluid-</i>
      or
      <i>solution-phase assays</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are classes of specific techniques, in which they are
      certainly qualitative and may also be quantitative:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Direct solid-phase IFA</i>
      . (An unknown) antigen is fixed to a substratum (slide, microtiter well).
      Antibody conjugated with fluorescent probe is incubated and allowed to
      react. Unbound material is washed away and fluorescence observed or
      measured. This assay is usually qualitative, often applied to observe CD
      markers on leukocyte surfaces, in which case the cell is fixed and
      constitutes the “solid phase.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Indirect solid-phase IFA</i>
      . Antigens (or cells) are fixed to a substratum, but in this case, the
      identity of the antigen is typically known. Unlabeled antibody, usually
      patient serum for which presence is not certain, is then added. After
      washing unreacted material, a flourescence-labeled anti-antibody conjugate
      is then added, reacted, and washed. Presence of a fluorescence signal
      above background controls indicates that the patient serum likely
      contained the antibody. This assay is usually done to detect antibodies to
      cellular antigens as in the direct assay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Competitive binding IFA</i>
      . Known antigens are fixed to a substratum and then both labeled and
      unlabeled antibodies added simultaneously. After washing, fluorescence is
      observed or measured. The more fluorescence, the less unlabeled antibody
      in the patient serum was present. This assay may be done in several
      reactions in which unlabeled antibody (patient serum) addition is varied
      by dilution, showing a series of graded increases in fluorescence. This
      assay can also be configured so that antibody is fixed to the substratum
      and both labeled and unlabeled antigen added for competitive reaction.
      This may be done when the antibody is available in limited amounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sandwich assays</i>
      . This is usually done to test for the presence of or to quantitate a
      known antigen. Its antibody is fixed to a substratum. Antigen is then
      added and washed out. Then a fluorescent probe-conjugated antibody to
      antigen is added and later washed out. A high fluorescence signal would
      therefore indicate high concentrations of antigen present.
      Immunofluorometric assays (IFMA) are usually sandwich-type assays.
    </p>
    <p>Of the homogeneous assay types:</p>
    <p>
      <i>Fluorescence polarization immunoassay</i>
      . FPIA was first conceived by Perrin in 1926 and later adapted for
      proteins by Weber (1953). In the 1960s and 70s, Dandliker et al. made the
      technique quantitative for proteins and haptens, and Maeda (1979) used
      FPIA in proteolytic and enzymatic reactions. This assay is competitive by
      necessity. Fluorescence-labeled and unlabeled antigen are added to a
      solution of antibody. Polarized monochromatic light (in the band causing
      fluorescence) is passed toward the cell. a A photomultiplier (detector) is
      placed 90° to the cell, with a filter for the emission wavelength and a
      rotatable polarizing filter placed in between. Normally a fluorescent
      molecule will absorb the polarized excitatory photon, and then emit a
      photon in a certain plane as well (it may not necessarily be at the same
      angle). If the fluorescent molecule is fixed in a way that molecular
      rotation is slow or slowed, a population of fluorescent molecules
      absorbing excitatory photons will emit photons which show significant
      polarization. If the molecules rotate rapidly however with respect to the
      time toward fluoresence, the emitted photon is likely to have a plane of
      polarization different from many other photons, and so photons emitted are
      likely to have many different polarization planes. The intensity of
      polarization at a specific angle measured by the detector is likely to be
      little, since there is a large number of different polarization planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assay takes advantage of the difference in molecular rotation of an
      flourescence-conjugated antigen when it is free and when it is bound to
      antibody. Binding to antibody (150 kDa in mass for IgG-based FPIA) should
      significantly slow the molecular rotation of antigen for this to work.
      This fact means that antigens must necessarily be small in size; in
      practice antigens are 1000 to 10,000 Da in mass, which means that certain
      haptens, small peptides, and non-proteinaceous drugs are measured by this
      assay. When a patient sample containing antigen (e.g., drug-containing
      serum) is added, the higher the presence of the antigen will make the
      polarized fluorescence signal higher than when drug is not present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain technological improvements were necessary for FPIA to be practical
      in clinical testing. An automated flow cell polarization fluorimeter was
      developed by Spencer et al (1973), a photon counting polarization
      photometer was introduced by Jameson et al (1978), and a system for
      computer the degree of polarization on a time-shared basis was introduced
      by Smith et al (1978). An instrument integrating these functions was first
      put together by Popelka et al and Jolley et al. (1981).
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, large antigens can not reliably be quantitated by FPIA.
    </p>
    <p style="font-variant: small-caps">Radioimmunoassays</p>
    <p>
      First developed in 1960, it remains one of the most sensitive assays. The
      label is not fluorescent or enzymatic in nature, but a radioisotope. The
      most common isotopes for labeling are
      <sup>3</sup>
      H,
      <sup>131</sup>
      I, or
      <sup>125</sup>
      I.
      <sup>125</sup>
      I is usually used largely because its half-life of 60 days is long enough
      to reduce the need to perform labeling steps but short enough not to
      present a significant radiation waste hazard or require expensive
      long-term waste treatment handling. Moreover, its decay events are more
      energetic and efficiently counted than weaker isotopes, but the decay
      energy is relatively low enough not to demand serious precautions against
      high-energy decay events.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the original method, antigen is labeled with isotope in a step which
      produces covalent bonding typically. Labeled antigen is mixed with
      antibody and an unlabeled antigen source, usually the sample of interest
      (antigen in a patient serum for example). Hence the assay is competitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another RIA type is to label the antibody and to add antgen and an unknown
      sample containing unlabeled antibody in a competitive assay. The more
      antibody in the sample, the less likely the labeled antibody will bind.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these assays, the critical step is to separate the bound tracer from
      the free tracer. Ineffective techniques will produce assays with a limited
      measurable range if not full of errors altogether. Antigens which are low
      in molecular mass (&lt; 30,000 Da) can convienently be separated as bound
      to antibody using salt or polymer precipitation methods (ammonium sulfate
      or PEG). The free tracer usually does not precipitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For larger antigens (&gt; 30 kDa), precipitation of this kind is not
      amenable. If the antibody used in the assay is of a certain IgG subclass
      known to bind to Staphylococcus protein A, this protein, usually itself
      bound to a particle of latex or to Sepharose beads, may be used to
      precipitate immune complexes and separate bound from free tracer, if the
      tracer is antigen. Alternatively, an anti-immunoglobulin may be used to
      bring about the precipitation. Other separation methods which have been
      exploited are the ability of antigens to bind to activated charcoal or
      talc when not bound to immunoglobulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Solid-phase RIA</i>
      (also called immunoradiometric assay or IRMA), was first developed by
      Miles and Hales in 1968. In principle either antigen or antibody is
      immobilized to a substratum (Sepharose beads, walls of a microtiter well
      or test tube). The separation of bound and free tracer is facilitated by
      simple washing of immobilized materials. As originally developed, a
      monospecific antibody was used as the immobilized reactant, but was not
      practical until monoclonal antibodies were developed sometime later.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sandwich RIA is another method commonly used, requiring an immobilized
      antibody which is incubated with unknown amounts of antigen. This is
      washed away, and then labeled, monospecific antibody is added, reacted,
      and washed away. In general the sort of RIA to be done must be designed
      first around determining whether patient antibody or antigen is to be
      detected. The IRMA is a much better than solution-phase RIA since reagent
      use is in smaller amounts and sensitivity is 10-fold greater.
    </p>
    <p style="font-variant: small-caps">Enzyme immunoassays</p>
    <p>
      Unlike with RIA and fluorescence-based assays, the total amount of signal
      does not increase with time (making detection below measurable thresholds
      possible), but readable signal may in fact decrease over time (such as
      with radioisotope decay). EIA is different in that the signal is generated
      over the course of time by conversion of a substrate to a product, the
      product providing the measurable parameter. Ever increasing amounts of
      enzyme tend to have a manifold effect on the signal present.
    </p>
    <p>
      EIA was reported simultaneously by Engvall and Perlmann and by von Weeman
      and Schuurs in 1971. An alternative was sought to popular RIA methods for
      multiple reasons. With use of enzyme labels, there is no necessity to use
      labeled materials in a short time: enzymes like peroxidase can store with
      a half life of 9 years at 4° C. Moreover reactions are set up so that a
      colored product is formed, making EIA both qualitative as well as
      quantitative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term ELISA is often used interchangably with EIA, but was specifically
      developed as a solid-phase technique to measure antibody in a sample, and
      should be used with these concepts in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      EIAs are heterogeneous or homogeneous, although the latter is used in a
      limited fashion. The EMIT (Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay developed by
      Syva) assay is a homogeneous assay which exploits the ability of an
      antibody sometimes to inactivate an enzyme. Antibodies binding to enzymes
      may inactivate enzymes either by distorting their molecular conformation
      required for catalysis of substrate(s) or by binding at or near to the
      active site, thereby preventing entry of one or more substrates. In these
      assays, enzyme is conjugated to antigen and mixed with a patient sample
      containing unknown amounts of antigen and with antibody to the antigen.
      Like FPIA, this assay is homogeneous and competitive. After time for
      immune complex formation, substrates are added and formation of (a)
      colored product(s) monitored spectrophotometrically. The more antigen in
      the patient sample, the greater the formation of absorbing color since it
      would mean less antibody was bound to enzyme-labeled antigen. In practical
      use, the antigens must necessarily be small in size for antibody binding
      to the antigen to be able to affect inhibition of the attached enzyme.
      Hence, some therapeutic drugs, hormones and a few antibiotics are tested
      using this method. As inhibition of enzyme is not so efficient or complete
      for many binding reactions, there is significant noise (background signal)
      and so loss of sensitivity and reduced linear range of quantitation
      (sensitivity is in the μg per ml range).
    </p>
    <p>
      Most EIAs are heterogeneous, solid-phase assays following the same
      principles as RIA. Typically, antigen or antibody are fixed to plastic
      surface substrata or to beads. (Use of beads increases the effective
      substratum surface area and improves the linear range of quantitation and
      may also improve sensitivity.) Other surfaces include nitrocellulose,
      nylon, and activated paper in the so-called DOT immunoassays.
      <i>Competitive binding EIA</i>
      generally refers to binding of antibody to the surface, with incubation of
      patient sample containing antigen and enzyme-labeled antigen
      simultaneously. Activity of bound enzyme present is inversely proportional
      to the unlabeled antigen present in the sample.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Indirect EIA</i>
      , which includes ELISA, involves fixing antigen to the substrate,
      incubating with patient sample containing antibody, then serially
      incubating an enzyme-conjugate anti-immunoglobulin to react with antibody.
      In this method, the amount of enzyme activity should be directly
      proportional to antibody in the sample. In some situations, a
      class-specific anti-immunoglobulin may be used (e.g., anti-IgM), in which
      case the assay is a
      <i>class-capture assay</i>
      . Such assays can reveal which antibodies may be present and reflect the
      immunological and pathological state of the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sandwich EIA</i>
      , or double antibody EIA, or immunoenzymetric assay (IEMA), is similar to
      IRMA. Antibody is immobilized to substrate, then patient sample is
      incubated and washed away. Enzyme-labeled antibody is now added, and later
      measurment is taken. This assay works well with polyvalent (or at least
      bivalent) antigens. Here enzyme activity is directly proportional to
      antigen present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which assay type for which test? Generally competitive binding EIA is used
      in quantitating relatively high concentrations of drugs or hormones, while
      sandwich assays demonstrate greater sensitivity and the typical assay
      design for low concentrations. Sandwich assays are also used when antigens
      are difficult to purify or obtain. Indirect heterogenous assays are the
      choice for those wishing to quantitate antibody for assessment of
      immunological state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various enzyme labels have been tried and each works to meet the needs of
      a particular system. Peroxidase is probably the most favored, able to work
      on a variety of substrates which produce a variety of colors. Some
      products are also insoluble, precipitating in the immediate vicinity of
      the enzyme and therefore useful showing the site of enzyme action
      (location of the formed immune complex); this has been exploited in
      histoimmunochemistry. Peroxidase is also a very hardy enzyme relative to
      other enzymes that have been used. Other enzymes used include alkaline
      phosphatase, both expensive and relatively insensitive, but nonetheless
      useful in particular situations, especially when peroxidase substrates
      might react nonspecifically. Several fluorochromogenic substrates have
      been developed for β-galactosidase, so it may be used where fluorescence
      signalling is desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      EIA may be measured in one of two ways: end-point or stopped assays, and
      rate or kinetic assays. The type of measurement often depends on the
      physical arrangement and technical setup. Most often, the end-point
      measurement is done since large numbers of assays are usually done
      simultaneously and the instruments used would be less expensive than those
      performing large number of rate measuring assays.

      Strongly reactive agglutinins are present in the serum of those who lack
      corresponding antigens of the ABO blood group. The antigens present on the
      RBC surface may be A, B, or H. Within these major groups exist variants: A
      <sub>1</sub>
      , A
      <sub>2</sub>
      , A
      <sub>3</sub>
      , A
      <sub>m</sub>
      , B, B
      <sub>3</sub>
      , O, and O
      <sub>h</sub>
      , although only A
      <sub>1</sub>
      , A
      <sub>2</sub>
      , and B are of practical importance. It should be noted that these
      antigens are also secreted in the saliva of people having the secretion
      gene: substances secreted are H and A for the A type, H and B for B type,
      and only H for the O type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three sets of genes regulate the ABO system: (1)
      <i>H</i>
      and
      <i>h</i>
      ; (2)
      <i>A</i>
      <sub>1</sub>

      <i>O</i>
      ; and (3)
      <i>Se</i>
      and
      <i>se</i>
      . The ABO locus is on chromosome 9, and the others are unknown. It is
      likely each set encompasses a well-defined locus. In the US, the
      frequencies of occurrence of the O, A, B, and AB phenotypes is among
      whites: 45% O, 40% A, 11% B, 4% AB; among blacks: 49% O, 27% A, 20% B, 4%
      AB; among Native Americans: 79% O, 16% A, 4% B, &lt;1% AB; and among
      Asians: 40% O, 28% A, 27% B, 5% AB.

      The products of the ABH genes are glycosyltransferases whcih transfer
      oligosaccharides to the carbohydrate portion of the maturing antigen. The
      <i>H</i>
      gene is a fucosyltransferase attaching
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span>
      -fucose to a terminal galactose of a type 2 oligosaccharide on the
      proteins of red cells and on vascular endothelium or as part of a
      glycolipid structure. The
      <i>Se</i>
      gene codes for a fucosyltransferase that reacts with type 1
      oligosaccharide on membranes of secretory glands. The
      <i>A</i>
      gene codes for an α-
      <i>N</i>
      -acetylgalactosyltransferase attaching N-acetylgalactosamine to the 3rd
      carbon of the H-active chain (H chain being part of a glycoprotein or
      glycolipid). The
      <i>B</i>
      gene codes for an α-galactosyltransferase attaching
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -galactose to the 3rd carbon of the H chain. The
      <i>O</i>
      gene is silent (the allele is null). In the absence of an H gene (
      <i>h</i>
      /
      <i>h</i>
      genotype), the precursor is not converted and the O
      <sub>h</sub>
      (also called Bombay-type) is the phenotype. Indeed, A and B gene products
      will have no effect on this type, even if present, since the H gene is
      absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ABH antigens can occur as soluble glycoproteins secreted and in the
      plasma, or form structural glycolipids in erythrocyte membranes and in
      some epithelial and endothelial cells. Secretion is autosomal dominant,
      occurring only when an
      <i>Se</i>
      gene is present (homo- or heterozygously;
      <i>se</i>
      /
      <i>se</i>
      do not secrete, which is about 1 in 5 people). Secretion of ABH
      glycoproteins is in the upper GI, ovarian cyst fluid, seminal fluid, and
      amniotic fluid. It is also reported that the antigens are found on
      leukocytes and platelets.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABH antigens can be seen on a 6-week old fetus, but do not fully express
      until an infant is 6-18 months old. Indeed, and infant typed A
      <sub>1</sub>
      may later be typed A
      <sub>2</sub>
      later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agglutinating antibodies to these antigens can be easily obtained from
      human serum. However, other non-antibody agglutinins have been obtained
      from plant sources. Production of the “natural” type antibodies (anti-A
      and anti-B) is thought to be due to the presence of A and B antigen (sugar
      types) on bacteria. Anti-A and -B antibodies are very low in titer in both
      infants (not expected to have been exposed to bacteria) and in germ-free
      animals, indicating that bacteria may be involved in eliciting these
      antibodies. Anti-A and -B IgM-class antibodies can be neutralized by
      soluble A and B group substances, while IgG-class anti-A and -B are not
      readily neutralized by the soluble molecules.
    </p>
    <p>
      An “immune” type of anti-A and -B (of the IgG class) is thought to result
      from an exposure to antigen that could occur as a result of fetal-maternal
      hemorrhage of the placental barrier or some contact with axenic blood.
      This can include injection of serum products containing soluble antigens.
      Of interest is that anti-A
      <sub>1</sub>
      does not cross-react with A
      <sub>2</sub>
      antigen or antigen-bearing cells. A lectin from
      <i>Dolichos biflorus</i>
      has proven useful in reacting with and typing A
      <sub>1</sub>
      antigen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anti-H antibody is known to strongly react with O cells; reaction is
      progressively weaker with A
      <sub>2</sub>
      and A
      <sub>3</sub>
      , and weakest or negligible with A
      <sub>1</sub>
      or A
      <sub>1</sub>
      B cells. H-substance can neutralize the antibody. Anti-H from Bombay type
      can agglutinate and sometimes hemolyze O cells. Anti_H in non-O
      <sub>h</sub>
      persons is weak and nonhemolytic. The lectin from
      <i>Ulex europaeus</i>
      is useful in determining secretor status and for typing cellular-bound H
      antigen. The lectin has a stronger binding affinity and reacts with A and
      B cells as well.

    <p>
      In distinguishing A
      <sub>1</sub>
      and A
      <sub>2</sub>
      antigen bearing individuals, anti-A
      <sub>1</sub>
      is usually used. Although it reacts with A
      <sub>2</sub>
      as well, the agglutination is noticeably different (weaker). A
      <sub>1</sub>
      individuals have no anti-A
      <sub>1</sub>
      in their serum while A
      <sub>2</sub>
      might. A
      <sub>1</sub>
      is distinguished by Type I and II chains (A
      <sup>a</sup>
      , A
      <sup>b</sup>
      , A
      <sup>c</sup>
      , A
      <sup>d</sup>
      ), while A
      <sub>2</sub>
      has only Type II (only A
      <sup>a</sup>
      and A
      <sup>b</sup>
      ). Also the activity of the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase in A
      <sub>1</sub>
      is higher with a shifted pH max of 6, while the enzyme in A
      <sub>2</sub>
      types is less active and the maximum activity is at pH 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      When grouping blood type by using cellular agglutination, this method is
      called “forward grouping.” With “reverse grouping,” cells of groups A
      <sub>1</sub>
      and B are used (A
      <sub>2</sub>
      used only when presence of anti-A
      <sub>1</sub>
      is suspected).

      Porter and Edelman showed basic structure of four polypeptide chains
      connected by disulfide bonds, which still interact even when disulfides
      are reduced. Acidification eliminates non-covalent binding and gel

    <h2>
      Classification of Structural Variation: Isotypes, Allotypes, Idiotypes
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Isotypes</b>
      refer to
      <b>classes</b>
      and also
      <b>subclasses</b>
      of antibodies: they are present in all individuals. In humans, there are
      five: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. Classes not only differ by sequence but
      also by antigenicity: antibodies to one class can be produced which do not
      cross-react with other classes. Both heavy and light chains are isotypic.
      With light chains, a clone is either κ or λ, never mixed. Thus the
      complete isotype is something like IgGκ or IgMλ and so on. IgG has five
      subclasses in humans, all of which vary by interchain disulfide bonds
      between the heavy chains, not just in number (IgG
      <sub>1</sub>
      and IgG
      <sub>4</sub>
      : two, IgG
      <sub>2</sub>
      : four, IgG
      <sub>3</sub>
      : 11!), but in placement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Allotype</b>
      are basically alleilic variants: they are not present in all individuals
      because a change in a few amino acids (usually) occur and expression is
      codominant. Allotypes are immunologically distinguishable, but do not
      affect function with respect to class or antigen-binding. The distinction
      in ABO blood grouping is analogous. Allotypic differences are seen in the
      constant regions of both heavy and light chains, rarely in the variable
      regions. The
      <i>marker</i>
      on IgG, or Gm, specifies allotypic differences. Thus G1m(a) specifies a
      DELTK sequences on the IgG
      <sub>1</sub>
      molecule, while the G1m(a−) (negative) variant is EEMTK. At least 20 Gm
      groups exist for γ heavy chains and three (Km, formerly Inv, groups) on
      the constant κ region. For rabbits, their light chains have a b4, b5, b6,
      and b9 allotypes. For mouse heavy γ
      <sub>2α</sub>
      , there are Igh-1
      <sup>a</sup>
      and Igh-1
      <sup>b</sup>
      allotypes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Idiotypes</b>
      refer essentially to the single antibody from a clone, and the uniqueness
      of its sequence created by the variable and hypervariable regions.
      Anti-idiotypic antibodies are specific for the variable and hypervariable
      regions.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Gene Organization and Re-Organization in B Lymphocyte Differentiation
    </h2>
    <p>
      The κ and λ light chains and the heavy chains are coded on gene clusters
      on three different chromosomes. The completed gene is actually not present
      in germ line cells, but in differentiated lymphocytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The κ chain variable region is made up of two genes that make up a large
      <i>
        V
        <sub>κ</sub>
      </i>
      and smaller
      <i>
        J
        <sub>κ</sub>
      </i>
      . Another gene codes the constant (
      <i>
        C
        <sub>κ</sub>
      </i>
      ) region. In B cell lymphocyte development, one of 40
      <i>
        V
        <sub>κ</sub>
      </i>
      genes and one of 5
      <i>
        J
        <sub>κ</sub>
      </i>
      are selected in a special translocation event. All
      <i>V</i>
      segments have a leader sequence and upstream promoter sites including
      octamer (ATGCAAAT) and TATA box (TATATAA) motifs. The
      <i>
        V
        <sub>κ</sub>
      </i>
      ,
      <i>
        J
        <sub>κ</sub>
      </i>
      , and
      <i>
        C
        <sub>κ</sub>
      </i>
      exons are brought into contiguity by RNA splicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      These same things occur in the λ light and heavy chains although some
      additional gene segments are added. For heavy chains different constant
      region genes form a single cluster. There is also a group of 25 highly
      variable
      <i>D</i>
      sgements between the
      <i>V</i>
      and
      <i>J</i>
      regions. The
      <i>D</i>
      segment and the junctions to the
      <i>V</i>
      and
      <i>J</i>
      segments code nearly the entire third hypervariable region. The first two
      hypervariable regions are coded with the
      <i>V</i>
      gene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Translocation occurs through a conserved heptamer-spacer-nonamer (7-x-9)
      recombination signal sequence (RSS) which flanks all
      <i>V</i>
      ,
      <i>D</i>
      , and
      <i>J</i>
      segments. The sequence pattern is as follows:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <i>V</i>
      <sub>L</sub>
      --heptamer--23 bp spacer--nonamer--intervening DNA--nonamer--12 bp
      spacer--heptamer--
      <i>J</i>
      <sub>L</sub>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the 7-x-9 is palindromic, which makes base pairing by sequence
      looping possible, in which recombination forms a circular DNA loop. The
      bending and looping of DNA is mediated by high mobility group-1 and -2
      proteins (HMG-1 and HMG-2). Products of the
      <i>r</i>
      ecombinant
      <i>a</i>
      ctivating
      <i>g</i>
      enes RAG-1 and RAG-2 then create double-stranded breaks for loop excision.
      The strands are left as hairpinned ends, with a phosphate group joining
      the 3'end of one strand to the 5'end of the other on the blunt end. Enzyme
      Ku (a heterodimer of 70 and 86 kDa units) binds to these ends and
      stimulates a DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase). Mutation of DNA-PK
      results in mice SCID. This opens the hair pin. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
      transferase (TdT) then extends the strands with random bases to create
      N-region diversity. Nucleases are present to trim excess nucleotides and
      polymerases fill the gaps. Finally DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 ligate the two
      sequences. Depending on the sequence lengths created, only one length
      provides the correct reading frame. Thus two in three cells are wasted,
      the cost of immunological diversity. The final sequence pattern is:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">

      In a study of anti-dextran idiotypic antiboddies, antibodies reacted to
      the CDR2 region (position 50-60 in the heavy chain) while special
      anti-idiotype (private) antibodies could distinguish sequence isoforms in
      the CDR3 region (position 95-100, where V joins with D) but in which all
      isoforms cross-reacted with the antibody to the CDR2 region. (Note that
      CDR1 corresponds to positions 30-40 in the variable region of heavy
      chain). These sequence isoforms for example had NN in the CDR2 region (SN
      in the case of one, which was weakly cross-reacting). In the CDR3 region,
      those antibodies which had sequences RY or NY reacted as a group, while
      those with YD or AD reacted with distinction. Other antibodies had RD, KD,
      SN or SH and did not react at all. While separated by large numbers of
      amino acids in the sequence, the CDR1-3 each have close spatial proximity
      after secondary structure folding. Topographically, the CDRx regions in
      the variable regions of the light and heavy chain form a pocket within
      which the antigen is bound.

      Thus nucleotides may be deleted or inserted between
      <i>VD</i>
      ,
      <i>DJ</i>
      , and
      <i>VJ</i>
      joining elements. Downstream are three enhancer regions (Eμ1, Eμ2, Eμ3)
      and octamer, very important in transcription of the entire set of genes.
      Downstream of the enhancers are a
      <q>switch</q>
      (Sμ) gene and the genes for the constant region, Cμ, Cδ, Cγ, etc. The
      switch region will control which constant region gets attached to the
      variable regions.

      the amino acid sequence, shows three hypervariable positions known as
      <i>complimentarity determining regions</i>
      (CDRs). Regions in between are called
      <i>framework</i>
      (Fr) regions, and these are numbered in the sequence in which they are
      found (e.g., CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, Fr1, Fr2).

      The variable domain is reponsible for antigen binding/recognition. X-ray
      crystallography shows binding between
      <i>F</i>
      <sub>ab</sub>
      fragments and antigen. Three hypervariable loops on the light and heavy
      chains creates essentially six points of contact with the antigen, each
      loop having a unique sequence which allows binding with the antigen,
      providing unique complimentarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constant domain affects function in many ways. It controls half-life,
      distribution, can or can not fix complement, and affect binding to surface
      Fc receptrs. Functions were discovered using myeloma proteins with
      spontaneous domain deletions or by using enzymic fragments. Site-specific
      mutagenesis has looked at critical amino acids. The particular function
      will differ according the antibody class.

    <h3>IgG Structure-Function</h3>
    <p>
      This antibody has a principle role in extracellular, extravascular
      defense, within the serous fluid spaces. It binds to neutralize a toxin
      function or it binds to the organism or cell to enhance phagocytosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Approximate 3D Structure</b>
      The structure of the IgG is approximated below. Note how the globular
      domains and spacing sequences arrange with respect to the strand and
      between other chains. Complement C4b and C1q activation domains are shown.
      The domains required to bind F
      <sub>c</sub>
      receptors are Cγ2 and Cγ3, which also bind to staphylococcal protein A;
      the receptors are found on phagocytic cells, NK cells and placental
      syncytiotrophoblast.

      <b>Complement activation (classical pathway)</b>
      . IgG complexed to antigen will bind to complement C1, which forms a
      complex. A minimum of two F
      <sub>c</sub>
      γ regions must occur close to one another to trigger the action of the C1q
      subunit. Within the second constant domain loop (Cγ2) is the sequence
      -EXKXK- (positions 318-322, where X is any amino acid) which binds to C1q;
      experiments with short synthetic peptides of this sequence block C1q
      activation. C1q activation then activated C4, and C4b subunit binds to the
      Cγ1 (first constant domain) region. Subsequent to this, C3 convertase is
      formed, leading to C3b coupling to bacterial wall and release of C3a and
      C5a, which are polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte attractants. PMNs adhere
      to bacteria because they have surface receptors for F
      <sub>c</sub>
      γ. This stimulates phagocytosis. Natural killer (NK) cells also make their
      way to target cells via IgG F
      <sub>c</sub>
      receptors and release substances to cause killing as well.

      (CD64) is coded by three separate genes and several transcripts, but only
      one is demonstrated to synthesize protein. It has three Ig-like domains
      and has higher affinity than all other receptor types. It might also bind
      C-reactive protein (CRP). It is present on monocyte family of cells (which
      include macrophages and dendritic cells). It is induced on neutrophils in
      the presence of IFNγ and G-CSF; it is down-regulated in response to IL-4
      and IL-13. It is made of a α chain that binds the IgG but lacks
      cytoplasmic tail, and has a γ chain homodimer with immunoreceptor
      tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). It binds monomeric IgG and holds
      it for subsequent cross-linking. This receptor and F
      <sub>c</sub>
      γRIIIA do not contain a cytoplasmic tail with any function, and in order
      to achieve signaling effect, these associate with a homodimer that bears
      an ITAM.

      γRIIA form also shows polymorphism at residue 131 (H or R) and this

      binding to leukocytes. Other polymorphisms of F

      γRIIA and F

      γRIIC, there are that undergo phosphorylation and this leads to
      stimulation of cell activity. In the case of F
      <sub>c</sub>
      γRIIB, there are ITIM motif to induce inhibition. Binding of these low
      affinity receptors to monomeric IgG is insignificant and their activation
      is promoted more by polymeric vs. monomeric ligand binding. Higher
      concentrations of immune complexes are required as they bring receptors
      closer together, required for activation (cell signaling).

      (n for neontal, where the original work was done) is a fourth type present

      well. It has MHC-like structure with α chain that associates with β

      microglobulin. It moves IgG through cells (moving maternal IgG across
      placenta). In rodents in moves IgG into colostral and maternal milk from
      intestine to circulation of neonate. Binding is pH-dependent in that in
      the acidic environment (pH 6.0) of the gut, it binds strongly, is
      transported, and then releases IgG in a pH 7.4 environment.

      Secreted in saliva, tears, nasal fluids, sweat, colostrum, and in lung,
      genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts. At least 40 mg sIgA is
      produced per kg body weight daily. It is dimerized intracellularly to a 15
      kDa Cys-rich J chain, providing multivalency in its activities; the dimers
      have identical specificity. A
      <b>poly-Ig receptor</b>
      (pIgR) binds to the J chain which is present on mucosal epithelial cells.
      This is endocytosed, transported to the external side of the mucosa and
      secreted into external body fluids after pIgR cleavage. At the cell
      surface, sIgA then acts to bind to bacterial cell surfaces and prevent
      their adherence to cells by which infection is achieved.

    <h1>Chapter 6: Immunochemical Techniques</h1>
    <p>
      The method of determining
      <b>antibody titer</b>
      is a way of determining a level or concentration of the antibody with
      respect to its undiluted state as to the effect it achieves. For example
      if serum is diluted 10,000-fold, and it still gives a positive test (say
      for agglutination), the titer is said to be 1:10000. It depends a great on
      the test. Precipitation reactions are lower sensitivity, and so a greater
      concentration (lower dilution, and thus lower titer) of serum may be
      necessary to produce a positive test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plot the Percent Total Ig against an affinity measure (
      <i>K</i>
      <sub>a</sub>
      , M
      <sup>−1</sup>
      ) and the plot starts high and falls as the affinity measure increases.
      This reflects the fact that there are many antibodies in serum with low
      affinity for antigen while there are fewer antibodies present have high
      affinity (specificity) for antigen. If the affinity constant
      <i>K</i>
      <sub>a</sub>
      is:
    </p>
    <p class="eqnserif">
      <i>K</i>
      <sub>a</sub>
      = [AgAb] / [Ab][Ag]
    </p>
    <p>
      where [AgAb] is concentration of immune complexes while the other are free
      antibody and antigen, then for a fixed [Ag]:
    </p>
    <p class="eqnserif">
      [AgAb] ∝
      <i>K</i>
      <sub>a</sub>
      [Ab]
    </p>
    <p>
      This means as antibody concentration increases, so it creates more immune
      complexes, which is reasonable.
    </p>
    <h2>The Precipitin Reaction</h2>
    <p>
      As antigen is added to an antiserum, AgAb precipitates are formed. This
      results from a cross-linking to give a lattice work through F
      <sub>c</sub>
      -F
      <sub>c</sub>
      interactions, which form precipitating aggregates. Antigen is added
      continuously and goes in excess to form soluble complexes which have the
      form Ag
      <sub>4</sub>
      Ab
      <sub>3</sub>
      , Ag
      <sub>3</sub>
      Ab
      <sub>2</sub>
      , and Ag
      <sub>2</sub>
      Ab. When antigen excess is extreme, precipitates from ultracentrifuge show
      them to be of form Ag
      <sub>2</sub>
      Ab, which occurs because Ab is divalent. EM and Scatchard plots also
      reveal this stoichiometry. 10% of antibody is nonprecipitating in that it
      contains oligosaccharide which prevents antigen-binding to one F
      <sub>ab</sub>
      side by a steric action. Precipitates would only occur within serum anyway
      when both antigen and antibody are in high concentrations. In general
      precipitating complexes occur when equivalence and antibody excess occur,
      but soluble complexes are found in antigen excess and whenever haptens are
      the antigen.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dilute solutions of antibody and antigen that form small aggregates
        create a cloudiness or turbidity which is measured by forward angle
        light scattering. Using monochromatic laser light and the addition of
        polyethylene glycol improves sensitivity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using radiolabled antigen and procedures to bring complexes out of
        solution by changing solubility or adding anti-Ig reagents, it is
        possible to estimate antigen-binding capacity of antiserum that forms
        only soluble complexes.

        <b>Countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis</b>
        . Antigens are placed in an agarose well at the cathode end (antigens
        not negatively charged in buffer might be modified to make them so) and
        antibody placed at the anode. When current is applied, the positively
        charged antibody migrates opposite the antigen and the emergence of a
        precipitin line is observed because effective Ab concentration is
        increased.

        <b>Measuring affinity</b>
        . With small haptens,
        <i>equilibrium dialysis</i>
        can be employed. To measure affinity of larger antigens, radiolabel the
        antigen and then precipitate the soluble complex (using solid
        phase-bound anti-Ig). Plot the application of the Steward-Petty
        modification of the Langmuir equation:
        <p class="eqnserif">
          1/[AgAb] = 1/(Ab-comb-sites ×
          <i>K</i>
          <sub>a</sub>
          [Ag]) + 1/Ab-comb-sites
        </p>
        <p>
          where [Ag] is free antigen concentration. Ab-comb-sites is total Ab
          combining sites, and
          <i>K</i>
          <sub>a</sub>
          is affinity constant. The plot is of 1/[AgAb] vs. 1/[Ag]. When [Ag] is
          in excess (inifinite), then 1/[AgAb] = 1/Ab-comb-sites. When half the
          Ab sites are bound, the 1/Ab-comb-sites =
          <i>K</i>
          <sub>a</sub>
          <i>K</i>
          <sub>a</sub>
          . For measuring mAb affinity, a curve of free mAb is done using
          solid-phase bound antigen so that Ab competes for solution and solid
          phase Ag; using [AgAb] = enzyme-bound anti-Ig. The Klotz-Scatchard
          equation is used:

          = ELISA optical density for Ab where there is no Ag,

        <b>Chaotropic Challenge</b>
        . In this assay, antibody is first bound to antigen and then increasing
        concentrations of a chaotrope (thiocyanate) are added; generally the
        higher the affnity, the more thiocyanate is required to break the
        binding.

      <li>
        Friguet and co-workers used an assay in which a constant Ab
        concentration was incubated with varying Ag levels and the free Ab
        remaining is brought down with solid-phase Ag. This assay differs from
        other in that the both Ab and Ag are not labeled, which might affect a
        true/accurate assessment of binding.

      <b>Surface plasmon resonance</b>
      is a tool created in order to accurately assess binding. mAbs are coupled
      to dextran which overlies a gold film on a glass prism. Light is passed
      such that it shows complete internal reflection at a given angle. When
      antigen is flowed into the system, the formation of a complex increases
      the size of the molecule, and this directly alters the angle of
      reflection. As time-based measurements can be done with such a system, the
      kinetics of association and dissociation can be determined, and this
      ultimately gives the equilibrum constant. A plot of the response in
      arbitrary signal units versus time produces lines which can be
      mathematically analyzed.

    <h2>Agglutination</h2>
    <p>
      When Abs cross-link themselves with multivalent Ag, the mass that forms
      leads to precipitation. When Abs crosslink cells or large particles, the
      reaction is
      <b>agglutination</b>
      . As cells are electrically charged and resist agglutination, it takes
      quite a few antibodies to bind before mutual repulsion is overcome. When
      cells have only a small number of determinants, additional help may be
      necessary such as adding anti-Ig. IgM is also an excellent agglutinating
      Ab. Cell types include leukocytes and platelets, and in some cases
      spermatozoa, which leads to infertility.

      Soluble antigens will coat erythtrocytes, latex, and gelatin particles.
      IgG-coated latex agglutination is a clinical test for testing for
      rheumatoid factors.

    <h2>Immunoassay for Ab Using Solid-Phase Ag</h2>
    <p>
      Assays of this configuration usually have a 3-step analysis. First Ag is
      bound to a plastic tube (immunotube) or surface of microtiter plate well.
      To block sites that might react nonspecifically with antibody (in serum)
      to be added at the next step, a blocking protein mixture is added (maybe
      albumin or milk proteins). The antiserum is then added and incubated.
      Followed by a labeled anti-Ig. For example in the assay of DNA
      autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythromatosis (SLE), a microwell is
      coated with DNA, then the test serum added. Bound antibody is then
      estimated with
      <sup>125</sup>
      I-labeled purified rabbit anti-human IgG. In the radioallergosorbetn test
      (RAST) for IgE antibodies, the allergen (e.g., pollen extract) is
      covalently bound to immunoabsorbent, in this case a paper disk. this is
      then incubated with patient serum. Labeled anti-IgE is now added to
      estimate the allergen.

      As to labels used, while radioisotopes are sensitive, there is loss of
      this detectability because of decay. In addition, radioisotope handling
      over the long term might adversely affect the technician. Horseradish
      peroxidase (HRP) and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (AP) are popular,
      while
      <i>Aspergillus niger</i>
      glucose oxidase, soybean urease, and
      <i>E coli</i>
      β-galactosidase. Even the AP reaction can be amplified by using a
      substrate like NADP to produce NAD which can now act as coenzyme for
      second enzyme system.

      Additional labels are streptococcal protein G and staphylococcal protein
      A. Use of biotin allows later binding of an enzyme-conjugated avidin or
      strepavidin. Enzyme substrates include those that produce
      chemiluminescence through HRP-catalyzed enhanced luminol. Time
