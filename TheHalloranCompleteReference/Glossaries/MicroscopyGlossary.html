A Glossary of Basic Microscopy


<div class="outerblock">


<p style="margin-top:4em;font-size:83%;">
This glossary was originally created by its maintainer for his own
learning purposes, to keep the maintainer fluent in the terminology
of microscopy and to serve as a strict reference.  For this reason
it is intended that this glossary be authoritative at some level.
As such the definitions contained within are <b>always tentative</b>,
meaning that they are being revised continually so that the meanings,
descriptions, and style of presentation meet the strict and exacting
requirements of the maintainer and the readers (namely you), the purpose
of which is to make the glossary both readable and informative.
Corrections, suggestions, criticisms, and contributions are
not only welcome, but they are
<a href="mailto:mavigozler@yahoo.com?subject=Microscopy%20Glossary%20Correction%2FCriticism%2FSuggestion%2FContribution">requested</a>.

<p>Note that the phrase &ldquo;Basic Microscopy&rdquo; is used.  This is
not a complete glossary for all of microscopy.  Little or no reference
to terms in <b>atomic force microscopy</b> or <b>electron microscopy</b>
is made because at the moment, I have little or no interest in these
techniques, and certainly no knowledge of them.  The terms in this
glossary are usually for light and fluorescence microscopy and their
associated techniques (including confocal).
<p>
For all unique contributions or revisions to the glossary,
the names of all contributers or revisers will be made a part of
this glossary unless inclusion of the name is withheld explicitly by request.

<dl>

<dt>Achroplan
 <dd>an objective lens set which, according to Zeiss, is of
<a href="#good">good</a> quality, has good field flatness,
is water-immersible, and optimized for infrared spectroscopy

<dt>compound microscope
 <dd>a microscope which features a series of lens, one of which is
an objective and an <a href="#eyepiece">eyepiece</a>.


<dt id="confocal">confocal microscopy
 <dd>a very high resolution form of light (including fluorescence)
microscopy which uses laser light and a very small depth of field to
re-create a 3-dimensional view or representation of imaged object

<dt>contrast
 <dd>[to be defined]

<dt>diaphragm
 <dd>see <a href="#stop">stop</a>

<dt>dichroic mirror
 <dd>see <a href="#filterset">filter set</a>

<dt>epi-illumination
 <dd>[to be defined]

<dt>epifluorescence
 <dd>[to be defined]

<dt>eyepiece
 <dd>an alternative name for <a href="#ocular">ocular</a>
<p class="detail">
Expert microscopists at Zeiss regularly use the term <b>eyepiece</b> instead
of <b>ocular</b>.

<dt>filter cube
 <dd>see <a href="#filterset">filter set</a>

<dt id="filterset">filter set
 <dd>an arrangement of three filters used in fluorescence microscopy that
generates excitation light through the first filter, reflects that light
via a dichroic mirror down into the objective from which the emitted light
is taken back into the objective

<dt>iris diaphragm
 <dd>see <a href="#stop">stop</a>

<dt>luminous field stop
 <dd>an iris diaphragm placed usually immediately next to the light
source

<dt>N.A.
 <dd>see <a href="#numaper">numerical aperture</a>

<dt id="numaper">numerical aperture
 <dd>a dimensionless value

<dt>Plan Apochromat
 <dd>an objective lens set which, according to Zeiss, is of
<a href="#good">excellent</a> quality, with the best field flatness,
best correction, and is ideal for confocal spectroscopy

<dt>Plan Neofluar
 <dd>an objective lens set which, according to Zeiss, is of
<a href="#good">excellent</a> quality, with the best field flatness,
best correction, and is ideal for confocal spectroscopy

<dt><a name="reflight"></a>reflected light path
 <dd>a path of light intended to view the specimen via light focused
from the objective on to the specimen, with its (back)scattered
or reflected light collected by the objective
 <p class="detail">
In reflected light path microscopy, the optical path starts
from the light source which is then reflected
by mirrors (possibly focusing mirrors) and into reflecting mirrors
(in fluorescence, it is a filter cube or filter set) to pass light
through the objective on to the specimen, from which the
reflected or back-scattered light is collected back into the objective
for viewing.
<p>
Reflected light path microscopy is used by the biologist typically
for fluorescence.  The term <a href="#epifluor">epifluorescence</a>
refers to the use of excitation light passed through the objective
to illuminate the specimen from which the emitted light is collected
back through the objective for viewing.
<p>
Compare this to <a href="#reflight">reflected light path</a>.

<dt>resolution
 <dd>[to be defined]

<dt id="stop">stop
 <dd>a diaphragm, usually a continuously adjustable iris diaphragm,
which determines the amount of light that passes through an optical
path and which can have a significant effect on contrast, resolution,
and depth of field
 <p class="detail">
A stop used in optics has several effects.  In  both photography and
microscopy, a smaller diameter stop (a higher f/stop value for focused
beams) produces a greater depth of field in the focal plane of
imaged objects, as well as producing greater contrast.  However,
as this also reduces the numerical aperture, which is an expression,
of resolution, resolution is thus reduced.

<dt id="translight">transmitted light path
 <dd>a path of light intended to view the specimen via light transmitted
after focusing through a condenser lens and then collected via an
objective
 <p class="detail">
Transmitted light path microscopy is the typical method of microscopy.
The optical path starts from the light source which is then reflected
by mirrors (possibly focusing mirrors) to a condenser lens that focuses
all light to a spot on a stage containing a slide with a specimen, and
the light transmitted through is collected by an objective and then
reflected into oculars for viewing by the observer, or through an
adapter lens into a camera.  Compare this to <a href="#reflight">reflected
light path</a>.
