This glossary was originally created by its maintainer for his own learning 
purposes, to keep the maintainer fluent in the terminology and basic concepts 
important in the understand of computational chemistry.  For this reason it is 
intended that this glossary be authoritative at some level. As such the 
definitions contained within are <b>always tentative</b>, meaning that they are 
being revised continually so that the meanings, descriptions, and style of 
presentation meet the strict and exacting requirements of the maintainer and the 
readers (namely you), the purpose of which is to make the glossary both readable 
and informative. Corrections, suggestions, criticisms, and contributions are not 
only welcome, but they are <a 
href="mailto:mavigozler@yahoo.com?subject=Computational%20Chemistry%20Glossary%20Correction%2FCriticism%2FSuggestion%2FContribution">requested</a>. For all unique 
contributions or revisions to the glossary, the names of all contributers or 
revisers will be made a part of this glossary unless inclusion of the name is 
withheld explicitly by request.

<dt>arg</dt>
 <dd>a <b>function</b> which when evaluated represents the <a href="#phase">phase</a>
of a complex number plotted in a complex plane.  For the complex number
<i>z</i> = <i>x + iy</i> = <i>r</i> cos <i>&theta;</i> + <i>ir</i> sin <i>&theta;</i>,
the value of <b>arg</b>(<i>z</i>) is <i>&theta;</i>.  Note that <i>r</i> 
= |<i>z</i>|, which is the <a href="#modulus">modulus</a> of the complex number
<i>z</i>.
</dd>

<dt>axiom</dt>
 <dd>a proposition regarded as true in a self-evident manner and without
 proof;  compare to <a href="#conjecture">conjecture</a> (hypothesis) in that
 the statement is true but it is not self-evident
 </dd>

<dt>conjecture</dt>
 <dd>
  <ol>
  <li>a statement that appears to be true but which has not yet been proved
(or shown as a proof) or disproved</li>
  <li> a conclusion drawn by the <a href="#induction">inductive 
  process</a>...an <q>educated guess</q></li>
  <li> a proposition consistent with known data, but neither verified nor
   shown to be false</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Synonymous with <b>hypothesis</b></p>
  

</dd>

<dt>corollary</dt>
 <dd>
  <ol>
  <li> a <a href="#theorem">theorem</a> which results from a previously shown
theorem that is not shown with rigorous proof </li>
  <li> the immediate consequence of a result already proved:  an expression of
   complicated theorem but in a language simpler to use and apply </li>
  </ol>
</dd>

<dt id="deduction">deductive reasoning</dt>
 <dd>the use of logic (valid argumentation) in order to arrive at conclusion
 such that, if the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false in any
 case; compare <a href="#induction">inductive reasoning</a>
</dd>

<dt id="induction">inductive reasoning</dt>
 <dd>Making general conclusions about some process or property based 
 on the observation of specific examples, identifying trends, and generalizing;
 it relies on observing patterns but makes no attempt to prove that the pattern
  applies in all cases; compare <a href="#deduction">deductive reasoning</a>
 </dd>

<dt>law</dt>
 <dd>a mathematical statement that is always true empirically and by proof</dd>

<dt>lemma</dt>
 <dd>a result shown to be true by proof which is used establish a more
important result that is a <a href="#theorem">theorem</a> 
(proposition)
 </dd>


<dt>postulate</dt>
 <dd>a statement regarded (taken) as true without a demonstration of proof;
  postulates are used (as premises) to construct/build/demonstrate/derive
  <a href="#lemma">lemmas</a> and <a href="#theorem">theorem</a>
</dd>

<dt>principle</dt>
 <dd>a term used broadly in reference to a postulate, theorem, and so on</dd>

<dt>proof</dt>
 <dd>a rigorous mathematical argument which unequivocally demonstrates the truth
of a given <a href="#proposition">proposition</a>, after which the proven is
regarded as <a href="#theorem">theorem</a>
 </dd>

<dt id="proposition">proposition</dt>
 <dd>a mathematical statement that will be proved, or shown to be true by
construction of a proof, after which it will be regarded as a
 <a href="#theorem"><b>theorem</b></a></dd>

<dt id="theorem">theorem</dt>
 <dd>a statement that has been proposed and shown to be true by a proof
</dd>
