<dt id="affinity">affinity
 <dd>the strength 

<dt id="antibody">antibody
 <dd>a special biomolecule that has a binding affinity

<dt id="antigen">antigen
 <dd>a mass usually of molecular scale, ranging from simple biomolecule,
to macromolecular assembly to subcellular organelle to even larger structure
that is necessary and sufficient for binding to an antibody, and necessary
but not sufficient for eliciting an antibody response;  antigens that
elicit an antibody response are <a href="#immunogenic">immunogenic</a>

<dt id="antigenic">antigenic
 <dd>possessing sufficient properties to be able to bind to an antibody

<dt id="antigenicity">antigenicity
 <dd>have the quality of being <a href="#antigenic">antigenic</a>

<dt id="avidity">avidity
 <dd>also called <b>functional affinity</b>, it is measure of the total strength
of all the antibodies that bind to an antigen;  the antigen must be polyvalent
(multiple epitopes) and the antibody response must be polyclonal

<dt>avidity testing
 <dd>a test used to distinguish between <a href="#primary-infect">primary</a> 
and <a href="#secondary-infect">secondary</a> infections:  with primary 
infections, the polyclonal response is such that there are many antibodies
with widely varying affinities for the antigens;  the B lymphocytes (plasma
cells) of the lower affinity antibodies are not expected to maintain memories
however, and only the clones producing higher affinity antibodies will be 
maintained, so with chronic infection, re-infection, or re-activation of an 
infection

<dt>CDR
 <dd>an abbreviation for <a href="#cdr">complimentarity determinant region</a>

<dt id="cell-mediated">cell-mediated immunity
 <dd>

<dt id="cytomegalovirus">cytomegalovirus
 <dd>

<dt id="epitope">epitope
 <dd>that part of the antigen that is necessary and sufficient for binding
to the <a href="#paratope">paratope</a> of the immunoglobulin molecule;
the typical biochemical structure of an epitope will be the <q>proximity</q>
or <q>presentation</q> of 5 or 6 amino acids or glycan monomers in space:
note that this does not imply that residues/monomers are serially bonded
to each other, but rather that they present a <q>face</q> which the immune
system will see as <q>foreign</q> and thus become activated to provide
humoral or cell-mediated immunity

<dt>F<sub>ab</sub>
 <dd>refers to <a href="#f-ab">fraction antigen-binding</a>

<dt>F&prime;<sub>ab</sub>
 <dd>refers to <a href="#f-ab-prime">fraction antigen-binding prime</a>

<dt>F<sub>c</sub>
 <dd>symbol for <a href="#f-c">fraction crystallizable</a>

<dt id="f-ab">fraction antigen-binding
 <dd>the part of the <a href="#pepsin">pepsin</a>-digested immunoglobulin 
molecule that is able to retain the function of binding to the antigen.
Pepsin effectively makes a single cut in the <a href=#hinge-region">hinge</a>
region of the Ig molecule which separates the H chains whose sequence is
constant among all heavy chains of a particular Ig class, and the 


<dt id="f-c">
 <dd> part of the immunoglobulin molecule after it has been digested with the protease
<a href="#pepsin">pepsin</a>

<dt>FR
 <dd>abbreviation used for <a href="#framework-region">framework region</a>

<dt id="framework-region">framework region
 <dd>regions corresponding to the amino acid sequences of the variable regions of 
both the light and heavy chains in the immunoglobulin that are not involved in 
the physical contact of antigen binding, which are the <a href="#cdr">CDR</a> 
structures, but are adjacent to, contain, and provide the structural base for 
the CDRs

<dt>functional affinity
 <dd>see <a href="#avidity">avidity</a>

<dt>H chain
 <dd>the <a href="#heavy-chain">heavy chain</a> of the 
<a href="#immunoglobulin">immunoglobulin</a> molecule

<dt id="hapten">hapten

 <dd>

<dt id="herpes-simplex">Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)
 <dd>

<dt id="hiv">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
 <dd>

<dt id="humoral">humoral immunity
 <dd>a general reference to that part of the immune system that provides
for immune protection using the antibody.  Antibodies are biomolecules 
usually soluble in physiologically correct biofluids, including sites of
inflammation, in which fluid accumulation occurs, or in alternative
phrasing, in which <q>humors</q> form;

<dt>Ig
 <dd>an abbreviation for <a href="#immunoglobulin"><b>immunoglobulin</b></a>

<dt id="ig-a">IgA
 <dd>an abbreviation for the <a href="#ig-class">class</a> <b>A</b> of the antibody 
(molecule) that functions in 

<dt id="ig-d">IgD
 <dd>

<dt id="ig-e">IgE
 <dd>

<dt id="ig-g">IgG
 <dd>an abbreviation for the <a href="#ig-class">class</a> <b>G</b> of the 
antibody (molecule) that functions primarily in combating pathogens in 
infectious disease and protecting against foreign molecules that are found in 
the serous and interstitial fluid space, which are most of the tissues of the 
body contained within epithelial barriers;  it is composed of two heavy (H) 
chains which bond to each other, and two light (L) chains, each of which bond
to one H chain in the F<sub>ab</sub> region; one H chain is about 50 kDa and
one L chain is half that (~25 kDa) and the total native MW is 150 kDa.
Many cell types, particularly phagocytic cells, have receptors for the 
F<sub>c</sub> component of the IgG molecule

<dt id="ig-m">IgM
 <dd>an abbreviation for the <a href="#ig-class">class</a> <b>G</b> of the 
antibody (molecule) that, like <a href="#ig-g">IgG</a>, functions primarily in 
combating pathogens in infectious disease

<dt id="immunogenic">immunogenic
 <dd>an antigen that is able to elicit an antibody response, that is an antigen 
able to stimulate the immune system cells that produce antibodies against that 
antigen;  factors that affect immunogenicity in an antigen include its size and 
its (bio)chemical complexity (proteins and polysaccharides, not so much lipids 
or polynucleotides)

<dt id="immunogenicity">immunogenicity
 <dd>an antigen that has the quality of being <a 
   href="#immunogenic">immunogenic</a>

<dt id="immunoglobulin">immunoglobulin
 <dd>

<dt id="immunoglobulin">immunoglobulin class
 <dd>

<dt id="incidence">incidence
 <dd>An expression of the rate in which a condition (disease, disorder, etc)
is presented within a specific time period.  In clinical biostatistics, the
count of new cases of the condition within a particular time frame/period is
determined, and this is divided to express the incidence as a ratio or percentage
or as the count per 100,000 individiuals within the population in which it was
counted.  Suppose that a country has a population of 20 million, and that within
a year within that population, 5000 cases of a condition were found.  Thus
the incidence is 5000 / 20,000,000 = 0.00025 = 0.025%.  To calculate the
per 100,000 rate, solve the equation:  5000 / 20,000,000 = <i>x</i> / 100,000 for the
unknown <i>x</i>, which is 25.  Thus the incide 25 cases per 100,000 per year.

<dt>L chain
 <dd>the <a href="#light-chain">light chain</a> of the 
<a href="#immunoglobulin">immunoglobulin</a> molecule

<dt id="light-chain">light chain
 <dd>

<dt id="paratope">paratope
 <dd>that part of the immunoglobulin molecule that is necessary and sufficient
for the binding of the epitope on the antigen

<dt id="parvo-b19">Parvovirus B19
 <dd>a virus

<dt id="prevalence">prevalence
 <dd>An expression of the proportion of individuals having a condition (disease, 
disorder, etc) at any given time.  In clinical biostatistics, this is usually 
determined dividing the count of individuals with the condition by the count of 
individuals studied.  Thus if 1000 people were randomly selected within the 
inclusion criteria of a study, and 56 of them had the condition, then the 
prevalence = 56 / 1000 = 0.056 = 5.6%.  Either the ratio/proportion or its 
percentage is correct in expressing prevalance.  For a prevalence is computed
to be lower than 0.001 (or 0.1%), it is more common to express the value as
the number of individuals per 100,000 individuals counted.

<dt id="rubella">Rubella
 <dd>Also called <b>German measles</b>, 

<dt id="rubeola">Rubeola
 <dd>a virus

<dt>TORCH
 <dd>An acronym which refers to a group of clinically significant infections
occurring in pregnant women in which the pathogen can be transmitted to 
developing embryos and fetuses and either result in stillbirth or developmental
abnormalities.  TORCH refers to five classes of these infections:
