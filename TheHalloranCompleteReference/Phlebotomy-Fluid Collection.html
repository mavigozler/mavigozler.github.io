<p>
This whole blood support medium had been used at one time for preservation
of donated blood.  Blood stored 14 days had an RBC survival rate of 85% or
more, and 70% or more for up to 24 days.

<h3>Bulk Solution</h3>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>
The following recipe can be used to preserve and prevent clotting of 500 mL of 
whole blood (1 unit for transfusion/banking purposes). The water quality for 
making the solution should be at least Type I grade, and preferably water 
suitable for cell culture should be the ideal.

<p>
The following equipment and materials which will make the preparation process 
easy are:

<ul>
<li>Glassware
  <ul>
  <li>125 or 250 mL beaker (cleaned as indicated below)
  <li>100 ml graduated cylinder (cleaned as the beaker)
  </ul>
<li>Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (fits into 100 mL beaker) with
    stirrer
<li>Electronic balance sensitive to 0.001 g measurements
<li>Weighing boats or glassine paper
<li>Stainless steel weighing spatula(s)
</ul>

<p>
Weigh out the following into a clean 125 or 250 mL beaker (rinsed with Type I 
grade water) containing 75 mL of stirring cell culture grade (or Type I) water:

<ol>
<li>2.2 g trisodium citrate (dihydrate)
(Na<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>9</sub>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O
or<br>CH(OH)(COONa)C(OH)(COONa)CH(OH)(COONa)&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O)
<li>0.80 g citric acid (monohydrate)
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>9</sub>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O
or<br>CH(OH)(COOH)C(OH)(COOH)CH(OH)(COOH)&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O)
<li>2.45 g dextrose [D-glucose] (monohydrate)
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O)
</ol>

<p>
When dissolved, bring the volume up to 100.0 mL with water solvent in a clean 
100 mL graduated cylinder.  Pour it back into the beaker to further mix it 
again.  Filter it through a 0.22 &micro;m sterile filter into a clean storage 
container for the volume prepared:  if preparing larger volumes of ACD, a vacuum 
filtration setup may be used and fitted with a 0.22 &micro;m membrane.  The 
receiver flask should be meticulously cleaned as all containers which hold the 
ACD solution! (Perhaps such containers could even be dedicated to preparing this 
solution or solutions requiring special cleanliness, if this is to be a routine 
activity) . For small volumes, serial filtration using a large syringe (10 ml) 
fitted with a membrane cartridge/cassette is convenient.  The type of membrane 
used to filter ACD does not matter most likely:  most membranes are compatible 
(unreactive) with a solution like ACD;  polysulfone or nylon (N-66) might be 
preferable, but nitrocellulose will probably work just as well, if the blood is 
not be used for transfusion purposes. As a precaution, a little of the ACD 
solution can be passed through any filter membrane first and this initial 
filtrate discarded with the idea that it may have liberated any impurities or 
substances that might negatively affect the whole blood constituents.

<p>
If a unit of whole blood is to be collected, use 67.5 mL ACD added to a 500 mL 
(1 unit) collection bag.

<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>
If the ACD is not to be distributed immediately into blood collection tubes,
the bulk solution can be stored in a cool place or even refrigerated
(at 2-8&#176; C) for an indefinite period (as much as three years).
<p>
As with even the most stable solutions however, it is wiser to prepare only the 
amount necessary that will last a half-year to a year.  A formal process 
requires that you keep information about the date of preparation and even assign 
the preparation a lot number for reference.

<h3>Use in Blood Collection</h3>

<h4>Distribution to Collection Tubes</h4>

<p>
The general rule is that 1 volume of ACD is mixed with 6-8 volumes of whole 
blood to produce the properly iso-osmotic/isotonic blood draw. Indeed, it is 
quite important to obtain the proper blood draw since ACD is used to preserve 
blood cell survival, and proper concentrations are essential.  The table below 
lists the volumes of ACD necessary to add to the standard blood collection tubes 
and the amount of the blood draw required to obtain proper mixing.  It is 
important that it be emphasized to the phlebotomists to make the necessary exact 
blood draw volume:  a label or mark placed on the tube to specify exactly how 
much blood is to be added to properly fill the tube is essential.

  <td>1.5

<p>
Note that by convention, ACD tubes are fitted with a yellow-colored stopper. If 
the tube is fitted with a stopper of another color, it is absolutely necessary 
to label the tube to indicate that it really contains ACD as a whole blood 
preservative.

<h4>Storage of Collection Tubes</h4>
<p>
Long-term storage of ACD-filled tubes is identical to the long-term storage
of bulk solution.  Refrigerated products probably last longer intuitively
than those stored at room temperature;  it is probably not necessary
to freeze any ACD solution, no matter what the container.  In general,
tubes can be stored in a cool place if stored in ambient temperature.
<p>
One product manufacturer of ACD-containing transfusion unit bags indicates an 
shelf life of three years for the product (the need for certain storage 
conditions were unknown).  It is safe to say that ACD is quite stable for at 
least that period.
