	</b>
	<p>Glutamine originally found in beet root juice by Schulze and Bosshard in 1883. Deamidation of Gln occurs very readily at neutral pH and esp. under mildly alkaline or acidic conditions in which it is cyclized to pyroglutamic acid, a lactam which is pyrrolid-2-one carboxylic acid. The cyclic product was first described as a derivative of Glu by Menozzi and Appianin in 1892, obtained by heating Glu powder at 180-190�, close to the melting point. Wilson &amp; Cannan have shown that when at constant pH, dehydration of Glu follows a reversible first-order process. At pH 7, equilibrium favors complete dehydration, although the kinetic rate is quite slow with 1% conversion in 2-3 h at 100�. At pH 4 or 10, the reaction is 98% complete in 50 h. But in strongly acidic (&gt;2M HCl) or alkaline (&gt;0.5 M NaOH), hydrolysis of the cyclic product is rapid and practically complete. Others have shown that ring closure is dependent upon pH. At pH 6.5, equilibrium favors the ring, with Glu being increased with acid or alkaline solutions. Phosphate ions accelerate lactam formation at pH 6.5 as compared with citrate, acetate, or lactate.</p>
	<p>Deamidation of Gln is achieved either enzymatically by <i>glutaminase</i> or nonenzymatically, but the enzymatic reaction yields Glu and NH3, while the nonenzymatic yields the pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid and NH3.</p>

		<p align="CENTER">Selective oxidation and reduction of methionine residues in peptides and proteins by oxygen exchange between sulfoxide and sulfide</p>
	</b>
	<p>INTRO. Chloramine-T and N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) at neutral or slightly alkaline pH have been shown to cause the oxidation of methionine to its sulfoxide in proteins with no -SH groups, and they will only oxidize methionine. Periodate, hydrazoic acid, iodination, photooxidation, mild brominating agents, and hydrogen peroxide were less selective, modifying other oxidizable groups. Chloramine-T is 4- to 5-times more reactive to cysteinyl -SH than to methionine, and in acidic mixtures, will also oxidize tryptophanyl residues. This study explores the chemical conversions of Met as an amino acid and component of protein.</p>
	<p>RESULTS. Methionine conversion to its sulfoxide by Me2SO (DMSO) under various conditions was examined. 0.2 mM Met in the presence of 0.2 M DMSO for 2 h at room temp with different catalytic environments. The tested environments are water, sodium bicarbonate at 0.1 M, pH 8.5, HCl at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 M, and acetic acid at 1 and 5 M. There was no conversion in water, alkaline sodium bicarbonate, or in 1 M acetic acid. There was only slight conversion with 5 M acetic acid (20%) and 0.01 M HCl (8%), but even more dramatic conversion with increased acidity: 70% with 0.1 M HCl and complete (100%) with 1 M HCl. Hence strong acidity coupled with a mechanism mediated by chloride-anion oxidation is the catalyst for conversion. This is suggested by successful results with other chlorinating compounds, Chloramine-T and NCS.</p>
	<p>A mixture of amino acids (D,T,S,E,P,G,A,half-cystine,V,M,I,L,Y,F,K,H,R,cysteic acid,M: 0.5 mM) was made 2 M and 1 M with respect to HCl and DMSO, resp. Reaction was done for 3 hr at 25� and recovery of each amino acid measured. There was virtual 100% recovery for all amino acids intact, even cysteine, except for cysteic acid and methionine, where its sulfoxide was recovered 100% (0% sulfone form). Monitoring the UV spectrum of N-acetyltryptophan during the reaction helped determine whether Trp is truly modified: after 2 h under the same conditions, there is no change in spectral character. When chloramine-T is added to the quartz cell, the peak at 280 nm falls rapidly indicating conversion of the tryptophanyl side chain to 2-oxyindolealanine. As to temperature effects, others have shown the DMSO/HCl conditions are selective for Met even at elevated temperatures (at 50� and 100�).</p>
	<p>In a further measure as to what effect there is on the free -SH groups, 3.6 mM reduced glutathione was incubated several hours in water, 10% N,N-dimethylformamide, 1.2 M HCl or at two different concentrations of DMSO/HCl. Only after 2 h does oxidation of glutathione by the DMSO/HCl medium occur (already 100% complete with Met). There was no observed oxidation in the other media.</p>
	<p>DMSO was added in large excess (25-250 M) to methionine in 1 M HCl. The oxidation was pseudo-first order with a rate of 0.23 � 0.01 M-1 s-1 at 22�. Quantitative conversion occurred within 30 min. Even at 10 M excess was quantitative conversion observed. At 4 M excess, conversion was 50%.</p>
	<p>Oxidation of Met in di- and tripeptides and in proteins by DMSO/HCl was examined. In all cases (Met, Met-Val, Met-Asp, Met-Phe, Met-Phe-Gly, the proteins ACTH, glucagon, a-lactalbumin) the Met residues were 100% converted to the sulfoxide. Only in bovine pancreatic ribonuclease was conversion &lt;100% (25%), but since only one Met in four is oxidized by other oxidizing agents, it only demonstrates that the DMSO/HCl can not penetrate buried Met residues any better than the other agents. The alpha-lactalbumin protein was reduced to break its four disulfide bonds: in the DMSO/HCl oxidizing system, only Met was converted and the free -SH groups did not change.</p>
	<p>Reduction of Met sulfoxide by Me2S (DMS) was examined as well: the reaction appeared to require high concentrations of HCl in order to occur. With 0.5 M DMS and 89 �M MetSO present in all reactions, with 1.0 M HCl, only 10% conversion to Met is seen after 40 min. With 4.4 M HCl, 50% conversion occurs after 10 min and appears complete after 30 min. With 10.7 M HCl, reaction is very rapid: 50% by 5 min and 100% done in 16 min. The same pattern of reduction of MetSO in alpha-lactalbumin is observed as it was for free MetSO.</p>
	<p>When the Met of insulin was oxidized to MetSO, there was no irreversible denaturation of the hormone and no change in its biological activity. On the other hand oxidation of Met in ACTH causes it to retain only 4% of the native activity. When the oxidized derivative is exposed to 10.3 M HCl/0.3 M DMS for 15 min at 37�, nearly full reactivation of biological properties is observed.</p>

	<p>[These notes are not entered in any order, but abstracted at will.]</p>
	<p>With manual sequencing there are basically two methods, the <i>partition</i> and the <i>film</i> method.</p>
	<p>The partition method is good for small peptides up to a dozen residues, or peptides which would wash out using the film method. The partition method is not recommended for large peptides or proteins. Partitioning in general gives better recoveries for Ser and Thr, lower extractive yields of Arg, is more work and time-consuming. While the film method is preferable, the materials best for filming are also best for automatic sequencing. A sequencing standard such as insulin B should always be included with each batch of samples.</p>
	<p>The film method is essentially the same as used in spinning-cup and gas-phase automated sequencers. Rather than a lower aqueous phase, a layer of peptide and Polybrene (a hydrated carrier) is found. Since polarity is the discriminating property of extraction, the organic solvent should remove hydrophobic products without removing peptide. Samples to be filmed are ideally salt- and detergent-free; it is good idea to prepare such samples by RP-HPLC in a volatile buffer system, exhaustively dialyzing in 50% EtOH (even if the sample precipitates), or precipitating sample from concentrated aqueous solution with acetone or MeCN or from a small volume of formic acid (HFo) with ethyl acetate. HFo and hexafluoroacetone trihydrate (HFA) are good general solvents for sample transfer. (Note while HFA is more toxic and expensive, it is gentler and compatible with long-term storage.)</p>
	<b>
		<p>Partition Method</p>
	</b>
	<p>Dissolve 50 pmol to 5 nmol sample in 5-50 �l dilute acid in water or aqueous alcohol. While HFo is an effective solvent, the peptide should not be stored in it. Redry the sample from 5-10 �l EtOH:TEA:water (2:2:1) to remove ammonia.</p>
	<b></b>
	<p><b>Step 1. Thiocarbamylation (coupling).</b> Add 10 �l freshly prepared EtOH:TEA:water:PITC (7:1:1:1) to the dry peptide and mix, but do not splash anything high in the tube. Reagents may be added to tubes with the 25 ml incubation vial and mixed by cautious lateral shaking and tilting. Incubate 8-10 at 50�, under N2 if preferred, although it seems to make no difference. With DMF as the solvent (3 min, 50�), reaction is faster but more by-products are observed. Trimethylamine (TMA) as an amine catalyst is not as good as TEA. Vacuum dry until all PITC is gone (it will <i>look</i> dry given no salt accumulation), which takes 5-10 min at room temp and 2-4 min at 50�, which is arranged by locating part of the vacuum system above the heating block.</p>
	<b></b>
	<p><b>Step 2. Washing.</b> Add 2.5 �l water low into the tube and ~200 �l heptane:EA (15:1) containing 0.5% TMA (serves to exchange TEA, creating a more hydrophilic, less extractable, peptide salt). Vortex and centrifuge briefly. Decant upper phase, being careful not to tip tube such that lower phase decants. Wash 2-3 X in same manner with heptane:EA (7:1) without amine. Now is a good time to add internal standard to normalize analytical results. Vacuum until quite dry.</p>
	<b></b>
	<p><b>Step 3. Cleavage.</b> Add low into tube 5 �l concentrated HCl (11-12 M) with a glass capillary or plastic needle syringe. (One can add acid high to tube then centrifuge: this may reduce chances of cross-contamination.) Mix (avoid splashing), let stand 5 min at 22� or 1.5-2 min at 50�. Although not essential, an inert atmosphere may improve efficiency and or background. While almost all residues cleave well at room temperature, Pro-X bonds require 50� treatment. Using a vacuum port different from the one used to dry the coupling medium, pull vacuum carefully to avoid bumping and leave on a full vacuum 3-5 min at 22�.</p>
	<b></b>
	<p><b>Step 4.</b> <b>Stabilization.</b> Add 5-10 �l MeOH and incubate 3 min at 50�. This opens the thiazolinone product of cleavage and prevents it from hydrolyzing in Step 5, which would prevent the extraction of His and Arg. This step is not absolutely necessary if Arg or His are not in the peptide. Vacuum dry.</p>
	<b></b>
	<p><b>Step 5.</b> <b>Extraction.</b> Add 4 �l water and 40 �l benzene/MeCN, 2:1, mix well, and centrifuge. Heptane:EA (1:5) can be used instead if one worries more about the toxic benzene than the peroxide-prone EA. Decant the upper phase carefully in 6 X 50 mm tubes containing 50 nmol thiourea in 2-5 �l MeOH. Extract now with 40 �l 0.02 M HFA, 0.016 M TMA in benzene:MeCN (2:1), combining the extracts. When processing a batch of samples, be compulsively organized to prevent errors: line up the extraction tubes in order in the microtiter plate and line up the sequencing tubes in a parallel row; always use the same hand to grasp each kind of tube, in the same order, and proceed systematically along the rows. If a peptide contains no very polar residues, a decrease in the strength of the extraction solvent may give less washout and, therefore, higher recoveries toward the end of the peptide (e.g., heptane:EA 1:2). Dry lower phase and return <i>N</i>-1 peptide to Step 1.</p>
	<b></b>
	<p><b>Step 6. Conversion.</b> Extract is dried carefully with weak vacuum or aspirator, then with full vacuum. Add 15-20 �l 1 <i>N</i> HCl/MeOH and incubate 65� for 10 min, or the same volume of 2 <i>N</i> HCl/MeOH and 10 min at 50�. Note if the analytical system does not accomodate Asp or Glu methyl esters, use 25% aqueous TFA at 65� instead.</p>
