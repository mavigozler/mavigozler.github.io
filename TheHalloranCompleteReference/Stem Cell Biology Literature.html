Osteogenesis in Transplants of Bone Marrow Cells
<p class="Para1">
Denis (1958) showed that heterotopic transplantation of bone
marrow (to subcutaneous tissue) caused loss of hematopoiesis in
the graft, which developed reticular tissue and later bone.
<p>
Marrow cells from C57BL mice were placed in HBSS and filtered through
Capron net to eliminate clumps.  At 2 million/ml, the cells are
placed in diffusion chambers having two sizes constructed of
Millipore HA 0.45&nbsp;&mu;m filters and Plexigas rings (4 mm thickness)
that fit within one another:  one was 10 and 14 mm, the other
3.2 and 7 mm.  Chambers are sterilized with 70% ethanol, rinsed
in sterile water, the HBSS.  Cells were placed in the larger filter
ring, sandwiched by the smaller filter ring.
Besides pieces of bone marrow, spongy bone and pieces of blood vessels
were included in some experiments.  After the incubation time,
the Gomori reaction for ALP was used to assess osteogenesis.
<p>
In the experiments where spongy bone and vasculature were included,
the Gomori stained positive.  Residual bone marrow was negative for
ALP however, and bone trabeculae became necrotic, with osteocyte death
evident.  The bone surface lost a cover layer of osteoblasts.  A broad
zone of hematopoietic and reticular tissue proliferated in the chamber.
After some time, actively proliferating fibroblast-like elements
were evident in many layers.  Osteogenic foci with larger cells
being Gomori-positive in both cytoplasm and matrix appear in the 3rd day.
To the 8th day, the foci did not increase, but mineralized matrix and
and cellular trabeculae did.
<p>
A marrow suspension whose cell character was defined (11% hemocytoblasts,
33% myeloids, 10% leukocytes, 8% erythroids, 4% monocytes, 34% lymphocytes,
and 0.5% reticular cells) was placed in chamber, distributed even over
the filters, no ALP-positivity found.  By days 2-3, filters were
covered with fibroblast-like and hematopoietic cells.  Solitary
well-defined foci consisted of young hematopoietic myeloblastic
cells.  Large phosphatase-negative basophilic cells with large
nuclei were found among the fibroblastic cells.
<p>
On day 5&nbsp;there was a decline in degeneration of hematopoietic cells,
and large polygonal cells with oval nuclei and compact dense cytoplasm
formed bands closely packed; these were Gomori-positive.  Between
days 7-12, these became osteogenic foci, osteoblastic, with bone matrix
surrounding them.  No myeloid cells were found in the filters, just
fibroblastic cells.
<p>
Cell count loading had an effect on the development and time of tissue
change.  Empty HA chambers showed no cellular presence after 7 d
posttransplantation into peritoneum.  Chambers made of 0.6-0.9&nbsp;&mu;m
pore AUFS filters are permeable to cells, and in the first few hours
leukocytes were evident in the chamber, with lymphocytes and
fibroblast-like cells or histiocytes following.  There must
be an initial packing density for promotion of osteogenesis as well:
when the larger diffusion chamber is loaded with only 10<sup>5</sup>
cells, osteogenesis is not seen within the incubation period.  10-fold
greater cells in suspension promotes osteogenesis.  The composition
of the suspension is important too:  if the suspension is from marrow
entirely, then osteogenesis occurs, but if the composition is altered
to 10% marrow cells and 90% lymphocytes although the loading density
is sufficient, osteogenesis still does not occur.

Structure of Fibrinogen and Degradation Products of Fibrinogen and Fibrin
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.
The structure/shape of fibrinogen (Fbg) was determined until the 1970s by
hydrodynamic measurements and by electron microscopy.  Hall &amp; Slater (1959)
proposed a linear trinodal shape.  Freeze-etching visualization
suggested a bent-rod/sausage structure with 9 &times; 45 nm proportions.
K&ouml;ppel used negative staining to reveal a 24 nm sphere having the
form of a pentagonal dodecahedron.
<p>
Fbg is dimeric (340 kDa), each monomer (170 kDa) possessing three single
polypeptide strands called A&alpha; (67 kDa), B&beta; (58 kDa), and
&gamma; (47 kDa). A&alpha; bonds to &gamma; at an N-terminal disulfide.
A&alpha; and B&beta; bond together with numerous stable and unstable
disulfides.  In fibrinogenesis, thrombin cleaves fibrinopeptides A
and B from A&alpha; and B&beta;, resp., forming a fibrin monomer
that can form the clot.
<p>
There is considerable heterogeneity in the gamma chain, and charge
heterogeneity overall (from differences in phosphorylation).  Size
heterogeneity of A&alpha; may be due to differences in processing
(by plasmin).
<p>
Fbg has 56-58 Cys residues, all involved in intra- or interchain disulfide
bonds.  With nearly 60 Met residues, CNBr analysis can be useful.

Formation of Bone and Cartilage by Marrow Stromal Cells in Diffusion
Chambers <i>In Vivo</i>
<p class="Para1">
Femoral marrow from NZW male rabbits is flushed into 20 mM HEPES-buffered
modified MEM with Earle's, and containing pen/strep (50 U/ml, 50&nbsp;&mu;g/ml),
and serially passed through smaller needles.  Spleen cells were also
obtained from minced tissue and needle passage.  Cultures were in 10% FBS
in medium, changed twice per week.  10-20 million cells are plated in
25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks in 5&nbsp;ml media (2 mm depth).
<p>
Majority of hematopoietic cells are eliminated in first week.  Colonies
are seen after 10-15 days, and total confluence reached in 20-30 days.
1 in 100,000 (0.01%) of cells are the source of colonies, as also shown
by Friedenstein et al.  Colonies consisted of cells either tightly
or loosely packed.  A third colony type considered of smaller size
colony its cells with densely staining nuclei and spread out in single
layer with epithelial-like appearance; these were 2% of marrow cells, but
more common in spleen cultures.  Hematopoietic cells are smaller, rounded
and stain more densely.  All colonies were negative for alkaline phosphatase.
Electron microscopy reveals shows that fibroblastic cells with many
ribosomes and well-developed Golgi bodies; there is evidence of extracellular
matrix collagen deposition.  All these characteristics are typical of
osteoblasts in vivo, except that intracellular glycogen was not found
as in osteogenic cells.
<p>
Diffusion chambers were constructed and several of each loaded with
cultured marrow fibroblasts, total marrow cells, or cultured spleen
fibroblasts, then implanted in the peritonea of rabbits.  Over time
a loose fibrous capsule encloses the chambers.  Sectioning of this
capsule reveals small capillaries in the fibrous tissue.  No vessel
formation was found in cells/tissue with the chambers.  In all instances
of cultured marrow fibroblasts or total marrow cells, bone, cartilage
and fibrous tissue were present, in as little as 21 days and as long
as 47 days.  In no cases in which spleen fibroblasts were used did
this tissue form.
<p>
Sections of femur (bone, cartilage and fibrous tissue) were fixed in
alcohol and embedded in glycol methacrylate and stained in toluidine blue,
alcian blue-chlorantine fast red and Van Gieson.  Von Kossa and alkaline
and acid phosphatase staining were tried as well.  Osteoblasts and their
progenitors showed excellent ALP activity in the epiphyseal cartilage
plate.  In the periosteum and perichondrium, osteoid, osteocytic, and
fibroblastic cells were ALP-negative.  Leukocytes were ALP-positive
but staining was intracytoplasmic.  Osteoclasts and macrophage-appearing
cells were acid phosphatase-positive.  Electron microscopy was extensive
and found typical structure of woven and lamellar bone within the
tissue that was bone-like.  Mineralization was also apparent.

Long-Term Culture of Human Bone Marrow Cells
<p class="Para1">
The marrow source was from the resected ribs of patients undergoing
thoracotomy.  Ribs were cut into 2-3 cm long segments
and placed in cold, calcium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline
containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10 U/ml beef lung heparin.
Two 6-inch blunt-ended forceps were used to pry apart the segments
longitudinally.  Marrow is scraped with the tip of the forcep into
a 10 cm glass or plastic petri which holds 20 ml cold complete
growth medium (Fischer's medium supplemented with 0.1&nbsp;&mu;M hydrocortisone
sodium succinate and 25% horse serum [Flow Labs]).  Marrow clumps were
broken apart by vigorous in-and-out pipetting.  0.04% trypan blue was
used to determine viability, typically found to be 98-100%.  Wright's/
Giemsa-staining showed the marrow to be normal.  1-2 billion nucleated
cells were recovered from each rib.  20 million of these cells were seeded
into 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks containing 10 ml medium.  Culturing was
at 33&deg; with 5% CO<sup>2</sup>.  (33&deg; is superior in promoting
hematopoiesis compared to 37&deg;, although the latter is better for
cultivating a stromal layer.)  Each week 5&nbsp;ml of medium was removed and
replaced with 5&nbsp;ml fresh medium.
<p>
Adipocyte-containing confluent stromal layers were initiated using
Fischer's growth medium supplemented with hydrocortisone and horse serum;
this supports a finding reported by Greenberger.  These cultures can
be maintained for a year, with active hematopoiesis shown by analysis
of the viable nonadherents checked in the 5&nbsp;ml of spent medium.
The serum component could be 25% horse serum or mix of 12.5% horse serum
and 12.5% FBS, with CFU<sub>c</sub> (granuloctye-macrophage progenitor
cells) generating cells for up to 12 weeks, but only 50 in 100,000 cells
being self-renewing.  Neither adipogenesis or hematopoiesis could be sustained
with 25% FBS alone.
<p>
FBS alone will sustain growth of other adherents, but cannot initiate
growth or differentiation of adipocytes.  McCoy's complete medium
(modified McCoy's 5a medium [430-1500], 0.1&nbsp;&mu;M hydrocortisone,
1% NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1% MEM sodium pyruvate solution [320-1360],
1% MEM vitamin solution [320-1120], 0.8% MEM amino acids solution [320-1135],
0.4% MEM nonessential amino acids solution [320-1140], 1% 200 mM Gln,
100 U penicillin and 100&nbsp;&mu;g streptomycin per ml; numbers in brackets
are GIBCO product numbers) containing both FBS and horse serum was
also abundant in initiating and maintaining stromal layers of abundant
adipocytes and also long-term hematopoiesis.  With McCoy's and 25% horse
serum, cultures took longer to reach confluence than those grown with
a mix.
<p>
Long-term cultures generated cells in colonies with two different patterns.
One is a &ldquo;hyperproliferative&rdquo; pattern described by cultures
where the CFU<sub>c</sub> values are 100 per 10<sup>5</sup> cells
in serial assays over several weeks.  The other is a &ldquo;homeostatic&rdquo;
pattern in which a steady-state lower level of CFU<sub>c</sub> value
is 25-75 per 10<sup>5</sup> cells present at a continuous level.
9 rib specimens in the McCoy's plus serum mix produced 4 having
hyperproliferative and 5&nbsp;homeostatic patterns.  Only the homeostatic
pattern was seen with other growth media.  Cell counts of all colonies
no matter what medium at whatever time interval analyzed contained cells
exceeding 500 cells.  After 8 weeks in culture, nonadherent cell counts
recovered each week numbered between 200,000 and 2 million cells, while
before the 7-8 week period, between 1 million and 15 million cells were
recovered; this was seen in both patterns.
<p>
In the first 4 weeks of culture (the initiation period), CFU<sub>c</sub>
values are low.  Dexter et al have reported the necessity of
&ldquo;recharging&rdquo; cultures at 4 weeks by adding fresh marrow.
This is not necessary with the marrow of other species (<i>Tupaia glis</i>).
Recharging did not work in these experiments and was deleterious, either
destroying a stromal microenvironment or decreasing recovered CFU<sub>c</sub>
(cells).  Increases in CFU<sub>c</sub> start after 4-6 weeks, and their
production continues up to 20 weeks.
<p>
Cells form a &ldquo;cobblestone&rdquo; appearance from which nonadherent
cells arise (hematopoiesis).  Adipocytes with a diverse stromal cell
population also arises.  Cultures grown on coverslips were stained with
myeloperoxidase and showed evidence of myeloid and monocytoid cells.
Monocytoid cells were revealed by nonspecific esterase staining, shown
scattered throughout the stromal layer within islands of hematopoiesis
and also within large tight clusters within stromal layer.  The
nonspecific esterase cells were stained more intensively outside the
cobblestone areas.
<p>
The vast majority of nonadherent cells forming in cultures older than 8
weeks and grown in McCoy's or Fisher's only with FBS were mature macrophages,
also a finding of Moore &amp; Sheridan growing human cultures in Fisher's
with HS.  In Fischer's containing only HS or a HS/FBS mix, a smaller number
of nonadherents formed but were immature monocytoid or both immature and
mature myeloid cells.  With McCoy's medium and FBS/HS mix, there were
many more immature myeloid and monocytoid cells, and mature myeloid also.
The myeloid count often exceeded the mature macrophage count in the
McCoy's cultures, unlike in the Fischer's cultures.

Differentiation of Human Bone Marrow-Derived Fibroblastoid Colony
Forming Cells (CFUf)
<p class="Para1">
Morphology of cell/colony growth was observed by Giemsa staining.
In the 1st week cells are arranged in small and &ldquo;loose&rdquo; foci
and are large elongated or fusiform with pale cytoplasm and ovoid nuclei.
In week 2, discrete colonies form and are large enough to appear in stains.
In week 3, colonies fuse as confluence is observed.  No differences in
growth were seen using either McCoy's 5A or Fischer's, whether supplemented
with 5&nbsp;or 15% FBS (McCoy's 5A + 5% FBS was the choice henceforth).
The relationship between colony count (done only on cultures > 2 weeks
and scoring >100 cells in a group as a colony) and the number of cell
plated was linear for the range of 200,000 to 1 million cells.  Size
of colony was reduced in low cell densities.  Hydrocortisone supplementation
at 1&nbsp;&mu;M resulted in colonies with high cell counts and diameters.
There were 98.1 (20% CV) colonies per million cells.  Hydroxyurea had
no effect on this (it usually sharply reduces CFU-GM values).
<p>
CFU-GM varies with certain hematological disorders (aplastic anemia,
hematopoietic dysplasia, chronic myelogenous leukemia).  CFU-F values
however did not show any correlation with CFU-GM, any distinction from
controls.  CFU-F was reduced in aplastic anemia (2 in 8 cases) and
hematopoietic dysplasia (1 in 7 cases) even though CFU-GM was normal.
CFU-F and CFU-GM values in acute myelogenous leukemia also changes
with the state of the disease:  lowered in untreated and induction therapy
AML, and also lowered in many cases in relapse, but raised in most
cases of remission.
<p>
Hydrocortisone supplementation resulted in vacuolated cells that
stained positive with Oil Red O.  Dose dependence was determined
at 0.1, 1, 10, and 100&nbsp;&mu;M, and the serum content and type were
also varied (15% FBS vs. 25% horse serum).  As for colony number
(CFU-F), the greatest response is with 1&nbsp;&mu;M, slightly increased
with either 0.1 or 10&nbsp;&mu;M, and lower than control when 100&nbsp;&mu;M
was used.  This was true for either HS or FBS.  The same results
were seen in determining the size of the colony.  Insofar as adipocytes
either 1 or 10&nbsp;&mu;M HC had the maximal effect.  There were no real
differences in the use of different sera.
<p>
Allogeneic BM cells were plated on to adherents treated with 0.1&nbsp;&mu;M
HC and in the presence of 0.1&nbsp;&mu;M HC.  Total cell number decreased
to below 1/10 of the plated cell count after 3 weeks.  The cells
in suspension also had a different morphology, with granuloid cells
predominating over macrophages.  In contrast, when the marrow cells
are plated to adherent layers containing adipocytes (cells treated
with 1&nbsp;&mu;M HC) and kept in the same HC concentration, the cell count
fell to only 1/4, and granuloid cells still predominated after 6 weeks.

Specific Fibrinogen Quantitation by Electroimmunodiffusion in
Agarose Gel Containing Heparin
<p class="Para1">
TBE buffer is prepared as 356 mM Tris-borate to pH 8.2 containing
10 mM EDTA disodium.  A pH 7.4 solution is prepared for samples.
Agarose is type II-M (Sigma).  Anti-fibrinogen serum or 100&nbsp;mg/ml
heparin or distilled water (for carbamylated samples) is added
to 1% molten agarose in buffer at 50&deg;.  The antiserum is
21.5&nbsp;&mu;l/ml gel, and the heparin is 40&nbsp;&mu;l/ml gel.  These
are cast on to 94 &times; 84 &times; 0.2 mm polyester Multiphor
plastic plates.  The volume:surface area is 144&nbsp;&mu;l/cm<sup>2</sup>.
After 20 min to set 3 mm dia wells spaced at 1 cm were cut from the
midpoint of the gel.  Standard plasma is diluted to final fibrinogen
concentrations of 20, 30, 40&nbsp;&mu;g/ml for EID/HP (heparin) and 25, 50,
and 80&nbsp;&mu;g/ml for EID/KCNO (carbamylated) samples.  10&nbsp;&mu;l
samples are applied using stopper-mounted syringes.  Electrophoresis
is in a water-cooled cell (15&deg;) with a 70 V/cm field for 1 hour.
Gels are washed, pressed, dried, then stained with Coomassie R-250.
A caliper is used to measure precipitin peak heights.
<p>
Results show that heparin clearly increased the sensitivity of
samples compared to carbamylation (seen by greater extension of
peak heights).  Carbamylation is observed to enhance degradation
products (FDP):  sensitivity is lowered from 300 to 100 ng/well
for fragment D, and from 10 to 5&nbsp;ng/well for fragment E.  Heparin
does not alter sensitivity of LMW FDPs but does increase HMW FDP
sensitivity to the same extent as carbamylation.

Immunohistochemical Detection of Proliferating Cell In Vivo
<p class="Para1">
B16 melanoma cells were cultured and 10<sup>5</sup> cells were injected
intradermally into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice;  the cells were cultured
in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS and 2 mM Gln (no antibiotics; monitored for
mycoplasma).  Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 10 mm diameter
usu. 2-3 weeks later.  200&nbsp;mg/kg BrdU was injected intraperitoneally
for pulse, or infusd by subcutaneously implanted mini-osmotic pumps, for
between 24 h and 7 d.  Bone marrow was harvested by PBS flushing,
and fixed on glass slides with methanol:acetic acid (3:1).
<p>
Nearly 20% of cells were labeled after just a 30 min pulse with BrdU.
Marrow from the femora of mice were obtained daily and the BrdU was
shown to cause no appreciable toxicity to cells.  Other tissues were
tested for BrdU incorporation:  intestinal epithelium, in which
BrdU was found to incorporate in the cells of the crypts of Lieberk&uuml;hn.
After two days, it could be seen that BrdU-labeled cells started to
migrate up the villi, three-quarters of the way up by day 3, and on
day 4, labeled cells covered the entire surface of villi.
These results were compared to the classic [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine
labeling experiment showing cell proliferation and labeling; mini-osmotic
pumps placed in the peritoneum of mice to infuse the thymidine, and
sections were autoradiographed over 20 d. The BrdU labeling pattern
was similar.  Kidney and liver labeling studies showed no nuclear
BrdU staining; these tissues are known to have low levels of proliferation.
<p>
B16 mouse melanoma are solid tumors with corded structure, well defined
areas of viable tissue, pyknotic cells, and necrosis where the distance
from vascular tissue increases.  After 30 min intraperitoneal injection
of BrdU tumor cells were clearly stained, and especially cells at a distance
from blood vessels.  Only cells 1-2 layers removed from necrotic areas
did not incorporate label.  48 h continuous labeling reveals some parts
of the tumors with high proliferation and others with low rates.
1 in 5&nbsp;cells are labeled after 30 min exposure.
<p>
30&nbsp;&mu;m sections were treated with Histo-Clear to remove paraffin,
rehydrated, then treated 30 min with 0.5% pepsin, pH 1.5, and
filtered through gauze.  After spinning down cells, they were
suspended in 1&nbsp;&mu;g/ml 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole 2 HCl (DAPI)
in RPMI-1640 for 30 min at room temp.  Single parameter DNA content
was measured on a Phywe ICP22 flow cytometer.  This revealed that
28.7% of melanoma cells were in S-phase, 6.9% in G2+M, and the balance
in G1/0.  This compares with 20.2% of BrdU-labeled cells.
<p>
A two-parameter flow cytometric study was done to determine the
discrepancy.  Cells were labeled with propidium iodide and anti-BrdU
monoclonal/fluoroscein-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (F<sub>ab&acute;</sub>).
The two one-dimensional flow cytometry plots were then plotted
two-dimensionally with isometric contours.  The plots clearly show
that there are cells in S phase which do not incorporate BrdU and that
this accounts for the difference seen.
<p style="font:normal 83% Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
<b>Methods</b>. <span style="color:blue;">Note that the importance of
this paper is that it is among the first to report the use of a
specific antibody for the detection of BrdU-incorporated DNA</span>.
Tissues are fixed in neutral formalin, and paraffinized blocks sectioned
at 4&nbsp;&mu;m.  Some sections are stained in H &amp; E.  Sections to be
immunostained are de-paraffinized with Histo-Clear, passed through
graded series of alcohols, and endogenous peroxidases inactivated
with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (v/v) in methanol.  Treatment in
1.5 M HCl for 20 min then follows:  this denatures the DNA required for
anti-BrdU binding.  Tissues/cells are then rinsed three times for very
short periods in cold 0.9% NaCl containing 1% (v/v) Tween 20; it is important
that the DNA not renature.  Anti-BrdU monoclonal is prepared to 5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml
in 1% BSA and 1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS (PBT buffer) and used for 1 h.
The tissue is then washed in PBT buffer alone, then incubated in 7&nbsp;&mu;g/ml
biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG for 30 min.  Two washed in PBT, then
one wash in PBS, then treatment with conjugated avidin-peroxidase.
Illumination was with 1&nbsp;mg/ml 3,3'-diaminobenzidine 4 HCl in 100 mM TrisHCl,
pH 7.2 mixed with an equal volume of 0.02% (v/v) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,
for about 10 min.  Slides were washed in water, counterstained with
hematoxylin, then dehydrated, cleared with Histo-Clear, and mounted
in Eukitt.  Any amber pigment in the nuclear region effectively identifies
the presence of BrdU.

Host Origin of Marrow Stromal Cells Following Allogeneic Bone Marrow
Transplantation
<p class="Para1">
Ten female patients contributed blood and marrow samples subsequent
to marrow transplantation (range of 55-1073 days post-transplantation) from
HLA-identical male donors.  Transplantations were mostly for leukemic
conditions (only 1 case of neuroblastoma), and 6 of the cases were
for an acute leukemia.  Mononuclear cells were exposed to hypotonic
lysis conditions with ammonium chloride and then cultured long-term
(in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks at 2 million per ml in
10 ml &alpha;-MEM with 12.5% horse serum, 12.5% FBS and
1&nbsp;&mu;M hydrocortisone sodium succinate.  After 2-4 weeks,
an adherent layer was confluent with mostly fibroblastoid cells,
adipocytes and macrophages.  Cells were trypsinized and stained
Wright-Giemsa.  One set of cells had macrophage-like morphology
(small heterochromatic nucleus, foamy cytoplasm), and the other
was heterogeneous with larger irregularly shaped euchromatic nuclei
having two or more prominent nucleoli.  Macrophages are butyrate
esterase- and acid phosphatase-positive; they express Leu-M3, the
monocyte-macrophage differentiation antigen, and DR (show by reaction
with MAb P4.1).
<p>
The stromal cells have high ALP activity but weak ACP
activity in contrast; they don't bind Leu-M3.  Histochemical
staining for laminin and collagen types III, IV, and V are shown
either by immunofluorescence or avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase staining.
The appearance of laminin and type IV collagen is consistent with endothelial
cell presence.  Others have reported type IV collagen and Factor VIII-related
antigen (FVIII rAg) as confirmation that a subpopulation is of this type.
<p>
A biotinylated DNA probe specific for repetitive sequence in Y chromatin
was used for in situ hybridization (illuminated by indirect immunofluorescence).
A bright spot in the nucleus indicates a Y chromosome-bearing cell.
For all patients, the stromal cells were of host origin.
Macrophages associated with stromal cell layer were entirely of donor
origin, showing true chimerism in the tissues.
<p>
Note that this result differs from another report showing progressive
loss of host stromal cells post-transplantation.  One reason could be
conditioning of the patient prior to grafting, and the response of cells
to treatment;  the regimen of cyclophosphamide and <sup>60</sup>Co
irradiation is similar however.  Another difference could be the criteria
used to identify stromal cells, in which the other group used biochemical
analyses of collagenous proteins to make the inference.  Another is
the method used to identify the origin of cells:  the other group used
quinacrine staining which is relatively insensitive to tissue mosaics,
whereas in situ hybridization has total sensitivity and specificity.
Trypsinization also introduces a sampling bias:  macrophages are detached
relatively easily (quickly) while stromal cells strongly resist detaching.
<p>
There is an issue about the transplantability of stromal cells via an
intravenous route, as experiments in mice and humans show.  There are
more failures than successes in grafting experiments, and even
the successes are qualified.  Long-term cultures may be particularly
difficult.

Bone Formation in Organ Cultures of Bone Marrow
<p class="Para1">
Marrow from 2-3 mon old F<sub>1</sub> mice (CBA &times; C57B1<sub>6</sub>)
is placed on Millipore HA filters resting on &alpha;-MEM medium
with 20% FBS,  150&nbsp;mg/l ascorbic acid, 0.05% Gln, 0.4% glucose,
and 60 kIU/l streptomycin and penicllin.  After 8 d,
10 mM &beta;-glycerophosphate was added in some experiments.
Media changes were every 3 d.
<p>
Macrophages and myeloid cells covered the filters after the first few
days, followed by fibroblastic growth on the filter surface.  In week 2
the myeloid cells disappeared from inside explanted fragments, and
multicellular phosphatase-positive layer having a partial cover of
macrophages and myeloid cells formed.  After week 3, myeloid cell count
decreased, and trabecular matrix (ALP-positive) is covered with
osteoblast-like cells.  When &beta;-glycerophosphate is added,
mineralization is seen by day 16, increasing rapidly by day 20.
Closer to the surface, there is less mineralization, and the tissue
is a layer of fibroblasts within osteoid and extracellular matrix.
Cells and tissue stain positive by Gomori, while with Sigma kit #85
the cell membranes stain strongly and the matrix is weakly stained.
(Sigma kit #85 staining is an azo dye method using fast red violet B
salt on ethanol-fixed cells embedded in glycol methacrylate.)
<p>
By days 26-30 bone lamina development on the filter surface is complete
and very mineralized.  3-8 layers of cells are present in both mineralized
and unmineralized tissue.  A lower layer of cells is attached to the
filter, extending processes that stain for phosphatase.  Without
&beta;-glycerophosphate, a trabecular matrix without mineralization
is apparent.  Organ culture of spleen fragments showed some presence
of ALP-positive fibroblasts, but trabeculae were not evident and there
was no calcification/mineralization.
<p>
Electron microscopy revealed collagen large amts in the ECM.  Cells
in unmineralized areas were fibroblastic with abundant ER and processes.
Next to mineralized matrix cells had a low nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio
with abundant ER, appearing osteoblastic.  Collagen appeared to be
arranged in fibrils that were perpendicular and parallel to the sections,
very much like lamellar bone.

Bone Marrow Osteogenic Stem Cells:  <i>In Vitro</i> Cultivation
and Transplantation in Diffusion Chambers
<p class="Para1">
The medullary cavity from fragments taken from a pelvic resection
of 1.5-2 kg California rabbits (under nembutal anesthesia) was
flushed for marrow using serum-free Ham's.  Single cell suspensions
were obtained by serial transfer through progressively higher gauge
needles using syringes, with final filtering through 4 layers capron mesh.
Cells were seeded to polyLys-coated 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks, left
to attach for 60 min, and medium removed, washed with fresh medium,
and volumes pooled.  Pool was brought to 5% BS
<p>
50-100 million cells can be obtained from 0.5 g pelvic bone fragments.
All cells adhere to polyLys-coated plates within an hour.  A few cells
appeared on Millipore filters which were washed out from the flasks.
Few stromal aggregates are seen immediately (1 in 500,000), but by
day 12-16 of growth, colonies of fibroblastic-like cells are evident
with < 1% macrophages also.  The macrophages are evident because they
form rosettes with IgG-coated erythrocytes, but the fibroblasts do not.
<p>
Colonies varied in size and number of cells, with 10% of colonies
having 5-10 mm diameter with 1000-30,000 cells, and smaller (90%)
colonies with diameters < 5&nbsp;mm and 50-1000 cells.
<p>
Cultures were created as an admixture of multiple donors, including
female and male, and karyotypes of 15 colonies from 7-9 d old cultures
determined.  The CFE<sub>f</sub> (fibroblast colony-forming efficiencies)
 of male was 4.5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>&minus;4</sup> and of female
was 7.3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>&minus;4</sup>.  In each colony all
 metaphase plates were of one karyotype, either male (8) or female (7).
<p>
 After 12-16 d primary cultures contain multiple fibroblastic colonies
with < 1% macrophages (as shown by RBC rosettes), which disappear entirely
 with later passages.  With each passage of adherent cells, the CFE<sub>f</sub>
 increase almost by one order of magnitude.  By the 7th passage,
 the number of population doublings is 20-22;  by 18 passages, 30 doublings.
<p>
 A type A diffusion chamber with 14 mm dia and 15&nbsp;&mu;l volume and
 type O chamber with 5&nbsp;mm dia and 150&nbsp;&mu;l volume were seeded with
 cells (10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> in type A,
 10<sup>5</sup>-2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup> in type O), and
 bone and cartilage formed in both of these chambers in a 1.5-2 month period.
 The cartilage was devoid of ALP activity and minerals.  An experiment
 to determine the number of CFE<sub>f</sub> was tested using four
 primary donors.  In general this number increases by several hundred-fold
 after a few passages.
<p>
 Using mixed cell cultures from donors of different sexes and studying
 karyotypes, these experiments showed that the formation of colonies
 from cells diluted to their limit were colonies formed from single cells.

Cardiac Specific Troponin-I Release in Canine Experimental Myocardial
Infarction:  Development of a Sensitive Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay
<p class="Para1">
Cardiac and skeletal muscle TnI were prepared using an affinity
chromatography procedure.  High ionic strength is required to keep
TnI soluble if the TnI concentration was 0.5-1.0 mg/ml.  Reducing
agents (2-mercaptoethanol) solubilized dimeric formation of TnI.
TnI was injected IM into rabbits with both complete and incomplete
Freund's adjuvant.  Antisera were purified by passing over a
skeletal muscle TnI-Sepharose 4B column (CNBr-linked).  To make
ELISA plates, polyvinyl Falcon plates were coated overnight at cold
temperature with 50 &mu;l containing 25 ng TnI in a 50 mM sodium
carbonate, pH 9.6 solution.  The postbinding blocking was done with
2% BSA in the coating buffer.  Plates are washed with PBS containing
0.5% (v/v) Tween-20 and blotted dry prior to use.  TnI standards
are made up in PBS with 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20, with 0.5 M KCl and 1% BSA.
Primary and secondary antibodies are made up in this solution except
for the presence of KCl.  Standards or unknowns and the purified antiserum
are incubated in plastic tubes for 2-3 h at room temp.  Then the
incubation mixture is added to the coated plates for 1 h (50 &mu;l
per well, triplicates).  Unbound antibody and Ab:Ag complexes are
then washed away.  HRP-conj. goat anti-rabbit is added, then washed away,
and the color developed.
<p>
Purification yield was 0.63 mg TnI/g tissue.  SDS-PAGE shows a single band.
The cardiac form showed a slightly higher <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> (19,800 Da
vs. 22,500 Da) compared to the mixed fast and slow skeletal forms.
Immunochemical cross-reactivity using the ELISA showed that anti-cardiac
TnI was 10% reactive with 250 ng skeletal TnI/ml and 25% reactive
with 100 &mu;g/ml.  This cross-reactivity was removed by passing
the anti-cardiac TnI antiserum over an affinity column with mixed
slow and fast skeletal TnI as ligand.  The ELISA was characterized
for optimal dilution of antiserum and the plate coating concentration
of TnI.  The detection limit is the lowest concentration of TnI
necessary to inhibit antibody binding at a level of two standard
deviations different from maximum binding, and this value was found
to be 4 ng/ml.  The range of assay was up to 200 ng/ml.
<p>
The CK-MB isoform is at much lower levels relative to total CK in canines
than in humans.  It could not be enriched by standard methods to
bring it to a concentration which could be assayed.  Noncommercial
columns were instead used to enrich the MB, BB, and MM isoenzyme fractions,
and then CK-MB was measured kinetically.
<p>
7 control canines showed a mean cTnI of 15.6 &plusmn; 4.5 ng/ml
(range 9.3-21.5 ng/ml).  Baseline of dogs used in study (n = 12)
was 12.9 &plusmn; 4.7 ng/ml (range 5.0-20.5 ng/ml).  Sham animals
showed mean 15.3 &plusmn; 3.9 ng/ml
(range 11.1-19.0 ng/ml).  Serum CK-MB in untreated animals was a mean
of 4.7 &plusmn; 2.0 IU/l.  The experimental animals had a mean
CK-MB of 7.0 &plusmn; 6.5 IU/l (not signficantly different from untreated)
while sham animals showed 10.0 &plusmn; 5.1 IU/l.
<p>
12 animals treated.  Three died from ventricular fibrillation from the
treatment.  Male or female 13-33 kg had their left anterior
descending coronary artery fitted with ligature just below first
major branch (usually).  30 mins was allowed for stabilization
before ligation.  4 ml of 1% lignocaine HCl was given at time
ligation started, and additional doses of lignocaine and pentazocine
during first 24 h close supervision.  Animals had indwelling jugular
catheter for blood sampling at 4 h intervals for first 24 h, then
increasing intervals up to 10 d.  After immediate centrifugation,
storage was at &minus;25&deg; or liq. nitrogen.  Euthanasia was by
pentobarbital sodium.  Heart was removed, washed in cold saline,
and partially frozen at &minus;25&deg; (ventricles filled with
saline to keep shape).  Staining of 3-5 mm thick sections of
tissue by nitroblue tetrazolium staining was used to map necrotic
regions of heart.
<p>
Increases in cTnI above controls were detected 4-6 h post-ligation.
These continued rising, reaching peak values at 10-16 h post-ligation.
Mean peak level was 100.7 ng/ml (range 44-217 ng/ml), 6-fold above
the control level, and this mean is 12 h post-ligation.  cTnI returns
to pre-operative or near pre-operative levels by about 200 h (8-9 days)
post-ligation.  Detection of the increase in CK-MB levels is about
3-6 h post-ligation, with peaks reached 8-16 h post-ligation and
ranging from 25.5-74.3 IU/l. Mean peak level is 49.6 &plusmn; 21.4 IU/l
which is 10 times that of controls and reached 12 h post-ligation
as for cTnI.  CK-MB levels decline more rapidly than cTnI, to baseline
in 40-100 h post-ligation.
<p>
Infarct size from histochemical staining revealed a mean 15.7% of
left ventricle with a range of 3.4% to 37.8% of the LV (2.3-27.4% of
whole heart).  A very good correlation existed between the size of the
infarct and both the peak values and the area under the time-activity
curves for the CK-MB parameter only.  The peak CK-MB and infarct size
correlation had <i>r</i> = 0.87, while the AUC for CK-MB activity vs.
post-ligation time and the infarct size relation showed an <i>r</i> =
0.90.  The peak cTnI and infarct size relation of <i>r</i> = 0.33 and
the AUC for TnI concentration-post-ligation-time showed an <i>r</i> =
&minus;0.01, both very poor correlations.  The relationship between
peak CK-MB and cTnI was found to be <i>r</i> = 0.52.

Purification of Human Plasma Fibrinogen by Chromatography on Protamine-Agarose
<p class="Para1">
<b>Coupling</b>.  Protamine (salmine)-agarose was prepared by coupling protamine sulfate
(grade X, histone-free, Sigma) to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B using
a coupling medium of 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,
0.5 M NaCl and 1.5 g protamine sulfate per 100 ml, at pH 8.5.  The difference
between protamine recovered before and after addition was used in estimating
the bound material.  Protamine is determined by biuret reaction.  After
2 hour incubation, 25&nbsp;mg protamine per ml wet gel is determined.  Glycine
at 0.32 M for 2 h is added to block residual reactive groups.  Final
washing is with 50 mM TrisHCl, 2.0 M urea, pH 5.0, then 50 mM TrisHCl with
2.0 M NaCl pH 8.0 alternately for 4-5 times.
<p>
<b>Chromatography</b>.  A 1 &times; 7 cm (5.5 ml) column geometry is used
(columns are Pharmacia C10/10 columns).  A drop-counter using preweighed
polypropylene collection tubes is used to fractionate the run.  OD280
is was monitored during elution.  Chromatography buffers were as follows:
<ul>
<li>A1:  50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 5&nbsp;mM EDTA, 5&nbsp;mM &epsilon;-aminocaproic acid
<li>A2:  Buffer A1 with 0.68 M NaCl
<li>B1:  Buffer A1 but pH is 4.5
<li>B2:  Buffer A1 with 2.0 M sodium bromide
</ul>
<p>
Flow rates are 20-25 ml per hour.  Gel filtration of the eluates from the 
protamine column are done using Sephacryl S-300 in water-jacketed 2.5 &times; 48 
cm column.  Sample size is 3 ml.  A Laurell electroimmunodiffusion technique in 
1% agarose with heparin following the method of Fabrizi et al. is used to 
determine fibrinogen concentration. The Staphylococcal clumping factor method of 
Hawiger et al. is used for semiquantitative evaluation.  A rabbit polyclonal 
(Behring) is used in an immunoblot procedure to qualitatively look at protamine 
fractions. The method of Clauss is also used to look at fibrinogen 
concentration.
<p>
In looking at product clottability, B1 eluates are neutralized to pH 7.4 using 
0.5 M sodium carbonate, and 3 units of thrombin added and placed at 37&deg;.  A 
clot generally forms after 5&nbsp;min and is removed by centrifugation (after 30 
min incubation).  The protein concentration of the supernatant (A), the 
neutralized eluate with water added instead of thrombin (B), thrombin in 
neutralized buffer B1 (C). The percent clottability is then defined as (1 
&minus; (A &minus; C) &times; B) &times; 100.
<p>
When the fibrinogen is mixed batchwise with protamine-agarose gel, 91% of the 
fibrinogen binds after 10 minutes.  There is no fibrinogen in the unbound 
fraction (shown by staphylococcal clumping and SDS-PAGE). When fibrinogen is 
applied in a column flow format, a minor peak A1 appears in the effluent, with 
no other detectable by clumping or PAGE.  A small peak is seen when elution with 
0.5 M NaCl at pH 7.3 is done.  Successively higher salt (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 M) at 
this pH yields nothing.
<p>
Only when the pH is dropped from 7.3 to 4.5 is 65-80% of bound fibrinogen 
released.  Use of continuous pH gradient (or steps of 0.1 pH unit) shows that 
elution occurs about pH 4.8.  Saturation experiments with the column show that 
it holds 6.5&nbsp;mg of pH 4.5-elutable fibrinogen per ml.
<p>
Plasma samples (from 0.2 to 10 ml) are diluted with equal volume of buffer A1 
and passed through the column.  When all unbound protein has passed and OD280 
returns to baseline, the column is washed in buffer A2 without significant loss 
of fibrinogen.  Proteins eluting with A2 buffer include albumin (present in 
unbound too), Igs, antithrombin III, and fibronectin.
<p>
Buffer B1 was used to elute the fibrinogen, which contained 90% of protein that 
was clottable.  Laurell electroimmunodiffusion showed no detectable 
fibrinogen-related materal in the supernatant of the clots.  The B1 peak had 
65-80% of the fibrinogen free of plasminogen (shown by absence of degradation of 
fibrinogen or thrombin-induced fibrin in &epsilon;ACA-free eluates upon addition 
of streptokinase inside 7 days).  A chromogenic substrate S-2251 revealed 
plasminogen to be in the unbound A1 fraction.  Non-reducing SDS-PAGE of all 
chromatography fractions shows that fibrinogen is in the B1 fraction, seen as a 
high MW band doublet (note that the doublet is because of clipping of the 
C-terminus in A&alpha;-chains).
<p>
Fraction B2 contains fibrinogen as shown by reactivity with anti-fibrinogen, 
with a band having same MW.  Fraction B1 is free of albumin, immunoglobulins, 
&alpha;<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin, antithrombin 
III, and fibronectin according to immunological methods.  Gel filtration OD280 
profiles of the B1 eluate and fibrinogen Kabi were compared.  The latter had a 
broader peak with a leading shoulder, while the former more pure material has a 
narrow symmetrical peak, indicating greater purity.  A reducing SDS-PAGE of the 
B1 eluate shows three bands corresponding (from high to low MW) to A&alpha;, 
B&beta;, then &gamma;.
<p>
B1 eluates may contain Factor XIII:  clots were formed in the presence
of calcium but did not dissolve in 6 M urea within 24 h.
20-30% of fibrinogen eluates when 2 M NaBr is applied to the buffer.

Stromal Stem Cells:  Marrow-Derived Osteogenic Precursors
<p class="Para1">
Evidence shows that osteogenic cells belong to stromal fibroblastic
cells in marrow and along bone surfaces.  Stromal cells likely
give rise to committed progenitors for different cell lines.
Single cell suspensions from marrow will form fibrous osteogenic
tissue within diffusion chambers grafted in vivo (see Friedenstein 1976).
The differentiation followed a sequence with respect to morphology
and biochemical (including gene expression) in the diffusion chamber
that is seen in the typical osteogenic developmental process:
at first a soft, fibrous connective tissue rich in type III collagen
and weakly represented by type I collagen.  Then a decline in type III
collagen followed by increasing expression of either type I or II only,
the former if osteogenic, the latter if chondrogenic.  Alkaline
phosphatase activity assays are useful for looking at cells that
accumulate mineral.  Chondrogenesis vs. osteogenesis may be a matter
of nutritional availability:  bone generally develops in tissue near
the filter surface of diffusion chambers, and cartilage more towards
the center in cylindrical chambers that are at least 2 mm in height,
but in chambers not so high (0.1 mm in height), only bone forms.
<p>
Single mouse marrow fibroblastic colonies (derived from one CFU-F)
cultured for 14-16 d then grafted under a renal capsule show development
of several lines of differentiated tissues:  bone, adipose, marrow reticular.
This is true for 15% of colonies.  Hematopoietic development is also evident.
<p>
The characterization of in vitro conditions for differentiation of CFU-F
(colonies) shows that colonies vary widely in size, morphology, and
level of ALP expression.  Cells in the center begin to express ALP;
cells at the periphery are still actively dividing (according the thymidine
labeling).  Cell growth can be arrested without expression of ALP.
Hydrocortisone increases ALP activity.  EGF has the effect of
stimulating colony size and reducing expression of ALP;  its continual
presence represses ALP, causing the cell to continually stay in cell cycle.

Osteogenic Stem Cells and the Stromal System of Bone and Marrow
<p class="Para1">
<b>Review</b>. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are part of the bone
tissue dynamic of formation and remodeling.  Although they are
self-renewing, they have a limited life span.  These cells have
distinct origins in the adult however.  Osteoblasts and chondrocytes
derive from bone marrow stromal cells, while osteoclasts appear
from a hematopoietic stem cell lineage.
<p>
Morphological evidence and presumed common ancestry suggests that
fibroblasts, reticular cells, adipocytes, osteoblasts, and periosteal
cells derive from the stromal cell system.  Macrophages and
endothelial cells do not derive from stromal cells;  macrophages
descend from hematopoietic stem cells, and endothelial are unknown.
<p>
Osteogenic precursors are associated with soft, fibrous tissue of
marrow stroma, since marrow fragments or cells in diffusion chambers
implanted in vivo form cartilage and bone.  These cells remain
progenitors even when mechanically or enzymatically disaggregated
into single cell suspensions, showing that cell-cell or cell-matrix
interactions are also not part of the requirements.  Osteogenesis
of MCs is found in rat, mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, and canines;
there is variability in terms of time of formation.  These differences
in variability may reflect observed differences in species in the
healing of fractures however.
<p>
Antibodies to specific components of ECM show that diffusion chamber
tissue is types I and III collagen, laminin and fibronectin in
the early stages, and in later stages with more advanced bone
development, type I collagen is increased while type III collagen,
fibronectin, and laminin fall to backgound levels.  Type II and IX
collagen indicate cartilage.  Within diffusion chambers, the formation
of bone and cartilage are not random:  bone is found near the membranes
of the chamber, while cartilage forms towards the center of the chamber.
The evidence indicates that whether cartilage or bone develop depends
on a nutritional gradient, as shown by alterin chamber geometry.
<p>
In some cultures of marrow cells, particularly mouse, macrophages
may persist even after a few media changes.  Persistent cultures
express fibronectin and collagen types I, III, and V, and do not express
endothelial Factor VIII-associated antigen or Weibelpalade bodies;
nor are there receptors for Ig or complement.
<p>
Marrow cells plated at more than 500,000/cm<sup>2</sup> readily form
monolayers.  Plated between 10,000 and 100,000/cm<sup>2</sup> however,
colonies are formed instead.  These are first apparent 3-4 d after
plating.  Between 5-12 d the size but not number increase, and by
day 10 colonies are 5-8 mm diameter and 5000-10,000 cells.  Experiments
show that the colonies are clonal in origin (including time-lapse
cinematography).  Friedenstein called the cell originating these
colonies a fibroblast colony-forming cell (FCFC).  The term
colony-forming unit-fibroblastic (CFU-F) has gained wider acceptance.
In vivo the CFU-F do not cycle based on experiments in which guinea
pigs were administered a single dose of radiothymidine and the cells
taken from bone marrows and forming colonies were unlabeled; also
hydroxyurea administration did not decrease the number of colonies
that could be formed.
<p>
Colony-forming efficiency (CFE) is defined as the number of colonies
of &ge; 50 cells arising from the total number of marrow cells cultured.
CFE ranges between 1 to 5&nbsp;in 100,000 cells in marrow suspensions from
human, rabbit, rat, mouse, guinea pig and hamster.  This falls as the
animal ages, correlating with a reduction in osteogenic potential.
Sampling of marrow from different anatomic regions shows CFE is
nonuniform.  From the core to intermediate to endosteal regions of the
marrow, CFE increases 4-fold, and result in agreement with diffusion
chamber studies.  What affects CFE is not known.  Ablation of the
marrow cavity in one femur results in CFE increases in the contralateral
femur, suggesting diffusible signals.  Ovariectomy in rats results in
reduced CFE;  the marrow CFE could be restored by treatments of ovariectomized
samples with dihydrotachysterol (analog of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>).
EGF has been shown to reduce the CFU-F but increase the average size
of colonies, as well as decrease the proportion of colonies expressing
ALP.  Hydrocortisone increases the CFU-F and the proportion of those
colonies expressing ALP;  this does not necessarily mean it has the same
effect in vivo, or that ALP is correlated with osteogenic potential.
<p>
Ectopic ossification often occurs in both inherited and acquired disease.
It can occur with living cells or with acid-demineralized bone matrix.
An inducer is usually necessary and must be continually present to
cause the ossification.  When cultured, inducing cells lose their osteogenic
potential immediately.

Stimulates Collagen Accumulation, Cell Proliferation,
and Formation of A Three-Dimensional Tissuelike Substance By
Skin Fibroblasts
<p class="Para1"
style="font:normal 83% Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,sans-serif;color:blue;">
[The value of this report is the finding that ascorbic acid 2-phosphate
appears to be a more reliable cell culture medium ingredient than the
more labile ascorbic acid, where the latter is an essential component
especially to the study of some process.  This was proven for human
cells, but may need proving for cultures where ascorbic acid dependence
is not a factor.]
<p>
<b>Abstract.</b>  Proliferation of human skin fibroblasts was
stimulated significantly by the presence of L-ascorbic acid
2-phosphate (Asc 2-P). The presence of Asc 2-P (0.1-1.0 mM)
in the culture medium for 3 weeks enhanced the relative rate
of collagen synthesis to total protein synthesis 2-fold as
well as cell growth 4-fold. Coexistence of L-azetidine 2-carboxylic
acid (AzC), an inhibitor of collagen synthesis, attenuated both
effects of Asc 2-P in a dose-dependent manner. Supplementation
of the medium with Asc 2-P also accelerated procollagen
processing to collagen and deposition of collagen in the
cell layer. Among the acidic glycosaminoglycans (GAG),
another major component of extracellular matrix (ECM),
deposition of sulfated forms was increased by the additive.
Electron microscopic observations showed multilayered,
rough endoplasmic reticulum-rich cells surrounded by dense ECM.
These results indicate that Asc 2-P is useful in culture systems
as a long-acting vitamin C derivative and also that it promotes
reorganization of a three-dimensional tissuelike substance
from skin fibroblasts in culture by stimulating collagen
accumulation in the fibroblasts.

The Adenylate Cyclase Response to Parathyroid Hormone in Cultured
Rabbit Marrow Fibroblastic Cells
<p class="Para1">
Adherent fibroblastoid rabbit marrow cells were examined for their
changes in cyclic AMP levels with PTH stimulation.  Care was taken
to grow colonies for the study from single clones as well as a mix
of clones from primary cultures, and using different medium conditions
(BGJ<sub>b</sub> vs. &alpha;-MEM, 2% vs. 20% FBS, presence or absence
of hydrocortisone [HC]).
<p>
Results show considerable variation in how PTH stimulates cAMP levels
from one culture to another.  Presence of HC enhanced the stimulation
by PTH, and the effect of HC was the same whether cells were present
from start of culture or only when placed in the well for the purposes
of an assay.  The PTH response was greater in cells in BGJ<sub>b</sub>
+ 20% FBS than in &alpha;-MEM + 20% or BGJ<sub>b</sub> + 2% FBS.
Rat osteosarcoma cell line UMR 106 was also tested, and its response
was greatest, being 4-fold the maximal stem cell response in any conditions.
Dose curve plots of the PTH response (treated/control level ratio vs.
log [PTH]) for the flasks of cells (not derived from single colonies)
and for both presence and absence of HC were linear, again HC slightly
enhancing the PTH response.  A response to isoprenaline was also
noted.
<p>
Using conditions that produced maximal response (initial growth in
BGJ<sub>b</sub> medium with 20% FBS and including HC, with plating to
assay wells in &alpha;-MEM + 20% FBS + HC), colonies arising from
single clones were tested for variable response, and the range was
from 3- to 19-fold among 7 colonies tested.  There was no real activation
in cells initially grown in &alpha;-MEM + 20% FBS, assayed in same,
nor in cells assayed in same and including HC.  Note that the control
cAMP levels in cells gronw in &alpha;-MEM + 20% FBS and assayed in same
was very high.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>.
5 ml serum-free medium was used to flush marrow from the mid-shaft
of the femora of male New Zealand white rabbits and these serially
passed through 19-, 21-, and 23-gauge needles.  This suspension then
filtered through two layes of 90&nbsp;&mu;m nylon,Medium was either
BGJ<sub>b</sub> or &alpha;-MEM with 100&nbsp;mg/l Gln, 50&nbsp;mg/L ascorbic acid,
50 kIU/l pen, 50&nbsp;mg/l strep.  Measurement of cyclic AMP was by:
<ol>
<li>prelabeling cells with 0.5&nbsp;&mu;Ci/ml [2,8-<sup>3</sup>H]adenine in
  &alpha;-MEM with 0.1% BSA for 2 h
<li>washing 2 &times; with fresh medium
<li>incubating in 1 mM IBMX in a-MEM+BSA for 20 min

Identification of Stromal Cell Precursors in Human Bone Marrow
By A Novel Monoclonal Antibody, STRO-1
<p class="Para1">
NS1-Ag4-1 murine myeloma cells and lymphocytes from BALB/c spleen in which
the animal had been immunized with CD34 were fused with PEG and hybridomas
selected with HAT using std procedures.  Initial screening was to remove
hybridomas whose product was directed against HLA and T- or B-cell lineage
markers.  Indirect immunofluorescence was then used as screening tool
on bone marrow mononuclear cells to identify MAbs reactive with &le;
10% of cells.
<p>
STRO-1 MAb was selected in part because it binds low numbers of mononuclear
cells and is reactive with a subset of CD34-positive cells.
Complement-mediated lysis experiments show STRO-1 did not inhibit
growth of CFU-GM, BFU-E, or CFU-Mix compared with a non-binding
isotype-matched antibody H12C12.  As a control, anti-HLA-A2 antibody
(P5.1) lyses all cells, and its use led to complete elimination of
all colony growth.
<p>
FACS was used to separate bone marrow cells that were STRO-1-positive
and -negative.  Unsorted cells give 50 CFG-GM, 34 BFU-E, and 1 CFU-Mix.
STRO-1-negative cells were 123 CFU-GM, 57 BFU-E, and 1 CFU-Mix.  No
colony growth is seen at all in the STRO-1-positive fraction.
<p>
Bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were characterized
using two-color (dual label) indirect immunofluorescence, with one
label anti-STRO-1 and the other one of a panel of CD antigens.
STRO-1 was not found on mature T cells (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, CD8),
in either BMMC or PBMC, nor on mature B cells (CD10, CD19)
in BMMC, nor myeloid cells (CD13, CD33) in BMMC, nor in macrophages
(CD14) in both tissues, nor in megakaryocytes (CDW41).  A subset
of CD20-positive cells (mature B type) did react with STRO-1 in PBMC.
STRO-1 was found on cells expressing CD34, CD44, and CD29, but &gt; 95%
of STRO-1 among BMMC were glycophorin A-associated nucleate erythroid
cells.  Leukemic cell lines were tested also:  STRO-1 was found only
on HEL-DR<sup>+</sup> and EBV immortalized B cells.  RAJ1 and DAUDI
(B cell leukemic) were STRO-1-negative; and also KG1, KG1a, HL60
and U937 (myeloid line);  and also CEM and Jurkat (T cell lines).
<p>
STRO-1-positive cells that had been sorted by FACS were seen to
develop fibroblast colonies as those in the CFU-F assay.  Complement-mediated
lysis was used on fresh bone marrow aspirates that had been first
exposed to anti-STRO-1.  This suppressed CFU-F by 70% compared to the
CFU-F of a control antibody H12C12.  Antibody 6.19 is a monoclonal
lytic to CFU-F:  its use reduces CFU-F by &gt; 90%, and so it can be
used as a positive control.  Bone marrow cells sorted by FACS as
STRO-1<sup>+</sup> were the source of CFU-F;  experiments in which
STRO-1-positive cells were added back to STRO-1-negative or unsorted
bone marrow cells did not make this finding different.
<p>
The majority of STRO-1-positive bone marrow cells also express glycophorin
A, with the exception of 5% of cells that are negative for glycophorin A.
This antigen marks a definite erythroid lineage.  Using two-color
indirect IF, all bone marrow CFU-F were found to be positive for STRO-1
and negative for glycophorin A, occurring with incidence of 1% of cells,
and a frequency of 1 in 10,000 unsorted cells.
<p>
STRO-1-positives were sorted from bone marrow using FACS and plated
for long-term growth in horse serum, FCS, and hydrocortisone, with weekly
media changes, and grown at 33&deg;.  After 3-4 wk, the adherent layer
was indistinguishable from layers made by unsorted BM cells.  Fibroblastic,
smooth muscle, and adipocytic cells were shown by phenotypic analysis
(MAb 6.19, TE7, IB10, CD10, CD13, ALP, laminin, and collagens type I, II
and III for fibroblasts;  MAb 6.19 and Oil Red O for adipocytes;
MAb 6.19, collagen type III, laminin, and FVIII rAg for endothelials;
IB10, CD13, and CD14 for macrophages; and HHF35 for smooth muscle).
Long-term bone marrow cells contain FVIII rAg endothelials and CD14 macrophages
but cultures established from STRO-1 sorting do not.  There are also
no granulocytic or hematopoietic progenitors as shown by CFU-GM,
BFU-E, and CFU-Mix assays after more than 8 weeks in culture.
STRO-1 long-term cultures also were positive for cells reactive to
MAb 6.19, CD10, CD13, and TE7, and one-half to three-fourths of cells
were also reactive with smooth muscle actin antigens (1A4 and HHF35).
Pre-adipocytes were reactive but not mature adipocytes.
<p>
The STRO-1 antigen itself is not cut by trypsin on stromal cells,
and so stromal cells were detached by trypsin after various times in
culture.  Flow cytometry showed that STRO-1 cell counts increase in first
2 weeks (time needed to establish adherent layer);  these decline to
15% of maximum by week 6.  When STRO-1 cells from long-term cultures
are sorted by FACS and used to seeded in fresh cultures, the pattern
of growth is identical with cells from fresh primaries.
<p>
Cultures of adherents were established from single donor(s) using
unsorted and FACS-sorted STRO-1 cells.  By week 6, part of the long-term
unsorted culture was killed, adherents detached, and STRO-1 cells
sorted out by FACS and plated.  After 4 weeks for a confluent layer,
these cells and the two other groups of cells were tested for their
ability to support progenitor and mature hematopoietic cells selected
for CD34 high level expression, low uptake of Rhodamine 123 (a fluorescent
vital mitochondrial dye), and absence of soybean agglutinin binding.
Both STRO-1 positive cells from long-term or normal marrow supported
clonogenic cells up to an 8 week period.  While STRO-1 sorted cells
did better than unfractionated long-term cultures, the difference
was not statistically significant.  Irradiation of STRO-1 positive
long term cultures prior to addition of test cells showed no difference
at all between the ability of irradiated and non-irradiated STRO-1
positives to produce non-adherents or maintain progenitors, indicating
no endogenous hematopoietic cells in sorted cells.
<p>
<b>Selected Methods</b>.CFU-GM assays are done using Iscove's Modified
Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) containing 20% FCS, 10% human placenta-conditioned
medium, 5&nbsp;&mu;M &beta;-mercaptoethanol, and 0.3% agar (Bacto Agar, Difco).
Burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and multipotential colony-forming
cell (CFU-Mix) assays are done in 1 mol/L consisting of IMDM, 30% FCS,
0.9% BSA, 4% phytohemagluttinin-stimulated leukocyte-conditioned medium,
1 U recomb. human erythropoietin (Amgen Biologicals),
5&nbsp;&mu;M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.2% methylcellulose.  Colonies are counted
on day 14 according to standard criteria.

Adipocytic Cells Cultured from Marrow Have Osteogenic Potential
<p class="Para1">
Marrow cells were taken from NZW rabbits, passed serially through
needles (19-23 gauge), filtered through 90&nbsp;&mu;m nylon mesh, and
then plated 50,000 to 10 million cells in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks,
and cultured in BGJ<sub>b</sub> medium with 50&nbsp;&mu;g/ml vitamin C
and 100&nbsp;&mu;g/ml Gln.  Serum additives depended upon experiments
but 20% FBS or 15% autologous rabbit plasma were used, sometimes
in combination with 100 nM hydrocortisone.  (Autologous plasma
was obtained by 20-30 ml blood by cannulation of the heart into
syringe pre-treated with 50 U heparin, spun 2500 <i>g</i> 20 min at 4&deg;.)
Feeder cells at 20 million cells, where used, were generated from
autologous marrow cells irradiated 3000 Gray from Cs source.
0.05% trypsin-EDTA was used for subculturing/passaging.
<p>
Colonies were observed by day 14 of primary culture, ranging in diameter
from 1-10 mm.  Proportions stained for ALP activity to various intensities
(staining by Sigma Kit #85).  Colony count per flask plotted against
count of nucleated cells plated (from 10<sup>6</sup> to
12 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>) was generally linear.
<p>
For purposes of ring cloning it would be better to have a full understanding
how best to cultivate cells so that CFE is within a predictable range.
Hydrocortisone (HC) stimulates CFE, but it still low when plating density
is low.  When feeder cells are added to the culture, CFE increases
significantly.
<p>
With plasma supplementation cells grew of a single type having adipocytic
morphology, which stained with Oil Red O.  Colonies were generally
smaller, 0.2-3 mm dia by 14 d.  In a larger colony at day 7, polygonal
cells show perinuclear accumulations of fat droplets (these are dense
black granules in phase contrast).  After 4 days, the colony has grown
by nearly 2-fold, differentiation in the center of the colony:
mature adipocytes with large lipid vacuoles, peripheral cells highly
granular and broadly spread.
<p>
Marrow cells initiated in BGJ<sub>b</sub> + plasma then changed to
BGJ<sub>b</sub> + FBS produce adipocytic colonies with elongated
fibroblastic morphology, cytoplasmic granules, with lipid vacuoles
disappearing; colonies grow to larger diameters, similar to those
that had grown in nothing but FBS.  Addition of HC increases adipogenesis
per colony.
<p>
Primary cultures where nonadherents are removed at 2 h, the adherents
washed and then treated with plasma + HC results in adipocytic colonies
free of cell debris, and these conditions were ideal for ring cloning of
these cells.
<p>
50,000 to 1 million cells were seeded to 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks to
produce well-spaced fibroblastic and adipocytic colonies.  The fibroblastic
colonies were established in BGJ<sub>b</sub> with FBS, HC, and irradiated
feeders.  Adipocytes were established with medium and rabbit plasma with
HC.  Colony development is usually with cells at the center starting to
differentiate first, followed by those in the periphery.  About 9-10 d
into culture, it helps to switch them to FBS with HC, since this
seems to improve the size of the colony for cloning purposes.
<p>
Cells were placed in diffusion chambers and then implanted into
peritonea of nude mice and left 60 d.  After removal, tissue chemistry
was toluidine blue, ALP, and von Kossa.  These revealed bone, cartilage,
and fibrous tissue development in the fibroblastic colonies;
some colonies formed only fibrous tissue.  The adipocytic implants
formed these tissue types as well, which shows that differentiated
cells can revert.  The mineralized bone was generally close to the
filter wall, while cartilage was deeper in the chamber.

Bone Marrow Stromal Colony Formation Requires Stimulation
By Haemopoietic Cells
<p class="Para1">
Marrow from male CBA mice was taken up in &alpha;-MEM and either
mechanically disaggregated (by passing through Pasteur pipet) or
trypsinized (0.25% for 1 h in HBSS on magnetic mixer).  Suspensions
filtered on 90&nbsp;&mu;m nylon were washed twice with medium and plated
to 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks or 35 mm dishes.  Medium usually suppl. with
20% FBS.
Comparisons of efficiency of colony formation of fibroblast (ECFf)
were made between the presence of feeder cells in adherent
mouse marrow cells cultures, and their absence.  The feeder cells
were marrow cells from either mouse or guinea pig irradiated to
60 Gy (using cobalt-60); some feeder preps treated with 0.4% EDTA
in liovine serum @ 37&deg; for 15 min to remove platelets.
Colonies (CFUf) were determined to be clusters of elongated fibroblasts
seen 3-6 d in culture.  By 10 d, most colonies were hundreds to thousands
of cells, with noted presence of some macrophages and myeloid cells.
<p>
The number of colonies formed in "conventional marrow cell cultures"
(CMCC, i.e., cultures containing both adherents and non-adherents)
increased linearly with the presence of a minimal count of cells
in the primary culture (linear with log #colony vs. log primary
culture cell count);  at least 10<sup>6</sup> cells (per
25&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> flask) were necessary to see more than one (2)
colony in the entire flask.  With up to 10<sup>7</sup> cells as much
as 600 colonies can form, whereas with 3 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> cells,
about 20 colonies form.
<p>
In adherent marrow cell cultures (AMCC, where nonadherents are removed
quickly), the ECFf (colony count) is much less than CMCC.  When 300,000
cells were placed in flask, CMCC formed 20 colonies vs. 1 for AMCC.
When guinea pig feeder cells were added to various levels in AMCC, it
became clear that ECFf increased dramatically.  With 3 million feeder cells,
it was 2-fold more than CMCC, and with 10 million FC, it was more than
4-fold above CMCC.
<p>
ECFf remained constant (about 10.0 per 10,000) in studies where the
total number of AMCC was varied while the feeder cell population
remained constant (at 10<sup>7</sup> cells).
<p>
As for disaggregation technique (mechanical or trypsinization), there
was no difference in the ability of feeder cells to stimulate
colony formation, but there was a difference in quantitative response,
with ECFf of mechanically disaggregated cultures being 1.7 and
for trypsin disaggregated cultures being 14.6.
<p>
Some dependence was seen with serum levels in feeder cell-containing
cultures.  With 10 million FC, 1% serum showed no colonies,
5% serum about 50, and 20% serum about 80.  Increasing FC beyond
10<sup>7</sup> usually had no effect in increasing ECFf.  Hence factors
in serum cannot be substituted by factors inherent in FC.
<p>
Within 24 h of primary culture, spindle-shaped fibroblasts are
distinguishable in AMCC (no feeders), being 2 in 10,000 of mechanically
disaggregated cells, and 2 in 1000 cells of trypsinized marrow.
<p>
Clonogenicity (colonies from single fibroblasts) were apparent in
a correlation between the number of single adherents counted at 24
h of the primary and the number of colony foci present in 10 day cultures,
with as many as 6 divisions estimated from the counts of cells in the
foci.
<p>
The timing of FC supplementation was tested.  In one experiment, the
number of days that feeders remained associated with cultures was
tested, and it was observed that CFUf increased up to and reached maximal
by 7 days (with a 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10 day period tested).  In a 2nd
experiment, the post-plating interval (association was a constant
10 days) was tested (from day 0 to day 10, 2-11, 3-12, 4-13, 7-16, 10-19),
and the maximal CFUf was for the 0-10 day interval, decreasing steadily
the more days post-plating that the culture was not associated with feeders.
This indicates that the feeders should be mixed with culture cells as
early as possible.
<p>
Other feeder cells types (other than from marrow) were tested.
Spleen cells from mice and guinea pigs, and platelets from guinea pigs
and rabbits, all had a stimulating effect on ECFf.  The effect
of 200 million platelets was equivlent to 12 million bone marrow feeders.
Megakaryocytes treated with EDTA to remove platelets also retained
ECFf-stimulating ability.  Guinea pig spleen cells whose platelets
were removed lost their ability to increase ECFf.  Thymocytes, lymph
node cells, and circulating leukocytes had no effect on ECFf.
<p>
Adding PDGF (at 10 and 50 ng/ml), IL-3 (at at range from 3-70 ng/ml),
or EGF (5, 20, and 100 ng/ml) to AMCC did not increase ECFf.  IL-3 also
had no synergy or added effect with feeder cell presence.

  Characterization of Cells with Osteogenic Potential from Human Marrow
<p class="Para1">
Marrow is taken from femur cancellous bone from
subjects with degenerative joint disease; from aspirations of the
iliac crest of healthy donors and oncology patients; from
tissue during marrow transplation procedures.  All stromal cells
had normal karyotypes.
<p>
For culture, cells are taken up in BGJ<sub>b</sub> medium with
10% FBS lot-selected.  They are centrifuged to eliminate fat and
the supernatant, serially passed through 18- and 20-gauge needles
(using 10 ml syringes) to produce single cell suspensions,
treated with 4% acetic acid to lyse RBCs, and then 50-100 million
mononuclear cells plated to 100 mm dishes.  Iliac crest aspirates
are also treated on 70% Percoll gradients, which are later separated
into three fractions:  top 25% (pooled density 1.03 g/ml), which contains
the MSCs; mid 50% (pooled density 1.10 g/ml) with high density mononuclear

Only 100-500 MSCs are present in a marrow prep of 50-100 million cells.
An experiment to test the best time to change media the first time to
remove adherents was done with 1, 3, and 7 days, and 3 days was found
to be the best time.  These few adherent cells will probably double
each day rapidly.  Cells are passaged when they become 80-90% confluent;
they are not allowed to become confluent out of fear of differentiation.
Trypsin treatments are with 0.25% trypsin + 0.1 mM EDTA; 5&nbsp;min at
37&deg; sufficiently detaches.  Splits are 1:3.  Cryopreservation is with
90% FBS/10% DMSO.  From a 100 mm dish, yields that are 80-90% confluent
are 1 million cells.
<p>
The goal of this research was to see how MSCs could infiltrate ceramic
plugs and diffusion chambers to be surgically implanted in bone repair.
<p>
The porous ceramic plugs (hydroxylapatite &amp; calcium phosphate) were
incubated in cell suspensions (suspensions were in serum-free media)
for vacuum-assisted infiltration, and
then placed in subcutaneous pockets incised along the backs of nude mice.
Plugs after the first week fibrous and vascular tissue lined the pores,
but no bone or cartilage was evident.  Over the next 7 weeks (weeks 2-8),
increasing mineralization without any cartilage was seen (29 in 30 samples);
this effect was independent of the age and sex of human donor, cell
passage and cell loading count (variables tested).  Osteoblast presence
is noted early in this process.  In ceramic grafts not receiving
cell infiltrates, no bone or cartilage growth was seen, although fibrous
and vascular tissue was found in pores.
<p>
Diffusion chambers were fashioned from plexiglass rings, Millipore
filter membranes, and cement (see Ashton et al., <i>Clin. Orthop.</i>
<b>151</b>: 294-307, 1980).  0.1-0.14 ml of cell suspension was
placed within diffusion chambers, which were surgically placed within
the peritonea of nude mice.  Even after 10 weeks, no bone or cartilage
tissue ever developed; only a hypocellular sparse fibrous tissue was
evident.
<p>
Immunocytochemical staining
using MAb 6E2 showed staining of the cells of the graft taken from
the mice:  MAb 6E2 reacts with a broad number of human tissues,
including bone osteoblasts and marrow MSCs, but it does not react
with nonhuman cells.  This indicated that the cells still found in the
mice were of human origin.

Cardiac Troponin I:  A Marker with High Specificity for Cardiac Injury
<p class="Para1">
This study of 215 humans included 56 with skeletal muscle injury
(37 acute injury by trauma, rhabdomyolysis, etc), 10 chronic myopathy,
9 acute injury from extreme exertion (marathon running).  159 with
chronic renal failure requiring dialysis included.  Acute muscle injury
defined as &gt;1700 IU/l total CK.  Clinical evaluations were done
except for the runners, and included history, phys. exam., and ECG.
Two-dimensional echocardiograms were done on all patients meeting
muscle damage criteria (using Hewlett-Packard 77600 ultrasound imager
coupled to 2.5- or 3.5 MHz transducer); parasternal short and long
axis, and apical two- and four-chamber views taken, as well as a subcostal
view.  Abnormal wall motions identified were also followed up.  The
presence of abnormal regional wall motion was considered definitive
for myocardial damage.  Blood was sampled for analysis of total CK,
CK-MB, and cTnI.  cTnI was assayed by a Stratus immunochemistry analyzer
using an antibody sandwich with enzyme-linked monoclonal.  Levels
are undetectable in normal individuals.  LOD is 1.5 ng/ml with a reference
range of &le;3.1 ng/ml.  CK-MB was assayed by various means, depending
on patient subgroup.
<p>
Total CK was elevated in all 37 patients with acute skeletal muscle
disease (mean 7731 IU/L).  24 of the 37 had elevated CK-MB (mean
22.7 &plusmn; 21.2 ng/ml).  Four of these had identified wall motion
abnormalities with acute cardiac injury.
<p>
Patients with chronic muscle disease showed elevated mean total CK
(4434 IU/l) and 9 of the 10 had elevated mean CK-MB (125.8 ng/ml).
Only one had cardiac injury showing abnormal wall motion.
<p>
27 in the 159 chronic renal failure patients showed elevated mean
total CK (180 IU/l) and 7 were elevated for CK-MB (mean 8.1 ng/ml).
<p>
Marathon runners also showed elevated total CK (mean peak 1337 IU/l) and
6 of the 7 had elevated CK-MB (mean peak 33 ng/ml), with highest levels
on first post-race sample.  Percent CK-MB of total CK did not show
a pattern for distinguishing skeletal muscle injury and myocardial injury.
<p>
cTnI was elevated in only 6 patients with regional wall motion abnormalities,
four having acute trauma, one Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, and one
with chronic renal failure.  In addition to having segmental wall
motion abnormalities, all had elevated CK-MB and ECG abnormalities
consistent with ischemia.  In the 4 patients with acute trauma,
3 had fixed area of akinesis on echo, as well as ST segment abnormalities,
and two developed new Q waves.
<p>
The data shows that cTnI increases do not occur despite severe acute
or chronic muscle injury even with elevated plasma CK-MB.  Increases
only occur with cardiac muscle injury.  Concordance was found with
cTnI elevations and presence of echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities.

Spinal Cord Neuroblasts Proliferate in Response to Basic Fibroblast
Growth Factor
<p class="Para1">
Spinal cords from E14-E16 Fisher rats were dissected and digested in
papain-protease-DNase for 15 min at 37&deg;.  Treated cords were
mechanically disaggregated by trituration in fine-bore fire-polished
pasteur pipets.  After centrifugation and resuspension in medium
(DMEM + 10% FBS + Gln), the suspension was plated for 2-3 h.
Nonadherents were collected and suspended in N2 medium (DMEM:F12
high glucose, 5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml insulin, 50&nbsp;&mu;g/ml human TRF, 20 nM
progesterone, 100&nbsp;&mu;M putrescine, 30 nM sodium selenite, 2.5 mM Gln),
and this was supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF; additional trituration
was done and (after counting) cells were plated on 75 cm<sup>2</sup>
coated with 10&nbsp;&mu;g/ml polyornithine/5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml laminin, with 10<sup>6</sup>
cells per flask.  (Note that the coating procedure involved overnight
incubation of polyOrn in water at room temp, wash twice with water,
then incubation with laminin in PBS overnight, and washing with PBS
twice and storing in PBS at &minus;20&deg; until use.)  Cell media
is changed 3-4 d cycles with N2 medium containing bFGF.  Cryopreservation
is in N2+bFGF medium containing 10% DMSO.
<p>
The preplating method to remove cells that adhere only to plastic is
well-reported.  Nonadherents transferred to polyOrn/laminin show certain
cells adhering by 24 h, and the cells extend processes.  Cells
are also proliferating within 2 d, the daughter cells small and bipolar.
Between 2-7 d, cell bodies are larger, and size of processes also.
Processes start to contact other cells.  By day 15, there is a lattice
structure, with aggregates of tens of cells between lattice connections.
<p>
Several growth factors at 20 ng/ml were tried using 3 d cultures exposed
to triated thymidine for 24 h (one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the
results).  DNA synthesis was stimulated 3-fold with bFGF, and 2-fold with
EGF, but there was no significant effect with NGF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BNDF), or NT3.  A dose response curve (0, 0.05,
0.5, 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ng/ml) indicated that 20 ng/ml in fact
produced the maximal response (more than 5-fold in this experiment).
Cell count data revealed that doubling time was 2.5 d with bFGF treatment.
Cells depend not on bFGF for proliferation, but survival as well.
<p>
Cells were treated with BrdU 24 h and immunocytochemically probed with
anti-BrdU and anti-NSE.  About 70% of cells were positive for NSE,
and 40% of those cells were positive for BrdU.  Double label determinations
for BrdU and the neurofilament 200 kDa (NF200) protein showed only a few
cells reacting to both;  NF200 staining would be indicative of fully
differentiated neurons.  Neuronal subtype was delineated with BrdU
and labeling to ChAT.  Astrocyte numbers were counted using BrdU
and antibody GFAP, with 17% cells positive for GFAP alone and 7% of
those labeled with both.
<p>
Long-term (multi-passaged) cultures were assessed for the ability of
neurons to express certain proteins.  Both primary cultured and long-term
cells stained for NSE.  Some cells were positive for NF-200.
15% of cells were positive for GFAP at passage 1, and 12% positive at
passage 4, showing that astrocytes maintain proportional numbers.
Neurotransmitter staining indicate neurons were composed of GABAergic
and cholinergic cells.  &lt; 1% of cells express ChAT, GABA, and
Glu decarboxylase (GAD 67).
<p>
It has been reported that spinal cord motoneurons express a low-affinity
75 kDa NGF receptor (LNGFR).  Passage 3 cells were positive for LNGFR for
a number of cells possessing long processes, in which the stain developed
in both the bodies and processes of these cells.  These cells are also
bigger than negative cells, and some express ChAT.  Motoneurons were only
a small proportion however (&lt; 1%).  Some GFAP-positive (though not all)
were also stained with LNGFR.
<p>
Stable transfection was achieved using a retroviral vector containing a
LacZ reporter.  12% of cells in 3rd passage after transfection were
expressing &beta;-gal;  control cells never stained for &beta;-gal.
Passage 4 cells were probed for NSE and &beta;-gal, and many cells with
widely varying morphologies showed dual labeling, with staining in both
the periplasm and in processes.  Double labeling was also revealed for
GABA and &beta;-gal in cells.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>.  MFG is a retroviral vector that contains up to 1035
bases of a <i>gag</i> gene for increased packaging efficiencies.  It
contains no selectable marker.  After preparation of MGF-&beta;-gal,
CRIP cells are transfected and a packaging cell line MIB4 is available.
E14-E16 spinal cord cells are cultured on 6-well polyOrn/laminin plates
in N2+bFGF, and packaging cells are in DMEM + 5% FBS overnight at
37&deg; in 10% CO<sub>2</sub>.  Virus is collected and filtered
through 0.45&nbsp;&mu;m and incubated with cord cells in 4&nbsp;&mu;g/ml polybrene
and 20 ng/ml bFGF overnight.  &beta;-Gal histochemistry is done on
(Lab-Tek) chamber slides allowed to reach 50-60% confluence, fixing
cells in 1.5% glutaraldehyde (30 min, RT), washing well with PBS,
and then exposing overnight to 5&nbsp;mM potassium <i>ferro</i>cyanide,
5 mM potassium <i>ferri</i>cyanide, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and
40&nbsp;&mu;g/ml X-gal (product of 5-Prime-to-3-Prime in West Chester, PA).
Cells can then be washed multiple (3) times in PBS and then dried in
ethanol gradient before mounting.

Differentiation of Human Bone Marrow Osteogenic Stromal Cells
<i>In Vitro</i>:  Induction of the Osteoblast Phenotype by Dexamethasone
<p class="Para1">
Human marrow cells were isolated from cut ribs irrigated with
DMEM/Ham's F-12 + 10 U/ml heparin and 1&nbsp;&mu;g/ml DNase.  After
centrifuging 500 &times; g 10 min, the pellet is resuspended in &alpha;-MEM
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS.  The suspension in a new tube (20 ml),
15 ml histopaque-1077 is layered to the bottom.  The tube is again
spinned 500 &times; g for 30 min.  Mononuclear cells are harvested at
interface, washed 3 times in serum-free media, then put into flasks at
4000 / cm<sup>2</sup>.
<p>
Cells are not disturbed for 7 days;  even no cells are observed to
attach until after 3-4 days.  Attached cells form rapidly growing colonies,
which eventually come to confluence, which continue to proliferate
at multicellular layers up to 2 weeks later.
<p>
First passage MSCs treated with 0.1&nbsp;&mu;M dexamethasone for 7 d took
on a cuboidal shape.  Cell growth was inhibited, as determined by
[methyl-<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine or by cell counting, was inhibited by half.
Alcian blue staining indicated that no chondrocyte was present after
1-3 weeks, either in vehicle-treated control or the Dex-treated.  Neither
morphology nor oil red O staining indicated any (perhaps a few) adipocytes
being present.
<p>
ALP activities were shown to be increased 2- to 6-fold over the week of
treatment, the range depending on from which patient the cells were taken.
This increase was time-dependent:  the increase first seen after 2-3 d,
and maximal by 1-2 wk.  It was also dose-dependent:  maximal with 1&nbsp;&mu;M
Dex, but effects observed with as little as 1 nM.  The treatment period
could also be as little as 2 d to observe effects as long as day 7.
ALP activity was pretty much the same on day 14 whether cells were
treated with Dex continuously or only for 7 d.The cells recover
from treatment (return to basal) over a 3-7 d period after Dex withdrawal.
<p>
Using a radioimmunoassay to measure cAMP levels, the effect of Dex
was seen to enhance the level of cAMP in cells treated with
0.1&nbsp;&mu;M hPTH 1-34 by 3- to 6-fold, and with 1&nbsp;&mu;M PGE<sub>2</sub>
by 3-fold.  The level of cAMP matched the level of ALP activity with
respect to pulse or continuous treatment and also withdrawal.
<p>
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> can induce osteocalcin (BGP)
synthesis and secretion from MSCs, and this was shown.  Cells
were treated with 20 nM 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitD and/or 0.1&nbsp;&mu;M Dex
and after 3 days, media was tested for secreted osteocalcin.  With
Dex treatment, osteocalcin levels actually fell off.
<p>
A Northern blot (see paper for detailed method) was used to test
for changes in expression of osteonectin mRNA.  No change in the level
of osteonectin was seen with treatment.
<p>
Ascorbic acid and &beta;-glycerophosphate were included in Dex treatment
and by 2-3 weeks, matrix deposition in the multicellular layers was
evident, and this matrix showed areas of mineralization.  Mineralization
was maximum after 4-5 weeks.  There was no nodule formation in either
controls or treated cultures.
<p>
Cells treated with Dex for 7 days continue to mineralize the matrix
(though to a lesser degree) as long as 10 days beyond the stop of
treatment.  There was no difference in the degree of mineralization
on day 20 cultures whether the cells had been treated for 7 d or 14 d
or continuously.
<p>
The mineralization was identical to hydroxyapatite, according to
electron probe x-ray microanalysis.  (Fixed, dehydrated cells on
coverslips are carbon-coated and illuminated with a JEOL 733 superprobe
set at 10 keV, beam current = 5&nbsp;namp, with energy dispersive spectrometer
which acquires 100 sec spectrum for each 20&nbsp;&mu;m spot.)  A small
amount of potassium is present among the calcium phosphate; Ca/P is
1.63 &plusmn; 0.15, similar to bone hydroxyapatite Ca/P of 1.6.
Trypan blue staining was used in part to verify that mineralization
was not the result of cell death or necrosis, which indicates that
mineralization was part of some biologically controlled ossification
process.

Tissue-Specific Expression of Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> Exchanger
Isoforms
<p class="Para1">
NCX-1 is a fragment corresponding to nt 2308-2760 of the sodium-calcium
exchanger (NCE) and its probe was used to screen 20,000 transformants
in a rat kidney cortex cDNA library.  Three clones were identified,
with clone F1 isolated and sequenced.  A single nt (987) was missing
likely because of a cloning error.  PCR or kidney and heart RNA showed
this base in all NCE transcripts.  Clone F1 is 3299 nt long with
376 nt in 5'-UTR, 957 aa in open reading frame, and 52 nt in 3'-UTR;
the 3' end features an AT repeat conserved in all NCE clones and a
common site of reverse transcriptase priming.  The clone was nearly
identical to a known NCE cDNA sequence except at position &minus;34
in the 5'-UTR and in nt 1800-1898 of the coding region which varies
because of alternative splicing.
<p>
5'-RACE was used to determine whether the unique sequence in the 5'UTR
was representative of kidney NCE transcript.  Two bands at ~600 and ~350 bp
were found in kidney cortex mRNA.  The larger product, Kc1, was found
from multiple independently isolated clones to be identical to F1, although
16 bases longer on the 5' end.  Restriction mapping of the 5'-RACE
product showed the larger band to be only one species corresponding to
the sequenced subclones, and the smaller band was a species corresponding
to clones found in the heart and brain.  5'-RACE was also used to analyze
heart left ventricle and brain cerebral cortex NCE transcripts because the
kidney species did not match published 5'-UTR NCE sequences:  one species
was found in heart, identical to published rat heart NCE but 62 bases
longer in 5' end.  In brain, two variants are found;  Br1 is the same
as reported for rat brain NCE with 99 nt extra on the 5' end and Br2
is the same as the smaller kidney 5'-RACE product and identical to heart
except for 66 more bases on 5' end.  Each species has a unique 5' end,
but are identical after position &minus;34.
<p>
Total RNA was prepared from various rat tissues and probed with the common
coding region (NCX-1) were used in Northern blots.  Also used as probes
were clone Br1, Br2, and kidney F1.  Transcripts at ~7 and ~13 kb
were recognized by NCX-1 (these are ubiquitously expressed) as were
fainter bands at ~3 and ~4 kb.  The brain tissue had more 13 kb transcript
than other tissues.  Densitometry indicatd that heart, brain, and kideny
cortex all had high NCE transcript levels, whereas other tissues had
variable amounts.  Br1 is more brain-specific and recognized a pattern of
bands with relative intensities closely matched to NCX-1, but with
lower levels in heart, kidney cortex, large intestine and stomach.
The Br2 clone is more heart-specific and hybridized strongly to NCE
transcript in heart, weakly to 7 kb band in large intestine and stomach,
and to 13 kb band in cerebrum.  The kidney F1 clone hybridized only
to transcripts in kidney cortex.
<p>
The 5' ends therefore are expressed in tissue-specific manner.
Bovine NCE clones have been isolated as well, the and Br2 rat heart
clone shows limited but significantly homoogy with bovine p13, and the
F1 rat kidney and bovine p17 clones are some similarity as well.
As NCE is transcribed, the transcription start site varies with the
promoter/enhancer, and splicing alternatives emerge to give unique
5'-UTR ends, but the splicing is identical after position &minus;34.
<p>
A variable region in the NCE protein exists in the carboxyl terminal
end of the large cytoplasmic loop, reported to result from alternative
splicing.  RT-PCR using primers AS1 (TAAAACCATTGAAGGCACAGC, nt 1713-1733),
and AS2 (ACTTCCAGCTTGGTGTGTTC) corresponding to conserved sequence
flanking the splicing area was done on various rat tissues.
Three bands were seen in acrylamide gel, which were sequenced or
analyzed by diagnostic restriction digestion showed 5 major species
in the different tissues.  Exons A and B are mutually exclusive with
in tissue expression.  Using nomenclature developed by others,
heart expresses an isoform called NACA1, brain predominantly NACA5,
and kidney mostly NACA3.  In rabbit, Exons E and F are expressed as a
unit, independent of exon C, included with exon A in isoform NACA1.
In rat exons C and E move as a unit, independent of F but only found
together with exon A in NACA1 transcript.  While alternative splicing
of the basic units does not alter exchanger functionality, it may alter
purpose with respect to binding regulatory factors or in directing
subcellular localization.

Neurotrophins and Receptors
<p class="Para1">
REVIEW. The neurotrophin family has four members, with 50-60% amino
acid identity between any two.  These are basic proteins (pI 9-10.5)
about 120 aa long, all processed from precursors.  NGF is the first
identified among all proteins with neurotrophic potential;  its three
-S-S- bonds are also found in the family.  The sequences surrounding
the 6 Cys residues that form the bonds are also highly conserved.
The family's three other members are BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4.
<p>
NGF exerts its neurotrophic properties to sympathetic neurons and
to certain subpopulations of sensory neurons of the neural crest.
Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain (BFCN) and striatum also appear
to be influenced.  Homozygous NGF knockout mice have no sympathetic
ganglia and more than 70% depletion of dorsal root ganglion neurons.
<p>
BDNF was isolated from pig brain (1982) then later found to be
related to NGF (Liebrock et al, 1989).  It promotes survival of
sensory neurons of placode-derived cranial ganglia, but does not
affect sympathetic ganglia, unlike NGF.  There is overlapping effect
between NGF and BDNF for action on DRG and BFCN.
<p>
With respect to BFCN, NGF and BDNF show no addivite response in terms
of promoting survival of these neurons, but there is a synergy to
induction of ChAT activity.  BNDF rescues BFCN from axotomy-induced
atrophy and death due to fimbria-fornix lesion.  It is the loss of
BFCN that is thought to be the cause of cognitive decline seen in
Alzheimer's.  No animal models of Alzheimer's is available, and
so therapeutic effects have been sought by direct administration
locally to different brain regions.
<p>
BDNF and other factors (CNTF, NT-3, and NT4) are necessary for survival
and differentiation of motor neurons.  In many cases they are involved
in the development of neurons as well.  Studies with mice having
motor neuron disease have shown that CNTF might be of some value in
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;  BNDF also has some positive effect
as does CNTF.  Particularly combined treatments of the two factors
provide greater compensation of abilities lost by the dieases.
Both CNTF and BNDF are in clinical trials for treatment of ALS.
<p>
Dopaminergic neuron loss the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease
may be thwarted by the use of BDNF.  It promotes survival of embryonic
rat nigral neurons, and protects these neurons from toxic action by

<p>

Survival and Differentiation of Adult Neuronal Progenitor Cells
Transplanted to the Adult Brain
<p class="Para1">
Hippocampi were taken from &gt; 3 mon old (adult) female Fisher 344
rats and the lining tissues (ependymal, subventricular zone, and
choroid plexus) were removed.  PBS-washed tissue was dissociated
with a papain/neutral protease/DNase I mix.  Cells plated into
DMEM/F12 (1:1) with high glucose and 2.5 mM Gln and 10% FBS
(1 million into 75 cm<sup>2</sup>).  The following day, medium is
changed to serum-free DMEM/F12 containing N2 supplement and 20 ng/ml
recombinant human FGF-2.
<p>
Cells were passaged over 2 months to produce cells with homogenous
morphology and doubling time of 2 days.  Cells are phase bright
and rounded with thin processes.  Removing FGF-2 from medium results
in cell death.
<p>
Immunocytochemistry revealed staining patterns identical in early
and late passage cells, and the hippocampal cells expressed proteins
in undifferentiated progenitors&minus;;nestin, A2B5, and O4.
Antigens suggesting glial progenitors (A2B5, O4) were present but
less than 2 in 100 progress to the glial phenotype.  Most cells
indicate a neuronal type (GAD, NSE, MAP2, and MAP5).
Cells expressing both glial and neuronal markers were considered
to be progenitors not yet committed to a fate.
<p>
The cultured cells express neither tau or NeuN; NeuN is a nuclear
marker specific to terminally differentiated neurons.  Calretinin
and calbindin are present in some cells, and these are found in
hippocamplal neurons.  Studies of the ultrastructure of selected
cells were showed large round euchromatic nuclei with distinct nucleolus,
and somatic extensions with organized arrays of microtubules, and
several layers were ensheathed in myelin of some processes, indicating
development of neurons and oligodendroglia.
<p>
Cells labeled with BrdU and/or an adenoviral vector carrying LacZ
were grafted to hippocampi of rats (controls were cells either sonicated
or freeze-thawed prior to the procedure, to see if dead or dying cells
or their contents had any effect).  75,000 cells were used in the graft
and animals sacrificed 1, 4, 8, and 12 wk later.  BrdU labeling indicated
that 26,000-31,000 grafted cells survived after 8-12 wk; this decline
could be either loss of cells or fall in transgene expression.  Loss
of <i>LacZ</i> expression may occur even if cultured cells proliferated,
since the adenoviral particle is episomal and degradation or random
loss can occur with cell division.  BrdU labeling would not account for
such proliferation if DNA synthesis brought about dilution of BrdU below
detection levels.
<p>
Grafted cells migrated up to 3 mm beyond the implantation site.  Cells
were usually located near sites of damage;  the injection itself can
cause damage to dorsal leaf of dentate gyrus.  The glial (both
astroglial and oligodendroglial) phenotype was prominent, shown
by cells that double-labeled for BrdU and GFAP, and found scattered
in corpus callosum, stratum radiatum and moleculare, and dorsal leaf
of dentate gyrus.  Neuronal phenotypes were in the granule cell layer
of the dentate gyrus.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>.  Type 5&nbsp;adenoviral vectors with E1a deletions were
set up with <i>LacZ</i> gene under the control of cytomegalovirus
immediate early promoter and obtained as virions.  Stocks were generated
by infecting 293 cells with an m.o.i. of 10, then harvesting the
supernatant containing adenovirus virions two days later, spinning
that at 5000 &times; <i>g</i> for 5&nbsp;min.  Titers were between 0.5-1.0
&times; 10<sup>8</sup>.
<p>
Transduction of the cultured cells of interest was done by mixing
9 volumes of fresh medium with 1 volume of viral titer stock from
293 cell supernatant.  Cells can then be harvested with trypsin,
washed in PBS and then used in grafting procedures.  Detection of
the <i>LacZ</i> reporter can be done using an anti-&beta;-galactosidase
antibody (or Xgal substrate??).

A Chemically Defined Medium Supports <i>In Vitro</i> Proliferation
and Maintains The Osteochondral Potential of Rat Marrow-Derived
Mesenchymal Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
Marrow from 2-4 mon old male Fisher F-344 rats (asphyxiated by CO<sub>2</sub>)
was taken from tibiae/femora (a complex in which ends excised by rongeur)
using 18-gauge needle to bore through growth plates and flushing with
DMEM + 1 g/l glucose (DMEM-LG) + 10% FBS.  Disruption of tissue achieved by
serial passage through 16-, 18-, and 20-gauge needles.  4% acetic acid
was used to lyse RBCs.  Plating was 50 million cells to 100 mm dishes.
After 12-14 d, large colonies are harvested by trypsin.  Subculturing
is typically 1:3 (but not less than 600,000 cells per dish);  harvest
is just near the point of confluence, but not beyond.
<p>
A quantitative crystal violet assay was used to assess proliferation.
This assay assumes that dye binding per cell is uniform, and that
total dye bound is released by Triton X-100 treatment;  solutions
are read at 600 nm.  To verify this assumption, cell numbers were
determined and 35 mm dishes seeded with between 6250 and 200,000 cells
for 24 h.  Cells are fixed and stained as usual; stain associates
with nuclei largely.  Plots of OD 600 nm vs. cell number are entirely
linear (<i>r</i> = 0.996); there is an upper limit however.  Additional
verification was done by trypsinizing the 24 h seeded dishes and counting
on Coulter Model Z1, with even better correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.999).
<p>
The effect of different growth media was tested.  In MCDB-201 medium
(a modification of Ham's F-12), rMSCs survived well but did not
go beyond 5&nbsp;days in plain F-12.  Other MCDB media (105, 110, 151, 153
and 302) were tried, but none helped survival or proliferation.
DMEM-HG (4.5 g/l glucose) did not do as well as DMEM-LG.  A 60:40
mix of DMEM-LG and MCDB-201 was judged an optimal basal medium.
In general growth of cells could not be sustained in serum-free medium
and so 10% FBS was a necessary additive.
<p>
Inclusion of 5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml insulin with 0.1% linoleic acid-bovine serum albumin
complex (LA-BSA) caused a decline in cell count in the first couple of days,
with cells remaining constant, but often increasing from days 2-4 and
days 6-9.  Still by day 7, cell counts are half those in controls (cultures
with serum).
<p>
In medium with insulin, LA-BSA, and 10 ng/ml PDGF-&beta;&beta;, cell
numbers were perhaps slightly higher by day 4 than in insulin+LA-BSA
alone, but only 90% of counts by day 5&nbsp;and 70-75% by days 6-9.
<p>
With the addition of bFGF to the insulin+LA-BSA+PDFG-&beta;&beta; medium,
day 5 culture counts were comparable even to serum-supplemented cultures.
After day 5, counts started to fall off to 70% of serum-medium counts
by day 9.  Nonetheless cell density by day 9 is such that subculturing
is necessary to maintain proliferation.
<p>
When switching from serum-containing medium to a serum-free defined
medium, care must be taken to make sure that all traces of serum are
removed since they have a substantial effect.
<p>
A dose-response curve was performed for each of the four components
of the defined medium.  With insulin tested (5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml transferrin
is present) at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100&nbsp;&mu;/ml,
OD 600 was always increasing without ever
reaching a constant maximum.  Higher concentrations were not tested
since these are in excess of physiological and likely beyond
pharmacological.  Different forms of BSA (fatty-acid
free, delipidized, linoleic acid-satd) from 0.005 to 0.5% were
tried:  Up to 0.1%, both the FA-free and LA-satd reached a maximum,
and then OD 600 fell off.  The delipidized showed a slowed increase.
Three forms of PDFG (&alpha;&alpha;, &alpha;&beta;, and &beta;&beta;)
were tried, and all caused an increase in OD 600, but the &beta;&beta;
response was best.  bFGF addition showed slow, barely significant
increases in OD 600, reaching maximal at 1 ng/ml, then falling off;
it was assayed in the presence of PDGF-&beta;&beta;
<p>
A combination of 50&nbsp;&mu;g/ml insulin included with LA-BSA and
PDGF-&beta;&beta; produced the highest cell counts possible on day 6.
Other studies indicated that higher insulin concentrations with
the other components present resulted in lower cell numbers, and
5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml insulin was judged the best level.  Other optimal concentrations
determined included 0.1% LA-BSA, 10 ng/ml PDGF-&beta;beta;, and
1 ng/ml bFGF.  In general any isoform of PDGF had a stimulating
effect on proliferation although PDGF-&beta;&beta; was the best.
Cells were not morphologically typical at very high concentrations
of PDGF-&beta;&beta; (20-30 ng/ml), even though they had the highest
effect on proliferation.  Since 5&nbsp;ng/ml PDGF provided no stimulatory
effect, the 10 ng/ml concentration represented the ideal compromise.
<p>
bFGF was also assayed in the presence and absence of PDGF-&beta;&beta;.
1 ng/ml bFGF was optimal in the presence of PDGF-BB and 0.5 ng/ml
in the absence of PDGF-BB.  Cell count was always higher at all concentrations
of bFGF when PDGF-BB was present.  Combinations of these factors in
medium show that cell proliferation increases due to individual components
of the medium are not additive, but synergistic.
<p>
Serum-fed (10%) colonies are rather small after 3-4 d, increasing in
size over next 10 d.  Multinucleated cells (macrophages, monocytes,
other hematopoietic) were also present; erythrocytes are not adherent
and do not survive passage.  Prior to becoming confluent, the fibroblastic
cells can be easily detached with trypsin-EDTA while the multinucleate
cells remain tightly bound.  So first passage cells are quite homogeneous,
as are the second passage, which cells are used in serum-free experiments.
Morphology of cells in DMEM-LG or mixture of 60% DMEM-LG/40% MCDB-201
when both are supplemented with 10% FBS.  The passage 1 and 2 cells
lose the spindle shape of the primaries in serum-supplementation.
<p>
In defined serum-free medium cells are morphologically similar
to the polygonal cells with numerous cytoplasmic fibrils and single
nuclei with usually two nucleoli, but cells are larger and broader.
Also cell count is much lower, and the cell borders rarely exhibited
irregularities or projections.  Addition of insulin and LA-BSA,
cell density is greater and cells slightly larger.
<p>
Adding PDGF-BB, even to 5&nbsp;ng/ml, has a dramatic effect.  Cells are
slightly larger with more irregular surfaces (many thin), and slightly
elongated cytoplasmic extensions.

Human and Animal Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells From Bone Marrow:
Identification of Serum for Optimal Selection and Proliferation
<p class="Para1">
Screening of multiple samples of serum lots has been performed
in the past using mesenchymal cells obtained from the limb buds
of Stage 24 embryonic chick.  Cells in 35 mm dishes are fixed on
day 8 and stained with toluidine blue; this staining colors
cartilage metachromatically.  Toluidine blue staining is done
by first rinsing in Tyrode's solution,
fixing in phosphate-buffered 10% formalin for 30 min, rinsing twice
in water, covering with 0.1% (w/v) toluidine blue for 3 min, then
rinsing twice with 70%, 95%, then 100% ethanol.
<p>
Because adult MSCs from mammals and not embryonic from avians are
used, serum selection must be on that basis.Marrow hMSCs were
plated to 100 mm dishes in low glucose DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS from the several lots being tested.  Scored is the ability
to facilitate attachment, promote proliferation, and maintain osteochondral
potential.  At least one serum which should be tested as a control is the lot
currently in favor.  The cells should be from a single donor since there
is variation in the yield of cells, colony number, ability to differentiate,
etc., and the only variable of interest is the effect of serum, not of
the cells.  The cells are allowed to grow for at least 2, even 3, weeks
and then cell counts made by hemocytometer or automated counter.
The primary cultures are re-passaged at least once and counts made again,
to see which serum is really performing.
<p>
Both rMSCs and hMSCs share an ability to form bone and cartilage
in fibronectin-treated ceramic tubes which have been implanted
subcutaneously in nude mice.  In a test of a dozen potential serum
samples, only 3 showed signs of bone or cartilage growth in plugs
after 3 weeks (one of which was the control being used).  One serum
sample showed bone, the other cartilage (neither was the control).
After 6 weeks ceramic cubes were positive for all sera except for two.
The greatest amount of bone (with mineralization approx equal) was in
three lots, one of which was the control, the other being the 3 week
cartilage grower, and the last being a lot not noted at 3 weeks.  Based
on the results, the 3-week cartilage grower compared well with the control,
and was selected.
<p>
Osteogenic potential was determined by inducing cells and then staining
for ALP and for mineral.  Cells were seeded 3000 / cm<sup>2</sup> in
multiwell plates.  After 24 h, serum-free induction medium containing
0.1&nbsp;&mu;M dexamethasone, 10 mM &beta;-glycerophosphate, and 50&nbsp;&mu;M
ascorbic acid-2-phosphate.  Medium was changed twice each week.
On days 4, 8, 12, and 16, the following tests were done:
<ul>
<li>ALP activity
<li>ALP histochemistry using Sigma kit #85 for 1 hr at room temp
<li>cell number by crystal violet
 <br>wash 2 &times; in Tyrode's solution, then fix with 1% (v/v)
glutaraldehyde in Tyrode's solution, then stain according to
published procedure
<li>mineral by von Kossa staining
 <ol>
 <li>stain for ALP histochemistry
 <li>rinse with distilled water
 <li>add 1 ml freshly made 2% silver nitrate, keep plate in dark 10 min
 <li>rinse wells three times with water in subdued light
 <li>leave the last well filled with water, but expose the plate to
  bright light for 15 min
 <li>stop reaxn by thorough rinsing with more water
 </ol>
</ul>
<p>
Cells at all passages were amenable to induction, although cells from
later passages appeared to deposit more mineralized matrix.
<p>
If rMSCs are being used in serum selection tests, it may be necessary
to use and to pool marrow from several animals which are nonetheless
from the same litter.

Genetically Selected Cardiomyocytes from Differentiating Embryonic
Stem Cells Form Stable Intracardiac Grafts
<p class="Para1">
A two-transcriptional unit construct was formed using an &alpha;-MHC
promoter (4.5 kb of 5'-flanking + 1 kb of the first part of the genes,
exons 1 to 3, but not including translational start) and a neomycin
resistance (neo<sup>r</sup>) as one unit, and placing these immediately
5' to a transcriptional unit composed of phosphoglycerate kinase (pGK)
promoter controlling a hygromycin resistance gene.  This construct
was then inserted into a pBM20 vector (Boehringer-Mannheim).
<p>
For transfection into mouse embryonic cells, the plasmid construct
was linearized with <i>Xho</i>I and <i>Hind</i>III and ES-D3 cells (ATCC)
electroporated in presence of construct.  Selection of transfectants
was with 200 &mu;g/ml hygromycin.  Confirmation of the presence of
the transfectants is by PCR using primers for both transcriptional
units.  Maintenance of undifferentiated ES transfected cells is in
a medium of HG-DME + 10% FBS containing nonessential amino acids and
0.2 mM &beta;ME, plus 100 U/ml LIF.  Five cells lines were produced
by hygromycin selection.  The line EA3 was chosen for continued experiments.
<p>
After 3 d without LIF present, cells form embryoid bodies in suspension,
which can be transferred to TC dishes for adherence.  After 16 d, there
is a high density with small number of cells showing differentiation
by immunofluorescence for sarcomeric myosin.  Regions showing contractile
activity were microdissected, trypsinized, replated.  There was a 10-fold
enrichment, but only 3.4% of cells were contractile.  EA3 were allowed
to differentiate 8 d, then selected for 8 d with G418.  Vast majority
now showed sarcomeric myosin immunoreactivity, with more than 99% of
cells positive.  Staining for nebulin was negative, a finding necessary
for cardiomyctic differentiation.  Myofibrillar structures could be
illuminated with titin and &alpha;-actinin.  Desmin staining revealed
intermediate filament structures.  Dystrophin staining was positive
(present in both cardiac and skeletal muscle); its staining was controlled
with staining of normal fetal, adult, and dystrophic adult mice.
<p>
ANF immunoreactivity was observed in G418-selected EA3 cells.  This
is constitutive in the atrium during development.  Transcription and
translation are high in fetal ventricle but quite attenuated at birth.
<p>
Total RNA was obtained from adult atria, adult ventricles, undiff. EA3
cells, and G418-selected cardiomyocyte cultures.  The probe was the
3'-UTR of MLC-2v and MLC-2a.  No signal was seen with undiff. EA3 cells.
Selected cultures were showed positive for one or the other, indicating
that atrial- and ventricular-like cells could be distinguished.
Because cells had no mechanical load, transcription may not have been maximal.
<p>
G418-selected cardiomyocytes showed spontaneous and rhythmic contractile
activity and adjacent cell beat synchronously.  These cultures of beating
cardiomyocytes could be kept as long as 11 months.  EM of these EA3 cells
show normal adult sarcomeric structure with intercalated discs composed
of fascia adherens, desmosomes, gap junctions, connecting adjacent cells.
The gap junctions were seen to have a laminar structure on high magnification,
and myosin synthesis occurred on free ribosomes in many of selected cells;
thus G418 selection did not impact on cardiomyocyte differentiation.
<p>
EA3 cells were detached by trypsin after G418 selection and 10,000 were
delivered into the left ventricular free wall of dystrophic mdx mice.

Single-Colony Derived Strains of Human Marrow Stromal Fibroblasts
Form Bone After Transplantation In Vivo
<p class="Para1">
Human marrow was made into a single cell suspension by passing through
16- and 20-gauge needles serially and filtering through BD 2350 nylon
cell strainer.  Plating density was variable, from 2000 to 170,000
per cm<sup>2</sup> for surgical specimen, and 470,000/cm<sup>2</sup>
for iliac aspirates. Most adherents at the lower density had macrophage-like
morphology with a scattering of isolated cells appearing fibroblastic.
After 1-3 days, a very small fraction of fibroblastic cells showed
colony-like proliferation.  Between days 6-9, colonies with cell counts
ranging from several dozen to nearly a thousand were observable.
Colonies would arrange themselves into a dense, sometimes multilayered
structure, often with spiral and nodule-like patterns.  After 13-16
days, colonies could be described as small (up to 200 cells), average
(between 200-1000 cells), and large (over 1000 cells).
<p>
Colony expansion followed a particular proliferative pattern.  After 1
day, a single fibroblast might be seen.  After 4 days, 4 cells might
be seen but the cells would all be separated from each other, from 4-10
cell lengths.  After 6 days, the colony has 45 cells, some in apposition
with one another, others quite scattered and singly adhering.  All cells
are generally spindle-shaped up to this time. After 8 days, the colony
has 150 cells, a few cells take on a polygonal (often triangular) shape,
and the start of a swirling pattern among the cell scattering is seen.
By day 10, the center of the colony is more dense, with a few of the
spindle-shaped cells forming tight clusters oriented along their long
axis; cell count is in the several hundred.  On day 14, the colony is
more than a thousand cells and the cell arrangment is dense with
spindles of the cells arranged parallel to each other's long axis,
often in a pattern that swirls with the circularity of the colony.
<p>
Forward scatter of a FACScan had a relative value of 300-600 representing
the largest cell fraction, while the balance of cells were smaller
with a forward scatter of 50-200.  These both were divided into two
fractions with differing side scatter, indicating differences in granularity.
These were about 1.4% of the total cells.
<p>
There was no detectable acid phosphatase or &alpha;-naphthyl acetate
esterase activity.  A distinctive fibroblast morphology was found;
this is a large flattened cytoplasm and large oval nucleus with prominent
nucleoli.  Cells positive for esterase and phosphatase in the third passage
made up a little more than 1% of cells.  These were round, bipolar, or
stellate in shape, and were small with a dense nucleus;  these were usually
macrophages or endothelial cells.
<p>
8 weeks after transplantation there was considerable bone formation,
sometimes with abundant interconnecting trabeculae (score 4) or with tiny
spicules in a few sections (score 1).  Formation originates from the
ceramic particle surface and can develop in the interparticle space.
Osteocytes are embedded in new bone, and osteoblasts form a layer on
lumenal surfaces.  Fields where hematopoiesis occurs were in close proximity
to bone trabeculae.  Reticular stroma, adipocytes, and hematopoietic cells
were found.

Control of Mouse Cardiac Morphogenesis and Myogenesis by Transcription
Factor MEF2C
<p class="Para1">
MEF2 is a family of transcription factors binding an AT-rich region
of the genome associated with cardiac muscle structural genes.  These
factors are found in cardiogenic precursors and differentiated
cardiomyocytes during embryogenesis.  These are seen in skeletal and
smooth muscle lineages as well.  MEF2 binding sites have been found to
be essential for all three muscle cell types.  Four genes A, B, C, and
D are in vertebrates and share homology in an amino terminal MADS-box
in addition to a MEF2 domain.  These domains mediate homo- and
heterodimerization and interaction with basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factors.  In mouse embryogenesis, MEF2-B and -C are first expressed at
E7.75, and MEF2-A and -D follow 12 h later.  These factors are seen in
somites (skel musc) and smooth muscle about E9.0.  Mutations causing
loss of function in <i>Drosophila D-mef2</i> prevent differentiation
of cardiac, skeletal and visceral muscle cells.
<p>
In these experiments, <i>MEF2C</i> was inactivated with a targeting
vector to delete the second exon, encoding residues 18-86, which
overlap with the MADS (1-56) and MEF2 (57-86) domains, essential
for DNA binding and dimerization.  Electroporation was used to introduce
vector into embryonic stem cells and clones isolated by positive-negative
selection, and genomic DNA analyzed by Southern.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>.  Targeting vector consisted of Neomycin resistance gene
under control of phosphoglycerol kinase promoter in same orientation
as MEF2C.  129 ES cells were used to introduce the vector by electroporation
(see McMahon &amp; Bradley, <i>Cell</i> <b>62</b>: 1073, 1990).
After positive-negative selection, surviving clones isolated and replica-plated
on to SN76/7 fibroblasts in 96-well plates and genomic DNA analyzed by
Southern using ES cells, yolk sac, or tail biopsies.  Digestion was with
EcoRI and the probe was a region immediately 3' of the region of homology
used for targeting.  Three clones were injected into blastocysts obtained
from C57BL/7 mice to generate chimeras.  Two of these transmitted the
mutation through the germ line.  Heterozygous mice showed no phenotypic
abnormalities.  These were intercrossed to obtain homozygous nulls.
Tail biopsies of offspring were used for Southern analysis, and none
of the 189 neonates showed homozygous MEF2C mutation.  Hence it is a
lethal mutation at the embryonic stage.
<p>
Embryos from crossings were taken at E6.5 and E12.5 and genotypes determined
by Southern and PCR of yolk sacs.  Homozygous mutants in expected
Mendelian frequencies were found at E6.5 and E9.5.  Up to E9.0 (14-somite
stage) wild-type and mutants have the same size, with first branchial
arch development normal.  Mutants did not develop beyond the 20-somite
stage however, with lethality fully penetrant by E10.5.
<p>
The heart tube forms from a coalescing of two midline primordia to form
a linear heart (E8.0-8.25).  Mutants and wild-type both do this.
Contractions also begin in both, but were slower and less rhythmic in
mutants.  Development proceeds with looping, and in wild-type embryos
strong atrial contraction followed by independent ventricular contraction
is seen.  In mutants the atria contracted weakly, and the ventricles
seemed to vibrate only in response.  Mutants also showed severe pericardial
effusion, an indicator of hemodynamic insufficiency.
<p>
E8.5 in wild-type involves rightward looping, which orients atria and
ventricles and aligns outflow with the vasculature.  Rightward looping
did not occur in mutants, and development of right ventricle was not evident.
Instead a single hypoplastic ventricular chamber fuses with an enlarged
atrial chamber.  Atrioventricular demarcation occurs in the mutant, but
the AV canal is not elongated.  There was no sinus venosus, normally forming
posteriorly to the atria.  Papillary muscles and trabeculae formed in
the ventricles but were poorly developed, and the ventricular chamber
lumen was quite narrow.  Cardiomyocytes in the ventricular
wall and endocardium were disorganized, and in the atria the myocardial
wall was thin and cardiac jelly absent.  Very few red blood cells were
seen in the heart, indicating impairment of circulation.
<p>
Whole mount ISH of several markers at E9.0 (before mutants show altered
growth) shows a reduction in expression of several markers.  ANF, cardiac
&alpha;-actin, and &alpha;-myosin HC were all down-regulated to background,
and myosin light chain (MLC)-1A was detectable although decreased signficantly.
MLC2V and MLC2A were muscle genes expressed at normal levels in mutants.
MLC2V was expressed localized to a hypoplastic ventricular chamber,
and it is normally expression in the ventricular space.  Quantitative
PCR (Q-PCR) confirmed the whole mount ISH results, showing down-regulation
of muscle genes 4- to 5-fold.  Since down-regulation preceded embryonic
growth retardation, it cannot be said that regulation was itself an effect
rather than the cause of the retardation and embryonic demise.
<p>
The &beta; helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes <i>dHAND</i> and <i>eHAND</i>
express in complementary manner in the developing mouse heart.
<i>dHAND</i> is expressed in the heart tube prior to localized expression
in the right side of the looping tube, and <i>eHAND</i> emerges in
the conotruncus and future left ventricle, with expression excluded in
the heart tube region giving rise to right ventricle.  In the mutants
<i>dHAND</i> has normal expression prior to looping, but transcription
falls off with the start of looping and is concomitant with failure of
the formation of th right ventricular region.  <i>eHAND</i> expression
was consistent throughout the tube, failing to show the gap expression
in the right side region as it normally does.  All this is consistent
with failure in mutants to form a right ventricle.
<p>
Cardiac homeobox gene <i>Nkx-2.5</i> was expressed throughout the heart
in both wild-type and mutant.  <i>MEF2B</i> normally co-expresses with
<i>MEF2C</i> during early cardiogenesis and was up-regulated &gt; 7-fold
in mutants at E9.5.  There were no differences in transcription of
<i>MEF2A</i> or <i>MEF2D</i> in wild-type or mutant.
<p>
<i>MEF2C</i> is clearly required for looping of the heart tube, development
of the right ventricle, and control of the expression of a subset of muscle
genes.  It likely regulates the expression of <i>dHAND</i> in controlling
the timing and development of the right ventricle.

Dye Efflux Studies Suggest That Hematopoietic Stem Cells Expressing
Low or Undetectable Levels of CD34 Antigen Exist in Multiple Species
<p class="Abstract">
We previously described a method for isolating murine hematopoietic
stem cells capable of reconstituting lethally irradiated recipients,
which depends solely on dual-wavelength flow cytometric analysis of
murine bone marrow cells stained with the fluorescent DNA-binding
dye Hoechst 33342. This method, which appears to rely on the
differential ability of stem cells to efflux the Hoechst dye,
defines an extremely small and homogeneous population of cells
(termed SP cells). We show here that dual-wavelength analysis
of Hoechst dye-stained human, rhesus and miniature swine bone
marrow cells reveals a small, distinct population of cells that
efflux the dye in a manner identical to murine SP cells.   Like
the murine SP cells, both human and rhesus SP cells are primarily
CD34-negative and lineage marker-negative. In vitro culture studies
demonstrated that rhesus SP cells are highly enriched for long-term
culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs), an indicator of primitive
hematopoietic cells, and have the capacity for differentiation
into T cells. Although rhesus SP cells do not initially possess
any hematopoietic colony-forming capability, they acquire the
ability to form colonies after long-term culture on bone marrow
stroma, coincident with their conversion to a CD34-positive phenotype.
These studies suggest the existence of a hitherto unrecognized
population of hematopoietic stem cells that lack the CD34 surface
marker classically associated with primitive hematopoietic cells.

Factors Required for Bone Marrow Stromal Fibroblast Colony Formation
<i>In Vitro</i>
<p class="Para1">
Cells from the marrow of the long bones (femora, tibiae, humera) of
sacrificed mice (6-10 wk old CBA/JCR or FVB/N) and guinea pigs
(5-10 wk old Hartley), as well as resected bone from humans (from 4-60 y)
were taken up &alpha;-modified MEM, passed through 16- then 20-gauge
needles with syringes, filtered with a 2350 Becton-Dickinson strainer,
and plated to 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks with total of 600,000 to 1.5
million nucleated cells for mice, 100,000 to 600,000 nucleated cells
for human.  These latter numbers determined to allow development of
approximately equal numbers of CFU-F.  When feeder cells were needed,
guinea pig marrow single cell suspensions were &gamma;-irradiated
with 6000 cGray and plated 10-15 million per flask; feeder cells from
either guinea pig or mouse could support colony growth of either
species.
<p>
Marrow cells were initially plated in 20% FBS-containing medium
then brought in serum-free medium.  No colonies were formed with
mouse or human cells; scattered macrophages and occasional single
fibroblasts were observed.  With feeder cells in serum-free medium,
MSC colonies having 50-200 cells in monolayer did form.  The MSCs
had an extensive flattened cytoplasm and oval nuclei and prominent
nucleoli.  Acid phosphatase and &alpha;-naphthyl acetate esterase
were negative.  This distinguishes them from macrophage-like cells
more abundant in mouse than human cultures, with smaller size and
a round, stellate, or bipolar shape, small dark nuclei and no
nucleoli, which are positive for acid phosphatase and naphthyl acetate
esterase.
<p>
 A serum-free medium conditioned (SFCM) by guinea pig marrow cells
 also produced MSC colonies.  Both large (50-200 cells) and small
 (30-50 cells) were formed, with CFU-F average efficiency of about
 3 per 100,000 cells for mouse, and 19 for human, with a broad range
 for both.  The efficiency is about half of that for serum-free feeder
 cultures for mice, but about equal for human cells.  Serum was
 required however for the initial plating (adhesion) stage, since
 no colonies are formed at all.  Filtration through 0.22&nbsp;&mu;m
 Millipore or one freeze-thaw cycle did not reduce the effectiveness
 of SCFM.  At least 9 months at &minus;70&deg; did not cause loss
of colony-forming ability of SCFM.
<p>
 Some cultures were treated initially with SFM for 1, 3 or 6 d,
 then switched to SFCM:  the CFU-F efficiency was very much decreased.
 Cells were also first cultured in SCFM then switch to SFM, and these
 too lost colony forming ability.  Hence factors in SCFM are continuously
 required.
<p>
To identify the soluble (growth) factors present in SCFM, different
antibodies to known substances were tried.  Mouse MSCs plated to
40,000-48,000/cm<sup>2</sup> in serum for 3 h were switched to SFCM
containing variable concentrations of anti-TGF-&beta;
(all three forms combined: at 1, 5, 25&nbsp;&mu;g/ml), anti-PDGF (same
concentrations as anti-TGF-&beta;), bFGF (0.4, 2, 10&nbsp;&mu;g/ml),
or EGF (2, 10, 50&nbsp;&mu;g/ml).  An additional study of adding growth
factor to its 25&nbsp;&mu;g/ml
antibody was done.  In addition, an incubation with a generic
IgG (rabbit source) was done.  CFU-F efficiencies were shown
to become progressively smaller with increasing antibody to
<em>all</em> growth factors (therefore inhibition was
dose-dependent), and was restored partially or ovewhelmingly
with addition of the growth factor at the same
time as its antibody.  The most pronounced inhibition was with anti-PDGF.
Human MSCs were plated to about 40-50% of the mouse MSC density and
similarly treated:  anti-TGF-&beta; and anti-PDGF had significant
effects in reducing colony-forming efficiency (no dose-dependence
was seen since the lowest antibody concentration was already maximal),
while anti-bFGF and anti-EGF were less effective but a dose-dependent
inhibition could be seen.  And when the growth factor was included
with the highest concentration of anti-growth factor, the reduction
in CFU-F efficiency in hMSCs was completely abolished, again showing
that the effect was attributable to the growth factors in SFCM themselves.
<p>
Mouse MSCs were plated as above, but after 3 h in serum-containing media,
switched to serum-free medium but containing one of the following
tested growth factors at variable concentrations:  human TGF-&beta;1
(0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 ng/ml); porcine TGF-&beta;1 (same levels tested);
human TGF-&beta;2 (same levels as &beta;1); human PDGF (1, 5, 25 ng/ml);
porcine PDGF (same as hPDGF); EGF (1, 10, 100 ng/ml); human bFGF (0.15,
1.5, 15, 150 ng/ml); bovine bFGF (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 ng/ml);
IL-6 (20, 200, 2000 U/ml), IGF-I (2, 20, 200 ng/ml); and IGF-II (0.5,
5, 50 ng/ml).  Only human and bovine bFGF showed a signficant response
(up to 20% of the control SFCM effect) in the lowest doses tested, and
CFU-F efficiency fell with progressively higher bFGF doses.  When
5 growth factors were combined (10 ng/ml pTGF-&beta;1, 5&nbsp;ng/ml pPDGF,
100 ng/ml EGF, 1.5 ng/ml h-bFGF, and 20 ng/ml IGF-I), efficiency
of nearly 40% of SFCM was seen.  It is clear that each of these growth
factors is necessary but alone is insufficient to promote growth
and proliferation, and it is likely they have a synergy in these
effects.
<p>
Mouse and human MSCs grown in SFCM for 13 d were transplanted as
ceramic plugs (with human foreskin fibroblasts as controls) into
subcutaneous incisions in the backs of immunodeficient 12 wk old
female beige mice (NIH bg-nu-xidBR, Harlan Sprague Dawley), and
left for 6 wk.  The plugs were then recovered, and paraffin embedded
sections cut, dewaxed, then stained H &amp; E.  Results show depostion
of new bone and embedded osteocytes, with osteoblastic layer on lumenal
surface.  Polymorphonuclear granulocytes of mouse origin represented
a signficant portion of hematopoietic cells present.

Differential Reactivity of Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle from Various
Species in A Cardiac Troponin I Immunoassay
<p class="Para1">
Approximately 1 g tissue was sampled from heart and skeletal muscle
of animals within 5 min of sacrifice with barbituates.  For the heart
left ventricle was sampled.
<p>
cTnI antibodies 2B1.9 and 2F6.6 were used in a western blot in which
samples of cardiac and skeletal muscle from horse, mouse, chicken
and fish (trout) were run along with a canine TnI control.  Both the
cTnI antibodies reacted identically on the western, reacting only
with cardiac muscle on the horse, mouse, and chicken, but not the
fish.  Antibody 3C5.10 reacts with both cTnI and skeletal muscle
(sTnI) from dog and human.  Its western showed a single band in
every lane, and even two bands in the dog TnI control (the faster
migrating band is sTnI).  This mAb even reacted with the fish TnI,
both skeletal and cardiac, which curiously had the same <i>M</i><sub>r</sub>.
Generally the antibodies showed greater reactivities toward heart
tissues of mammals, then to birds, then to fish.  There was also
a relationship between sequence homology (for known TnI sequences)
and reactivity of the antibody.
<p>
Reactivity was lower in dogs having heart failure than in healthy
control dogs (by 32%), and the reactivity in dogs with heart failure
was not signficantly different from lab mammal rodents.

Adenovirus Mediated Alpha Interferon (IFN-&alpha;) Gene Transfer into
CD34<sup>+</sup> Cells and CML Mononuclear Cells
<p class="Para1">
The adenovirus construct AdCMV-IFN-&alpha; was reported in a previous paper,
and represents the homologous recombination of dL7001 E3-deletion vector
and human IFN-&alpha;.  An <i>Xho</i>I fragment containing hIFN-&alpha; cDNA
was cut from BMGNeoIFN-&alpha; plasmid and inserted into pRC/CMV (Invitrogen),
and then the <i>Nru</i>I-<i>Bam</i>HI digest was inserted into pBacPac 8
(Clontech) after double digesting that with <i>Stu</i>I-<i>Bam</i>HI.
The <i>Bam</i>HI-<i>Bgl</i>III fragment was then take from this
pBacPac 8-CMV-INF-&alpha; construct, and inserted into the <i>Bgl</i>II
site of pAdv.<i>Bgl</i>II plasmid to give the finally constructed vector.
293 cells (ATCC #1573-CRL) were then contransfected with 10 mg AdCMV-IFN-&alpha;
linearized with <i>Eco</i>RI, and 1 mg dL7001 linearized with <i>Cla</i>I,
using Stratagene's mammalian cell transfection kit.  5 days later, viral
plaques were marked and allowed to develop until cytopathic effects had
affected a large area.  Plaques were purified by CsCl gradient
ultracentrifugation, and PCR used to verify IFN-&alpha; (forward and reverse
primer sequences are given).  Five freeze-thaw cycles were done to release
virus 2 days after infection.  These were concentrated on Ultrafree-MC
filter (Millipore) and dialyzed against PBS.  Titers were 10-50 billion
infectious units/ml.  MOI were varied.  Viral stock was stored 1:1 in
glycerol at &minus;20&deg;.
<p>
Bone marrow was taken from health volunteers and CML patients and mononuclear
cells purified on Ficoll-Paque.  Sequential counterflow centrifugation
elutriation (see), erythrocyte rosetting, and immunomagnetic beads were used
to enrich cell populations.  Mononuclear cells were also enriched for
CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with avidin-biotin immunoadsorption columns
CellPro, Inc>.  Selected cells were double-tagged with
anti-CD34-phycoerythrin-conjugated and anti-HLA-DR-FITC antibodies to
examine on flow cytometer.
<p>
CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were maintained in IMDM + 0.5% FBS supplemented
with 50 U/ml recombinant human IL-6, 100 ng/ml recomb hum SCF, 5 ng/ml IL-3,
50 U/ml G-CSF, 50 U/ml GM-CSF, and 10 U/ml megakaryocyte growth factor (Immunex).
Cells in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks were infected at various MOI (20, 40, 80,
120, 160, 240) for various times (4, 8, 12, 24, 48 h).  Cell viability
postinfection was evaluated using PI staining or clonal efficiency in
methylcellulose cultures.  RT-PCR was used to evaluate IFN-&alpha; mRNA
transcription.  CML progenitor cells (not just CD34<sup>+</sup>-enriched)
were also evaluated by RT-PCR:  cells from leukapheresis were separated
by counterflow centrifugation and sheep RBC rosetting, then plated in IMDM
+ 0.5% FBS and virus added at MOI=120-300 for 24 h.
<p>
AdCMV-IFN-&alpha; vector was transduced into CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in
initial experiments.  24 h after induction, cells were evaluated using
an IFN-&alpha; radioimmunoassay.  The results show increased secretion
of protein (to 4.1 U/ml).  A control vector of AdCMV-HO-1 (hemo-oxygenase
insert) showed no significant IFN-&alpha; levels.  Batches of 10,000
cells were used to evaluate viability and markers:  cells were stained
with CD34-FITC and CD45-PerCP at 4&deg; for 30 min, and 5 min before
analysis, propidium iodide was added.  After washing the cells,
a three-laser analysis with forward and side scatter was done.  96%
of cells were CD34<sup>+</sup> at 4 h, 95% at 8 h, 67% at 16 h,
and 57% at 24 h.  Propidium iodide-excluding cells were 99%, 97%,
83%, and 74% in these time periods.
<p>
2 million CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were plated in ea. 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask
in IMDM and infected with various MOI from 40-240 for varying periods
from 1-48 h, and mRNA transcription and clonal efficiency assessed.
The best expression was seen with 120 pfu/cell (81% of cells), and
there was little or no significant increase in expression at higher
pfu/cell (76-91% for 160-240 pfu/cell).
<p>
CD34<sup>+</sup> cells infected for 24 h with virus were plated (1000 cells)
into methylcellulose cultures containing GM-CSF.  The count of CFU-GM
in all experiments was more than 50 clones.  240 pfu/cell had less CFU-GM
compared to the 120 pfu/cell treatment, which had colony growth similar
or equal to control cells.  Thus the optimal MOI for expression was also
optimal for the least toxicity.
<p>
There was no significant difference between the growth of AdCMV-IFN-&alpha;
infected and control cells.  Colony counts were slightly less for cell
groups at 24 h compared to groups at 4 or 8 h, and gene transfer was maximal
at 24 h.  Clonogenic potential of cells either infected or control at 48 h
was less than transduced cells at 24 h.  In vitro hybridization revealed
a rate of transfection varying from 5-41%.
<p>
The DNA from a CFU-GM colony of cells grown from a
AdCMV-IFN-&alpha;-infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cells was digested and the
band pattern for CD34<sup>+</sup> cells transfected for 24 h, CFU-GM
colony cells obtained after 12 d, and positive control were the same.
Total RNA was isolated from CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and and BFU-E and
CFU-GM colonies and RT-PCR/Southern analysis done for IFN-&alpha;.
All results were positive for expression.
<p>
Mononuclear cells from CML patients were infected (120 or 240 pfu/cell)
in suspension for 24 h in culture with cytokines.  Clonal efficiency
in methylcellulose was evaluated.  CFU-GM was 48 for non-transduced
cells and 46 for infected cells (120 pfu/cell).  The CFU-GM count went
down for cells infected at 240 pfu/cell

Osteogenic Differentiation of Purified, Culture-Expanded Human
Mesenchyamal Stem Cells In Vitro
<p class="Para1">
1 volume human marrow added to 2 volumes DMEM + selected 10% FBS, spun
to remove fat, and then pellets separated on 70% Percoll at
13,000&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<i>g</i> for 20 min.  Low density fraction
was rinsed with medium; 10 million cells were plated to each
60 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.  Near-confluent flasks are trypsinized
(0.25% with 1 mM EDTA), and replated 5000/cm<sup>2</sup> with
each passage.
For osteogenic assays, 6-well dishes are used
with plating at 3000 cell/cm<sup>2</sup>, left 24 h, and then
inducing medium of 0.1&nbsp;&mu;M dexamethasone, 10 mM &beta;-glycerophosphate,
and 0.05 mM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate;  this is the optimized
medium, having been determined by dose response experiments reported
below.
<p>
Adherent hMSCs in passage zero were evident by day 5, and colonies
from days 6-12 grew in size quickly.  Monolayers from each colony
passed at 80-90% confluence.  Replating was at 30% confluence (1:3 split).
Experiments usually done on 2nd/3rd passage cells.
<p>
An inducing medium of 100 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM &beta;-glycerophosphate,
and 0.05 mM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate was used.  von Kossa staining
revealed calcified matrix deposition.  Calcium quantification and
<a href="#xraydiff">X-ray diffraction</a> also revealed mineralization.
Within 2 d and more apparent after 4 d, cell shape underwent a transition
from spindle to cuboidal.ALP positivity was far greater in treated
cultures compared to untreated controls.  In addition, treated cells
formed multiple layers of nodules while controls confined themselves
to monolayers.  By day 12 a uniform sheet of bone-like material
forms the whole dish.  Controls show some changes in ALP activity,
but hMSCs always remain spindle-shaped.
<p>
Dose dependence was tested using 1 to 1000 nM Dex up to 16 d.  Morphology,
proliferation, ALP activity, and mineralization were determined on
days 4, 8, and 16.  ALP activity/cell is 3- to 8-fold higher in day 8
cultures compared to untreated (hMSCs in medium with only &beta;-GP
and ascorbic acid 2-P alone).  At 1 nM, while ALP was elevated,
the spindle shape was retained and cells were fibroblastic; no mineralization
was seen.  With 10 nM Dex, ALP activity/cell was maximal.  However
only at 100 nM Dex was osteogenic potential realized, with osteoblastic
morphology and mineralization.  At 1000 nM Dex, more mineralization
than for 100 nM Dex was seen, but cells detached from the dish.
At all doses proliferation was evident, but it was greatest at 1 nM.
Toluidine blue did not reveal chondrogenesis nor did oil red O
reveal adipogenesis under these conditions.
<p>
Ascorbic acid is (1) required for hydroxylation of Pro and Lys for collagen
and (2) is used in synthesis of non-collagen bone matrix proteins.
The 2-phosphate form is used because plain ascorbic acid is unstable
at culture temp and neutral solutions.  Dose dependence from
0.05 to 4.0 mM indicated that high concentration (1-4 mM) were
toxic to cells by 4 days.  The lowest (0.05 mM) concentration produced
maximal ALP activity, proliferation, and mineralization.
Plain ascorbic acid added fresh daily to 0.25 mM (the old method)
had the same effect.
<p>
In testing the optimized ossifying medium against time, ALP activity
peaked at day 12 (true also for controls, but day 12 and 16 were
not significantly different).  Cell number always increased however,
the increase significantly greater by 2-fold in treated cultures.
<p>
Individual human donors were compared for differences in ALP
expression on 8-day cultures.  There were clear differences
in basal ALP activity in untreated controls alone; these differences
were not related to donor age.  There were also differences in
the fold response to treatment: from 1.5- to 6.4-fold, with no
relationship to baseline level.  However, there was a clear response
in every donor to the treatment.  Also the day that ALP activity
peaks in donors is not entirely coincident:  some peaked later at
day 12.
<p>
Mineralization was also tested using von Kossa staining or sensitive
colorimetry of calcium.  MSCs in control medium showed no deposition.
Treated cells show mineralization by days 12-16, with a pattern
distributed throughout the dish rather than in discrete foci as seen
with rMSCs.  X-ray diffraction patterns of powder show peaks between
30 and 35&deg; 2&Theta;, characteristic of bone apatite, and coincident
for a reference standard of fully crystalline hydroxyapatite.
The absence of these crystal formations in control medium preclude
the possibility that &beta;-GP is supersaturating or contributes
to nonphysiological deposition.
<p>
Total RNA was purified from hMSCs treated 14 d in medium with and without
48 h exposure to 10 nM vitamin D<sub>3</sub> following treatment.
>From this northern blots were prepared and probed with osteocalcin.
Without vitamin D<sub>3</sub> treatment, no osteocalcin mRNA was found,
but with vitD, it was seen in both control and ossifying media.
More importantly, osteocalcin mRNA expression was discernibly greater
in cultures not treated with Dex than cultures treated with ossifying
medium and tested at day 14 just before vitD treatment.  Hence Dex
attentuates the response to vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, consistent with
previous reports.
<p>
The effect of different basal media were tested.  Cells are plated
first in the usual control medium (DMEM) then switched 24 h later
to different media (all contain 10% FBS from same lot).  Those
switched to BGJ<sub>b</sub> with ossifying treatment (+OS) die and detach
by day 12.  Cells in DMEM/F-12 + OS show &ldquo;modest&rdquo; increase
in ALP.  Cells in DMEM or &alpha;-MEM containing OS show the usual
response:  by day 8, the number of cuboidal ALP-positive cells
increase noticeably.  Background ALP was higher in ALP-stained
cultures of &alpha;-MEM-grown &minus; OS cells (quantitation showed
no significant difference however).  The increase in ALP
in DMEM + OS was greater against DMEM &minus; OS than it
was for &alpha;-MEM + OS compared to &alpha;-MEM &minus; OS, even
though &alpha;MEM + OS produces consistently the greatest ALP activity.
Although overall ALP activities were lower, cultures treated with DMEM + OS
show more mineralization than &alpha;-MEM cultures according to the
von Kossa staining.
<p>
Initial plating density was also tested for its effect.  Cells plated
at 3000 and 5000/cm<sup>2</sup> tested for ALP at day 8 showed
no signficant difference.  Cell counts at day 4 were not different
as well.  However mineralization of the matrix according to von Kossa
and quantitative calcium was directly correlated with higher plating
density.  This effect required ossifying treatment, as controls showed
no calcium deposition.  Higher densities (up to 7500/cm<sup>2</sup>)
also resulted in greater calcium crystallization, but layers of cells
also began to detach.
<p>
Cells grown in a 10 cm<sup>2</sup> area were given either 1 or 2 ml
medium (the usual is 2 ml).  No differences in morphology, ALP activity,
or proliferation were seen with control or ossifying medium, but there
was a significant increase in mineralization with the 1 ml volume
cell layers.

Marrow Stromal Cells as Stem Cells for Nonhematopoietic Tissue
<p class="Para1">
The nonhematopoietic stem cells (NHSC) that are found in bone marrow
are called &ldquo;mesenchymal stem cells&rdquo; because they give rise
to mesenchyme.  They are also called marrow stromal cells (MSCs).
130 years ago Cohnheim first suggested the presence of stem cells in the
marrow:  he injected insoluble aniline dyes into veins of animals and then
looked for the appearance of dye-containing cells in wounds created at a
distal site.  The cells were thought to be of marrow origin since blood
arises from the marrow.
<p>
In mid-1970s Friedenstein attempted to culture in vitro plastic-adherent
cells from marrow.  The most tightly adherent formed were spindle-shaped
and formed 2-4 cell foci, which were dormant for a couple of days, then
expanded rapidly.  The multicellular colonies that formed took on the
appearance of differentiated tissue, such as bone and cartilage.
In the 80s, Piersma and separately Owen as well as others showed multipotentiality
in these cells.
<p>
These cells are highly heterogeneous however.  There are major differences
between species:  in mouse marrow cultures, initial adherents are largely
hematopoietic while in humans it is &lt;30%.  Most hematopoeitic cells
are lost if primary culture continues for 2-3 weeks.  MSCs produce an ECM
composed of interstitial type I collagen, fibronectin and basement membrane
proteins (laminin and type IV collagen).  A small proportion also produce
Factor VIII-associated antigen, suggesting they have endothelial character.
They also secrete cytokines such as IL-7, IL-8, IL-11 and SCF (the c-kit
ligand).
<p>
Differentiation of cells can depend on many factors, including the lot
of FBS used.  Dexamethasone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, or cytokines
such as BMP-2 will induce osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis.
Amphotericin B (with and without 5-azacytidine) appears to promote myoblast
formation.
<p>
In studies of HSC culture, it was found that adherent cells were vital as
feeder layers to the growth of HSCs and their differentiation into
erythrocytes and granulocytes.  In some regions of the culture, very
large cells with thin cytoplasm form blankets over granulocyte precursors
giving a cobblestone appearance.  Time-lapse photography showed that the
granulocyte precursors move under the blanket cells, replicate, differentiate,
then detach into medium.  Other parts of the flask show clusters of
macrophages and erythroblasts which mature together.  The adherent cells
secrete IL-1, IL-6, CSF-1, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and SCF (c-kit ligand).
<p>
In a mixed population of HSCs with CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors, there
is expression of at least 16 <i>hox</i> and 5 homeodomain-containing
genes.  More needs to be known about these molecular controls.
<p>
The marrow MSCs differentiate into bone is not unusual.  Marrow is composed
of an array of thin spicules of trabecular bone, a kind of bone being
continually remodeled.  Recovery of marrow is likely to contain osteoblasts
throughout.  As marrow ages it is replaced with fatty deposits, and so
the ability of these cells to undergo adipogenesis is also not surprising;
some forms of osteoporosis are described as osteoblasts and their precursors
differentiating into adipocytes.  Chondrogenesis in MSCs may arise because
of a process required for fracture repair, although bone without marrow
similarly undergoes repair.  Myogenesis is more difficult to explain since
adult muscle tissue is not replaced after destruction;  hence the phenomenon
may be an in vitro rather than in vivo one.
<p>
Of great interest are therapeutic use of MSCs in grafting studies.
Animals undergoing marrow ablation can repopulate up to one-third of their
marrow with exogenous MSCs.  Using marrow obtained from a mouse transgenic
for a type I collagen mutation, the collagen was found in a tissue-specific
manner and could be used to track both donor MSC presence and the
differentiated cell.  Myeloablated mice were grafted with marrow and
PCR was used to detect cells with the gene to a sensitivity
of 1 in 10,000 cells.  After 1 week, nothing.  At 1 and 5 months however,
donor cells were detected and found to be 1 and 12% of tissues.  Cell
replacement was teh same in bone, cartilage, marrow, and spleen.
In some cases, cells in cartilage were found to contain the mutated gene
but the gene was not expressed, consistent with the showing that type I
collagen is specific to bone while cartilage uses another.  In another
study SCID mice were injected with human MSCs, and after 2 months,
the cells made up 0.2-2.3% of liver, thymus, and lung.
<p>
MSCs have been explored for potential in cell and gene therapy.  They are
easy to transfect/transduce with exogenous genes.  They are better than
HSCs, which are found in fewer numbers in marrow and are more difficult
to expand in vitro.  Caplan's group wanted to use MSCs taken from patients
with degenerative arthritis, grow them in culture, then use cells to
resurfcace joints by direct injection.  MSCs were injected locally into
rabbit knee cartilage, and MSCs infused into bone ceramics promote repair.

Selection and Maintenance of Multidrug-Resistant Cells
<p class="Para1">
P-glycoprotein is the product of the <i>MDR1</i> gene, and is a transporter
of many different cationic or uncharged drugs that are strongly hydrophobic.
MRP is the product of the <i>MRP</i> gene and transports anionic hydrophobic
drugs and drugs conjugated to anionic moieties (glutathione, sulfate, etc.).
<p>
Cells that are multidrug-resistant express these transporters.  Selection
of these cells occurs in one of two ways:
<ol>
<li>Individual clones are produced in which a single cell is expanded and then the
expanded cells (clones of that single cell) treated with cytotoxic agent,
and surviving cells isolated and expanded again, to be treated at a higher
strength if a greater resistance is required, such as to clone the genes
responsible
<li>A large count of heterogeneous cell types are selected with incremental
increases in the dose of cytotoxic agent(s), with a massive kill-off allowed
at each dose followed by re-expansion before the next incrementally higher
dose is applied.
</ol>
<p>
A drawback of selecting the heterogeneous population is that the resistant
cells will be heterogeneous with multiple and different mechanisms involved
in resistance;  this is called <i>multifactorial multidrug resistance</i>.
It is thought that tumors actually resist cytotoxic drugs by this mechanism,
but this form of selection is inadequate for the purpose of identifying
and cloning the genes involved with resistance.  MCF-7 human breast
cancer cells are resistant to doxorubicin and were selected by the
mass population of heterogeneous cells approach.
<p>
<b>Selection of Multi-Drug Resistant Cells from Cloned Populations</b>.
<ol>
<li>A cell line is carefully chosen.  Place 100 cells in a 100 mm dish
and allow very limited colonial expansion.  Remove the medium.
Use a marker to draw a circle around the colonies of interest.
With a 1 ml sterile pipet, use the tip to scrape lose the cells within
the circle and use a small amount of medium to aspirate the cells.
Transfer to a single well of a 24-well plate.  If cells are sensitive
to scraping, place a cloning ring down and use trypsin to detach.
After the cells have expanded again, place 200-500 cells in a 100 mm dish
(know the count exactly!), allow the cells to grow into small colonies
visible if stained, then stain with 0.5% methylene blue in 50% ethanol
for 30 min.  If the colonies counted is less than 10% of the cells plated,
the cells may not be satisfactory for selecting multidrug resistant cells.
<li>Growth medium is important as well.  A medium that contains 0.11 mg/ml
sodium pyruvate is essential.  It should also contain 5 mM Gln, 50 U/ml
penicillin, and 50 &mu;g/ml streptomycin.  Large lots of serum need to be
screened at 2, 5, and 10% levels.
<li><i>Killing curves</i> are generated by measuring the colony efficiency
of a standard set of cells in a large dish (300 cells in 60 mm dish) at
incremental levels of drug.  Unless something is already known about the
drug's toxicity, levels of drug start at 1 ng/ml and increase in 3-fold
steps:  10 such steps cover 4 logs up to 10 &mu;g/ml.  Plot percent survival
against log dose and find the approximate dose that yields 1% survival
on the fitted curve.  Cell density is a contributing variable as to the
drug's cytotoxic effect:  use 1-2 million cells in the 100 mm dish
(12,000-25,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>).
<li>The drug stock needs to be kept sterile.  Most drugs are not water-soluble
but can be dissolved in DMSO at 10-100 mg/ml and stored in the dark at
&minus;20&deg;.  The final concentration of DMSO should fall below 0.5%,
and the medium should be filter-sterilized at the final step.
<li>Surviving clones are re-expanded in the selective medium, first in
multi-well plates, then transferred to 25 or 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks.
When possible, several clones need to be frozen away in liquid nitrogen.
Selection that persists causes genetic drift seen as changes in the copy
number of amplified genes, or where multiple mechanisms occur, in that
of the predominant mechanism.  Detach cells from an exponentially growing
culture in a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask, count them, and place them in an
appropriate cytotoxic drug-free cryopreservation medium at 10<sup>6</sup>/ml,
and 0.5-1.0 ml per cryovial.  When thawing cells from the deep freeze,
remove their cryopreservation medium, and resuspend in 2 ml complete,
drug-free medium in a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.  Transfer 1 ml to a second
25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.  Add medium to the appropriate level to one
flask (the drug-free &ldquo;safe&rdquo; flask).  To the other, add medium
representing one-half of the volume of the flask.  Then add the remaining
half volume in which the medium contains 2&times; the drug concentration
for selection.  Because the lag to exponential growth can be very prolonged,
an alternative is to allow proliferation without drug selection from a
25 cm<sup>2</sup> to 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask, and when expanded in the larger
flask, split 1:4 or 1:10.  Continue freezing a portion of cells for
seed lots of different passages.
<li>The resistance of clones to multiple drugs (cross resistance) should
be ascertained by generating killing curves (% survival vs. log dose plots)
for other drugs.  Relatively nontoxic drugs may be used to see if the
resistance phenotype reverses (is lost).  Use the maximum tolerated drug
concentration at first.  Then use a drug level that results in no loss
of cloning efficiency.  Killing curves in presence and absence of reversing
agent are generated, and by  comparing LD<sub>50</sub> or LD<sub>10</sub>
values, and the reversing potency can be determined.  Use of inhibitors
of P-glycoprotein (verapamil, cyclosporin A) can be used at nontoxic
levels to select for cell lines that are resistant based on non-<i>MDR1</i>
mechanisms, or to express mutant P-glycoproteins.
<li>Maintenance of resistant cells requires continuous selection.
Without selection, resistance is lost over time.  Over time, it may be
necessary to thaw frozen seed stocks to obtain cells resistant to the
requisite level.
</ol>
<p>
The cloning of several genes involved with multidrug resistance has
enabled studies to determine how they confer resistance to drug-sensitive
lines.  Standard transfection/transduction with calcium phosphate precipitates,
cationic lipids, and retrovirus have been used.  Cultured human cells
have proven more sensitive to drug than rodent (mouse, rat, hamster) cells;
it takes about 1 log dose less to kill human cells (1-10 ng/ml) than
rodents.  <i>MDR1</i> was prepared in a retroviral vector (pHaMDR1/A)
and then transfected into mouse PA-12 cells, which produce viral capsid
coded for the amphotropic murine leukemia virus; these transformed
PA-12 cells (PA12MDR1/A-1) produce particles and grow in 60 ng/ml
colchicine (are drug-resistant).  Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells are transduced
with a PA12MDR1/A cell filtered supernatant (diluted 1:5 with McCoy's 5A
+ 10% horse) containing 2 &mu;g/ml polybrene for 48 hours.  After the two
days, fresh McCoy's medium is used.  Infected cells can then be used to
generate killing curves to see the conferred resistance to colchicine.
<p>
Mice were injected with 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg IV) to stimulate
bone marrow stem cell proliferation (the drug actually targets and kills
progenitor cells, and their loss should stimulate stem cell proliferation).
The drug was given 2-4 days prior to harvest of marrow.  Single cell suspensions
are obtained using flushing and passing through 20-gauge needle, and then
mononuclear cells separated on Ficoll.  Cells are then sorted using
immunomagnetic beads (MACS, Miltenyi) to deplete the Lin<sup>+</sup> and
MHC II<sup>+</sup> cells.  Additional sorting is done to obtain Sca-1<sup>+</sup>
cells.  The Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> MHC II<sup>&minus;</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup>
cells are plated with medium and cytokines for 18-24 h at 37&deg;.
<p>
Virus producer cells are seeded to a flask and irradiated at 30 Gy
to prevent proliferation.  The bone marrow cells are cocultured with
the viral producers for 6-8 d in Iscove's MDM with polybrene at 4 &mu;g/ml,
20% FBS, 0.5 &mu;M 2-mercaptoethanol and the following cytokines:
100 ng/ml murine IL-1&beta;, 1 U/ml hum recomb. erythropoietin,
200 U/ml murine IL-3, 200 U/ml human IL-6, and 100 ng/ml rat stem cell factor.
The bone marrow cells will grow in suspension (start at 10<sup>6</sup>/ml).
Cells are recovered carefully from the suspension without detaching the
viral producers.  They are then grown alone for 24 h in cytokine-containing
medium then  selected for 48-96 h in cytotoxic drug.  Drug-resistant cells
from this treatment are then used in colony assays of hematopoietic cells,
transplanted into irradiated recipient mice (same day, with 10 million cells)
and the bone marrow analyzed 8-10 wk later, or analyzed for P-glycoprotein
transport using FACS and antibody or rhodamine-123 efflux.

Isolation of Neuronal Precursors by Sorting Embryonic Forebrain
Transfected with GFP Regulated by the T&alpha;1 Tubulin Promoter
<p class="Para1">
Red-shifted GFP (rsGFP) was put under the control of neuronal-specific
T&alpha;1 tubulin and constitutive, non-neuronal cytomegalovirus (CMV)
promoters.  GFP optimized for expression in mammalian cells
(&ldquo;humanized&rdquo; GFP or hGFP) was also constructed as reporters
under each promoter.  Forebrain cells were taken from embryonic rats
(E14) and chicks (E6 and E10), and cultured cells transfected for 12 hours
with either pCMV:rsGFP or pT&alpha;1:rsGFP, or alternatively with
the <i>lacZ</i> reporter rather than rsGFP.  At 12 h intervals, cultures
are examined for location of GFP-expressing cells.  It was seen that
expression was maximal within 48 h.  Transfection efficiency was also
tested by transfection of 1-day cultured E6 chick forebrain cells with
pCMV:<i>lacZ</i>.  After 2 days, between 4-5% of cells were found to make
&beta;-galactosidase (522 in 12,200 cells, observed in 10 fields in each
of 6 plates) according to Xgal detection.  3.8% (109/2897 from 3 plates)
of cells transfected with pCMV:rsGFP showed GFP fluorescence, in generally
good agreement.  With pT&alpha;1:<i>lacZ</i>, there was less expression
at E6 and E10 compared to pCMV:<i>lacZ</i> cells, about one-third of level.
<p>
LacZ and rsGFP expression were compared under the CMV promoter control.
After 2 days, rsGFP was determined on a set of cells transfected with
rsGFP reporter, and lacZ determined in fixed and stained cells.  The
rsGFP and lacZ reporters under T&alpha;1 were roughly equal.  GFP
expression was greater under CMV than T&alpha;1 generally.  There is
no difference in the transfection efficiency of E6 or E10 cells.
<p>
E6 forebrain cells were then treated 12 h with T&alpha;1:<i>lacZ</i>
and then exposed 2 days later with [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine for 6 hours,
then fixed.  Cultures were stained with Xgal and then autoradiographed
(done by air-drying after distilled water rinse subsequent to Xgal staining,
dipping in Kodak NTB-3 emulsion at 46&deg;, then exposing for 7 days
at 4&deg;;  development is with Kodak D-19 at 17&deg; for 3 min;
use differential interference contrast optics to observe).
Cells that were lacZ-expressing and radiolabeled were frequent, indicating
that cells were dividing neuronal progenitors.  Cells transfected
with T&alpha;1:<i>lacZ</i> and also stained with MAb 16A11 which reacts
with Hu family of neuronal RNA-binding proteins shows that Hu is expressed
within hours of postmitotic neuronal development (a better marker than
certain traditional markers that appear only with more maturation).
Staining was also done wit MAb TuJ1, antibody to neuron-specific
&beta;III-tubulin, identifying also young neurons.  The T&alpha;1:<i>lacZ</i>
cells include both Hu-positive and -negative sets.
<p>
Because some T&alpha;1:<i>lacZ</i> cells are Hu-negative, and the latter
has been described as strictly indicating neuronal phenotype, selected
plates were stained for either Hu or &beta;III-tubulin or avian glial
antigen (recognized by MAb 3A7).  More than half (52%) of E6 forebrain
cells positive for T&alpha;1:<i>lacZ</i> are also positive for Hu.
All of the Hu-positive cells were positive for &beta;III-tubulin.
No cells could be double-labeled for Hu and astrocytic glial fibrillary
protein (GFAP) in E14 rat cultures, and the same for Hu and ependymoglial
3A7 in E6 chick cultures.
<p>
Ventricular zone cultures from rat and chick were also transfected with
rsGFP under T&alpha;1, and then sorted using FACS.  66% of cells
sorted were Hu-positive in 6 hours, but only 30% were Hu-positive in
the unsorted lot.  This was constant after 4 days, indicating that
Hu-positive diffentiated cells formed from proliferating precursors that
were Hu-negative.  The FACS enrichment of T&alpha;1:rsGFP cells would
be expected to increase neuronal progenitors, and this is not expected
with CMV:rsGFP.  E14 rat forebrain were transfected with CMV:hGFP or
T&alpha;1:hGFP and neuronal enrichment compared after 48 h (done by
doing 3 independent sorts, with 3 cultures per sort).  Matched controls
were transfected cells not subjected to sorts, and cells were stained
for nestin, Hu, and &beta;III-tubulin.  Sorted CMV:hGFP cells were
clearly not enriched in neuronal progenitors compared to T&alpha;1:hGFP
(expected).  Hu-positive cells among CMV:hGFP was 41% before sorting
and 38% after.  But Hu-positive among T&alpha;1:hGFP was 26% before sorting
and 63% after (16 hours).  Similar numbers were seen for the marker
TuJ1:  31% before sorting of T&alpha;1:hGFP and 67% after, with no
enrichment (difference in percentages) with hGFP under CMV control.
By two-way ANOVA of Hu-positive as function of promoter and
sorting and using Tukey's posthoc t test, and by Boneferroni <i>t</i> test,
these differences were significant.
<p>
E14 rat cultures, sorted and unsorted according to T&alpha;1:GFP
were stained by MAb Rat-401 for nestin.  Only 10% of cells expressed
nestin in unsorted cultures, while 52% of cells were nestin-positive
in the T&alpha;1:GFP-sorted pool, creating a &gt;5-fold enrichment.
As expected, T&alpha;1-driven cells also preferentially express nestin.
Most nestin-positive cells also developed Hu and/or &beta;III-tubulin
expression within first 2 days in vitro, which indicates a neuronal
or pro-neuronal phenotype.  T&alpha;1-sorted cells generally expresed
<em>either</em> &beta;III-tubulin <em>or</em> nestin, indicating that
expression of these latter two is mutually exclusive, and generally
nestin-negative cells become &beta;III-tubulin-positive.
<p>
E14 rat forebrain cells were stained glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
or oligodendrocytic O4.  The pool obtained two days after T&alpha;1-GFP
sorting showed virtually no GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells (&lt;1%) nor
any O4<sup>+</sup> cells, but unsorted cells showed that 3-4 in 100 cells
were GFAP-positive, a difference signficant with the sorted.  After
7 days, the total proportion of cells that were GFAP positive increased,
but the difference was still signficant (unsorted 39% to sorted 7%),
proportions expected since glial cells expand well against postmitotic
neurons present.  There was no double-labeled T&alpha;1:GFP with either
GFAP or O4:  The FACS was set to accept a 1% false positive rate
for the green fluorescence, and so the glial in the enriched pool are
clearly non-fluorescent contaminants.  When the sorting gate is more
stringent, with 0.1% false positive, no GFAP-positive cells are seen
at all after 2 days, and the unsorted pool is still 3-4% GFAP-positive.
After 6 days, there is still no GFAP-positive cells, while the unsorted
is 28% GFAP-positive (comparable to previous sort).  Hence we believe
that nestin<sup>+</sup>/Hu<sup>&minus;</sup>/TuJ1<sup>&minus;</sup> cells
which drive T&alpha;1 are neuronal progenitors that show the most
immaturity compared to Hu- and TuJ1-positives.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>. Culture of the forebrain cells involves immersing
rat and chick samples ten volumes HBSS, mixing 1:1 (v/v) with 0.25% trypsin
with 1 mM EDTA, and incubating 15 min at 37&deg; with intermittent trituration
to disperse cells.  Trypsin is stopped with soybean trypsin inhibitor,
and one volume of media with serum added.  After spinning 10 min at
a standard setting, pellets are resuspended to 2 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>
per ml in DMEM/F12/N2 with 5% FBS.  One ml is plated per 35 mm Falcon
Primaria coated with 2&nbsp;&mu;g/cm<sup>2</sup> laminin and incubated 5%
CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&deg;.
<p>
The plasmid <b>pT&alpha;1:rsGFP</b> was constructed first by amplifying
the 5'-flanking sequence of T&alpha;1 gene using PCR;  the 5'-primer
is 5'-CTTACATATGCTGAATTCCGTATTAG-3' and the 3'-primer is
5'-GCTCACCGGTGTTGCTGCTTCGCG-3'.  The plasmid containing 1.1 kb
of the 5'-flanking sequence of T&alpha;1 gene actually contained a
lacZ reporter (<b>pT&alpha;1:<i>lacZ</i></b>), and came from
F. Miller.  A red-shifted GFP mutant, <b>prsGFP-C1</b> was
obtained from Clontech.  <i>Nde</i>I and <i>Age</i>I sites are contained
in the 5' and 3'-primers, respectively.  The 1.1&nbsp;kb PCR product of T&alpha;1
5'-fragment was inserted into <i>Sma</i>I site of pBluescript by
blunt-end ligation.  The <i>Nde</i>I-<i>Age</i>I T&alpha;1 fragment
was then excised and gel-purified.  The prsGFP was digested with
<i>Ase</i>I and <i>Age</i> to remove the CMV promoter, and the
rest of prsGFP ligated with the <i>Nde</i>I-<i>Age</i>I T&alpha;1 fragment
to make pT&alpha;1:rsGFP.
<p>
<b>pT&alpha;1:GFPh</b> was made by digesting pBluescript-T&alpha;1 with
<i>Xba</i>I and <i>Hind</i>III to obtain the T&alpha;1-promoter,
and also getting the <i>Xba</i>I-<i>Sal</i>I fragment containing
SV40 SD/SA-GFPh-SV40 poly(A) from an rAAV UF2 cassette (from N. Hackett
and R. Crystal), and inserting these fragments in frame into pBluescript
SK plasmid between its <i>Hind</i>III and <i>Sal</i>I sites.
<p>
<i>Ase</i>I is an isoschizomer of <i>Asn</i>I, which cuts AT|TAAT.
<i>Age</i>I is an isoschizomer of <i>Pin</i> AI, and cuts A|CCGGT.
<i>Nde</i>I cuts CA|TATG. <i>Sma</i>I cuts CCC|GGG.
<p>
Transfection is accomplished by adding to 35 mm dishes of forebrain cells
plated 12 hours earlier with 10&nbsp;&mu;l of lipofectin (GIBCO) and
2&nbsp;&mu;g DNA.  Cells are incubated in DNA-lipid in OPTI-MEM (Gibco) for
5-7 hours, then taken back to normal medium.  Imaging of GFP in the 12-48 h
period after transfection is done with an Olympus IX70 epifluorescence
microscope.

  Muscle Regeneration by Bone Marrow-Derived Myogenic Progenitors
<p class="Para1">
Satellite cells are a subset of tissue in skeletal muscle located
between the sarcolemma and muscle fiber basal lamina which
serve as mononuclear myogenic precursors.  When there is injury,
these cells proliferate and some fuse to form new fibers.
<p>
Myogenesis in marrow-derived MSCs has been induced in vitro, but
not yet demonstrated in vivo.  BM cells were obtained from
C57/M<i>lacZ</i> transgenic mice; <i>lacZ</i> gene expression is
under the control of the muscle-specific myosin light chain 3F promoter.
10<sup>6</sup> BM cells were injected into damaged tibialis anterior
muscles of <i>scid/bg</i> immunodeficient mice.  Expression of the gene
is restricted to cardiac and skeletal muscle of adult mice, but
is activated in cell types induced to myogenic differentiation.
As a control, satellite cells from skeletal muscle of transgenic
mice are obtained and injected (5 &times; 10<sup>5</sup> cells)
in the contralateral leg.  The TA muscles are examined at various
times from 5&nbsp;d to 5&nbsp;w for XGal+ nuclei.
<p>
Muscle stained histochemically after 2 w showed &beta;-Gal<sup>+</sup>
nuclei aligned similar to those nuclei of satellite cell injected
into the contrlateral leg (control).
<p>
Cells were taken from the C57/MlacZ mice and fractionated into
adherent/non-adherents.  Enriched cells then injected into TA
muscle of 15 scid/bg mice, and their tissues analyzed at 1, 2, and 6
weeks.  &beta;-Gal<sup>+</sup> nuclei were found in 6 mice given
adherents, and in 3 given with nonadherents at 2 and 6 weeks postinjection.
The transgene (MLC3F-nlacZ) was never found activated in tissues
that were not muscle.
<p>
BM cells from the C57 line (H-2<sup>b</sup>) were transplanted to 12
irradiated scid/bg (H-2<sup>d</sup>) mice in order to see if cells could
move from marrow to damaged muscle.  5&nbsp;weeks later muscle regeneration
in 9 surviving mice was found in both TA muscles.  The study looked
at mice 1, 2, and 3 weeks for reconstitution of marrow;  in scid/bg
mice, there are normally no circulating lymphocytes, but the treated
animals showed this.  CD4 and CD8 showed 34% and 15% mature lymphocytes,
with all circulating cells donor- (H-2<sup>b</sup>) derived.  Nearly
complete chimerism was also seen.
<p>
Transverse cryostat sections of regenerating fibers reveal
&beta;-Gal<sup>+</sup> nuclei in 5&nbsp;of 6 reconstituted animals at
2 and 3 weeks after injury.  Hoechst nuclear staining shows that &beta;-Gal
nuclei are present in immature centrally nuclear fibers and in
mature fibers with peripherally located nuclei.  No blue nuclei were
found in tissues after 1 week, which were infiltrated by inflammatory
mononuclear cells.  Hence this is direct evidence of BM-derived cells
relocating to damaged muscle and participating in a regeneration process.

  The Effects of Implants Loaded with Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells
  on the Healing of Canine Segmental Bone Defects
<p class="Para1">
16 days prior to creating segmental defects, a 15-gauge Janishidi needle
was used in aspiration of 9 ml BM tissue in 1000 U/ml heparinized saline
in syringe; cells were transported on frozen cold pack overnight.
Cells were mixed with DMEM-low glucose medium + 10% FCS +
pen G (100 U/ml) + strep sulfate (100&nbsp;&mu;g/ml) + amphoB (0.25&nbsp;&mu;g/ml).
Enrichment was on Percoll cushion (1.073 g/ml), plating to 10 million
cells in 185 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.  At day 4, nonadherents are removed;
day 9, 10, or 11 is subculture day, with replate to 8000 /cm<sup>2</sup>.
On days 13-15, flasks are shipped and held incubated until day 16.
Hydroxylapatite-calcium phosphate (65:35) ceramic cylinders are coated
with human plasma fibronectin (soak 16 h in 100&nbsp;&mu;g/ml fibronectin at
4&deg;) and air-dry in sterile cabinet (store 4&deg;).  Coated cylinders
are placed in 5&nbsp;ml suspension of stem cells (7.5 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>/ml)
in serum-free DMEM.  A vacuum (3 bursts, 5&nbsp;s each) was used to remove
air bubbles, and they were placed in the incubator for 2 h, gently
agitated every 30 min.  Remaining cells were counted to determine the
number of cells loaded.  Control cylinders were treated the same, except
loading medium had no MSCs.
<p>
All dogs treated were weight-bearing after 1 week, and all wounds healed
without infection or failure of fixation.  In three dogs whose defects
were not treated, there was no healing in the 16-week posttreatment
period.  At the cut ends, there was limited new bone formation (first
seen at 8 weeks).  Radiographic atrophic non-union was the diagnosis
for these animals.
<p>
For the implant groups, the implants in all dogs showed a granular
appearance because the pores were empty.  As new bone formed, this
radiographic granular appearance went away.  10 of 12 dogs implanted
with cylinders without cell infusion showed union between cylinder
and cut bone by 16 w.  A large number of cracks in ceramic were evident
at 12 w however.  In the group of dogs implanted with cell-laden ceramic,
union was more rapid, with all 12 dogs showing it by 8 weeks.  Cracks
in the ceramic were less evident as time progressed.  A callus developed
in the periphery of cylinders with cells in 5&nbsp;of 6 treatments, while no
callus was evident in implants without cells or in untreated defects.
<p>
Histological exam showed in untreated dogs that there was no union,
although trabecular bone arose from cut ends;  the central region had
filled with fibrous tissue and skeletal muscle that had collapsed into
the defect.
<p>
A solid union was found in implants which had been loaded
with MSCs, with new bone formation.  All pores contained either woven
or lamellar new bone, and the tissue was in direct contact with ceramic.
The callus seen on radiographs had spanned the length of the defect,
extending into adjacent areas.
<p>
Implants without cells showed a union as well, but only a minimum amt
of bone was formed in middle of implant, and pores were filled with
fibrous tissue.  The union was composed of an ingrowth of bone from
cut ends of cortex, and endosteal spike advancing into hollow core
of implant.

Alternative Promoters and Cardiac Muscle Cell-Specific Expression
of The Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> Exchanger Gene
<p class="Para1">
The exons encoding the sodium-calcium ion exchanger NCX1 were
mapped by probes of three unique 5' untranslated sequences called Ht, Kc,
and Br (heart, kidney, and brain, resp.) using Southern blotting
of restriction endonuclease-digested
rat genomic DNA.  These three probes bound to a <i>Bam</i>HI fragment
about 20&nbsp;kb long.  The Kc and Br probes hybed to a <i>Eco</i>RI
8&nbsp;kb fragment and <i>Hin</i>dIII 9&nbsp;kb fragment, and the Ht probe
matched to <i>Eco</i>RI 3.6&nbsp;kb and <i>Hin</i>dIII 0.4&nbsp;kb fragments.
(Multiple but fainter bands appeared in some hybridizations of the Br probe,
which may be due to nonspecific pairing as a result of this probe's high
GC content.)  A rat genomic library was then probed with these three
sequences and with the 3'-end of the NCX1 coding region:  15 clones
were found with Ht, 3 with both Kc and Br, and 5&nbsp;with the coding-region
probe.  No probe of one class of clones reacted with another class.
The final map was generated by Southern hybridization, restriction
mapping, and sequencing.  A <i>Bam</i>HI site is close to the 3'-end of
the Br sequence.  The Ht region is furthest upstream (about 20 kb)
from the Kc, then Br sequence.  The three exons form the 5&acute;-end
of NCX1 transcripts in different tissues, each being the exon 1 of those
tissues.
<p>
Transcriptional start site determined using RNase protection
and primer extension analysis of the RNA of heart, kidney and brain.
Short and long riboprobes were made from Ht- and Kc-exon1, and long
riboprobe from Br-exon1.  Two species from the Kc long and short riboprobes
in protection of species 474 and 285 bp long, resp., annealed to
kidney cortex RNA.  These correspond to identical positions in exon 1
of Kc and match the 5'-RACE data.  Kc long probe also gives rise to
cluster of shorter bands corresponding to protection of exon 2 by
NCX1 transcripts from cerebellum and heart that contain alternative
first exons.  Primer extension confirms the start site of the Kc exon 1
as did the 5'-RACE and RNase protection experiments.
<p>
RNase protection was also done with heart riboprobes.  RNA from
heart protects at doublet at 350/351 nt with Ht-long, and a doublet
at 197/198 with Ht-short.  More faint bands appear at ~11 and 30 nt
longer.  These are consistent with 5'-RACE of previous work in which
8 clones clustered with 1 nt of the start site of the major protected
doublet 2805/6 nt long; 3 addl clones were 11 nt longer.
Primer extension showed doublet indicating a start site at 2805/6.
These results indicate that the A residue at 2805 is the start site.
Earlier 5'-RACE experiments show expression of exon 1-Ht in brain and
transcription starting 77 nt upstream of the heart start.  Fainter bands
show up on longer exposure that are larger, which show up in heart RNA
and cerebrum, but not in kidney or cerebellum, verified by using the Ht
probe in Northerns.
<p>
RNase protection with the Br-long probe shows a predominant fragment
296 nt long on in the brain RNA lanes, showing a transcriptional start
agreeing with three 5'-RACE clones.  Other protected bands of ~290-340
nt indicate a staggered start of exon 1-Br.  Primer extension experiments
show a cluster of bands with one predominant and showing a start site
at &minus;215.
<p>
A 3.6 kb <i>Eco</i>RI and 421 bp <i>Hin</i>dIII fragments of genomic DNA
contain the heart start site.  The <i>Hin</i>dIII fragment is contained
entirely within the <i>Eco</i>RI fragment.  This was shown by inserting
the fragments into pGL2B promoterless vector to prepare pGL2-336 and
pGL2-2805 corresponding to the <i>Hin</i>dIII and <i>Eco</i>RI fragments,
resp.  The start site is 85 bp upstream the 3' end of the <i>Hin</i>dIII
fragment, and 336 bp downstream the 5'-end;  the upstream and downstream
portions of the <i>Eco</i>RI fragment are 2805 and 795, resp., accounting
for the names of the plasmid constructs.  These were transfected into
primary cardiac myocytes, CHO cells and COS-7 cells.  As a positive control,
pMLC was used being the cardiac-specific myosin light chain 2 promoter
with luciferase.  A negative control was pGL2B.  pRSV contains the
strong RSV promoter was used to define level of cell type-independent
activity in promoters.  Results show pMLC was 3 times higher in primary
myocytes relative to CHO cells, 9 times higher relative to COS-7 cells.
pGL2-2805 with the NCX1 promoter was 9 times higher in myocytes than
CHO cells, 18 times higher than in COS-7 cells.  The smaller pGL-336
construct had high activity ratios of myocytes relative to CHO and
COS-7, being 13 and 31, resp.  This the DNA fragments are transcriptionally
active and cardiac cell-specific.  Since pGL2-336 was 3 times more active
than pGL-2805, the presence of an upstream suppressor element is indicated.
<p>
The promoters for the different tissues (cardiac, brain, and kidney)
were placed into different constructs (pGL3Ht-2805, pGL3B4-1086,
and pGL3Kd-1663) and transfected into primary cardiac myocytes with
a pGL3Basic plasmid as negative control.  The brain promoter was only
20% as active as the heart promoter, the kidney only 4-5%, and the
promoterless vector about 1-2%.
<p>
Primer pairs A2-B1, A3-B1, and A4-B1 were used in succession to reduce
the side of the <i>Hin</i>dIII fragment containing the NCX1 cardiac
promoter.

A Multidrug Resistance Transporter from Human MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells
<p class="Para1">
PCR and degenerate-primer pairs were used to amplify cellular mRNA
in a special RNA fingerprinting technique.  cDNA was prepared using
PCR for the MCF-7, MCF-7/AdrVp, and MCF-7/AdrVpPR cell lines.  The latter
lines have partially reverted to sensitivity to the drug when cultured
in the absence of selecting agents (AdrVp = adriamycin-resistant line and
maintained in 1&nbsp;&mu;g/ml doxorubicin and 2.5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml verapamil,
AdrVpPR = partial revertant to adriamycin sensitivity).  The fingerprinting
was according to a protocol of the Delta RNA Fingerprinting kit (Clontech),
which makes use of a P6 arbitrary primer and a T9 oligo(dT) primer.
Differentially expressed cDNAs are excised from the PCR products in
the differential display gels (eluted by boiling in 40&nbsp;&mu;l dd water for
5 min), then amplified by PCR for 20 cycles with original primers,
separated on 2% EtBr-agarose gels to see size, and ligated into mcs
of TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), transfected to TOP10F <i>E.
coli</i>.  After colonies emerge, plasmid DNA is isolated (Wizard miniprep
from Promega), and confirmation of cloning done by a &ldquo;reverse&rdquo;
Northern, fixing plasmid DNA to Zeta Probe-GT (Bio-Rad) in a slot-blot,
probing with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled PCR mixture amplifying MCF-6 cDNA with
original P and T primers in the kit.  Another blot was probed with
labeled PCR mixture amplifying cDNA from MCF-7/AdrVp with standard Northern
hybridization conditions.  Autoradiography was used to illuminate.
<p>
Use of the P6 and T9 primers lead to reproducible findings of cDNA from
MCF-7/AdrVp cells that appeared as new bands compared to MCF-7 or
MCF-7/AdrVpPR revertants.  The PCR product from the resistant cells
was excised from dried gel, purified, ligated to TA cloning vector,
screened by reverse Northern.  Standard Northern showed a 2.4&nbsp;kb mRNA
with marked overexpression in MCF-7/AdrVp, with intermediate expression
in partial revertant, and none in MCF-7 parent.  Sequencing shows a 795-bp
cDNA and a homology search in protein databases show high identity with
ATP-binding casette transporters.  Labeled 795-bp cDNA used as probe to
screen cDNA library of &lambda; bacteriophage, identifying a 2.4&nbsp;kb cDNA.
The sequenced isolate was 2418 bp long with a long open reading frame starting
at base 239 and a stop codon TAA at base position 2204.  The deduced amino
acid sequence is designated BCRP, breast cancer resistance protein.
GCG FASTA analysis reveals extensive homology with 50 ABC transporters
the best match being PIR2:G02068, the human homologue of <i>Drosophila</i>
white (<i>w</i>) gene (29% identity).  The Drosophila gene is a transporter
of guanine and Trp.  RT-PCR shows that <i>w</i> human homologue is not
overexpressed in the resistant line compared with the parent.
<p>
The program <span style="font-variant:small-caps">motifs</span> was
used to look at BCRP sequence and found a single Walker &ldquo;A&rdquo;
ATP/GTP-binding region as well as a phosphopantetheine attachment site;
phosphopantetheine is the attachment on activated fatty acids and
amino acid groups.  The software
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">pepplot</span> and
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">plotstructure</span> show
a hydrophobic amino terminal (from 1-400) with the ATP-binding domain.
A relatively hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal indicates potential transmembrane
domain and four N-glycosylation sites.
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">dotplot</span> indicated that the
peptide is homologous with one half of duplicated Pgp or MRP.  There
configuration is NH<sub>2</sub>-[transmembrane domains]-[ATP binding
1]-[transmembrane domains]-[ATP binding 2]-COOH, but BCRP is
NH<sub>2</sub>-[ATP binding]-[transmembrane domains]-COOH.  Phylogenetics
were assessed by
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">pileup</span>,
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">distances</span>,
and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">growtree</span>, with only
distant relationship shown for Pgp and MRP.
<p>
Northern of normal human tissue show the greatest expression of BCRP
in placental tissue, very low levels in brain, prostate, small intestine,
testis, ovary, colon, and liver.  Undetected in heart, lung, skeletal muscle,
kidney, pancrease, spleen, thymus, and PB leukocytes.  Inserted into the
mcs of pcDNA3 vector and transfected to MCF-7 cells, the full-length
BCRP was examined by Northern blot and two positive clones and one negative
used in further study.  Transfected cells were tested for an ability to
prevent accumulation of daunorubicin using flow cytometry.  The intracellular
steady-state concentrations of daunorubicin for clones 8 and 6 were
30% and 50%, resp., of those found in cells transfected with vector alone
(note that clone 8 makes more BCRP mRNA than clone 6, as shown by the
Northerns).
<p>
ATP-dependence on the function of BCRP was determined by depleting cells
of ATP and checking for intracellular retention of rhodamine 123.
Clone 8 overexpressers showed a concentration 45% of that in the control.
A sulforhodamine-B cytotoxicity assay tested the sensitivities of the
transfected sublines to chemotherapeutic agents, and clones 6 and 8
were resistant to mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, while
clone 19 non-overexpressers were sensitive by comparison.  The greatest
degree of resistance of clones 6 and 8, comparable to MCF-7/AdrVp
resistance, was to mitoxantrone.  The transfected clones 6 and 8 showed
similar pattern of cross-resistance, but the MCF-7/AdrVp show greater
relative resistance to all cytotoxic drugs.  Clones 6 and 8 are sensitive
to <i>cis</i>-platin, paclitaxel, and vincristine, but so are MCF-7/AdrVp
and the non-overexpresser clone 19.

Transduction of Murine Bone Marrow Cells With an MDR1 Vector Enables
Ex Vivo Stem Cell Expansion, But These Expanded Grafts Cause A
Myeloproliferative Syndrome in Transplanted Mice
<p class="Para1">
Marrow cells were flushed from hind limbs of C57BL/6 (C57) or
B6.C-H1/BY (HW80) congenic mice 4 days before injection to recipients,
preincubated with DMEM + 15% FBS for 48 h.
Growth factors are added to suspension cultures:  20 ng/ml
mouse IL-3 (Amgen), 50 ng/ml hIL-6 (Amgen), 50 ng/ml
mouse SCF (Amgen and R &amp; D Systems).  After 48 h pre-stimulation,
cells were then co-cultured on irradiated (1500 rad)
retroviral GP+E86 ecotropic producer cell lines in the presence of the same
growth factor combination, but also containing 6&nbsp;&mu;g/ml polybrene.
Two Harvey murine sarcoma virus vectors contained a stably transmitted
human MDR1 cDNA or DHFR<sup>L22Y</sup>, a resistance-conferring DHFR
mutant.  After transduction, cells are placed into suspension culture.
<p>
Progenitor transduction efficiencies on day 0 were 40.3% for MDR1
taxol-resistant and 39.6% for DHFR trimetrexate-resistant.  Cells
expanded logarithmically over 12 days in culture.  At 6 and 12 days,
a cell aliquot was tested on semisolid methylcellulose to determine
myeloid progenitor colony formation, and the relative percentage
of progenitors drug-resistant remains constant during culture.
Both MDR1- and DHFR-transduced drug-resistant progenitors expanded
100-fold (about 6 cell cycles) by 2 weeks.
<p>
The transduced and expanded cells (12-16 days of expansion) were
injected daily into HW80 mice over a 5&nbsp;day period such that 40-100
million cells were injected per mouse.  Several hours after each injection,
mice were treated with trimetrexate and with nitrobenzylmercaptopurine
riboside phosphate (NBMRP-P), a nucleoside transport inhibitor that
increases toxicity of trimetrexate for hematopoietic cells.
The proportion of hemoglobin (Hb)-containing cells from the C57
donor were followed beginning 1 week after transplant up to beyond a
1 year.  While reconstitution was seen partially of donor cells
with both vectors, engraftment did not last with DHFR- or mock-transduced
marrow.  In contrast 5 in 12 mice with MDR1-transduced marrow showed
long-term engraftment up to 6 months, and one up to 14 months as the last
time point.  Southern blot on DNA from marrow, spleen, thymus, and
peripheral blood of recipients indicates multi-lineage engraftment.
Flow cytometry of all four mice from an earlier experiment shows
P-glycoprotein as 10 weeks engraftment.  As there was a 1:12 donor
to recipient ratio which is unfavorable for long-term engraftment,
there is an strong indication that stem cell expansion occurred
ex vivo.
<p>
Mice were lethally irradiated and given one of three grafts:
fresh bone marrow, cells transduced with DHFR, or cell transduced
with MDR1, and mice monitored with Hb electrophoresis.  MDR1-tagged
cells were also co-grafted with fresh BM cells at a 0.005/0.25
volume ratio in the hind limbs.  This means that MDR1 cells would
only expand to 2% of reconstituted cells if there were no difference
in expansion.  MDR1 cells formed 26% of reconstituted cells however,
with a 13-fold greater expansion.  With DHFR + fresh BM cells also
grafted in the same proportion, no DHFR cells could be found in the
reconstituted populations.  When both MDR1 and DHFR cells were grafted
equally (0.005 hind limb volumes), only MDR1 cells were found in the
competitive repopulation study.
<p>
The presence of the MDR1 proviral vector in expanded cells was to be
verified.  CFU-S from recipients grafted with donor cells were expanded
till day 12 and genomic DNA digested with <i>Eco</i>RI then probed
with full-length MDR1.  88 in 88 CFU-S from 7 primary recipients
(6 mice from the MDR1 vs. DHFR competitive repopulation study, and one
mouse from the MDR graft into non-irradiated host) showed positive
on Southern blots (band expected at 3464 bp).  Hence only the MDR1
cells in secondary culture were expanded.  Moreover the integration
site of stably transfected MDR1 proviral sequence was checked for
context sequence, and at least 5 separate clones were found in 3 mice
recipients receiving grafts from same expansion pool.  Single mice
also showed engraftment with multiple clones, indicating that expansion
is more about the presence of the retroviral transgene than the site
of its integration into the genome.
<p>
Bone marrow from HW80
mice were transduced with MDR1 retrovirus and 0.02 donor volumes
were put to competition against 0.25 volumes of fresh C57 marrow cells
after the former were allowed to expand 0, 3, and 6 days.  After 12
days, cell dose was 0.01 donor volume of MDR1 and 0.125 donor volumes
of fresh BM.  MDR1 engraftment was successful only after 3 days
expansion.  After day 12, MDR1 out-competed fresh marrow although
there was a 12.5-fold dilution at transplant time.  These studies
show that stem cell expansion occurs steadily with the time in culture,
and that it is not arrested after only a few days.
<p>
Mice given MDR1-expanded grafts showed abnormal leukocyte counts
for a 3- or 4-month period (30,000 / &mu;l).  There was typically
an acute phase with counts ranging from 100,000 to 450,000/&mu;l,
in mice developing a myeloproliferative disorder.  These numbers
were attributable to abnormal cell types with a GR-1<sup>+</sup>
or MAC-1<sup>+</sup> immunophenotype, consistent with the granulocytic
morphology of a majority of cells.  In 4 of 24 mice, blast forms
were seen with emergence of leukemia.  These disorders were
transplantable to secondary recipients, and genomic analysis did
not indicate a single integration-site clone was involved.
Transduced cells and plasma were sampled and used in a sensitive
PCR assay to detect helper virus was negative for the helper genome,
but positive for a control monkey DNA source.  Hence the disorder
and stem cell expansion are not associated with expression of a helper
virus.
<p>
Beside the increased leukocyte count, clonogenic myeloid progenitors
both in blood and spleen were found in high numbers.  In blood the
concentration in normal animals is 1-4 CFU-C per 100,000 cells, but
in MDR1 mice, the range was from 57-1290 CFU-C per 100,000 cells.
Splenomegaly was evident, with weight ranges of 483-834 mg comparing
to a mean 106 mg for normal mice.  The average progenitor content
in spleen is 11/100,000 in normal animals, but 180/100,000 cells in
MDR1 mice.  P-glycoprotein was found in both normal and abnormal
leukocytes, but levels varied from mouse to mouse.  Progenitors
resistant to taxol varied from 1.1-6.7% in blood to a high of
34.7% in spleen.  Cellularity of the bone marrow was normal in all
mice examined.

Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus-Based Vectors Provide Short-Term
Rather Than Long-Term Transduction of Primitive Hematopoietic Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
SSV9 vector is a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector construct
with lacZ driven by CMV immediate early promoter (AAV &beta;-gal).
FBMD-1 cells are a stromal support layer for mouse marrow cells.
In a preliminary experiment these were exposed to virus and cobblestone
areas stained with X-gal.  Early-appearing cobblstone area-forming cells-7 (CAFC-7)
had a transduction efficiency of 35%.  Late-appearing CAFC-35 showed
60% positive for lacZ.  A second experiment showed 57% CAFC-7 transduction
and 38% CAFC-35.  These indicated efficient transduction with an MOI=0.45,
and 90% viability.
<p>
C57BL/6J (B6-Gpi-1<sup>b</sup>) mice were lethally irradiated with 9.5 Gy
whole body and received either 1 or 2 million transduced cell.  6 months
later, bone marrow was evaluated for lacZ expression.  No expression was
seen in any tissue.  Southern analysis indicated the gene integrated into
the genome,  PCR of vector-specific primers showed no integration into
genome of long-term repopulating stem cells.
<p>
This protocol had worked for rat neurons but not for LTR stem cells of
bone marrow.

Implication of Expression of GDNF/Ret Signalling Components in
Differentiation of Bone Marrow Haemopoietic Cells
<p class="Para1">
RT-PCR was used to examine a TGW human neuroblastoma and four leukemia
cell lines (THP-1 monocytic leukemia, HL-60 promyelocytic, KG-1
CD34-negative myeloblastic, KG-1A CD34-positive myeloblastic) for
the expression of RET and GFR&alpha;-1, -2, and -3.  The primer
used for RET produces a 228 bp species from mRNA preparations
of expressing cells.  RET was found in cell types TGW, THP-1, HL-60,
and KG-1A, but not KG-1.  It has been previously reported that
the 150 kDa and 170 kDa Ret isoforms were found in TGW, and forms
150 kDa and 190 kDa in THP-1 and HL-60.  KG-1A expresses a 100 kDa form,
which is detectable by two different Ret antibodies generated against
the receptor domain and carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids, resp.
A second primer pair downstream of the first pair for locating RET
was used to probe the message fraction, and this time KG-1A showed
no band:  this confirmed the suspicion that the 100 kDa in KG-1A
is a form in which the middle section is deleted.
<p>
RT-PCR did not find GFR&alpha; forms in THP-1 and HL-60.  KG-1 and
KG-1A both expressed GFR&alpha;-1 and -2, but not -3.  No GDNF or
neurturin (NTN) transcripts was found in any of these cell lines.
Ret proteins in TGW but not HL-60 nor THP-1 were phosphorylated on
tyrosines when these cells were treated 5&nbsp;min with GDNF or NTN.
This indicates that the GFR&alpha;-1 and -2 expressed in these
cells is required for Ret phosphorylation.  A 160 kDa band from THP-1
cells is found with anti-PTyr antibody, but was also found in control
(untreated) cells, which could mean that GDNF nor NTN exert any
effect on it.  GDNF and NTN caused no phosphorylation of the 100 kDa
protein in KG-1A cells although they express GFR&alpha;-1.
<p>
Treatment of THP-1 and HL-60 cells with TPA (12-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)
causes these cells to differentiate to macrophages;  moreover, it
is also reported that HL-60 differentiates to granulocytes with
all-<i>trans</i> retinoic acid (while THP-1 undergoes no significant
morphological changes).  When THP-1 and HL-60 were exposed to TPA
or RA for 24 h, Ret expression falls significantly.  It is not known
if the decrease in Ret occurs directly because of these agonists, or
whether regulatory changes are the effects of other direct actions.
Expression of GFR&alpha;-1 and -2 in these cells was not affected by
these treatments.
<p>
Bone marrow from a 28-year old man and spleen from a 1 week old male
BALB/c mouse were stained with anti-Ret Ab in an immunohistochemical
probe of expression.  In both human and mouse tissues, staining of
promyelocytes and myelocytes (intermediate mature myeloid tissues)
was evident.  Staining of erythroid and lymphoid-lineage cells
and segmented neutrophils was weak or undetectable.  Monocytes in
peripheral blood were weakly stained.  Mouse bone marrow expressing
Gr-1 and B220 antigens, treated with anti-Ret-R5 Ab, and analyzed
by flow cytometry shows that Ret expression is seen in a fraction
of the Gr-1-positive myeloid cells by not B220-positive lymphoid.
All data indicates a high level of Ret expression in mature myeloid
cells with expression down-regulated at the terminal stage of maturation.
<p>
RT-PCR was used to determine expression of RET, GDNF, NTN,
and GFR&alpha;-1, -2, and -3 in mouse bone marrow hematopoietic and
stromal cells.  Adherent bone marrow cells were collected and represent
a number of types: fibroblasts, endothelial, adipocytes, with macrophages
as well.  Nonadherents (hematopoietic) were also analyzed.  Results
indicate that only RET was expressed in the hemaotpoietics.
Adherents expressed GFR&alpha;-1 and -2, and GDNF, but not Ret.
The mRNA from substantia nigra (a control) showed the presence of
RET, GFR&alpha;-1 and -2, and GDNF.

Stimulation of Osteoclast Differentiation In Vitro by Mouse
Oncostatin M, Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor, Cardiotrophin-1 and
Interleukin-6:  Synergy with Dexamethasone
<p class="Para1">
Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP<sup>+</sup>)
multi-nucleated cells (MNCs) from mouse bone marrow calvarial cell
co-cultures were treated with murine oncostatin M at 1.25 ng/ml
(62.5 pM), which increased proliferation in these at least 3 orders
of magnitude.Increases were also seen in a dose-dependent manner,
up to 10 ng/ml.  Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1
(CT-1) also had an effect.  Bone resorption in the MNCs was tested
by culturing calvaria and marrow cells on smooth cortical bone slices.
The number of pits in the bone in these slices was determined, and
it is clear that pit number increases steadily in a dose-dependent
manner with OSM, LIF, and CT-1.  Resportive pit area is also a measure
of osteoclast activity, and all cytokines had significant effects also;
with 5&nbsp;ng/ml cytokine, resorptive area increases 3-fold.
<p>
TRAP<sup>+</sup> MNCs are produced in response to IL-1 or IL-11 and
also depends on presence of PGE<sub>2</sub>; indomethacin can inhibit.
Co-cultures were treated with 10 ng/ml OSM over increasing dosese of
indomethacin, and OSM induction was clearly inhibted in dose-dependent
manner by the indomethacin.  0.1 and 1&nbsp;&mu;M indomethaciin inhibits
TRAP<sup>+</sup> MNC numbers by 70% and 90%, resp.
<p>
TRAP<sup>+</sup> numbers were not affected by dexamethasone, but did
enhance proliferation of MNCs caused by OSM, with greater counts than
with OSM alone.  10&nbsp;&mu;M, 1&nbsp;&mu;M, and 0.1&nbsp;&mu;M Dex increased counts
4-, 3-, and &gt;2-fold, resp., with 5&nbsp;ng/ml OSM, relative to OSM alone.
10 nM Dex + 5&nbsp;ng/ml OSM was not different from 5&nbsp;ng/ml OSM.  Dex also
enhances the effects of LIF and CT-1 to induce osteoclast formation.
<p>
It is known that IL-6 in combination with addition of soluble IL-6R
can induce TRAP<sup>+</sup> cell numbers.  IL-6R synthesis itself can
be induced by human OSM or Dex in other cells.  OSM was added at
levels &gt;1 ng/ml along with 20 ng/ml IL-6 and formation of
TRAP<sup>+</sup> cells was found to be 2-fold compared to OSM alone.
20 ng/ml IL-6 alone was without effect.  Hence OSM induces IL-6R in
this system.  0.1&nbsp;&mu;M Dex alone was without effect, but addition
of IL-6 increased TRAP<sup>+</sup> MNC counts, although the counts
were very low compared to the OSM treatment.
<p>
OSM can also induce IL-6 expression in some cell types, and calvaria
cells can secreate IL-6 in response to cytokines and hormones.
Supernatants of calvarial cell cultures treated with OSM, LIF, CT-1
at 2 or 20 ng/ml or IL-1&beta; treatment after 24 h showed &gt;20-fold
IL-6 with IL-1&beta; or with 20 ng/ml OSM according to a B9 assay;
LIF and CT-1 had no effect.  Additional time points (48 and 72 h) showed
the same trend.  1&nbsp;&mu;M Dex alone does not alter basal IL-6 expression,
but with OSM, IL-6 is inhibited by about 60%.  Estradiol at 1&nbsp;&mu;M
has no effect on basal or OSM-induced IL-6 levels.
<p>
IL-6 mRNA levels were also evaluated by Northern blots.  After 24 h
with OSM, an increased 1.3&nbsp;kb band signal is observed.There is no
change with LIF, CT-1, with or without Dex.  The increase is detectable
as early as 6 h.  \\0.1&nbsp;&mu;M Dex suppresses the OSM induction.

  Cardiomyocytes Can Be Generated from Marrow Stromal Cells <i>In Vitro</i>
<p class="Para1">
A cardiomyogenic (CMG) cell line was produced in these experiments.
BM cells from femurs of ten female C3H/He mice were isolated according
to Dexter et al. (J. Cell. Physiol 91:335, 1977), then cultured in
Iscove's MDM + 20% FBS + pen/strep/ampho (100&nbsp;&mu;g/ml,250 ng/ml,85&nbsp;&mu;g/ml)
at 33&deg; in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.  Marrow cells emerged that did not depend
on hematopoietic feeders, and after 4 months, a continuous line was obtained.
Cell lines were subcloned by limiting dilution.  Differentiation was
achieved by treatment with 3&nbsp;&mu;M 5-azacytidine for 24 h.
<p>
192 single clones were isolated by several limiting dilutions, and several
of these could differentiate into spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes.
Both morphological and immunochemical methods were used to characterize
the effects of 5-azacytidine treatment.  Antibodies to sarcomeric myosin,
actinin, and desmin formed the panel of immunocytochemical methods.
About 30% of of CMG cells show increases in size, with a ball-like
appearence, and with a process extended.  After two weeks, adjoining
cells connect with one another, with myotube-like structures apparent
at 3 weeks.  Differentiation to cardiomyocytes was apparent, although
cells were not post-mitotic.  For at least 8 weeks after treatment,
the cardiomyocytes retained differenitiated phenotype (no de-differentiation).
Other non-myocytes showed an adipocyte-like appearance.
<p>
Immunostaining with MF20 (anti-sarcomeric myosin) was done at 1, 2, 3
and 4 weeks posttreatment.  All cells were positive prior to forming
connections to form myotubes.  Myotubes ranged in length from 1000-3000&nbsp;&mu;m.
Cardiac myocytes differ from skeletal muscle myocytes because they
have branching fibers, evident in these differentiated cell cultures.
Most cells at 4 weeks are mononuclear, but there are a large number
of binuclear, and a few multinuclear (3-10 / cell).  Intercalated
disks are apparent and the cells form myotubes.  These stain strongly
with antibodies to actinin and desmin.
<p>
Video recording shows spontaneous contractile movement in myotubes.
This beating activity begins within 2 weeks in the CMG line, and is
random.  However by the 3rd week, tubes show synchrony is contractility.
The contractions differed greatly from smooth and skeletal muscle cells
in culture, being rapid and automatic, at frequencies of 63-428/min.
<p>
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done on CMG cells at different
stages.  Myofilaments are seen after 1-2 weeks, with an intricate alignment.
Striations and pale staining pattern of the sarcomere can be observed.
Nuclei were at the center of the cell (not beneath the sarcolemma).
Membrane-bound dense secretory vesicles 70-130 nm dia are conspicuous;
these concentrate in the juxtanuclear cytoplasm, but some are near the
sarcolemma.  These may be atrial granules.  These findings taken together
indicate a phenotype more cardiomyocyte-like than any other myocyte.
<p>
Cells treated between 2-5 weeks were examined for changes in
electrophysiology.  The time-recorded potentials showed two distinguishable
action potentials:  a sinus node-like and a ventricular myocyte-like.
The sinus node-like suggested a pacemaking ability, a shallow resting
membrane potential with a late diastolic slow depolarization.
At 5&nbsp;weeks, contraction of the myotube is so large and forceful that the
glass microelectrode was damaged.
<p>RT-PCR or Northern analysis was done to look at expression in
differentiated lines.  In an RT-PCR/Southern analysis, both ANP and BNP are
found to be present in CMG cells and in a mouse heart positive control,
but not in a skeletal muscle negative control.  RT-PCR products of
0,2,4 wk CMG cells, heart (positive) tissue control, and liver (negative)
tissue control were separated on agarose gels and probed with
&alpha;-myosin heavy chain (aMHC), &beta; chain (bMHC), and
&alpha;-skeletal and -cardiac actin.  The 302 bp aMHC is positive
for the heart and weakly positive for CMG.  bMHC
is clearly expressed in the positive heart control as
well as the 2 and 4 wk CMG cells (205 bp probe).  This is the
same finding for &alpha;-cardiac actin (99 bp).
&alpha;-skeletal actin is present in all CMG cells (treated
or untreated), although expression is clearly enhanced by
treatment.  Northern analysis was done at 0,1,2,4, and 6 weeks
and probes for both actins as well as for GADPH tested.
Both actins clearly increased their expression following
treatment, while GADPH stayed constant throughout.  CMG
cells were found to express MLC-2v, but not MLC-2a.
<p>
Transcription factor expression was studied as well.  RT-PCR/Southerns
of Nkx2.5/Csx, GATA4, and TEF-1 showed all three transcription factors
present in CMG cells, while skeletal muscle controls express only TEF-1.
These factors were also present in differentiate myotubes.
Time course comparisons of expression show these factors present
even before 5-azacytidine treatment.  Probes designed to check for
all alternative splicing forms of MEF-2 (A, B, C, D) were also
used for this factor:  the time course study revealed that MEF-2C is
present before treatment, but that MEF-2A and -2D are induced.
<p>
<b>Methods.</b>
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (GIBCO) and RT-PCR performed
using 1&nbsp;&mu;g RNA in the presence of DNase I at 23&deg; for 15 min.
PCR was 30-35 cycles (95&deg;/30 s, 53-60&deg;/1.5 min, 72&deg;/1 min),
with additional 7 min at 72&deg; at end of last cycle.  After 1st
strand synthesis, primers for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), &alpha;- and &beta;-heavy chain
myosin, &alpha;-skeletal actin, &alpha;-cardiac actin,
myosin light chain-2a and -2v, Nkx2.5/Csx, GATA4, TEF-1, MEF-2A, -2C,
and -2D were used.  Products were size-fractionated with 3% Nu Sieve
agarose gel electrophoresis.  In some cases transfer to nylon (Hybond N)
and UV cross-linking was done;  Southern hybridization was at 42&deg;
for 24 h with end-labeled <sup>32</sup>P internal 25-bp fragment
(this fragment probed for ANP, BNP, Nkx2.5/Csx, GATA4, TEF-1; see text
for coding).  Blots are washed several times, and finally with
2 &times; SSC (0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate) containing
0.1% SDS at 55 &deg;.  Blot is then autoradiographed at &minus;70&deg;.
<p>
Northern blot was used to show &alpha;-skeletal actin and &alpha;-cardiac
actin expression.  20&nbsp;&mu;g RNA is separated on 1% MOPS/formaldehyde-agarose
gel and blotted to nylon (Hybond N).  cDNA species for both actins
are obtained using RT-PCR from mouse heart RNA and cloned into pCR II
plasmid, with sequencing confirmation.  Labeling of inserts was done by
random priming with [<sup>32</sup>P]CTP.  After transfer, hybridization
is performed in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham LifeSci) according to
manufacturer.  Blots were serially washed, with final wash being
55-65&deg; in 0.1 &times; SSC with 0.1% SDS for 30 min.

  Propagation and Senescence of Human Marrow Stromal Cells in Culture:
  A Simple Colony-Forming Assay Identifies Samples with the Greatest
  Potential to Propagate and Differentiate
<p class="Para1">
The source of hMSCs are iliac crest aspirates (20 ml) from human
adults (19-49 y) which are washed in eq vol of HBSS, enriched
on Ficoll-Paque (10 ml layered beneath then spun 2500 <i>g</i> for 30 min),
and grown in &alpha;-MEM + 20% FBS + pen/strep + 2 mM Gln.  Medium
changed within 24 h to remove nonadherents.  Harvest of cells is
done when 70-90% confluent.  Passage 1 cells (from 75 cm<sup>2</sup>)
form a seed lot (frozen in 5% DMSO + 30% FBS).  Cells are plated
at 5000/cm<sup>2</sup> (1:3), and grown to near confluency in
successive passages.
<p>
FACS analysis for CD45 of Passage 2 (revitalized frozen cells)
shows negative;  for Stro-1, all cells were positive, but the cells
that were large in volume and quite granular were strongly positive.
<p>
Population doublings were counted for different donors, and there was
noticeable variation among individuals donors.  Some expanded as little
as 4 and as much as 15 doublings.  There was no relationship between
age or sex of donor and replicative capacity.
<p>
Cells beyond Passage 4 were analyzed by a CFU assay for cultures
with initial plating of 10/cm<sup>2</sup>.  A positive correlation
(<i>r</i> = 0.79, <i>n</i> = 8, <i>P</i> < 0.011) was shown for
plating density and CFU count, although there was no correlation
of duplicates obtained at same time from same donor.  Population
doublings and CFU count were significantly correlated
(<i>r</i> = 0.97, <i>n</i> = 5, <i>P</i> = 0.006).  CFU count
decreased as cells expanded in culture and with increasing passage
number;  passage 12 colony-forming efficiences were very small
compared to passage 4 values, and this was true irrespective of
donor.
<p>
Colony sizes (crystal violet stained diameter of colonies in dishes
as a measure of the counts of cells) showed variation, with the
largest about 2-3 times the size of the smallest.  Larger colonies
were composed of small spindle-shaped cells while smaller ones
held more broad flattened cells and tended to be less confluent.
<p>
  Multipotentiality was assessed in Passage 2 cells plated at low
  density whose colonies had been isolated with cloning rings.
  Duplicates from cells in each colony were grown to near confluency
  and then treated with osteogenic (medium containing 10 nM dexamethasone,
  0.2 mM ascorbic acid, 10 mM &beta;-glycerophosphate) or
  adipogenic medium (containing 0.5&nbsp;&mu;M hydrocortisone,
  0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine [IBMX], 60&nbsp;&mu;M indomethacin).
  All clones from 2-3 week cultures differentiated to a phenotype expected
  from the treatment, although the extent of differentiation varied.
  Alizarin red staining revealed the mineralization of ossified cultures
  with plates almost entirely covered with dye.  Oil Red-O showed
  all cells stained with vacuoles.
<p>
  Late passage cells were also induced which were not isolated from
  colonies, since CFU dropped considerably.  Near confluent cultures
  plated 1:3 showed cells retaining the ability to differentiate to
  osteoblasts with evident mineral deposition.  In fact, some late
  passage hMSCs showed a spontaneous differentiation to
  osteoblastic-like cells.  Adipogenesis however had been lost in
  these late passage cells.
<p>
  <b>Discussion</b>.  hMSCs in primary culture are notable for the
  rapid loss of hematopoietic precursors unlike in murine MSCs, which
  show very low MSC yields.  Two cell types emerge:  type I cells are
  spindle-shaped and grow rapidly, while type II are broader and grow
  slowly.  Type II counts increase with each passage, and appear to
  arise from type I.  CFU counts probably represent clones of single
  MSCs present in primary culture;  these CFU assays probably identify
  type I cells, which also appear to possess greater multipotentiality.
  Findings of heterogeneity in colony size, morphology, and
  differentiation potential supports previous reports.

Cardiac Expression of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> Exchanger
NCX1 is GATA Factor Dependent
<p class="Para1">
The minimum promoter of the rat (&minus;137) and cat (&minus;250)
NCX1 genes are cardiac tissue-specific as shown previously.
Sequence analysis reveals a common GATA element which may account
for cardiac specificity, providing a binding site for GATA-4 transcription
factor.  GATA-4 is known to regulat &alpha;-myosin heavy chain and
BNP.  Two GATA elements are located upstream of the NCX1 transcription
start site, a distal element CAGATAG at &minus;150 in rat and &minus;126 in
cat, and a proximal element CAGATAA at &minus;78 in rat and &minus;51 in cat.
Both of these are about 70-75 nt separated from one another.  An E-box
CATGTG is found at &minus;177 in the rat and &minus;153 in the cat.  There
is &gt;90% sequence identity in the region between the E-box and transcription
start between rat and cat for NCX1, while upstream of the E-box in the
clones of the full-length promoters, the sequence identity is &lt;20%.
<p>
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was used to assess binding of proteins
in nuclear extracts of cardiac myocytes of 1-2 d old neonates.  A 25 nt
ds oligo (from SantaCruz) containing a consensus for all GATA transcription
factors 1-6 was used as probe, as well as a ds oligo probe whose sequence
flanks the GATA elements (at &minus;75 and &minus;145) and the E-box
element (at &minus;175) within the rat NCX1 promoter.  Radiolabeled probes
were used;  unbound probe moves faster than bound probe in the shift
analysis.  The GATA site at &minus;75 was altered to TCGC, and antibodies
to GATA-4, -5, and -6 were used in a supershift with the oligo probes.
With probe alone, no band shifting occurs.  With the addition of nuclear
extract, a shifted (retarded) band is found.  When an unlabeled GATA-4
oligo is added in multifold excess to probe, the amount of shifted band
is reduced, showing competitive binding of nuclear proteins with unlabeled
probe.  When an unlabeled probe in which two bases in the consensus were
changed to reduce GATA binding specificity, the labeled probe shift was
seen again (as for just the probe with extract), showing an absence of
competition with the mutant unlabeled probe.  If anti-GATA-4 antibody is
incubated with probe alone, there no shift.  If nuclear extract is included
with antibody, there is a supershift that is even more retarded, reflecting
the extra mass of the antibody now bound specifically to GATA-4.
Supershifting is not seen with anti-GATA-5 or -GATA-6, indicating either
that they are not present or that they do not bind the labeled probe.
<p>
The same shift analysis is done with an NCX1 oligo as labeled probe instead
of a commercial GATA consensus probe.  This oligo contains a GATA-4 element
at &minus;75.  The supershift is seen with anti-GATA-4 antibody, but not
with GATA-5 and GATA-6.  Other oligos used at probes and corresponding
to NCX promoter positions &minus;145 (distal GATA element) and the E-box
showed less binding efficiency.
<p>
Bases at the &minus;75 position of NCX1 minimum promoter was changed to
TCGC using site-directed mutagenesis, creating plasmid pGL2-137mG1.
pGL2-336mG1 was a plasmid constructed to contain the full-length
and not minimum promoter, also containing the mutant sequence at &minus;75.
pGL2-336mG2 contains full-length promoter with mutation in the distal
GATA site (position &minus;145), and pGL2-336mG1,2 has mutation in
both GATA binding sties.  pGL2-336mE contains mutations in the E-box
at &minus;175.  Each of the 5 plasmids was transfected to primary
neonatal cardiac myocytes, and activities of the promoters compared.
The plasmids are all based on Invitrogen's pGL2 vector for testing
promoter activity;  it contains a luciferase reporter.  Site-directed
mutagenesis can be done using the QuikChange method (Strategene) and
PCR primers (as from Retrogen).  A full length promoter spans from
&minus;366 to the transcription start site (+1).
<p>
Results show that the pGL2-137mG1 had only 5% of the activity of
pGL2-137, in which the latter contains the minimal promoter and the
former contains a mutated promoter.  The promoterless vector (pGL2B)
had no activity.
<p>
The full-length promoter pGL2-336 had an abitrary mean chemiluminescence
value of 3.3, and the mutated proximal GATA element (pGL2-336mG1)
had a value of 1.4, while the mutated distal GATA element (pGL2-336mG2)
had a value of 2.3.  When both were mutated (pGL2-336mG12), the value
was 0.4.  The reduced activities for the mutated proximal GATA element
and both elements being mutated were significantly different from the
full-length promoter.  While the distal GATA element activity was
reduced, this was not significant.
<p>
The activity of the pGL2-336mE construct was nearly identical to the
activity of the unmutated promoter (pGL2-336), showing that the E-box
does not influence the transcription of NCX1.

CD44, CD71, CD90, CD106, CD120a, CD124, among others.  Cells routinely
negative for hematopoietic markers CD14, CD34 and CD45 (LCA).
To distinguish MSCs from marrow fibroblasts, use CD34.
Full details of the cell isolation procedure are at
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/983855.shl">
http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/983855.shl</a>.
<p>
Continuous passages up to passage 12 showed normal telomerase activity
(TRAP-eze, Oncor) and karyotype (farmed out to Nichols Institute),
without differentiation.  hMSCs are cultured with
selected FBS and should have &ldquo;attached well-spread morphology&rdquo;
and a consistent set of markers.  As for marker, FACS analysis
shows enhanced expression of markers to antibodies SH2 and SH3
as they progress from days 2, 5, and 14 in culture.  After 2 weeks
95-99% of cells are homogeneous, negative for CD14, CD34 (Becton-Dickinson),
and CD45 (Pharmingen).
<p>
Differentiation of three kinds was studied.
<p>
<b>Adipogeneis</b>. For adipogenesis, combined
treatment with 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 1&nbsp;&mu;M
dexamethasone, 10&nbsp;&mu;g/ml insulin and 100 mM indomethacin
(indomethacin is described as used here, but not in a patent issue)
in growth medium (DMEM containing 10% selected FBS and pen/strep/amphoB).
It is important to use confluent cells, and it may be necessary to leave
them confluent for a while (from half to a full week).  Cells are then
treated 48 h with induction medium, then  a maintenance medium with
insulin alone is used.  Medium must
be changed every 3-4 d.  Lipid vacuoles appear in 3-7 d, enlarge and
increase in number, at least out to 30 d.  Vacuoles eventually coalesce
to form even larger vesciles, and the cells remain healthy even after
3 months.
<p>
Adipocytes also express peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor
&gamma;2 (PPAR&gamma;2), lipoprotein lipase, and fatty acid-binding
protein aP2.  In the case of aP2, western blotting was used to check
expression of the protein.  For PPAR&gamma;2 and LPL, northern blots
of total RNA were probed with cDNAs to reveal 3300 and 3700 nt products
for LPL, and 1800 nt product for PPAR&gamma;2.
<p>
<b>Chondrogenesis</b>. MSCs were made into a micromass (a centrifugal
pellet) in medium with no serum and containing TGF-&beta;3.  The pellet
is allowed to sit a day so that cells form a mass that will not be
disturbed as a suspension culture.  The micromass
forms a matrix-rich multilayered morphology and there is increased
proteoglycan in the ECM.  A MAb (C4F6) was used to show the presence
of type II collagen after 10-14 d (this collagen type typical in articular
cartilage).  Pellets maintained for a longer time eventually show
chondrocyte-like lacunae and the ECM is rich in aggrecan and type II collagen.
See fig. 3 on this
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/983855.shl">page</a> for
how the micromass changes and stains for cartilage.
<p>
<b>Osteogenesis</b>. Isolated MSCs treated with dexamethasone, &beta;-glycerol
phosphate, and ascorbate formed aggregates/nodules which increased
expression of (bone?) alkaline phosphatase.  Accumulation of calcium
was also observed in the cells.
<p>
An additional experiment was done to test expression in differentiated
cells for particular gene products.  After 2 wk treatment, total RNA
was isolated from cells and RT-PCR performed.  The cDNAs were then probed
for PPAR&gamma;, aP2, type II collagen, type IX collagen, osteopontin,
and alkaline phosphatase.  &beta;2-microglobulin probe served as a control.
A Qiagen kit (DPBS with RLT lysis buffer) was used to isolate total RNA,
the RNA amt then determined by UV spectrophotometer.  1&nbsp;&mu;G RNA was
used in RT-PCR (Moloney MLV RT with random hexamer primers).  PCR
was done for 30 cycles and products separated on 1.5% agarose gel, visualized
with ethidium bromide.  The sequence of primers is given on this
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/983855.shl">page</a>
at fig 5.  These results show that differentiation does not result in
multiple lineages.  Chondrogenic cultures express osteopontin and ALP.
<p>
A control of cultured fibroblasts did not show differentiation when subjected
to these treatments.
<p>
The pluripotentiality of cells was determined using isolated single cells
from Percoll separations.  1.5-6 million cells were plated per 150 mm
dish, and individual adherents taken after 24 h, grown in colonies of
30-100 cells, with colonies isolated using cloning rings.  These clonal
cells then moved using trypsin to 24-well plates, and later expanded in
75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks.  Cells which probably doubled on 19-21 times
from the original marrow cell.  Flow cytometry showed the same markers
as for cells passaged many times.  Six colonies were tested, and all
retained osteogenic potential, five retained adipogenic potential, and
two retained chondrogenic potential (one was weakly positive for
chondrogenesis).
<p>
Among the important factors in obtaining differentiation efficiently:
<ul>
<li>basal nutrients
<li>cell density
<li>spatial organization
<li>mechanical forces
<li>growth factors and cytokines
</ul>

Dystrophin Expression in The <i>mdx</i> Mouse Restored by Stem Cell
Transplantation
<p class="Para1">
9 female <i>mdx</i> mice were lethally irradiated and then either
500,000 or 10-50 million bone marrow cells from normal male C57BL/10
mice injected via tail vein.  After 5 weeks, all hematopoietic cells
were donor-derived and shown by Y chromosome fluorescence in siut
hybridization (Y-FISH).  The tibialis anterior muscle of the female
was also examined immunohistochemically for dystrophin expression
after 5, 8 , and 12 wk.  At 5 wk, &lt;1% of fibers were positive
for dystrophin.  At 8 wk, 1% of fibers make dystrophin in sarcolemmal
location, and 25-63% of dystrophin fibers contained donor-derived nuclei.
After 12 wk 10% of fibers express dystrophin and 10-30% of positive
fibers contain fused Y-chromosome fused nuclei.
<p>
Hematopoietic stem cells were then FACS sorted from the marrow of male
mice using Hoechst 33342.  These HSC represent the side population (SP)
which are Sca-1<sup>+</sup>, c-Kit<sup>+</sup>, CD43<sup>+</sup>,
CD45<sup>+</sup>, linear marker-low or -negative (linear marker is
B220, Mac-1, Gr-1, CD4, CD5, and CD8), and CD34<sup>&minus;</sup>.
This cell can engraft at low (100-500 cells per mouse) numbers.  In
these experiments, 2000-5000 marrow SP male cells were injected by tail
vein into the 9 irradiated <i>mdx</i> females.  At weeks 5, 8, 12  Y-FISH
showed that male donor cells had completely reconstituted the blood.
The tibialis anterior muscle was examined for dystrophin and Y chromosome
nuclei:  at 5 wk &lt;1% of myofibers made dystrophin, increasing to 1%
at 8 weeks (20-40% of these fibers have fused Y chromosome-postive nuclei),
and at 12 weeks 4% of fibers are dystrophin-positive, and 10-30% of these
with donor nuclei.  This pattern for the HSC grafted matches that for
the unsorted marrow graft.
<p>
Y chromosome-bearing cells were found isolated singly as well as in clusters
of fibers.  The location of these nuclei was not really favored centrally
or peripherally within the fibers.  Control IHC and FISH experiments also
reveal that not all Y chromosome nuclei are identified by FISH as well.
In fact the proportion of dystrophin-positive cells that are Y chromosome-bearing
decreases as post-transplantation time increases.
<p>
The property of Hoechst 33342 dye efflux was then used to enrich skeletal
muscle stem cells via a FACS method.  Mononuclear cells from the skeletal
muscle of 3-5 wk old mice were exposed to 12.5 &mu;g/ml H0342, and a side
population was isolated by FACS.  Addition of verapamil (blocks Ca-dependent
efflux) to the muscle SP caused disappearance of the cells (identical with
bone marrow results); main population (MP) cells are not affected.  There were
some differences between muscle and bone marrow SP cells:  the muscle
cells requires a 2.5-fold higher dye concentration and the muscle cells
do not have the c-Kit and CD45 surface markers while bone marrow SP does
(both SP types are Sca-1<sup>+</sup> Lin<sup>&minus;</sup>).  Only 10%
of muscle SP cells are positive for CD43 (leukosialin or Ly-48 or sialophorin,
and is a highly sialyted protein with 115 and 130 kDa isoforms),
whereas this is a marker for bone marrow SP cells.  The muscle MP cells
are Lin<sup>+</sup> (positive for several markers:  CD11, Gr-1,
CD5).  Culture of the MP cells for one week shows them differentiating
into myoblasts (some fibroblasts are revealed by desmin staining).  SP
cells maintained a spherical shape and did not adhere;  2 wks in culture
they finally differentiated into myoblasts and fibroblasts.
<p>
These muscle SP cells there then injected into lethally irradiated <i>mdx</i>
females as for the other cells used.   Dosage studies revealed that at least
10 times the number of muscle SP cells were required than the bone marrow
SP cells to permit recovery of animals.  One mouse that had been injected
with a low dose of 7000 cells appear too weak at day 17, and was killed.
4 other animals were in good health and killed at 28-30 d.  Bone marrow
samples were probed with Y-FISH, and a range of 30-91% of the cells in the
4 animals were positive for the donor nuclei.  Metaphase spreads were
also observed that where Y chromosome-positive, and thus the muscle SP
cells divide <i>in vivo</i>.  Giesma staining of marrow revealed a
distribution of cell types in expected proportions.  Staining of splenic
sections in two animals showed CD43- and CD45-positive cells  (muscle
SP cells are not positive, but HSCs are).  More than 90% of all cells
and of CD43- and CD45-specific cells were positive for Y-FISH, indicating
donor origin.  Hence muscle SP cells can repopulate hematopoietic lines
of cells, although with less potency than bone marrow SP lines.
Results from a competitive repopulation study prove this:  200 bone
marrow SP cells from <i>mdx</i> females and 6000 muscle SP cells
from males were injected into irradiated females, and &lt;1% of cells
were positive by Y-FISH at 4 and 8 weeks.
<p>
The muscles of females engrafted with the muscle SP cells were also
evaluated.  15-30 skeletal muscle sections from the 4 animals showed
donor-derived dystrophin-positive myofibers, with 1 or 2 Y-positive nuclei
fused to fibers in each section.  Localization of the nuclei was a pattern
seen with bone marrow SP cell-grafted animals.
<p>
Note that the genotypes of the <i>mdx</i> females are
C57BL/10ScSn-<i>Dmd<sup>mdx</sup></i> (X-linked muscular dystrophy).

  Plastic Adherent Stromal Cells from the Bone Marrow of Commonly
  Used Strains of Inbred Mice:  Variations in Yield, Growth, and
  Differentiation
<p class="Para1">
Because of differences seen in characteristics of MSCs between
mammalian species, an investigation was undertaken to look at differences
between strains of a single species.  Marrow cells from five different
strains (BALB/c, C57BL/6, DBA/L, FVB/N, 129) were tested for CFU-F
yields of plastic adherent cells:  bone marrow from four individuals
of each strain were pooled and plated to 25 million cells in a
35 mm dish/well and left 72 h, nonadherents removed, then left additional
5 days, after which plates were fixed and stained.  Three plates in
replicate determined a mean CFU-F.  BALB/c produced the most (75.3)
followed by FVB/N (52.7), then DBA/L (37), 129 (12.5), and C57BL/6 (7.7).
BALB/c was significantly different from all other strains, and FVB/N
was different from C57BL/6 and 129.  Note that the CFU-F for BALB/c
corresponds to 3 per 10<sup>6</sup> cells, and other strains are percentage
of that.
<p>
Growth was measured by counting cell numbers on days 6, 11, 15, and 18.
BALB/c had the fastest growth rate (31,300 cells/day), a rate 1.5- and 4-fold
greater than FVB/N and DBA/L, resp. C57BL/6 and marrow explants
grew so slowly that they did not thrive.  Both the total number of
cells at 18 days and the growth rates for BALB/c and FVB/N were
significantly different than the other three strains.
<p>
ALP activity was determined in cell extracts over the time course
in each strain.  FVB/N showed a rapid and steady increase starting
from day 6 to 8, 11, and peaking at day 15 with a 6-fold greater level
than any other cell strain, followed by a decline but still
significant elevation above other strains at day 18.  ALP in DBA/L increases
slightly peaking at day 11 (3.5-fold greater than 3 other strains).
All other strains showed low, steady levels of ALP.  Strains C57BL/6,
129, and FVB/N are used to make transgenics, but only FVB/N can be
counted on to produce MSCs.
<p>
FVB/N was chosen for greater characterization because of its good
growth rates, an ability to upregulate ALP (and potentially differentiate
to osteoblasts), its common use for transgenic mice, and this lab's use
of it to develop transgenic mouse models of osteogenesis imperfecta.
The first experiment was to study CFU-F yield against the time before
nonadherents were removed from primary culture:  the 4, 24, and 72 h
time points (when nonadherents removed) showed CFU-F counts of 26,
33.5, and 59.5 in 35 mm dia plastic wells at day 9, all points
signficantly different.  The nonadherent fraction was also plated
to check yield:  these were CFU-F counts of 4.0, 7.5, and 8.5 at
4, 24, and 72 h, resp.
<p>
Comparisons of the culture substrate were then tried.  25 million nucleated
cells were placed in untreated plastic and produced 88 CFU-F counts.
CFU-F counts for dishes with coatings of type I collagen (59),
type IV collagen (53), laminin (49), fibronectin (67), and
poly-D-lysine (79) were all significantly less than for uncoated plastic.
Total numbers of cells were also counted at the end of 13 days, but
the only surface that yielded significantly less numbers than all others
was the laminin-coated; there were no differences between other surfaces.
ALP expression in cell extracts was also determined in 13 day cultures:
with the exception of poly-D-Lys surface, all surfaces showed no difference
in ALP activity (between near zero to 350 nmol/min/mg protein);
the poly-D-Lys surface had nearly 16-fold greater expression that
the average value of the others.  The basic conclusions are that
standard TC plastic is best for isolation and growth of MSCs, and that
poly-D-Lys coatings promote osteogenesis.
<p>
3-4 days after a relative quiescent period since plating, FVB/N marrow
cells begin characteristic proliferation.  Cell numbers peak in the start
of the 2nd week at 16-fold greater, then decline to a constant level
which is 75% of maximal.  ALP expression began to rise to detectable
levels by day 12, peaked at the 18th day (coincident with the cell number
peak), declined to the 24th day, then rose precipitously on the 28th
day to levels 6-fold greater than the 18th day maximum, then began to fall
again.  A plate was also stained histochemically for ALP to see that
fibroblastoid cells within focal growth areas were the source of this
activity.
<p>
11-day cultures were visualized with immunofluorescence for CD11b:
results show that these MSCs were positive.  Moreover, immunofluorescence
indicated CD45 positivity as well, both findings indicating a large
presence (80% of all cells) with lymphohematopoietic precursors.
This remains true after several weeks of subculture.  A fluorescent
antibody to a marker present in broad endothelial cell types also
indicates endothelial presence.  MSCs with the fibroblastoid appearance
do not react.  They do show the presence of type I collagen and vimentin
however.  Other mouse strains (BALB/c and DBA/L) also show these
heterogeneous cultures.  Colony-forming assays for hematological progenitors
were performed by taking 10-day plastic adherent FVB/N cells (1st passage),
performing a passage at 1:3 for an additional 10 days (2nd passage),
and plating at different cell densities in IL-7-supplemented
methyl cellulose (Methocult 0.9%) media.The colonies forming is
correlated directly with the number of adherent cells in both passages
(1st: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.98; 2nd: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.74).
Fluorescent antibody to murine Ig confirms a B cell lineage in the
cells of these colonies (counterstaining with ethidium bromide).
The number of granulocytes (CFU-G) and monocytes (CFU-M) and combined
(CFU-GM) also correlated with plating density to Methocult media
supplemented with murine spleen cell-conditioned medium in which spleen
cells had been activated with pokeweed mitogen (stained by periodic
acid Schiff and counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin).
Note that no colonies of any type formed in methyl cellulose media
not supplemented with cytokines or conditioned media.
<p>
Multipotentiality was investigated.  7-day adherents were treated
with substance to induce osteogenesis, and high ALP activity and
mineralization (calcium deposited in extracellular matrix) revealed
by Alizarin Red S was observed.  RT-PCR indicated expression of
osteopontin, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein.  PTH receptor
expression, modulated by vitamin D, remained constant.  Adipogenesis
was observed as lipid vacuoles through constant stimulation by 10 nM
dexamethasone for 2 weeks.  Treatment with the PPAR&gamma;2 agonist
5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid rapidly induces multi-ocular lipoblasts
similar to the long-term dexamethasone application.
Amphotericin B exposure (1.5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml for 2 weeks then withdraw
and wait 1 week) induces multinucleated fiber network in which
the fibers rhythmically contract when exposed to heat:  these
appear myotube-like.
<p>
FVB/N cultures were treated with 2.5 ng/ml bFGF and 10 ng/ml IGF-I,
the major effect being a dramatic inhibition of ALP expression.
Nonetheless, MSCs respond to osteogenic induction with an increase
in ALP activity once growth factors are removed.  Treatment with
PDGF-&beta;&beta; at 5&nbsp;ng/ml stimulates proliferation 2-fold
(bFGF and IGF-I had a modest effect);  at 1 ng/ml there is no
effect, and at 10 ng/ml the effect is slight.  EGF at 5&nbsp;ng/ml
also increases cell number by 2-fold.  In the 2.5-20 ng/ml range
bFGF was without effect.  A concomitant decrease in ALP activity
was seen with PDGF-&beta;&beta; treatment.  bFGF had the same effect.
In contrast EGF appeared to stimulate ALP expression.

Modification of Expression of Stem Cell Factor by Various Cytokines
<p class="Para1">
cDNA libraries were obtained from poly(A)+ RNA of BALB/3T3A31,
MC3T3-E1, and C3H-2K cells using reverse transcriptase.  Forward
and reverse primers for PCR were prepared for mouse stem cell
factor (M59915, MusSCF), the c-Kit ligand; mouse basic fibroblast
growth factor receptor (bFGFR), mouse TGF&beta; type I receptor
(TBR1), mouse LIF receptor (LIFR), mouse IL-3 receptor alpha
subunit (IL-3R), mouse IL-4 receptor (IL-4R).  Agarose gel electrophoresis
shows that with the exception of IL-3R, all other five transcripts
could be amplified from all cell lines.  IL-3R was not amplified
in BALB/3T3A31 cells but could be amplified in the other cell lines.
<p>
Each set of primers were designed so that amplified products woudl have
different size.  Restriction analysis provided confirmation.  The SCF
transcript was digested with EcoRI, and other transcripts divided
in two with BglII, BamHI, and EcoRI (see table).  The ability to
produce expected digestion products confirms the expression as indicated
above.
<p>
The SCF oligo DNA probe was characterized for its specificity and sensitivity
using dot-blot and Northern analysis prior to in situ hybridization.
SCF anti-sense probe was found quite specific with useful sensitivity.
(SCF probe is T-T dimerized and then given log dilutions and added
to membranes dot-blotted with sense oligo.  Illumination is with
HRP-conjugated anti-T-T dimer mouse MAb, followed by DAB and hydrogen
peroxide with nickel and cobalt ions.)
<p>
All three cell lines were grown on glass slides for 3 days to form
a monolayer.  In situ hybridization was done for SCF, and BALB/3T3A31 cells
stained strongly in cytoplasm with no nuclear staining.  The cytoplasm
of MC3T3-E1 were mildly stained, and C3H-2K cells showed no staining.
Cells were treated with bFGF, TGF&beta;-1, LIF, or IL-4 for 24 h,
and there was an increase in SCF transcription.  No effect was seen for
IL-3.  Morphological changes were seen in MC3TC-E1 cells treated with
bFGF and TGF&beta;-1, changing from polygonal to spindle-shaped,
as well as with the dramatic increase in SCF transcription.  Small
increases in SCF mRNA were seen with IL-4 and LIF treatment, and IL-3
had no effect.  No signal was seen for SCF mRNA in C3H-2K cells
with these cytokines, but a detectable signal was seen in other
cytokins:  bFGF, TGF&beta;-1, and LIF.  bFGF caused C3H-2K cells
to become spindle-shaped.  Use of a sense probe (as control) gave
negative staining.
<p>
Staining was quantitated using image pixel signal analysis.  This
quantitation indicated a high level of SCF mRNA even in untreated
BALB/3T3A31 cells, with relative higher expression in treated cells,
with 2.4-2.8-fold increases with bFGF, TGF&beta;-1, and IL-4.
LIF marginally elevated SCF (1.5-fold) and IL-3 had no effect.
A 14-fold increase in SCF transcription was seen in MC3T3-E1 with
bFGF and TGF&beta;-1; with LIF, 3.5-fold, and with IL-4, 5.5-fold;
with IL-3, no effect.  In CH3-2K, no signals were measured in untreated
cells, whereas bFGF induced an 87-fold increased;  signif. enhancement
was seen also with TGF&beta;-1 and LIF.
<p>
SCF protein (translation of mRNA) was tested using dot-blot ELISA
in cell lysates.  Single cell determinations were made since MC3T3-E1
cell proliferation was stimulated by bFGF but suppressed by TGF&beta;-1.
MC3T3-E1 show an increase in SCF to bFGF in 24 h from 0.1 ng/ml to
10 ng/ml.  TGF&beta;-1 causes a greater increase per cell, at 1 and
10 ng/ml, despite suppressed proliferation.
<p>
bFGF and TGF&beta;-1 at 1 ng/ml induced in BALB/3T3A31 cells a moderate
elevation in SCF protein.  This cell type also shows the same level
of protein in unstimulated MC3T3-E1 cells.  C3H-2K cells express
only 16% of what unstimulated MC3T3-E1 cells show, but then dramatically
increase when treated with these two factors.
<p>
Bone marrow stromal cells were also tested with dot-blot ELISA.
Unstimulated cells produce twice the level of SCF as untreated MC3T3-E1
cells.  Treatment with high and low levels of bFGF had no effect on
this expression, although a low concentration of 0.1 ng/ml stimulated
proliferation.  TGF&beta;-1 however markedly suppresses proliferation
in a dose-dependent fashion, and it induces increases of 1.4-, 2.0-,
and 5.2-fold when these cells are treated with 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml
for 24 h, resp.
<p>
Hence while TGF&beta;-1 appears to suppress proliferation in many of these
cell line, it markedly stimulates SCF production.  bFGF is a potent
modulator, but does not affect cells in this way.

  Marrow Stromal Cells Migrate Throughout Forebrain and Cerebellum,
  And They Differentiate Into Astrocytes After Injection Into
  Neonatal Mouse Brains
<p class="Para1">
An immunodepletion technique was used to purify mouse bone marrow cells
such that it was MSC.  From previous work, it had been shown
that MSCs are contaminated with CD11b-expressing cells which are
myelopoietic.  Hence an immunodepletion technique was used to
remove CD11b-negative cells:  biotinylated anti-CD11b antibody
bound to avidin-coated paramagnetic beads (50&nbsp;&mu;g/ml
beads, with 10&nbsp;&mu;g antibody to 1&nbsp;mg beads) are incubated with cells
for 60 min at 4&deg;, and unbound cells are removed, washed and
resuspended in PBS.  Cells can be shown to be free of CD11b
(try FITC-conjugated anti-CD11b and use a DAPI counterstain)
as well as CD45.  Additional confirmation was by flow cytometry.
<p>
Differentiation tests were performed on immunodepleted cells
to confirm their multipotentiality.  Cells were cultured in micromass
(200,000 cells were formed into a micromass and treated 3 weeks
with TGF-&beta;1, then another 3 weeks in hypertrophic media).
After fixing in PBS-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, these masses were
embedded in glycol methacrylate (Technovit 8100), then sectioned (1.5&nbsp;&mu;m)
and stained with toluidine blue, which reveals glycosaminoglycans typical
in cartilage.  The masses contained chondrocytic-looking cells within
lacunae and a pericellular matrix.  Type I and II collagens were shown
by immunohistochemistry.  The micromass also revealed ossification
by Alizarin Red S staining.  5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic acid is
an agonist of peroxisome proliferator activating receptor-&gamma;:
cells treated with this differentiated into adipocytes.  Cells take on
a round shape and accumulate large cytoplasmic vacuoles which stain
with Oil Red O.
<p>
Approx. 50,000 cells were labeled with bis-benzimide (Hoechst 33342)
and injected into the lateral ventricle of neonatal mice.  In 17 of 18
animals, fluorescent microscopy of cryostat sections showed presence
of labeled cells at 12 or 45 days after injection.  Some labeled cells
were found at different distances from the injection site.  In more
than 40 such procedures done, only 2 mice died (probably due to prolonged
exposure to anesthesia).
<p>
Brains were examined after 12 days postinjection with cells labeled
with BrdU.  The distribution was identical in the three animals studied.
Throughout the striatum in the forebrain ipsilateral to the injection,
labeled cells were present in the anterior commissure to the cingulate
cortex.  Cells were found in white matter tracts, including corpus
callosum and external capsule; the pattern in the forebrain especially
suggested migration.
<p>
Some tissues were visualized for BrdU and GFAP, and some MSCs within
the corpus striatum, molecular layer of hippocampus, and cerebellum
had differentiated into astrocytes (macroglia).  There was no positive
staining for neurofilament.

Gene Therapy:  Adenovirus-Mediate Human Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2
Gene Transfer Induces Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell Proliferation and
Differentiation <i>In Vitro</i> and Bone Formation <i>In Vivo</i>.
<p class="Para1">
BMP-12 is a recently cloned new member of the BMP family with homology
to mouse GDF-7, belonging to new subgroup of TGF-&beta; superfamily.
BMP-12 in vitro inhibits terminal differentiation of myoblasts;  it
does not, like BMP-2, induce myoblasts to become osteoblasts.
In vivo, BMP-12 implants induce tendon and ligament formation (but
not bone).  C3H 10T1/2 is a mouse cell line of pluripotential mesenchymal
stem cells (will differentiate to myoblast, adipocytes, chondrocyte,
osteoblasts).
<p>
Recombinant adenovirus Adv-BMP-12 was made previously by linearizing a
BMP-12-containing gene in vector pAC-CMV-BMP-12, and co-transfecting with
the <i>Cla</i>I fragment of Ad5 wildtype genome using LipofectAMINE into
293 cells.  Recombinant plaques were selected after 10 d at 37&deg;
from agarose overlay.  A lacZ gene control virus (Adv-&beta;gal) was
also constructed.
<p>
BMP-12 under control of CMV promoter was obtained in a recombinant adenovirus
from 293 cells with a titer of 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml.  A monoclonal
to BMP-12 (F2B12/15.4.15) was available for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting.
C3H 10T1/2 cells were transduced at MOI=50,

The MADS Domain Containing Transcription Factor <i>cMef2a</i> is
Expressed in Heart and Skeletal Muscle During Embryonic Chick Development
<p class="Para1">
A 2328 nt long cDNA was isolated from a E5 chick embryo heart library
using a human RSRFC4 probe; the cDNA encodes a 499 amino acid protein.
The deduced protein sequence was compared with mouse and human
<i>Mef2a</i> and was 100% identical within the MADS and MEF2 domains,
85% outside them.  The total RNA from embyronic and adult chicken organs
was blotted for Northern analysis:  expression was greatest in heart
and skeletal muscle, but also found in gut, lung, and brain of E15
and adults.
<p>
Whole mounts and sections of embryos between HH stages
8-20 were probed by in situ hybridization.  Detection in
HH stage 8 embryos was found in two lateral domains, presumably pre-cardiac
regions.  This persisted through development of the heart tube.
Expression was limited to mesoderm and later to atrial and ventricular
myocardium.  The vitelline vein, which participates in formation
of atrium and sinus venosus, provides venous return from the yolk sac
and showed strong <i>cMEF2a</i> expression.  Note that <i>Mef2a</i>
expression in mouse starts in the linear heart tube after earlier
expression of <i>Mef2c</i> precardiac mesoderm (Edmondson et al. 1994).
<p>
<i>cMef2a</i> expression in chick also arises at HH stage 13 in the somites
in a cranial to caudal gradient.  This expression was limited to more
mature somites, and typically in the myotome.  Earlier muscle-specific
transcription factors <i>MyoD</i> and <i>myogenin</i> preceded <i>cMef2a</i>
in expression, and this suggests that activation of <i>cMef2a</i>
is regulated by these myogenic bHLH factors.

Generalized LacZ Expression with The ROSA26 Cre Reporter Strain
<p class="Para1">
Transgenic mice strains exist that express the recombinase Cre, which
can be used to remove gene function by directed placement of flanked
<i>loxP</i> sites (another useful homologous recombination system
is Flp/<i>FRT</i>).  Cre can be placed under the control of specific
(cell-, tissue-specific) promoters or might be constitutive.  An
assay must be used to verify that Cre is expressed when desired.
Akagi et al. (1997) and Tsien et al. (1996) have produced transgenics
and O'Gorman et al (1997) a knock-in line that feature a lacZ reporter
that is only expressed when an 5'-intervening segment flanked by
<i>loxP</i> is removed.
<p>
Soriano and co-workers have produced a mouse strain, ROSA &beta;geo 26,
with constitutive expression of a &beta;geo reporter during embryonic
development.  Here we report that the ROSA26 locus was targeted to
Cre dependence by subcloning of a 5 kb genomic fragment into an
into plasmid vector containing a diphtheria toxin antigen (DTA)
expression cassette;  the new vector is pROSA26-1.  A sequence
was produced to place in 5'&rarr;3' order:  a splice acceptor sequence,
<i>loxP</i> sequence, a neomycin expression cassette (PGK promoter,
neomycin, and polyadenylation signal), <i>loxP</i>, the <i>lacZ</i>
reporter, and a triple polyadenylation sequence to ensure no transcription
beyond.  This was inserted into an unique <i>Xba</i>I site about 300 bp
5' to the gene-trap integration site and DTA cassette, to produce pROSA26-R.
This was linearized with <i>Kpn</i>I and electroporated into AK7
embryonic stem cells.  G418 selection was used to produce 23 colonies,
8 of which were found to have undergone homologous recombination
(shown by PCR, confirmed by Southern analysis).  Three of these were
used to make germline chimaeras.  Heterozygous mice did not show the
phenotype, but homozygotes could be bred that were fertile and viable.
R26R crossed with R26Cre mice;  R26Cre is a deletor line which targets
Cre to the ROSA26 locus.  E8 and E16 embryos were stained with X-Gal
and heterozygotes for R26Cre and R26R stain blue in every tissue.
Wild-type and R26R heterozygotes show no staining.  This establishes
the reporter line.
<p>
ROSA26 is a promoter whose genes under its control become activated
during embryonic development.  When recombination occurs preimplantation
the promoter should be activated, and LacZ should be expressed.
R26R mice were also crossed with other Cre strains, but the pattern
of expression of LacZ was more limited or different in pattern.

Marrow Transplantation and Targeted Gene Therapy to the Skeleton
<p class="Para1">
<b>Review</b>.  Conventional therapies for treating skeletal disorders
and combating tumors metastasizing to the bone are beset by significant
limitations.  Treatment with growth factors, steriods, and chemotherapeutics
is affected by short biological half lives and the ability to target
these agents directly at the diseased tissues.
<p>
Osteocalcin is a gene specific to osteoblasts, and is active in bone formation
during development and in adults during bone remodeling.  Its promoter
has been used to target expression of thymidine kinase directly into
osteosarcoma or host systemically treated with acyclovir.  Different
transgenic animals prove its expression is restricted to changes in the
skeleton.  Under control of osteocalcin promoter, TGF-&beta; receptor
expression caused decrease bone remodeling in transgenic mice;  TGF-&beta;2
receptor expression caused osteoporosis-like phenotype; calciton-related
peptide resulted in increased bone density; growth hormone resulted
in increased bone growth.
<p>
A look at the structure of the rat osteocalcin promoter is necessary.  In
the proximal region (0 to -200 bp) is an OsteoCalcin (OC) Box,
highly conserved among the species.  It is involved in suppression
and activation through binding of Dlx-5 and Msx-2 (homeodomain)
proteins, and OCBP-1, an osteoblast-specific DNA-binding protein.
This one element provides tissue-specific regulation, and is
required for transcription.  In the distal (-400 to -600 bp) region
is a Vitamin D response element (VDRE) which functions as an enhancer.
A glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in the far distal region (5' to
-600 bp) serves as suppressor or activator, depending on the stage
of osteoblast maturation.  AP-1 supports suppression through the
TGF-&beta; response element (TGRE), but alternatively it supports
enhancer activity through the VDRE.  A YY1-binding motif overlaps
with the VDRE, and YY1 competes with VDR/RXR (VDRE-binding protein)
in its enhancement function.  Note that a positioned nucleosome promotes
interaction with VDRE and TATA/TFIIB factors in the proximal region.
<p>
An OC-CAT reporter (OC=osteocalcin) was tested in various bone marrow
cell types prepared from transgenic mice, and activity was not found
in undifferentiated marrow mesenchymal cells, and only in osteoblasts.

Smooth Muscle Cell Outgrowth Stimulated by Fibrin Degradation Products:
The Potential Role of Fibrin Fragment E in Restenosis and Atherogenesis
<p class="Para1">
Linjen et al. have shown that plasminogen and urokinase-type plasminogen
activator are essential for smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and
neointima formation.  Restenosis may be influenced by factors in an
evolving blood clot, platelets, thrombin, fibrin, plasmin, and FDPs.
The model for restenosis is an early proliferative atherosclerotic lesion
of gelatinous type.  FDPs will stimulate cell proliferation in the chick
chorioallantoic membrane.
<p>
<b>Preparation of FDP</b>.  Kabi human fibrinogen (from Kabivitrum, now
Chromogenix) was used initially, then purified human fibrinogen from
a transfusion service.  6.3 NIH units of human thrombin (Sigma) is added
to 3 ml fibrinogen (16.8&nbsp;mg/ml) and incubated overnight at 37&deg;.
Clots were homogenized for 10 sec and spun at 600 &times; <i>g</i> 10 min.
The pellet was washed 3 &times; with saline to remove clotting factors
and any low M<sub>r</sub> fibrinopeptides.  The clot was resuspended in
calcium-containing TBS (10 mM Tris pH 7, 0.1 M NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>)
(5 ml) and 2 casein units of porcine plasmin (Sigma) added.  This was
incubated on a rotary shaker 37&deg; for 48 h.  Sample was then sterilized
with a 0.2&nbsp;&mu;m filter.  Rocket immunoelectrophoresis using antifibrinogen
antiserum (DAKO) provided concentration measurements relative to a
fibrinogen standard.  PAGE-immunoblotting shows fragment E (35-40 kDa)
as well as other FDP (see Thompson et al, J Pathol 168:47, 1992).
Commercial preps of fragment D and E came from Diagnostica Stago,
and fragment E treated with thrombin, as well as thrombin-only controls;
thrombin cleaves fragment E as well as the E domain of fibrinogen and
does not attack fragment D.
<p>
Aortic explants 1 mm<sup>3</sup> in volume were cultured in round-bottomed
wells of a 96-well plate.  The explant was of the scrapings of the medial
wall from the adventitia subsequent to removal of the endothelium.
Treatments are then applied and outgrowth is observed on a daily basis,
then scored.  Results show that FDP increased SMC outgrowth.  Over
7 days about 50% of controls showed outgrowth while 80% of explants treated
with 1:40 and 1:60 titers of FDP were counted as outgrowth.  Greater
concentrations of FDP depressed growth.  There was a 2-4 day lag phase
before any outgrowth is observed, although FDP-treated explants show
outgrowth a day earlier.  Outgrowth had the typical &ldquo;hills and
valleys&rdquo; appearance of SMC, and stained positively with anti-SMC-specific
actin.  20% FBS was essential as an inclusion, and rabbits older than
the 3 kg stage showed slow to nonexistent outgrowth.  The total number
of outgrowing SMC could be counted within the first 5&nbsp;days, but was nearly
impossible after that.
<p>
By day 10 the growth distance in treated explants was approx. double
that of controls (8 days of growth if it begins on day 2).  The maximum
increase difference was 333% of controls (which happens earlier on day 7).
Maximal effect was seen with 92 and 138&nbsp;&mu;g fibrin-related antigens
(1:40 and 1:60 dilutions).  The growth stimulation followed a bell curve,
with lower giving less outgrowth, and higher inhibiting growth.
<p>
Batch-to-batch variability seen in these studies is attributable to
difficulties in controlling fibrin digestion when clot densities are
different, as well as differences in clot disperal during homogenization
before washing.
<p>
Rat antihuman fibrin fragment E antibodies were incubated in one
treatment and found to suppress growth stimulated by FDP.  ANOVA
of the growth curves and distance data reveals the signficant differences
between anti-fragment E with FDPs present, but not with anti-fragment E
and controls, suggesting neutralization.  Treatment with antibody
alone was without any effect on explant outgrowth.  Commercial
anti-fragment D had no effect on SMC outgrowth.
<p>
Commercially obtained fragments D and E (which are produced by plasmin
digestion omitting first the clotting with thrombin) were applied
over a wide range and did not stimulate SMC outgrowth.  At the highest
concentrations, fragment D inhibited outgrowth (500 and 1000 ng/ml).
Fragment E treated with thrombin to produce small fibrinopeptides A and
B.  The digest was found to stimulate outgrowth.  A thrombin control
was found to be without effect.  High concentrations of the thrombin-treated
E fibrinogen (&ge;500 ng/ml) were inhibitory.

Rapid Expansion of Recycling Stem Cells in Cultures of Plastic-Adherent
Cells From Human Bone Marrow
<p class="Para1">
hMSCs were prepared in the same manner as
<a href="#digirolamo1999">DiGirolamo et al</a>.  Plated at low density
hMSCs form into colonies derived from single cells.The colony-forming
efficiency (# colonies / 100 cells plated) did not vary according
to initial plating density from 0.5 to 12 cell/cm<sup>2</sup>.
Colony size (diameter of crystal violet-stained colonies in dishes)
decreases markedly with higher plating densities.  Colony size
was maximal with plating densities of 1.5-3.0 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>
with MSCs from frozen stocks.The size of colony did not depend
on the frequency of changing the medium (tested from every day to
a period as long as 10 d).  Cell yields in each colony decreased
with colony size.  Cultures plated at 1.5-3.0/cm<sup>2</sup> expand
2000-fold over 10 d, while at 12/cm<sup>2</sup> they expand only 60-fold.
<p>
Low density-plated cultures demonstrate growth typical of three phases
with a lag, log and stationary phase.  Log phase could see two doublings
in 24 h (12 h cycle).  Cells plated at 6.0/cm<sup>2</sup> show more
rapid growth on day 6, while those at 1.5/cm<sup>2</sup> show it at
day 8.  Cells plated at 12/cm<sup>2</sup> show division cycles of
&gt; 24 h.
<p>
Stationary phase (confluent?) cultures were checked for
cell size and granularity using FACS forward and side scattering, resp.
Most cells were large and moderately granular, but a subset
were small and agranular.  Propidium iodide staining reveals 98%
of cells in both sets are viable.  Cells were stained with
<i>K</i><sub>i</sub>-67 antigen, specific for indicating active
cell cycling, and the small, agranular cells were negative while the
larger cells were positive.  These findings were the same with
cultures plated 12/cm<sup>2</sup> and examined at 5&nbsp;d.  However,
for cells plated at 1.5-3.0/cm<sup>2</sup> and checked at 5&nbsp;d, about
13% of cells were small and agranular (designated RS-1), and a new
set of cells (designated RS-2) both small and granular were found,
about 30% of total cells.  RS-2 cells were
<i>K</i><sub>i</sub>-67-positive, and they appear first in the lag
period and expand in that phase.  During log phase, RS-2 counts
decrease as the larger, somewhat granular mature MSCs (mMSCs)
quickly proliferate.  In late log, RS-2 cells disappear and RS-1
cells expand.
<p>
There was a strong correlation between the number of cells belonging
to the RS subsets and CFU values (<i>r</i> = 0.97, <i>P</i> = 0.001).
Regression analysis reveals that each RS cell formed a colony with
an average efficiency of 82%.  Within cultures from same donor,
the efficiency correlated with number of RS cells.Day 5&nbsp;cultures
having 48 total RS cells per 100 also showed CFU of 42%.  For day 12
cultures, 12 RS cells per 100 were counted and had a CFU of 12%.
Most RS cells on day 5&nbsp;were RS-2 while those on day 12 were RS-1, and
so both cells generate single-cell derived colonies.
<p>
Cells were negative for CD34, CD11b, CD43, and CD45.  Less than 10% of
cells (all three types) were weakly positive for CD31 and for CD38
(a marker for B and T lymphocytes, some thymocytes, NK cells, and
macrophages).  Mature MSCs (as defined here) were weakly positive
for CD117 (c-Kit), but RS-1 and -2 were negative.  mMSCs were moderately
positive for Stro-1 (marker for osteogenic MSCs) while RS-1 and -2
were negative.  RS-1 cells were weakly positive for CD90 (Thy-1,
marker for thymocytes and peripheral T lymphocytes), RS-2 cells
were negative, and mMSCs were clearly positive.
<p>
Repeated passaging at low denisties was determined.  Cells from
one large colony in cultures plated at low density were isolated with a
cloning ring, and only cells from the largest colony isolated by this
way were replated.  At least 50 doublings were possible.  MSCs passed
at high density showed stopped growth within 15 doublings.  In another
experiment, cells from throughout the culture were replated at low
(3.0/cm<sup>2</sup>) density with each passage.  Expansions were
150- to 2000-fold over the 14 d between passages.  Checking 4 samples
from 2 donors, the total expansion was 600- to 2 billion-fold over
3 passages in 6 weeks.
<p>
Studies are being done to see what factors affect low expansion
and low CFU with high density plating (contact inhibition or secretion
of factors in medium at high density?).

Effect of Maturation on the Osteogenic Response of Cultured
Stromal Bone Marrow Cells to Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor
<p class="Para1">
Cells were taken from the marrows of 6-week (YG, young and growing)
and 9-month old (AD, adult) rats and cultured for 7 days to observe
emerging colonies and the effect of growth factors.  Cells were also
treated with either 10 nM or 100 nM dexamethasone.  YG cells not treated
with anything express 250% more counts that untreated AD cells.
bFGF at 3 ng/ml without Dex presence does not affect YG counts, but there is an
80% increase in AD counts.  10 nM and 100 nM Dex alone reduces counts
of YG cultures by 74% and 85%, resp., also reducing AD counts by 30%
and 77%, resp.  bFGF at 3 ng/ml in presence of 10 nM Dex increased
counts in YG and AD cultures by 228% and 180%, resp, compared to 10 nM
Dex alone.  bFGF compensates for the reduction in cell counts caused by
Dex in the AD cultures, but not for YG cultures.  In 100 nM Dex, bFGF
increases YG counts by 215% but does not affect AD counts.
<p>
YG cultures generally express 4-40 times more mineralized bone tissue (MBT)
than AD cultures.  Passage 1 cell treated with 100 nM Dex are inhibited
from expressing MBT, no matter what [Dex] passage 0 cultures were treated
with.  The highest MBT formation is seen in YG treated with 10 nM Dex at
passage 1 and 100 nM Dex at passage 0.  10 nM Dex was best for p0 and p1
cells in AD cultures.
<p>
bFGF was added either at p0 or p1, or present at both p0 and p1.
MBT was increased in p0 YG and AD cultures treated with bFGF alone.
The amount of MBT formation was always less in AD than YG cultures,
except for p0 and p1 AD cultures containing 10 nM Dex.  AD cultures
treated with 100 nM Dex would not form MBT unless also treated with bFGF.
In p0 and p1 AD cultures where bFGF was present and treated with 10 nM Dex,
MBT was increased by 5-fold.  bFGF also stimulated MBT formation in YG
cultures at p0 and p1 from 1.6- to 5-fold, no matter the variables of
passage and Dex.  In general addition of bFGF at p1 (only) substantially
increases MBT in YG and AD cultures and was better at these enhancement
than when used at p0, no matter [Dex] modalities.  For YG cultures,
the greatest MBT formation is with 100 nM Dex at p0 and 10 nM Dex +
bFGF at p1.  bFGF added at p0 and present in p1 was better than bFGF
at p1 only (except for YG cultures treated with 100 nM Dex at p0).
10 nM Dex + bFGF at p0 and 10 nM or 100 nM Dex + bFGF at p1 gave
the greatest amount of MBT in AD cultures;  the amount of formed MBT
was comparable to that produced in YG cultures treated in the same way,
and with YG cultures treated optimally.
<p>
With optimal conditions for MBT known for YG and AD cultures, the effect
of bFGF on cell proliferation and osteogenic marker expression in p1
cultures was determined.  p0 cultures were treated with optimal Dex
and bFGF, and then p1 grown in optimal Dex +/- bFGF.  [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine
incorporation, protein content, ALP activity, and calcium deposition
were evaluated.  In cultures without bFGF, YG and AD cultures were
similar for these parameters.  cAMP response to PTH was 20 times
lower in AD compared to YG cultures.  bFGF stimulated proliferation
roughly equally:  2.9-fold in YG, and 2.2-fold in AD cultures;  the maximal
effect was seen with 3 ng/ml.  Total protein was increased 40% and
80% in bFGF-treated YG and AD cultures, resp., compared to untreated
controls.  ALP activity was raised 3.5 and 2 times, resp.
<sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> deposition rate was 3 and 4 times higher
in bFGF-treated YG and AD cultures.  bFGF increased cAMP response only
slightly in YG and AD cultures.
<p>
Extracts of stromal bone marrow cells at p1 from 7-day old YG
were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-glucocorticoid receptor
antibodies.  When bFGF was added to Dex-treated cultures, there was
an increase in glucocorticoid receptor expression by 2.3-fold.

Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Engraft and Demonstrate Site-Specific Differentiation

<p class="Para1">
Human iliac bone marrow stromal cells were obtained as 10 ml aspirate
and put in 20 ml DMEM with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and spun to remove fat.
Spun on 70% Ficoll density at 13,000 <i>g</i> for 20 min, then plated to
10 million cells per 60 mm<sup>2</sup> dish.  Allowed to reach near confluence
then detached on trypsin/EDTA and suspended in 5 million cells/ml in 5% DMSO
in medium and frozen in liq nitrogen.  Cells were injected into sheep fetuses
at different gestational age in sheep that were laparotimized and hysterotimized
to expose fetuses;  cells injected directly into fetuses peritoneal cavity.
Animal sacrifices were done at 2 weeks or 2, 5 and 13 months after injection
and tissues for DNA isolation for PCR and immunohistochem taken from liver,
spleen, lung, bone marrow, thymus, brain, heart, sk musc, cartilage and blood.
Immunohistochem only done on positive;  negative tissue by PRC were done with

were studied:  4-5 &micro;m sections were put on Superfrost Plus slides
from paraffin-embedded blocks, placed at 55&deg; for 16 h, deparaffinated
in xylene, rehydrated in graded EtOH to water, immersed in 1% Antigen
Unmasking Solution (Vector Labs) for enhanced retrieval and microwaved 3 min.
Blocking is done in non-immune serum from primary antibody species (1:10)
for 30 min, then incubated in primary for 16 h (the dilutions varied with
antibody used, but were generally 1:20, 1:50 to 1:100).  After washing PBS,
slides then washed 30 min in MeOH with 0.6% peroxide, then washing then 1:200
biotinylated secondary then illuminiated on DAB after washing.  Hematoxylin
counterstaining done after, except if double-staining was done.  Sk musc sections
were treated differently (read article for details).  In situ hybridization
(ISH) was also done using fluorophore-conjugated human <i>Alu</i> probes
(Innogenex).
<p>
Human MSCs were injected into 65 and 85-d old sheep fetuses to the level of
5-20 million cells per fetus (100-200 million cells/kg fetal weight).  Gestation
is normally 145 d, and at 75 d, the fetus probably undergoes the phase where
immune tolerance is determined, so the 65 and 85 d treatment evaluates whether
this is true.  At 65 d hematopoiesis largely in fetal liver, but by 85 d
the marrow is developed and hematopoietic.
<p>
A total of 12 65-day fetus and 16 of 17 85-day fetuses showed evidence of
human cell engraftment, with human-specific sequences in 28 of 29 sheep.
These were found in multiple tissues although distribution varied in individuals.
Nearly all tissues showed human cells at 2 weeks postengraftment.  Cells were
not characterized with respect to population doubling ability, which would say
if they could be sustained with proliferative capacity.
<p>
Absence of immune response at 85 d engraftment indicates one of three things:
failure of immune recognition, local immune suppression, or thymic clonal
deletion.  Human MSCs have class I human LCA but no class II antigens necessary
for immune recognition.  MSCs in mixed lymphocytes nonspecifically ablate
alloreactivity by unknown mechanism.  Thymic clonal deletion of tolerance
when foreign antigen is presented after mature T cell repertoire is unlikely,
and so a combination of minimal immuogenicity or local immune suppression may
be involved.
<p>
Immunohistochem showed human cells present in hematopoietic and lymphopoietic
tissues 5 and 13 months postnatally (spleen, thymus, marrow, fetal liver).
Adipose tissue, lung, articular cartilage, perivascular tissue in CNS, and
cardiac and sk muscle show &beta;-2 MG staining.  Cells appear differentiated:
human &beta;-2 MG-positive cells in art cartilage lacunae are chondrocytic.
CD23 expression was positive in cells staining in marrow shown as human, indicating
IgE-expressing cells (they express CD23); human CD45 staining of these CD23 cells
was negative, showing they were non-hematopoietic.

Adult Rat and Human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Differentiate Into Neurons
<p class="Para1">
<b>Methods</b>. rMSCs are cultured in &alpha;-MEM with 20% FBS,
2 mM L-Gln, 100 U/mL pen, 100&nbsp;mg/ml strep, 25&nbsp;mg/ml amphoB.
Each passage is plated to 8000&nbsp;cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and
grown to confluency.  Passage 6 cells transferred to
DMEM + 20% FBS and maintained beyond passage 20.
Subconfluent cells in DMEM + 20% FBS were first treated 24 h in same
medium containing 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (BME).  Neuronal differentiation
is induced by washing cells in PBS and then incubating in DMEM with
1 to 10 mM BME.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  Cells at passage 1 were negative for CD11b (integrin
&alpha;<sub>M</sub>) and CD45 (Ly-5, Leuk Comm Ag) as shown by FACS;
these markers typical in lymphohematopoietic precursors.  Cells were
positive for CD90 (Thy1), common in undifferentiated cells.
Untreated cells are also positive for CD44 and CD71, as has been
noted by others.  Neuronal differentiation occurs first by treating
cells in 1 mM BME, then placing in serum-free medium.  Within even
30 min the cells flatten and contract a bit while elaborating
processes which also elaborated secondary branches.  Cells
fixed after 5&nbsp;h were tested for NSE using immunocytochemistry
(polyclonal Ab, Polysciences):  quantitation of digital images
indicated a progressive increase in expression of NSE
correlated with morphological change (extension
of processes and contraction of cell bodies).  Rare NSE-positive neurons
showed pyramidal cell morphology, and neurons with long processes
and clear varicosities were more common.  Some differentiated cell
clusters were centers of intense NSE positivity, with intercellular
process networks.  Flat rMSCs found in these clusters were only weakly
stained, and clearly undifferentiated;  western analysis confirmed a low
level of NSE in these cells.
<p>
rMSCs were treated with DMSO, BHA, or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)
singly or in combination.  Each of these antioxidants elicited morphological
changes to neuronal type in a time course similar to the action of BME.
2% DMSO and 200&nbsp;&mu;M BHA was the most effective.  Treated cells were
analyzed with antibody to intermediate filament NF-M:  these were
positive in BME-treated cells from earlier experiments (data not shown),
and cells with rounded bodies and elaborate processes stained well with
NF-M, but not cells clearly undifferentiated.  A subset of cells with
neuron-like phenotype showed NF-M exclusively in the processes.  As a
control, purified NF-M protein (antigen) pre-adsorbed to anti-NF-M
abolishes staining.
<p>
The expression of the microtubule-associated protein <b>tau</b> was
also checked.  Neuron-like cells were clearly tau-positive, undifferentiated
cells tau-negative.  There was also no staining with <b>glial fibrillary
acidic protein</b> (GFAP), and this pattern suggests the cells are neuronal
and not glial (in particular, astrocytic).  <b>NeuN</b> is a marker
found particularly in postmitotic neurons:  cells with very round cell
bodies and well-developed extensions stained positively, while neighboring
cells were negative.

Adenoviral-Mediated Gene Transfer into Ex Vivo Expanded Human Bone Marrow
Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells
<p class="Para1">
Mononuclear cells from heparinized bone marrow from several humans was
enriched on Ficoll-Hypaque and then seed at 1 million/cm<sup>2</sup> in
20% FBS + &alpha;MEM.  After a week when cells were confluent, these
were detached and subcultured at 7000/cm<sup>2</sup> in 10% serum medium.
The resulting monolayer is called mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs),
and these were expanded in successive passages.
<p>
Ad5CMVlacZ and Ad5CMVGFP are replication-defective adenovirus running
reporters under the control of CMV promoter.  Virus is cultivated in
293 cells (ATCC, CRL1573) and purified on CsCl and enriched to 2.5 &times;
10<sup>10</sup> pfu/ml (storage at &minus;80&deg;).
<p>
MPC were infected by both adenoviral constructs and 2 d later a transgene
expression analysis performed.  About 20% of cells had high fluorescence
signals for GFP and for LacZ (LacZ was measured using a fluorescein conjugate
of galactose).  Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that transduced
cells had a homogeneous green fluorescence, but nontransduced showed
yellow autofluorescent patches in cytoplasm.  No cells had both kinds of
fluorescence.  Changing the MOI from 250-2000 did not increase or alter the proportion
of cells transduced.  Nor did altering the amount of time to virus exposure.
When the MOI &ge; 2500, 80% of cells were transduced but there was a significant
cytopathic effect and loss of viability.  Use of a lipofection (pGeneGrip)
protocol was not helpful.  The transduction was also tried on different
donor cells to eliminate the effect of a particular batch of ex vivo
expanded cells:  transduction was 19% on average (range 10-37%), and so the
limitation was according to this cell type.

Rat Marrow Stromal Cells Are More Sensitive to Plating Density
and Expand More Rapidly from Single Cell-Derived Colonies Than
Human Marrow Stromal Cells
<p class="Para1">
rMSCs obtained from tibias &amp; femurs of 6-12 mon Lewis rats;
cultured in &alpha;-MEM w/ 20% FBS (lot-selected), 2 mM Gln, 100 U/ml
penicillin, 100&nbsp;&mu;g/ml streptomycin, 25 ng/ml amphotericin B.
Filtered through 70&nbsp;&mu;m nylon (Falcon) with one 75 cm<sup>2</sup>
flask ea rat.  Media replaced after 3 d; adherents allowed to reach
90% confluence (these are passage zero cells).  hMSCs were obtained
according to Colter et al.
<p>
  Passage 1 cells (first trypsin) were plated at variable densities
  of 2 and 16 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in 58 cm<sup>2</sup> plates.
  On day 12 there were 300 cells obtained in the 16 cell/cm<sup>2</sup>
  plate, but 800 cells for the 2 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, meaning
  yields are higher when plating density is lower.  Yields with hMSCs
  are greater with more frequent media changes (q 3-4 d).
  rMSCs also were more expansive by 2-fold in &alpha;-MEM compared to DMEM.
<p>
  Plots of %CFU vs. plating density at 1, 2, 4, and 8 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>
  showed an inverse relationship, meaning that lower densities produce
  more clones.  This was only true for rMSCs, not hMSCs, whose %CFU
  remained constant despite density.
<p>
  rMSC size and granularity was measured by forward and side scatter, resp.,
  using a FACS.  Three populations of cells (as for hMSC) were shown:
<ol>
<li>Large, granular, apparently mature cells
<li>RS-1 cells:  small and agranular
<li>RS-2 cells:  small and granular
</ol>
<p>
  Stationary phase cultures (initially plated 5000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>
  and left 12 d to become confluent) contain only mature and RS-1 cells.
  RS-2 cells can be isolated in 3-4 d cultures that are plated at low
  density (2 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>).  RS-2 cells decrease in proportion
  to expansion of mature MSCs (at 12 d).  While hMSCs show a correlation
  between %RS cells and assayed values for CFUs, this is not so for rMSCs.
<p>
  rMSCs were transduced with LXSN-GFP (see HTML comments for explanation
  of this process) to determine how well these subpopulations interconvert.
<!--
  Transduction with LXSN-GFP
  1. 800 bp BamHI fragment containing gene for enhanced green fluorescent
  protein (GFP) [EGFP-1 from Clontech) is ligated into BamHI site
  of MMLV-derived plasmid (see Miller &amp; Rosman, Improved retroviral
  vectors for gene transfer and expression, Biotechniques 7: 980-990, 1989).
  This plasmid it LXSN-GFP.
  2. 24 h before the next (transfection) step, plate 2.5 million
  Phoenix amphotropic packaging cells (obtain from ATCC) to a
  9.6 cm2 plate in growth medium (DMEM/2 mM Gln/10% hi-FBS/penstrep).
  3. Just before transfection, change medium above to medium containing
  25 microM chloroquine.  Prepare a 2X transfection cocktail of
 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.05, 10 mM KCl, 12 mM D-glucose, 280 mM NaCl, and
 1.5 mM Na2HPO4.
  4. Now add 500 microliters of cocktail to an equal volume of
  solution containing 10 mg plasmid DNA and a final concentration of
  250 mM calcium chloride.
  5. Add this to the Phoenix cells and leave 10 h at 37 C.
  6. Change the medium with fresh medium NOT containing chloroquine.
  Collect the viral supernatants after about 48 h, filter through
  0.45 um filter, and store at -80 until use.
  7. To transduce cells, about 100,000 rMSCs are plated to 9.6 cm plates
  the day before infection.
  8. 2.5 ml complete medium with 20% hi-FBS, 500 microliter viral supntnt,
  and 8 microG/ml polybrene are added to the cells.  This infection
  procedure is repeated 24 h later.
  9. After 72 h, medium is replaced with fresh medium containing 20% serum
 (but not heat-inactivated).
 10. 48 h after the last infection, cells are split 1:2 into 58 cm2 plates
  and incubated in complete medium containing 200 ug/ml G418 (Sigma)
 for 14 d.  Surviving cells are pooled and expanded for experiments.

-->
Cultures stably transduced after 3 weeks were analyzed by FACS.
Cells expressing GFP in the greatest amounts were mature MSCs.
These cells were sorted (according for ability to express GFP),
plated at low density (4 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) and then FACS done
after 10 d.  FACS results show the re-formation of RS cell subpopulation.
%CFU from presorted cultures (34%) was nearly identical with postsorted
mature MSCs (32%) was nearly identical.  Sorted mature MSCs also
possessed osteogenic potential (treated with medium containing
10 nM dexamethasone, 0.2 mM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, aand
10 mM &beta;-glycerophosphate after reaching 80% confluence; left 2-3
wk changing media q 3-4 d, and mineralization checked with
40 mM Alizarin red, pH 4.1, Sigma; see DiGirolamo et al).
<p>
Epitope analysis (using FACS) was done to look for
&ldquo;contamination&rdquo; with hematopoietic precursors.
Both rMSCs and hMSCs were negative for CD4, CD11b, CD43, and CD45,
typical hematopoietic markers.  Mature hMSCs were positive for CD31
(PECAM-1) as well as for most human RS cells, but negative for all rMSCs.
CD59 (SCA-1) was positive on most human RS and mature cells, positive
only on mature rMSCs.  CD90 (thy1.1) was positive on most cells from
both RS and mature in both species.
<p>
  Colonies (stained using crystal violet) were counted on rMSCs plated
  at 4 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and left 4 weeks for long-term cultures.
A nearly confluent monolayer forms from the colonies in this time.
  hMSCs plated at low density stop expanding after 2-3 week, with
  fewer colonies.

Cultivation of Rat Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in
Reduced Oxygen Tension:  Effects on In Vitro and In Vivo
Osteochondrogenesis
<p class="Para1">
Rat MSCs are from tibiae and femora of male F-344 rats (6-12 wk old).
Media is DMEM-low glucose + 10% FBS.  Single cell suspensions by serial
passage through 16-, 18-, and 20-gauge needles; followed by 500 &times; <i>g</i>
spin, mixing with 4% acetic acid to lyse RBCs; 50 million seeded to 100 mm
dish.  Billups-Rothenburg air-tight incubator modules with 5% oxygen-
5% carbon dioxide-90% nitrogen was used, largely by flushing premix
air for 15 min then closing ports.  Flushing is done daily, and excess
gas is vented.
<p>
There were no differences in the way cells in primary culture initially
developed with respect to growth and yield (CFU-F).  At 12-14 d colonies
in low oxygen were larger and cell numbers greater.  Cell morphology
was not different however.  Culture medium pH was measured on days 3, 7,
11, and 13 and not signficantly different between low and high oxygen
tensions.
<p>
Cells cultured in media with osteogenic supplements became more polygonal
and less spindled.  At day 7, cells were rounded in foci of low number.
The foci became <i>nodules</i> increasing in size and number, and became
multilayered.  Brown to black von Kossa staining indicated mineralization.
Cells between nodules (internodular cells) maintained a polygonal shape,
became multilayered but were von Kossa-negative.  Cells in control
medium (contains ascorbic acid 2-phosphate and &beta;-glycerophosphate,
but no dexamethasone) were more elongated than cell outside of the
node in osteogenic medium, and they were multilayered without nodule
formation, and were never von Kossa-positive.
<p>
Cell counts were always consistently higher (from 11-55% in a range
of 5&nbsp;compared preps, with mean of 41%) when primaries were grown in
low oxygen rather than normal.  To account for the large differences
in cell counts, total DNA was also determined.  A plot of DNA vs
days in culture show that the curves for all variations of oxygen
tension are the same:  DNA increases steadily to the 9th day, falls
on the 12th day, but continues up to the last (21st) day measured.
In osteogenic medium, DNA increases steadily but slowly (as in controls),
and then the rate of increase goes up 2-3 times after the 2nd week, without
the decline seen on the 12th day.  This pattern is seen whether cells
are cultured in low or control oxygen, but the absolute amount of
DNA is always higher with cells in low oxygen.

Cyclophosphamide/Granulocytes Colony-Stimulating Factor Causes Selective
Mobilization of Bone Marrow Hematopoietic Stem Cells into the Blood
After M Phase of the Cell Cycle
<p class="Para1">
Mice were treated with a cyclophosphamide/granulocytic colony stimulating
factor (CY/G-CSF) combination and also with BrdU thymidine analog.
99.1% of the Thy-1.1<sup>lo</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> Lin<sup>&minus;</sup>
c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Mac-1<sup>&minus;</sup> cells of the bone marrow
taken from 4 day-treated mice stained positive for BrdU.  This same
cell fraction was quantitated in peripheral blood that had been
cytokine-mobilized, and 98.5% of cells showed BrdU labeling.  The
cell type fraction Thy-1.1<sup>lo</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup>
Lin<sup>&minus;/lo</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> (it includes the
Thy-1.1<sup>lo</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Mac-1<sup>lo</sup>
transiently self-renewing HSC) was 97.8% BrdU-positive.  This indicates
that cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood (MBP) HSC divide at least once
(from BrdU results).
<p>
CY preferentially kills dividing cells.  If a dose is given 2 days after
the initial, then MBP and splenic HSC arising from long-term HSC following
CY/G-CSF should kill these cells.  Animals were treated with CY initially
but since long term HSC are not dividing, they are not killed.  After 4
days mice given a second dose on day 2 showed lower counts of LT HSC
in BM, blood, and spleen.  This indicates they were actively cycling.
<p>
LT HSC were taken from blood (5 cell/sample) and two experiments of
nested RT-PCR were performed to test the expression of cyclin D2,
a marker of active cell cycling.  This marker was found in both LT HSC
from BM and blood in CY/G-CSF day + 4 mice.  Control splenic T cells
showed little cyclin D2 mRNA.  Others report that MPB LT HSC are
in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> part of the cell cycle, migrating
to blood after completing M phase.  Our results show that cells are
in blood are in G<sub>1</sub> phase.
<p>
Double-sorted HSC were stained with Hoechst 3342 and pyronine Y (PY).  The
former permits evaluation of cells with greater than DNA 2n content, and
the latter relative levels of ds RNA totals.  Cells moving from
G<sub>0</sub> to G<sub>1</sub>, then from G<sub>1</sub> to S, G<sub>2</sub>,
and M phases accumulate RNA mostly as ds ribosomal RNA;  PY-rich cells
could be expected to have high levels of protein synthesis.  Total RNA
levels of HSC in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> and S/G<sub>2</sub>/M from
sampled at day +3 to +5 animals treated with CY/G-CSF-treated were higher
than the RNA levels from untreated mice in all tissues.  The PY staining
was 50%, 13%, and 24% (mean = 29%) was higher in 3 experiments in LT HSC
from blood of day +4 and +5 animals treated with CY/G-CSF than from HSC
in bone marrow in untreated mice.  This indicates a greater activation
(protein synthesis) in circulating HSC than in the bone marrow of
untreated mice.
<p>
Lin<sup>&minus;/lo</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic
progenitor cells were sorted from mobilized periperhal blood of
transgenic mice that express eGFP under &beta;-actin promoter.
High levels of eGFP are produced in all cells, including HSC.
FACS-sorted MBP eGFP<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors from CY/G-CSF
+ day 4-treated animals were injected IV into wild-type mice that had
also been treated with CY/G-CSF in parallel.  As a control, normal
erythrocytes were fluorescently tagged with red fluorophore PKH-26
and co-injected with eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells.  The purpose is to see
the period of the transient presence of these progenitors in the blood.
Even in less than 1 minute, eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were not found in
the blood whereas PKH-26 cells were easily detected.  Never were
eGFP<sup>+</sup> ever found.  Examination of tissues indicated their
presence in spleen, liver, and bone marrow 3 hours after IV injection.
<p>
Note in these experiments most eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells migrated to the liver
and spleen, far fewer to the marrow.  No cells were found in lymph nodes,
Peyer patches, or thymus.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>. For the production of transgenic mice, pCXEGFP vector,
described by Dr. J-I Miyazaki, was linearized with
<i>Bam</i>HI and <i>Sal</i>I and the fragment containing the
cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV-IE) enhancer, chicken &beta;-actin
promoter, eGFP cDNA, and &beta;-globin polyadenylation sequences
was gel-purified with Qiaquick gel extraction kit; this was injected
into zygotes of an F<sub>1</sub> cross of C57BL/Ka-Thy1.1 &times; C3H
mice.  Founders were screened by FACS for peripheral blood leukocytes,
and eGFP<sup>+</sup> back-crossed to C57BL/Ka-Thy1.1 mice.  Mice that
had been back-crossed for at least 5&nbsp;generations were used.

  Bone Marrow Cells Regenerate Infarcted Myocardium
<p class="Para1">
Lin-negative marrow cells from transgenic mice making enhanced GFP (eGFP)
were sorted by FACS for c-kit expression.  Damage to heart was induced
by coronary ligation, and male Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells
injected into the contracting wall bordering the infarct of the left
ventricle of female mice.  12 in 30 mice showed repair, with the balance
failing either because of the difficulty of transplanting cells to hearts beating
at 600/min or due to graft rejection as the Y chromosome has histocompatibility
issues.  The extent of injury was not different between control and treated
animals.  New myocytes could not be detected in mice treated with
Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-kit<sup>&minus;</sup> cells.
<p>
eGFP was found in the cytoplasm but not of surviving parts of ventricle.
It was seen in cells with proteins present in myocytes, endothelial, and
smooth muscle.  It was expressed in about half of all these cell types
with new cells.  Also about half of Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-kit<sup>+</sup>
cells expressed eGFP.  An average of slightly more than half of all cell
types (myocytes, smooth muscle, endothelial) in the hearts of donor

<p>
Expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), GATA-4 (a cardiac-specific
transcription factor), and Csx/Nkx2.5 (early marker of myocyte diff), and
all cells were labeled with MEF2 and GATA-4, but about 40% of cells were
labeled with Csx/Nkx2.5.  Connexin 43 is involved with development of
intercalated disks between cardiomyocytes, which represent plasma membrane
channels and electrically coupled cells;  it was found in the cytoplasm
and on the surface of differentiating cells.
<p>
Cells in active mitotic cycle express Ki-67 in all phases (G1, S, G2,
and early M).  5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) identifies cells in S phase.
Using these methods, myocytes were found to be the most active in
proliferation, 93% and 60% higher than endothelial cells as measured
by BrdU and Ki-67, resp., and 225% and 176% higher than smooth muscle
cells by those methods, resp.  36% of myocytes, 19% of endothelial cells,
and 11% of smooth muscle were BrdU-positive;  19% of myocytes, 12% of
endothelial cells, and 7% of smooth muscle was Ki-67-positive.  40-50%
of these cells expressed eGFP.
<p>
Hemodynamic parameters were measured in treated mice.  In mice with
infarcted hearts cardiac failure was greater than sham-operated.
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was 7 mm Hg in sham-operated
(SO), 26 mm Hg in infarcted mice (MI), and 17 mm Hg in infarcted mice
injected with Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-kit<sup>+</sup> (MI + BM).
Developed pressure (LVDP) was 95 mm Hg in SO mice, 48 mm Hg in MI,
and 65 mm Hg in MI+BM mice.  LV + d<i>P</i>/d<i>t</i> was
8500 mm Hg s<sup>&minus;1</sup> in SO mice, 4200 mm Hg s<sup>&minus;1</sup>
in MI mice, and 6000 mm Hg s<sup>&minus;1</sup> in MI+BM group.
LV &minus; d<i>P</i>/d<i>t</i> was 8000 mm Hg s<sup>&minus;1</sup> in SO mice,
4000 mm Hg s<sup>&minus;1</sup> in MI mice, and
5500 mm Hg s<sup>&minus;1</sup> in MI+BM group.  All of these values
show the effectiveness of injected cells having the right phenotype in
partially restoring ventricular function.
<p>
The Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-<i>kit</i><sup>+</sup> differentiate to
myocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle, demonstrating true
multipotentiality.  The model is that infarcted myocardium sends
unknown molecular signals (normally?) to bone marrow cells (or
stem cells in local tissue, equivalent to stem cells in BM with
respect to multipotentiality), and cells migrate to the damaged area
and proliferation occurs with a large subset differentiating in
which nuclear proteins, largely transcription factors such as
Csx/Nkx2.5 and MEF2 and GATA-4, are expressed and/or activated, and this
in turn leads to cytoplasmic expression of structural and functional
proteins such as cardiac myosin, &alpha;-sarcomeric actin, and connexin 43.
<p>
c-<i>kit</i> is expressed in stem cells of hematopoietic lineage,
in melanoblasts from the neural crest, and in primordial germ cells.
The latter cells migrate to yolk sac and liver (endoderm);  these tissue
show mRNA expression of stem cell factor (SCF), the c-<i>kit</i> ligand;
SCF/c-<i>kit</i> interaction is believed to signal cell migration to
target tissues.

Segregation of Human Neural Stem Cells in the Developing Primate Forebrain
<p class="Para1">
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing, propagatable primordial cells
with the capacity to give rise to differentiated progeny within all
neural lineages in all regions of the neuraxis and thought to exist in
embryonic and fetal ventricular geminal zone.  Similar cells are identified
in adults in the subventricular and ependymal zones of forebrain,
subgranular zone of hippocampus, retina and optic nerve, cerebellum,
spinal cord, and cortical parenchyma.
<p>
A human NSC clone was grafted to developing brain of fetal bonnet monkey
(<i>Macaca radiata</i>, Old World species) by injection of about 20 million
cells which had been prelabeled with BrdU in utero into the left lateral
cerebral ventricles of fetuses at 12-13 weeks gestation (this was guided by
transabdominal ultrasound).  The cerebral cortex derives from the ventricular
zone;  at 12-13 weeks, stem cells in the ventricular zone stop populating
neurons in layers IV to VI, and start neurogenesis in layers II and III.
At 16-17 weeks, fetuses were delivered by Caesarean and brains processed
histologically.  The donor human NSCs were identified using anti-BrdU
and human-specific nuclear mitotic antigen (NuMA) immunocytochemistry;
other antigens were probed as well.
<p>
The hNSCs were distributed symmetrically in the brain despite the unilateral
injection, in both cerebral hemispheres and at most levels of the neuraxis.
One subpopulation migrated long distances (about 1600 cell diameter) from
the periventricular germinal zone along radial glial processes, and it
differentiated into several neuronal and glial types appropriate to the
cortical laminae.  hNSCs in superficial neurogenic cortical layers II and
III became neurons according to staining with NeuN, calbindin, and
neurofilament.  These were intermixed with monkey neurons.  hNSCs that
integrated in the deeper cortical layers IV to VI became glial cells,
as shown by GFAP and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNPase)
staining which identify astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, resp.  Donor
glial cells were also found in the marginal zone (in layer I) and in
subcortical regions, and also contributed to radial glial cell populations.
<p>
Cells in a second subpopulation were small, undifferentiated without
neuronal processes and dispersed in subventricular zone as single cells
or small clusters.  Vimentin-positive staining indicated these cells
to be immature progenitors or stem cells;  they were negative for other
markers indicating differentiation.

Acquired Mutations in the <i>MXR/BCRP/ABCP</i> Gene Alter Substrate
Specificity in MXR/BCRP/ABCP-Overexpressing Cells
<p class="Para1">
9 MXR/BCRP/ABCP-overexpressing sublines were tested in efflux assays
of rhodamine and mitoxantrone (control cell lines included two parental
cell lines, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and S1 human colon cancer
cells).  Assays were done in the presence or absence of fumitremorgin C (FTC),
an inhbitor of MXR/BCRP/ABCP.  All resistant sublines showed reduced
MTX accumulation, but only 2 of the 9, MCF-7 AdVp3000 and S1-M1-80,
transported rhodamine 123.  In the absence of FTC, cell fluorescence
is much lower in flow cytometry than in the presence of inhibitor, indicating
transport of MTX.  Rhodamine efflux was also inhibited in the 2 sublines
in the presence of FTC.
<p>
Membranes from these cells were prepared and run on an immunoblot,
staining with a polyclonal antibody to MXR/BCRP/ABCP.  MCF-7 cells
showed no band, but resistant cells showed heavy bands on the blot.
Difference in efflux capacities of cells did not correlate with differences
in protein expression shown by immunoblot.
<p>
Total RNA was isolated (RNA STAT-60) from the cell and poly(A)<sup>+</sup>
selected.  Sequencing of mRNA was doine using the ABI PRISM Rhodamine
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit.  Between residues 12-482,
differences were seen in the sequence.  At 482, Arg was found in majority
of cell lines, with Gly and Thr found in S1-M1-80 and MCF-7 AdVp3000, resp.
The parental lines MCF-7 and S1 both had Arg-482, indicating that the
two cell lines that efflux rhodamine had acquired these mutations.  Cell
lines that had been intermediate in the selection were also evaluated:
all these were Arg-482.

  Hepatic Stem Cells:  From Bone Marrow Cells To Hepatocytes
  <br><span style="font:normal 90% Helvetica,sans-serif;">
 &sect; Breakthroughs and News</span>
<p class="Para1">
<b>Review</b>.  Important recent studies include:
<ul>
<li>Peterson et al. show that bone marrow stromal cells transplanted
to lethally irradiated rats migrate to liver and differentiate to oval
cells and hepatocytes.The same is later found for mice and humans.
<li>Lagasse et al. show that purified HSCs also differentiate to hepatocytes;
they replace diseased livers in mice with hereditary tyrosinemia with
mature hepatocytes from stem cells.
</ul>
<p>
Hepatoblasts are present only in fetal tissues and give rise to
hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium.  Research needs to focus on sources
of stem cells and to characterize the hepatic lineage.  Some things
already understdood:
<p>
<b>Oval Cells</b>. These cells appear in numbers in periportal areas of liver 
lobules when hepatocytes are killed in large counts or when proliferation is 
prevented by toxins or carcinogens.  They are thought to have bipotent ability 
to become hepatocytes and bile duct cells.  Induction of these cells is with 
2-acetylaminofluorene [2AAF] and two-thirds partial hepatectomy with 
CCl<sub>4</sub> used.  Oval cells can transform to basophilic small hepatocytes 
and then go on to mature.
<p>
<b>Bone Marrow-Derived</b>. Oval cells and HSCs (hematopoietic stem cells) share 
several markers: c-<i>kit</i>, CD34 in both rats and humans, and also Thy-1 in 
rats. In the Petersen et al study, rat bone marrow cells were taken from males 
and transplanted to lethally irradiated females and Y chromosome-bearing cells 
tracked in the liver.  Also marrow from males positive for dipeptidyl peptidase 
IV were transplanted into females deficient for the enzyme.  Moreover, whole 
organ transplantation in one strain of rats was done into another strain to see 
if allogeneic donation was possible.
<p>
In embryogenesis, HSCs appear in a mesodermal region that forms an axis from 
which the aorta, gonads, and mesonephros form.  Hematopoietic cells leave the 
liver and move to the bone marrow and spleen, but some may remain in the liver 
well after birth.  These cells have the ability to replace marrow in disease. 
Stem cells remaining in the liver however may differentiate only into 
hepatocytes and bile duct cells, and so microenvironment determines fate.
<p>
<b>Small Hepatoctyes</b>. Small mononucleate cells cultured within primary 
hepatocytes increase in number with treatment with 10 mM nicotinamide with EGF: 
the clone divides 5-6 times in about 10 days.  These cells total about 15-20 per 
1000 in liver, and retain hepatocytic phenotype but immortalization has not been 
done yet.
<p>
Proliferating small hepatocytes express hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4),
whereas larger cells express CCAAT/enhancer binding protein &alpha; and
HNF6 as well as HNF4.
<p>
Figure 1 shows a scheme by which cells may form progenitors of liver structural 
components.  Hepatoblasts are the major embryonic precursors giving rise to 
small hepatocytes and bile duct cells.  Small hepatocytes then mature, with a 
small proportion remaining small, undifferentiated, and self-renewing.
<p>
Oval cells may come from two sources:  bone marrow, as stromal cells
or from HSCs, and from the canals of Hering in the liver, in the periportal
areas.  Oval cells may serve as a source of bile duct cells and small
hepatocytes, filling in for the hepatoblasts.  Another set of cells
probably marrow-derived are H-CFU-C cells, which may commit to forming
oval cells and/or small hepatocytes.  It is also possible that cells
in the marrow form cells in the canals of Hering.

A Functional Assay for Detection of the Mitoxantrone Resistance Protein,
MXR (ABCG2)
<p class="Para1">
Cancer cells feature the overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters.  P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and the multi-drug resistance-associated
protein (MRP) are two members extensively studied.  The mitoxantrone
resistance protein, MXR, is an ABC half-transporter cloned from
colon cells selected with mitoxantrone at high levels.  MXR is identical
to breast cancer resistance protein (BRCP) with but a few amino acid
differences.  BRCP was overexpressed in breast cancer cells selected
with adriamycin in presence of verapamil.  It is also nearly identical to
the placental ABC protein, ABCP1 (found in expressed sequence tag
databases).  These proteins confer resistance to high levels of
mitoxantrone and to anthracyclines, camptothecins, topotecan, and SN-38.
<p>
To do efflux assays, cells in log phase are detached and plated to
96-well plates in phenol red-free medium.  The medium contains the
fluorescent compounds to be tested in the efflux assay:  0.5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml
rhodamine 123, 100 nM LysoTracker Green DMD-26, 250 nM BODIPY-prazosin,
or 20&nbsp;&mu;M mitoxantrone).  Incubation can be in presence or absence
of 10&nbsp;&mu;M fumitremorgin C (FTC), an inhibitor of the ABC transporters,
was for 30 min at 37&deg; in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> system.  Cells are then
washed with ice-cold complete medium and placed in ice in the dark,
or resuspended in complete medium, and incubation continued for an
additional hour with or without 10&nbsp;&mu;M FTC.  Cells analyzed with
this were examined for their efflux of the dye.  Cells are washed
in cold saline, kept on ice until analyzed in FACSort cytometer
with 488 nm argon and 530 bandpass filter
for rhodamine, LysoTracker, and prazosin fluorescence.  A FACSCalibur
cytometer with 635 red diode laser and 670 nm bandpass was used for
mitoxantrone fluorescence.  10,000 events were counted at a minimum.
Debris was marked by gating forward and side scatter, and dead cells
eliminated by propidium iodide.
<p>
Two sublines overexpressing MXR were tested for their dye-pumping ability
against four dyes.  Cells were treated 30 min with dyes with and without FTC
present, then some cells continued 1 h in washout medium to permit efflux
following the accumulation period.  Mean channel numbers were calculated
for each condition.  The difference between the mean value of the FTC/Efflux
histogram and the Efflux histogram is the FTC-inhibitible efflux, and
provides the most reproducible values.  MCF-7 AdVp3000 and S1-M1-80
cells are MXR overexpressers with a high FTC-inhibitible efflux for
all anti-metabolites used here.  MCF-7/MX8 cells overexpress MXR at a
lower level, and their histograms show mitoxantrone and prazosin
efflux ability, but they show no capacity for LysoTracker or rhodamine.
With the S1 parent line, there is no efflux, although with MCF-7 parent
there is a slight but detectable FTC-inhibitible mitoxantrone and prazosin
efflux.  S1-B1-20 cells are Pgp-overexpressers, and efflux of all compounds
but LysoTracker was observed to be inhibited by the Pgp antagonist PSC 833;
this system is not inhibited by FTC.  MCF-7/VP is an MRP-overexpresser,
and there was no FTC-inhibitible efflux noted with any compound.  It
should be noted that small amounts of FTC-inhibitible efflux of LysoTracker
were seen probably because LysoTracker undergoes significant quenching.
<p>
Total RNA from selected cell lines was run on Northern blots to examine
for MXR mRNA expression.  High levels were observed in S1-M1-80 and
MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells, which confirms findings elsewhere.  Additionally
high levels were seen in MCF-7/MX100 cells, intermediate in MCF-7 MX8
and MCF-7 AdVp10, and very low in the MCF-7 parent.  No MXR was found
in S1 or S1-B1-20.  54 of 60 cell lines making up the Natl. Cancer
Institute Anticancer Drug Screen were analyzed by quantitative PCR for
MXR levels.  From this, 10 cell lines that made MXR mRNA above the mean:
SF-295, M14, SN12C, KM12, HCC-2998, HT29, HOP-62, NCI-H460, A549, and
NCI-H23.  The cell line IGROV had no detectable MXR and could be used
as a negative control.  The 10 cell lines plus the negative control
were then analyzed with Northern blots, and expression of MXR was
detectable in SF295, KM12, NCI-H460, and A549 cells.
<p>
The four anticancer drugs were used in a functional assay of the 11
drug screen lines.  Flow cytometry showed that drug efflux (by fluorescence)
was apparent in cell lines A549, H460, KM12, and SF295, but not
in M14 and IGROV  (data for mitoxantrone and BODIPY-Prazosin are
shown).  This agrees with the MXR expression results.
<p>
Difference in the mean channel numbers between FTC-treated efflux and
normal efflux were correlated to mRNA expression of MXR seen in Northern
blots of selected and unselected cell line.  The coefficient of determination
<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> was 0.89 between efflux of mitoxantrone and mRNA
expression of MXR.  For prozasin efflux, <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.70.
FTC-inhibitable LysoTracker and rhodamine did not correlate with selected
cell lines, and they were unable to detect low levels of MXR in in unselected
cell lines.  FTC-inhibitable mitoxantrone correlated with MXR expression
in unselected cells lines (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.77);  there was also
a correlation with FTC-inhibitable prazosin (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.76).
As for LysoTracker and rhodamine, again the correlations with MXR
expression were weak for unselected cells (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.07
and <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.03, resp.).
<p>
Three cell lines, A549, NCI-H460, and MCF-7 with FTC-inhibitable mitoxantrone
efflux and one cell line insensitive to FTC, SN12C, were treated with
mitoxantrone over a dose range to measure percent survival.  This curve
was also generated in the presence of 5&nbsp;&mu;M FTC.  The three cell
lines with FTC-inhibitable MTX efflux showed a 3-4-fold sensitization to
MTX.  SN12C showed no increased sensitivity to MTX with FTC present, and
this agrees with the MTX and prazosin efflux data.  The negative control
IGROV also showed no increse in sensitization.  By comparison S1-M1-3.2
cells treated with FTC are increased in sensitivity to cytotoxic drug
by 400-fold.  Hence the cytotoxicity (sensitivity to MTX) assays compare
with the efflux data.
<p>
MXR is an ATPase (ATP-dependent enzyme), and its activity was measured
against the concentration of the inhibitor FTC in membranes from S1-M1-80
cells.  The <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> (half-maximal inhibition) was found to
be 1&nbsp;&mu;M.  There was no effect (inhibition) in the parental S1 cell line.
<p>
The upregulation of MXR in unselected cells expressing low MXR levels by
treating four lines (SF295, KM12, NCI-H460, and A549) showing MTX
and prazosin efflux with 10 nM MTX.  The cells selected by such treatment
are then designated with MX10 attached to their name.  Both MTX efflux and
MXR expression were determined.  Results show an FTC-reversible increased
efflux in 3 of the 4 MTX-resistant sublines compared to parents.

 Stem cells:&nbsp;&nbsp;is there a future in plastics?
<p class="Para1">
Stem cells in whole bone marrow in human and animal models is
reported to differentiate into cell types of many tissues:
skeletal and cardiac muscle, liver, endothelial cells, and
brain.  Also, stem cells taken from mature tissues will
differentiate into many cell types of other tissues.
<p>
A line of neural stem cells made continuous by growth in EGF and FGF
were injected into animals whose bone marrow had been ablated with
sublethal radiation dosing.  The donor NSCs later were found to
contribute to blood production.  Experiments by others with mouse
NSCs showed that cells injected into mouse and chick embryos later
contributed to development of all three germ layers, but interestingly
not hematopoietic precursors (blood).
<p>
Three labs reported that stem cells isolated from mouse skeletal muscle
were excellent at restoring all peripheral blood cell progenitors
in lethally irradiated mice.
<p>
HSCs transplanted into bone marrow can contribute to the repair
of capillaries and cardiomyocytes in mouse model of infarction.
2000 HSCs marked with <i>lacZ</i>-expressing Rosa26 transgene
were purified and grafted to bone marrow, and also at lower levels
to infarcted heart.  2 in 10,000 cardiomyocytes were <i>lacZ</i>-positive,
and 3 in 100 endothelial cells were the same.
<p>
Using a Y chromosome to track the fate of singly engrafted HSCs
to bone marrow, cells with Y chromosomes were found in epithelial
tissues in the liver, gut, and lung.  Note that besides looking for
the Y chromosome, functional markers identifying cell type were also
used to show the transdifferentiation.
<p>
Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase is required for survival but its effects
can maintain animal viability through a drug.  When the drug is removed,
mice die.  The marrow of mice was engrafted with as few as 50 HSCs
that were not mutant for FAH.  The drug was removed, and hepatocytes
derived from HSCs apparently grew in the liver and rescued the mice.

Multi-Organ, Multi-Lineage Engraftment by a Single Bone Marrow-Derived

Mak in Toronto) are used (cervical dislocation sacrifice).  Marrow
is flushed from hind limbs with medium using 25-gauge.  Cells are
elutriated.  Males are collected at flow rate of 25 ml/min (Fr25)
and females collected after rotor stopped (R/O).  Fr25 cells are

and demonstrated long-term repopulation (LTR) ability, not found for
10<sup>4</sup> cells homing to spleen.  As a control, 100 or 1000
PKH26<sup>+</sup> Fr25lin<sup>&minus;</sup> cells from males were injected to
females for LTR without using a 48 h homing procedure via an intermediate
engraftment.  These controls did not survive beyond 12 weeks, and
there was no male reconstiution before death.  Of the 30 mice transplaned
with a single cell, 5&nbsp;survived in the long term.  Donor cell
reconstitution was characterized at 5&nbsp;and 11 months in surviving mice.
With 1 in 6 animals showing LTR from a single cell, this 6-indicates
a 500- to 1000-fold enrichment of the cells after homing of the
Fr25lin<sup>&minus;</sup> starting population.
<p>
At 11 months the 5&nbsp;long-term survivors are killed and the marrow
plated to recover progenitors for serial transplantation.  Marrow
from 4 of 5&nbsp;survivors had CFU from male, ranging from 77.5-97.5%
of CFU.  One survivor had no male CFU.  13% of the cells in peripheral
blood in the mouse with no male CFU were of donor origin.  Another
mouse with low percent donor cells in blood had high donor-derived CFU
(88%).  The marrow from the long-term survivors was transplanted to
four new irradiated females for each survivor.  3 of the 5&nbsp;mice
provided the engrafted recipients with male cells at 4 months posttransplantation
that was at a level of engraftment seen in the primary recipients.
<p>
PKH26-labeled cells before and after 48 h transplantation were characterized
for surface antigens.  The recovered bright PKH26 cells from the
marrow of the 48 h female showed high frequences of CD34<sup>+</sup>
and SCA-1<sup>+</sup> cells (46% and 24%, resp.), whereas the starting
population was much lower (4% and 3%, resp.).  It is unknown whether
CD34 expression upregulates in homed cells, or whether CD34 cells
preferentially home to marrow.  If the latter is true, 29.5% of
CD34<sup>+</sup> and 9.3% of SCA-1<sup>+</sup> injected cells home to the
marrow, as opposed to 12.8% of cells, as reported by us elsewhere.
Fluorophoric cells recovered from the spleen after 48 h were not enriched
in CD34<sup>+</sup> or SCA-1<sup>+</sup> cells.
<p>
PKH26-labeled Fr25lin<sup>&minus;</sup> cells from males with CD34 knockout
were found to seed the spleen of recipients in larger numbers than
when normal HSCs were used.  This indicates that CD34 may be necessary
for homing of the cell to the marrow.
<p>
Epithelial tissues were examined in the five mice using anti-cytokeratins
(MAb AE1/AE3 and MAb Cam5.2; Cam5.2 stains for CK8, CK18, and CK19)
for immunostaining.  Donor cell reconstitution was quantitated
unambiguously staining.  Tissues examined included stomach lung
(bronchi, alveoli), esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon,
renal tubules and glomeruli, liver (both hepatocytes and the biliary tree
or cholangiocytes), and skin.  Y chromosome-bearing cells identified by
FISH were found in the bronchi (staining for both MAbs).  Cam5.2 staining
is apparent in the columnar respiratory epithelium.
<p>
Intraepithelial lymphocytes are excluded as possible false positives:
sequential sections of lung, liver, skin, and esophagus do not show
the presence of lymphocytes studied by FISH.  These lymphocytes are
present in stomach and both
intestines however.  Lymphocytes are distinguished from epithelials
based on cell size (with nuclei twice as large as normal lymphocytes),
cytokeratin immunohistochemical staining (to nuclear membrane), and lack
of halo (distinctive of lymphocyte cytoplasm).

Matrix Metalloproteinase Expression and Activity in Isolated Myocytes
After Neurohormonal Stimulation
<p class="Para1">
Porcine LV myocytes were isolated by dissecting free wall of muscle
near left circumflex artery, which was cannulated, and the cannula
then perfused with collagenase for 20 min, followed by mincing,
further collagenase treatment in oxygenated tissue.  Culture was
in M199:F-12 with 2 mM calcium and ITS along with a 0.2% protease
inhibition cocktail.  Myocytes were then prepared by a special cocktail
of isoproterenol, endothelin-1, angiotensin II, and phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA).
<p>
Medium sampled from the myocytes was subjected to MMP zymography and
activity was observed within 30 min of incubation with specific
stimuli.  A small increase in MMP gelatinase activity is found
after 2 and 4 h after incubation in PMA relative to untreated LV myocytes.
After 6 and 8 h, there is a vigorous increase in this activity,
showing the clear time-dependence of PMA activation.  Results were
similar with endothelin-1 (Et-1), angiotensin II (A-2), and
isoproterenol (IsoP).  Although there was a slight increase
in MMP activity in untreated myocytes,  differences between
time points in the untreated cells was insignificant, and the
slight increase may be due to autolytic activation.
<p>
Image densitometric changes were quantitated in the zymograms.
Increases in the total gelatinase activity were seen with PMA,
Et-1, A-2, and IsoP, and all but the IsoP increase was significant
to <i>p</i> < 0.05.  Specific analysis of the 90 kDa (MMP-9)
and 70 kDa (MMP-2) isoforms showed the same results as the total
activity, that there were increases with all treatments but only the
Et-1, A-2, and PMA treatments were significantly higher than the
untreated.
<p>
LV myocyte purity during the isolation steps were verified by use
of zymographic analysis the serum-free medium during wash steps;
the second wash was free of collagenase.   Myocytes were refined
on 40% Percoll, although there was no difference in zymographic
analysis of the conditioned medium before or after density centrifugation.
Propidium iodide staining of nuclei were used to ensure cell type
purity:  no inflammatory cells such as neutrophils or macrophages
were present.  Lipopolysaccharide was not assessed as the cells
were isolated under sterile conditions.  Anti-smooth muscle actin
(Sigma, 1:5000) was used to test a LV myocyte prep along with a
femoral artery homogenate as well as myocardial homogenate, and
a positive result was seen for the artery and myocardial homogenates
only.
<p>
The specific MMP-2 content was determined on medium samples using
a monoclonal.  Cells were treated with signaling agents and the
samples run on a Western blot.  Two bands at about 72 and 63 kDa
were observed for all media, including medium from untreated cells.
Sarcolemmal preparations of the untreated and treated LV myocytes
were also positive, but only for the 72 kDa band.  It is thought that
the 72 kDa band represents an inactive pro-MMP-2 while the lower
MW band is the active form.
<p>
It is reported that MMP-2 activation is controlled by membrane type-1
MMP (MT1-MMP).  A polyclonal specific for MT1-MMP was used in
Western blotting of LV myocyte sarcolemmal preps in cells both
untreated and treated with neurohormonal stimuli.  Bands at
60, 55, and 40 kDa were found, corresponding to the proform, active
form, and potential activation byproduct.  The total MT1-MMP activity
was seen to increase with hormonal stimulation (for all treatments,
PMA, Et-1, Ang-2, and IsoP), although the protein was present in
untreated cells also.  LV myocytes were fixed and stained using indirect
fluorescent antibody to MT1-MMP and visualized by laser scanning
confocal microscopy:  MT1-MMP was localized to the sarcolemma,
with no staining evident at all when the antibody was not used.
LV myocyte morphology looked good under phase contrast.

Myocardial and Interstitial Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity After
Acute Myocardial Infarction in Pigs
<p class="Para1">
20 pigs (35-40 kg) were each placed in deep anesthesia with an arterial
line (7-Fr) placed in right carotid, and multi-lumened thermodilution
catheter (7.5-Fr) placed in pulmonary artery through right external jugular.
Both fluid-filled catheters were connected to externally calibrated
transducers.  Sternotomy was performed and vascular ligature placed around
inferior vena cava for transient occlusion.  Precalibrated microtipped
transducer (7.5-Fr) was introduced through the apex into the LV and sutured
in place.  Two pairs of 2 mm piezoelectric crystals were placed in the
myocardium to measure segmental wall motion:  first crystal pair
was between first and second diagonal branches of left anterior descending
artery, and second pair between first (OM1) and second (OM2) obtuse marginal
branches of the circumflex.  In addition, a microdialysis probe was
inserted into myocardium between each pair of crystals, sutured into place.
Baseline measurements were done after 60 min.  Parameters measured were
heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, aortic pressure, LV end-systolic
and -diastolic pressure, peak rate of pressure development (+dP/d<i>t</i>),
and LV regional segmental shortening.  Snare occluders were also placed
around OM1 and OM2.
<p>
Once all baseline parameters were assessed and instrumentation equilibrated,
the ligatures around OM1 and OM2 were closed to induce regional ischemia.
This region chosen because ischemia does not affect the conduction pathways
that might cause AV block.  A 3 h period was done because it causes
permanent infarction.  Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining reveals
25% infarct size from previous work.  Mean aortic pressure and LV peak
systolic pressure fell significantly during the 3 h period, while all
other parameters remain unchanged.  S-T segment elevation was also
observed although sinus rhythm was always maintained.  Plasma troponin-I
increased over 2-fold (10.5 ng/ml to 24.6 ng/ml).
<p>
Regional LV function was determined in a remote untreated and in the
ischemic/infarcted region.  After 60 min occlusion it was apparent
that segmental shortening had decreased in the ischemic region.
Regional preload recruitable stroke-work (PRSW) decreased after 60 min
and continued to fall with greater ischemia;  regional PRSW was unchanged
in the remote region.
<p>
Matrix metalloproteinase zymography on dialysate samples showed
a robust increase in activity 3 h after coronary occlusion, esp.
within the range of 80-100 kDa.  Lytic regions of the zymogram
were quantitated by densitometric analysis: there was a significant
increase in myocardial interstitial zymographic activity in the ischemic
region 3 h after occlusion (<i>p</i> = 0.068).  A fluorogenic substrate
for MMP-2/9 was infused into an undamaged region (in the LAD) and into
the infarcted region in the circumflex, and fluorescence of the sampled
dialysate monitored every 10 min over a time course up to 120 min.  After
80 min, the dialysate from the infarcted region showed significant
increases above baseline, while the undamaged region never changed
significantly from the baseline.  This further shows that MMP-2/9
isoforms are activated in the infarcted region.
<p>
Zymographic analysis was done on the infarcted region, the region
immediately surrounding the infarcted region, and the region remote
from the infarcted region.  A significant increase in a 92 kDa
activity was seen in the infarcted region.  The difference in this
increase was relative to the remote undamaged region.  While there
was a higher 92 kDa activity as well in the peri-infarct area relative
to the remote region, the difference was not signficant.
<p>
Zinc-dependent proteases in the myocardium become activated during
injury (infarction) and likely contribute to repair and remodeling.
The microdialysis technique used here showed an early onset of activiation.
Activation can occur in the absence of reperfusion, and a fluorogenic
assay shows what appears to be activation (although not signficant)
as early as 10 min after acute occlusion.

Stem and Progenitor Cells:  Origins, Phenotypes, Lineage Commitments,
and Transdifferentiations
<p class="Para1">
<b>Review</b>.
Stem cells currently defined:  single cells that are clonal precursors
of both more stem cells of the same type, as well as a defined set of
differentiated progeny.  First studies were of hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells (see Till &amp; McCulloch 1961).
<p>
Stem cell isolation was helped first by development of assays for
clonal precursors of all known types, from myeloerythroid to B and T
cell lineages.  The production of monoclonal antibodies then allowed
marking of cell surfaces.  In the late 1980s, mechanisms to sort these
cells were then developed (see Muller-Sieburg et al 1986, Spangrude et al.
1988).
<p>
HSC stems must not be committed to a lineage (Lin<sup>&minus;</sup>).
Mouse HSCs are positive for Sca-1 (Ly6A/E) and Thy-1, glycophosphatidyl
inositol-linked immunoglobulin superfamily molecules.  They are
positive for the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase, though this is down-modulated
if there is an abundance of c-kit ligand (SLF).  Bone marrow which
are multipotent can be divided into 3 subpopulations based on surface
markers and degree of self-renewal:
<ol>
<li>the Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> are long-term &ldquo;perpetually&rdquo;
self-renewing (LT-HSC)
<li>Mac-1<sup>lo</sup> subset of KTLS cells are self-renewing in vivo
upon transplantation for 6 weeks (ST-HSC)
<li>Mac-1<sup>lo</sup>CD34<sup>lo</sup> subset of KTLS are clonogenic
multipotent with short self-renewing potential and are also called
multipotent progenitors (MPP)
</ol>
<p>
LT-HSC give rise to ST-HSC, which give rise to MPP and there is no
de-differentiation (ST-HSC cannot give rise to LT-HSC, and MPP not to
ST- or LT-HSC).  Donors treated with cytoxan + G-CSF activate HSC to
go into cell cycle, and daughter HSCs are released into the blood from BM.
<p>
The KTLS fraction can more quickly restore all cell lineages in lethally
irradiate mice.  Doses (cell numbers) and compatibility (graft of syn-
vs. allogeneic strains) shows that syngeneic transplantation offers the
most rapid, and a maximal number of cells provides the effect (more
cells do not shorten time).  100 cells alone will restore marrow in
syngeneic strains, whereas 500 cells are necessary in MHC-matched
(not donor-recipient match) grafts.  1000-3000 cells are necessary where
neither donor-host or MHC matches are negative.  There are no T lymphocytes
in transplantation, so there is no GvH response.
<p>
Human HSCs are found in cord blood, fetal liver, fetal BM, adult BM and
mobilized peripheral blood.  These are CD34<sup>+</sup>, Thy-1<sup>+</sup>,
Lin<sup>&minus;</sup>, c-kit<sup>lo</sup>, and CD38<sup>&minus;</sup>.
Enrichment of the CD34<sup>+</sup> Thy<sup>+</sup> fraction away from
cancer cells in peripheral blood prior to lethal irradiation is one
consideration for therapy:  fully myelo-ablated patients with stage IV
breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma have been
rescued.
<p>
>From the HSC, two progenitors will arise:  the common myeloid progenitor
(CMP) and the common lymphocyte progenitor (CLP).  Surface markers
and gene profiles are characterized for these cells.  CMP express
GM-CSF receptors (GM-CSFR) but no IL-7R, while CLP express
IL-7R&alpha;&gamma;<sub>c</sub> but not GM-CSFR.  CMP give rise
to granulocyte/monocyte progenitor (GMP) or the megakaryocyte/erythrocyte
progenitor (MEP), very much lineage-restricted and unable to self-renew
in grafts.
<p>
8% of LT-HSC can enter cell cycle per day at random, while ST-HSC, MPP,
CLP, and CMP show higher percentages, meaning these more committed
cells provide the bulk of the proliferative capacity.  All GMP and MEP
cells derived from CMP are always in cell cycle.  LT-HSC enter cell
cycle dependent upon stimuli largely.  In pathological states, committed
progenitors acquire unlimited capacity for self-renewal.  Leukemic cells
show chromosomal translocations, deletions, amplification, or inversions.
A translocation (AML-1; ETO) in HSC may be the cause of acute myelogenous
leukemia:  this makes sense in that a buildup of genetic problems
that would shutdown proliferation in a set of cells eventually
creates the possibility that a downstream progenitor acquires the
ability to self-renew.
<p>
<b>CNS Stem Cells</b>.  Experiments have now shown that the nervous
system is able to regenerate cells, with some regions have a high
rate of neurogenesis, such as the subventricular zone bordering the
lateral ventricles and the dentate gyrus in the hippocamplus.  Cells
from rat fetal and adult brain could be sustained in bFGF and EGF forming
adherent monolayers or non-surface adherent self-associating neurospheres.
Retrovirus-marked adherent cells show clonal cells that self-renew
and give rise to neurons and glia.  Human fetal cells also respond to
growth factors present by forming neurospheres.  It is possible that
a particular stem cell that initiates neurospheres is present.  Cell
sorting by FACS was done to see which cells initiated neurospheres
when the candidate cells were grafted to lateral ventricles of
nude (NOD-SCID) mice.  Human cells continued to expand and be neurogenic
not only in the neonate, but even 7 months thereafter;  Ki67-positivity
verified an active cell cycle.  Human-origin cells were also found
distributed in several structures of the mouse brain, including the
corpus callosum, striatum, mid-brain, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex.
Injection to SVZ and DG of adult immunosuppressed rats also showed
cells able to proliferate, migrate, and differentiate.

Regeneration of Ischemic Cardiac Muscle and Vascular Endothelium
by Adult Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
Bone marrow was taken from tibia and femora of 6-12 wk old mice of
C57BL/6-Rosa and C57BL/6-Ly5.1 strains and suspended at 10<sup>6</sup>/ml
in DMEM + 2% FBS buffered with HEPES.  These were stained 5&nbsp;&mu;g/ml
Hoechst 33342 for 90 min at 37&deg;, centrifuged, then resuspended in
cold HBSS with 2% FBS and 2&nbsp;&mu;g/ml propidium iodide.  Flow cytometry
set for Hoechst Blue vs. Hoechst Red shows a blue-rich/red-poor
fraction about 5&nbsp;in 10,000 cells that is a "side population" (SP).
Flow cyt on a c-Kit (FITC anti-c-Kit) vs. PECAM-1 (CD31)
(Phycoerythrin-strepavidin + biotinylated anti-CD31) shows staining for
both in SP.  PECAM-1 was thought to be restricted to angioblasts, endothelial
cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets.  The SP can give rise to all
hematopoietic lineages in the mouse.
<P>
SP was selected using Hoechst staining.  RT-PCR shows these are negative
for desmin and &alpha;-actinin, expressed in cardiac muscle.  These cells
are negative for ICAM-2, VE-cadherin, von Willebrand's factor, and Factor
VIII, indicating that they are not differentiated endothelial cells.
They are also not early endothelial progenitors, since they do not express
<i>Flk</i>-1 or <i>Flt</i>-1, receptors for VEGF.
<p>
SP was positive by RT-PCR for <i>Tie</i>-2, a receptor for angiopoietins
1 and 2.  SP cells modified to contain <i>lacZ</i> under the control of the
<i>Tie</i>-2 promoter were galactosidase-positive, confirming the RT-PCR
result.  These cells also expressed <i>Tal</i>-1/<i>SCL</i>, the
three isoforms of <i>VEGF-A</i> and angiopoietin-1.  DNA sequencing was
also used to verify PCR products.
<p>
C57BL/6 mice (<i>n</i> = 22) were lethally irradiated and SP cells
transplanted to them (cells also express <i>lacZ</i>).  After 10-12 wk,
the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 60 min,
followed by reperfusion.  19 animals were treated, 3 received sham
operations.  After 2-4 weeks of injury mice were sacrificed and
tissues analyzed for repair.  5&nbsp;of the mice undergoing coronary occlusion
survived the waiting period.  Hearts of survivors were sectioned and
X-gal-stained, then with fluorescent Ab.  lacZ-positive cells costained
with Flt-1 and ICAM-1.  The lacZ staining was seen in various structures,
but mostly in capillaries.  No staining was found in sham-operated animals.
<p>
LacZ staining was also found for cardiac muscle, with blue staining found
throughout the heart.  Staining was in a punctate pattern in many cases.
A Rosa26 positive control stains in both a punctate and diffuse pattern.
The lacZ-positive regions co-stained with &alpha;-actinin and were
contiguous with lacZ-negative cardiomyocytes.  The punctate pattern
was not because of infiltrating hematopoietic cells since the lacZ cells
were not positive for CD45.  Spleen sections were heavily stained for
CD45.
<p>
The lacZ-positive myocytes were largely at the edge of the myocardial
scar (a region of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; cells).  The prevalence of
lacZ-positive cells in the cardiac tissues was determined.  For
selected individual treated (and one sham) mice, the week of testing,
number of lacZ<sup>+</sup> myofibers per 100 sections, percent
cardiomyocyte engraftment, the number of lacZ<sup>+</sup> vessels of the
total, and the mean percent endothelial cell engraftment are reported.
Three mice were examined at 2 weeks, and the only surviving treated mouse
at 4 weeks.  100 sections were counted, each having 13,000 cardiomyocytes.
A mean engraftment prevalence of 0.02% of all cardiomyocytes was found.
<p>
The mean prevalence of endothelial cells was also determined to be 3%.
Engraftment of SP cells was predominantly into newly formed capillaries,
and in the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; region next to the infarcted zone.

Cdk5 on The Brain
<p class="Para1">
REVIEW.  Much of the study on cell cycle control done on yeasts,
where <i>cdc2</i> in <i>Schizosacchromyces pombe</i> and <i>cdc28</i>
in <i>Sacchromyces cerevisiae</i> were found to be essential
cyclin-dependent kinases involved in control of the G<sub>1</sub>-to-S
and G<sub>2</sub>-to-M transitions.  In mammals Cdk1 is the counterpart
to Cdc2/cdc28.  Cdk2 and Cdk4 are involved in timing DNA replication.
The Cdk family of proteins are proline-dependent serine/threonine kinases
associating with some 15 cyclins for activation.
<p>
Cdk5 has about 60% homology with Cdk1, and its mRNA is found in the
kidney, testes, and ovary, but highest levels are in postmitotic neurons
in both embryonic and adult nervous systems, indicating a role of Cdk5
in other than cell cycle control.  Enzymatic active is detected exclusively
in brain extracts.  Monomeric Cdk5 is inactive (true for all Cdks), but
Cdk5 is not activated by association with known cyclins.  Activation
requires binding to brain-specific p35 and p39, which have little
sequence similarity to known cyclins, although p35 has a characteristic
cyclin fold.
<p>
In last 10 years it has been learned that Cdk5 regulates neuronal migration,
with a role also in axon growth and synaptic function.  The p35/Cdk5
complex also exists in muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction.
In yeast p35/Cdk5 orthologues regulate endocytosis and actin dynamics.
Pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's may be due to unregulated
Cdk5 activity, which is neurotoxic.
<p>
Knockouts of p35 and Cdk5 in mice revealed roles in neuronal migration
when there was an inversion of the normal laminar pattern in the cortex.
6 layers form the cortex normally, and newly postmitotic cells migrate
to form the layers along one of several migratory routes.

Stem cells for repair of cartilage and bone: the next challenge
in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
<p class="Para1">
<b>Review</b>.
Treatments to arrest the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are being
researched and reported, but there is a need for regenerating
articular cartilage damaged by the inflammatory process.  Self-repair
with fully differentiated cells is one process, and replacement using
stem cells is another.
<p>
Articular cartilage is composed of a tissue of cartilage matrix
and embedded chondrocytes.  The matrix is collagen and proteoglycan
aggregates (aggregan).  RA pathogenesis features proinflammatory
cytokines in synovial fluid activating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
secretion from chondrocytes, and this increases pericellular matrix
decomposition/degradation.  IL1&beta; and IL6 presence creates a
synergy in the decrease of aggregan chondral synthesis and the
hyaluronan/aggregan ratio in the ECM.  Use of an IL1 antagonist
partially inhibits proteoglycan depletion.  The MMPs is a family
of 18 endopeptidases whose secretion is promoted by IL6 family cytokines
(includes IL6, IL11, oncostatin M).  Activated monocytes (macrophages)
secrete a 58 kDa glycoprotein which is an ECM MMP inducer which initiates
the cascade.  Serine proteases from PMNs also aggravate RA joint
destruction:  an imbalance between proteases and their inhibitors.
<p>
Cartilage degradation is also inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines
(IL10) or by growth factors such as TGF-&beta; family (includes
TGF&beta;1 and bone morphogenetic protein-2 [BMP-2]), which stimulate
collagen type II and proteoglycan synthesis by chondral cells.
TGF-&beta; superfamily consists of 40 members, whose characteristic
structure features seven conserved Cys residues in the COOH terminus.
Binding to TGFR stimulates <b>Smad</b> proteins, which serve to
assemble multisubunit complexes in nuclei which function as transcription
factors.  TGF-beta-related molecules and BMPs are important in signalling
skeletal morphogenesis during embryonic development, and BMPs are
involved in bone healing and cartilage metabolism in the mature organism.
<p>
  Effective clinical therapy has been achieved using recombinant human
  BMP-2 in Lewis rats where a 5&nbsp;mm femoral defect was introduced.
  After 12 wk 80% of union was restored compared with 38% restoration
  with bone graft or 47% with marrow used alone.  BMP-2 clearly attracts
  marrow MSCs, and induces proliferation and osteocytic differentiation.
  BMP-2 induces cartilage growth by having chondrocytes synthesize ECM.
  Safranin O and collagen type II staining (immunohistochemical?) can
  be used to show cartilage repair.
<p>
  BMP-7 and OP-1 (osteogenic protein 1) are effective stimulators
  of proteoglycan synthesis by chondrocytes, even in the presence of
  IL1&beta; (unlike BMP-2).  Persistent BMP-2 or OP-1 treatment will
  induce bone formation.  CDMP-1 or -2 (a/k/a GDF-5 and -6, resp.) are
  members of the TGF-&beta; family that induce cartilage repair without
  concomitant ossification.  Other factors involved in embryonic
  chondrogenesis include Indian Hedgehog, PTH-related protein, insulin-like
  growth factor, FGF, and Noggin.  NFATp (nuclear factor of activated
  T cells) appears essential for differentiation of MSCs and
  cartilage morphogenesis in adult mice.
<p>
  Current therapies now try autologous chondrocyte transplantation
  to articular surfaces that are damaged.  Successful results are
  seen in patients less than 50 y of age within 2 y of treatment.
  A periosteal flap was sutured over the defect, and it is possible
  that osteoprogenitor cells participated in the repair.  A problem in
  RA is that chondrocytes are injured or lose their differentiation,
  with some undergoing apoptosis.
<p>
  Bone marrow MSCs also support growth of HSCs by secreting a number
  of cytokines (GM-CSF, IL6, IL7, IL8, IL11) as well as stem cell
  factors such as SDF-1.  They lack the markers CD34, CD45, CD14
  and T and B cell markers.

High-Yield Selection and Extraction of Two Promoter-Defined
Phenotypes of Neural Stem Cells from The Fetal Human Brain
<p class="Para1">
Telencephalic ventricular zone (VZ) parenchyma was obtained from human
fetal brain of aborted fetuses (15-23 wk, 2nd trimester).  Cells from
zone were dissociated then kept in DMEM/F12/N2 with 20 ng/ml bFGF
and 10 ng/ml EGF, to 4 million/ml, plated 4 ml in 100 suspension culture
plate (Corning).
<p>
Brains taken between 12-23 weeks were immunostained for musashi1 and nestin
to determined tissue distribution.  Musashi1 was ubiquitious with the
ventricular neuroepithelium, less so in the nascent subventricular zone (SVZ),
with none in the intermediate zone or cortical parenchyma.  Nestin was
found in the VZ, colabeling with musashi1.  There were more mushasi1<sup>+</sup>
cells by far than musahsi1<sup>+</sup>-nestin<sup>+</sup> cells.  Radial
guide fibers forming a dense array in the intermediate zone showed
staining for nestin only;  however, musashai1-nestin-positive cells are
found to migrate within this array.
<p>
Quantitation using high-magnification confocal microscopy of a 14 wk
rostrolateral telencephalic VZ shows 72% musashi1 that coexpress with
nestin (seen in 644 cells in 3 sections).  After 21 wk, 93% of musashi-positive
cells also express nestin.  But in this time, the proportion of musashi-only
cells falls from 27 to 5.5%, and the proportion of nestin-only cells
remains stable at about 1%.
<p>
Cells from 15-23 wk fetal VZ were exposed to adenovirus constructs containing
eGFP put under the control of nestin enhancer (E/nestin:eGFP) or
musashi1 promoter (P/musashi1:hGFP).  The cells were dissociated from
the tissue with papain, and numbered ten fetuses aged 15-19 weeks,
and 15 which were 20-23 weeks.  These were placed in bFGF- and EFG-supplemented
media.  The efficiency of the construct was improved by making a
&Delta;E1 virus bearing E/nesting:eGFP.  This virus was infected into
cells on their first day in vitro, with a 1-25 moi ratio.  After 4 d,
nestin-controlled expression was seen.  Among cells expressing the
eGFP, 98% of them also expressed nestin.  61.6% were actively dividing,
according the BrdU test.  Only 3.1% expressed &beta;III-tubulin,
and 8.9% made GFAP.  Hence nestin regulation was of a relatively
undifferentiated population.
<p>
The 4.6&nbsp;kb mouse musashi1 promoter was linked to a hGFP reporter,
placed into a type 5&nbsp;&Delta;E1 adenovirus (AdP/musahshi1:hGFP), and
then transduced.  Transduction with the virus was much better than
attempts to transfect with P/musashi1:hGFP plasmid DNA alone.
Cell viability was not affected by infection in the 10-25 PFU/cell
range.  In the AdP/musashi1:hGFP-positive cells there was no
expression of &beta;III-tubulin;  96% of those cells were nestin-positive,
and immunoreactivity was also found for musashi1 as well.  93.3%
of AdP/musashi1:hGFP-positive cells also incorporated BrdU, showing
a large proportion were self-renewing.
<p>
Both of these viral expression systems did not change the phenotypic
expression, and were identified in uncommitted progenitors, not
by more differentiated neurons.  These results validate their usefulness
in specifically and selectively identifying neuronal progenitors prior to
their commitment.
<p>
The fetal VZ and SVZ cells infected by these adenoviruses were extracted
using FACS using a very stringent criteria previously reported.  10.6% of
cells  (the mean of 3 sorts) of cells from 17-19 gestational week VZ
were seen to express GFP under nestin control.  This fell in a small
but significant way to 7.4% (n=11 sorts) in nestin-controlled GFP-positive
cells by weeks 20-23 (shown by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc
test).  AdP/musashi1:hGFP-driven VZ cells appeared in lower frequency
than of E/nestin:eGFP-driven cells at 17-19 and 20-23 weeks (2.4%
and 3.2%, resp.).  When marking the forward and side scatter, it appears
that the nestin- and musashi-transfected progenitors overlapped.
When the AdE/nestin:eGFP cells were sorted, they rapidly express nestin,
with 83% of cells doing so within 1 week in serum-free media.  Cells
expressing Hu and &beta;III-tubulin were rarely detected, even beyond a
week.  There are maturation factors in serum however, since only 36.3%
of cells express nestin protein in 5% plasma-derived fetal bovine serum
(loss of nestin expression is considered evidence of differentiation).
Most sorted progenitors raised in PD-FBS mature within a week, becoming
&beta;III-tubulin neurons or GFAP<sup>+</sup> glia.
<p>
Low-density cultures of sorted/purified E/nestin:eGFP and P/musashi1:hGFP
cells were prepared so that neurospheres could form.  Spheres were
then dissociated and limiting dilution was done to propagate the progeny
as secondary neurospheres.  The clones were characterized after plating
and immunolabeling.  This technique revealed that individual secondary
and tertiary spheres were each derived from single E/nestin- and
P/musashi1-sorted cells tagged with retroviral GFP, and that neurons
and glia could be derived from these progeny.
<p>
Transfected cells were sorted by FACS and limiting dilution performed
before formation of neurospheres, with propagation of cells in suspension
culture.  Cells were initially plated at 3000 per 0.1 ml in 24-well plates
with 0.3 ml volume;  a serum-free DMEM/F12/N2 with 10 ng/ml bFGF medium
was used, a protocol established to produce neurospheres.  After 2 weeks,
secondary neurospheres were produced:  primary neurosphere were removed
to single wells of a 24-well plate, then dissociated and dispersed as
single cells (those that did not dissociate were identified and removed
by a micropipette).  After all accounting, each well harbored 500-1000 cells.
These were grown in bFGF-supplemented base medium.  Positions of expansion
were marked after 1 week, then followed daily to ensure no clonal mixing.
With forebrain VZ samples, a mean 15.3 spheres/well for the musashi1:hGFP
cells and 11.5 spheres/well for nestin:hGFP were found (cells were 19-22
wk gestational age).  Using unsorted cells 15-23 wk gestational age,
only 1.4 spheres/well were found with identical culture conditions.
When cells from the frontal cortex were used in these studies, only
0.1 spheres/well were found (21-23 wk fetuses used).  Hence, use
of these sorted cells produced a 10-fold enhancement in clonogenicity
compared to unsorted cells from the VZ, and a &gt;100-fold enhancement
from unsorted cortical parenchyma.  (One-way ANOVA demonstrated this
significance).
<p>
The proportion of cells capable of generating spheres depends upon
gestational age and the plating density;  earlier ages and higher
densities allow for a higher proportion of sphere-generating clones.
The absolute count of stem cells cannot be estimated.
<p>
Immediately after FACS, each of both cell types were infected with
supernatant derived from NIT-eGFP, which contains an eGFP under
the constitutive control of Rous sarcoma virus promoter within
a vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotyped amphotropic vector.
E/nestin- and P/musashi-sorted cells that are not infected by this
retrovirus will lose their ability to express GFP in a few weeks,
as differentiation occurs (with episomal transgenes downregulated
or abandoned).  About 1-1.5% of cells were transduced and constitutively
express GFP.  These transfected sorted cells are placed 10,000 in 0.3 ml
of each well of a 24-well plate.  Clonal progeny of roughly 100 tagged
cells in each well can be followed for weeks.
<p>
With the tagged cells, several cycles of sphere generation to dissociation
to single cells to sphere generation were performed.  At least 5-6 cycles
were performed.  With each passage there was a 50- to 100-fold increase
in cell count (500-1000 cells/well expanding to &gt;50,000/well).  This
means 6-7 population doublings during a month between passages, with a
cell cycle about every 4-5 days.  Over the 6 months, this entails a minimum
of 36-42 doublings, with no change in cell capacity for proliferation.
<p>
Cells at any passage from both phenotypes always retained the ability
to differentiate with multilineage potential.  Differentiation involved
5% PD-FBS and 20 ng/ml BDNF on a laminin substrate.  After 1-2 weeks
cultures are fixed and immunostained with neuronal &beta;III-tubulin,
astrocytic GFAP, or oligodendrocytic O4.  3rd passage neurospheres
were derived from
retroviral GFP-tagged E/nestin:eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells sorted from
22-wk VZ, and 33% of plated cells expressed &beta;III-tubulin within a
week of plating.  Remaining cells expressed either nestin or GFAP,
with only occasional O4<sup>+</sup> cells were seen.
<p>
Sorted human cells were xenografted to E17 or P0-2 rat forebrain ventricles.
100,000 AdE/nestin:eGFP- or AdP/musashi1:hGFP-sorted VZ cells were injected
into the ventricular lumen of each E17 embryo.  Pups were sacrificed 2-4
weeks later, after delivery, and brains were sectioned and stain with
anti-human nuclear antigen as well as neuronal and glial markers (this
identifies human cells since the other markers may have intergeneric
cross-reactivity).  E17 is a stage at which cortical neurogenesis
of the ventricular neuroepithelium occurs.  Most of the human cells of
both nestin- and musashi1-types migrate to cortical laminae and become
neurons, resulting in dramatic human-rat neocortices.  If injected
at P0-2 neonates intraventricularly or intracallosally, the cells only
migrate to the subcortical white matter, becoming glial cells instead.
At 28 days, the human cells are oligodendrocytes (cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterase, CNP) or astrocytes (GFAP), abundant in subcortices.
Neurons were rare for cells injected late into development:  in that
case they were found largely in rostral migratory stream or olfactory bulb.
In conclusion both E/nestin:eGFP and P/musashi:hGFP-sorted cells become
all phenotypes in the xenograft.

 Isolation of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells:  Bone Marrow Versus
  Umbilical Cord Blood
<p class="Para1">
  MSCs could be isolated from marrow but not cord blood in a medium
  with 10% FBS and 10% HS.  Mononuclear cells were enriched on
  Percoll gradient.  At every passage, morphology, immunophenotype,
  and cytokine mRNA expression evaluated.  The Pittenger et al method
  was used to induce differentiation, and differentiated cells were
  stained cytochemically and illuminated using RT-PCR.  Adherent
  cells from marrow were negative for CD45, CD14, and CD34.  Cord blood
  cells lost count and viability with each passage, and were instead
  positive for CD45, CD14, and CD31, and negative for CD34, CD1a,
  and CD80.  Guiterrez et al indicated that their cord blood layer
  contained 60% dendritic cells, which was not found here;  the
  technical differences included use of Ficoll gradient and cultivation
  as a dexter long-term culture.
<p>
  Marrow adherent cells were found to produce mRNAs for IL-6 and IL-11,
  which stimulate hematopoiesis, but not mRNAs for TNF-&alpha; or
  TGF-&beta;1, cytokines that are made by monocytes (macrophages).
  Cord blood adherents however produced TGF-&beta;1, TNF-&alpha;,
  and IL-6.  The inability to detect IL-11 suggests cord blood adherents
  are not MSCs.  The presence of multi-nucleate cells that were positive for
  tartrase-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) indicates a spontaneous
  differentiation of moncytes/macrophages to osteoclasts.

Characterization of Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells,
A Subpopulation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
Mesenchymal cells were isolated by depleting CD45<sup>+</sup> and
glycophorin-A<sup>+</sup> cells from marrow and expanding in low-serum
and serum-free cultures containing EGF and PDGF-BB.  A subpopulation
we call Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPC) emerges, and can
be doubled 70 times.  Their telomeres do not shorten in culture, and these
cells have multilineage differentiation.  Under specific culture conditions
they can develop into cartilage, bone, fibroblasts, adipocytes, which
are mesenchymal types, as well into myoblasts of all muscle types and
von Willebrand factor-positive endothelium, which are mesodermal types.
MAPC can also differentiate to neuroectoderm of all kinds, with cells
expressing beta tubulin III, neurofilament, neuron-specific enolase,
and glutamate, which are neuronal phenotypes;  they can also express
GFAP of astrocytes, and MBP and galactocerebroside of oligodendrocytes.
Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting was used to demonstrate these.
MAPC can be subcloned to 10 cells per well, but will not initiate cultures
from single cells.  Retroviral gene marking will determine whether a single
MAPC can express all lineages.
<p>
MAPC are present as 1 in 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> cells,
compared to MSC present as 1 in 10<sup>5</sup>.  Generating MAPC is
reproducible in 50 human donors.  Injection of these cells into
SCID mice does not generate teratomas (tumors with multidifferentiating
cells), although these cells were early passage cells, and not necessarily
homogeneous.  Cells that were used were not (starting to) express(ing)
OCT4, and it is expected that doublings should exceed 40 or more before
injection into immunodeficient mice.
<p>
MAPC emerge from MSC by subcloning (subculturing) cells over a very long
time.  77% of cells die when induced to differentiate to a neuronal lineage
during the first 20 or so doublings.  Beyond passage 40, the vast majority
differentiate.
<p>
Besides humans, MAPC were obtained from mice (C57Bl/6).  CD45<sup>+</sup>
cells do not grow over time.  If allowed to grow for 2 weeks with
hematopoietic cells, then when the cells are isolated by CD45, they then
grow, but require LIF.  Note that mouse ES also require LIF, but
human ES do not.  Oct-4 increases over time.

Isolation and Characterization of Canine Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells
<p class="Para1">
Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) obtained from iliac crest and the long
bones and placed in IMDM with 150 U/ml heparin.  Histopaque-1077
(Sigma) was used and cells obtained at 1-5 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>/ml.
Adherents were removed by two rounds of adherence to plastic for 1 hr
at 37&deg;.  Lineage depletion using six mAbs to markers for granulocytes,
monocytes, platelets, and B and T lymphocytes were used to reduce the
cells by 80 &plusmn; 11%.  This technique greatly reduced committed
myeloid cells.  The Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> cells were assayed for CFU-GM
and BFU-E formation, with a 3.7 &plusmn; 1.5-fold enrichment in CFU-GM
and 2.0 &plusmn; 0.6-fold increaase in BFU-E.
<p>
Flow cytometry was used to characterize total mononuclear cells and
lineage-depleted cells for CD34, c-kit, and Flt-3.  For CD34, this
was 9.8 &plusmn; 5.5% and 27.1 &plusmn; 9.1% for BMMCs and depleted
cells, resp.  Binding of biotinylated stem cell factor (SCF) showed
5.2 &plusmn; 2.9% and 54.1 &plusmn; 3.9% of BMMCs and depleted, resp.,
which indicates c-kit positivity.  An SCF-responsive canine mast cell
tumor cell line was used as a positive control, and showed 98% of cells
as c-kit<sup>+</sup>.  As another control, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled
SCF with biotinyl-SCF showed that binding was specific.  Biotinylated
human Flt-3 ligand was used for checking Flt-3, and was 17.2 &plusmn; 5.8%
and 19.2 &plusmn; 7.8% for BMMCs and lineage-depleted, resp.  If an
anti-human Flt-3 ligand blocking Ab was coincubated, staining did not
occur, demonstrating specificity.  4.5% of BMMC co-expressed CD34 and
Flt-3, and 1.8% of BMMC were CD34<sup>+</sup>/c-kit<sup>+</sup>.
7.9% of lineage-depleted cells were CD34<sup>+</sup>/Flt-3<sup>+</sup>.
19.5% of lineage-depleted cells were CD34<sup>+</sup>/c-kit<sup>+</sup>.
Lineage depletion therefore results in a 2.7-fold increase in
CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, a 10.4-fold increase in c-kit<sup>+</sup>
cells, and a 10.8-fold increase in CD34<sup>++</sup>/c-kit<sup>++</sup>
cells.
<p>
BMMC and Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> cells were stained with Rhodamine-123
and cells sorted into Rh-123<sup>dull</sup> and Rh-123<sup>med/bright</sup>
fractions using FACS using forward scatter parameters.  Letting efflux
occur for 3 hours reduces variability in staining profiles.
There were twice as many Rh-123<sup>dull</sup> cells in Lin<sup>&minus;</sup>
cells than in BMMC.  With verapamil added, Rh-123 efflux was inhibited
and so a subpopulation expressing P-glycoprotein is likely present.
The Rh-123<sup>dull</sup> cells sorted out were small in size having
dense chromatin and scan cytoplasm.  Rh-123<sup>med/bright</sup> cells
were slightly larger blast-like cells.  Lin<sup>&minus;</sup>
Rh-123<sup>dull</sup> did not generate CFU-GM when cultured short term
in methylcellulose, indicating that these high dye efflux cells are
primitive early progenitors.
<p>
NOD/SCID mice were irradiated and then injected I.P. or by tail vein with
10 million BMMC or Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> cells, or with 10,000-60,000
Rh-123<sup>low</sup> cells in a hematopoietic system reconstitution
assay.  Using 400 cGy, 30% of mice die 9-21 days following irradiation.
With engraftment of canine cells, bone marrow, peripheral blood and
spleen are examined 4-8 weeks following.  Mice showed successful
engraftment of BMMC in bone marrow (6.8%), peripheral blood (23.3%), and
spleen (9.5%) when seen 7.5 weeks after injection.  5.25% of mice
showed successful engraftment of Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> cells in bone marrow
6 weeks after injection combined with treatment with canine G-CSF and SCF.
Without the growth factor treatment, engraftment was at low levels in
bone marrow, although the major site of engraftment was the spleen
(4.4%).  Mice injected with 10,000 Rh-123<sup>low</sup> cells had engraftement
rates of 2.5% in blood and 3.3% in spleen.  CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were
not detectable in bone marrow.
<p>
Reconstitution studies were continued using allogeneic DLA-identical
bone marrow transplantation.  Three dogs receiving total BMMCs showed
&gt; 30% chimerism after 8 weeks.  Although one dog died due to unrelated
causes, the other two dogs persisted with high level chimerism after
6 months.  When transplantation was with Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> BMMCs,
engraftment was seen at lower levels, still persisting after 10 weeks.

Somatic Stem Cell Plasticity:  Current Evidence and Emerging Concepts
<p class="Para1">
Mavilio and Cossu transplant bone marrow from lacZ-expressing transgenic
mice into wild-type; the gene is under the control of a muscle-specific
promoter.  Muscle is injured by cobra venom, and the repaired muscle
shows signficant lacZ<sup>+</sup> fibers.
<p>
Eglitis and Mezey show that bone marrow cells home to the brain of mice
and differentiate to microglia and astroglia (neuroectoderm from mesoderm).
Marrow cells can also transdiff to endoderm, such as hepatocytes and oval
cells (stem cell of hepatocytes and biliary epithelium).
<p>
Gussoni et al. transplant 2000-5000 HSC from male mice into lethally
irradiated female <i>mdx</i> mice.  Probes 4-6 wk later for dystrophin
and Y chromosome show 1-10% of fibers dystrophin-positive.  This was
evidence that HSC could differentiate to an nonhematopoietic type
(skeletal muscle).  We have shown that HSC transplated to bone marrow
can make cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells subsequent to injury
by coronary artery ligation.
<p>
Lagasse and others have been able to rescue mice from a lethal liver

NSC and clonal neural lines from lacZ transgenic mice were transplanted
to sublethally irradiated, and both whole and clonal NSC populated the

neuronal or neuroglial.  Clarke et al injected NSC from lacZ-transgenic
into either chick or mouse and found they had contributed to multiple
lineages in all three germ layers.

Stem Cells for All Seasons?  Experimental and Clinical Issues
<p class="Para1">

<b>REVIEW</b>.  There are certain cells that self-renew over the lifetime of an 
organism.  Male spermatogonia are one example. Somatic stem cells beyond the 
embryo are pluripotential only to a point.  Hematopoietic stem cells are seen in 
the yolk sac initially, moving to the paraortic region, then to the liver, then 
finally in spleen and bone marrow.  Generally in adults, stem cells form 
'niche' of differentiation, limited to a few related lineages, 
with the environment of the cells as important in influencing the timing of 
their innate potential to change. Adult HSCs from murine marrow injected to the 
inner mass of blastocysts will express the fetal rather than adult form of 
hemoglobin.

<p>
A regenerative potential appears to exist for certain neural centers
such as striatum, thalamus, and hypothalamus.  Why do NSCs exist in
the ventricular ependymal layers?  Sphere-forming cells appear in
embryonic development and persist as progenitors in repair of injury
or disease.
<p>
Hematopoietic regenerative potential is well-known.  CFU-S (spleen)
can re-populate entire systems of lethally irradiated mice, with
analogous cells in humans.  Oligopotent myeloid and lymphoid progenitors,
some of which are also the source of erythroid or megakaryotic or
granulo-moncytic precursors are known.  BFU-E and CFU-E of erythroids
are identified.  CFU-GM give rise to granulocytes and monocytes, and
CFU-MKs are megakaryotic progenitors.
<p>
Macrophage inflammatory protein 1-&alpha; (MIP-1-&alpha;) and TNF-&alpha;
are factors that will inhibit hematopoiesis, and these could be useful
in promoting cultured stem cell proliferation.  MIP-1&alpha; and LIF
protect repopulating ability of HSCs.

At this point bone marrow transplantation in mice shows cells will
differentiate in to skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, endothelium,
liver, and brain.  Cells transplanted to humans are found in liver too.
Ferrari et al. 1998 demonstrated stem cell plasticity by showing
bone marrow cells differentiating into skeletal muscle.  Marrow
from transgenic mice making <i>lacZ</i> under control of myosin
light chain promoter was grafted to irradiated scid/bg recipients.
Injury of tibialis anterior with cardiotoxin was followed 2-3 weeks
later with &beta;-gal-positive muscle fibers in regenerating muscle.
<p>
HSC and MSC are both found in marrow, so the type responsible was not
known.  Wakitani et al 1995 have shown MSC can differentiate into
myoblasts (skeletal muscle precursors).  Gussoni et al 1999 have shown
HSC are multipotential.  Male HSC from normal donors transplanted
to lethally irradiated female <i>mdx</i> (muscular dystrophic models)
mice and cells from hind limb of recipients examined 4-6 wk later for
dystrophin and Y-chromosome.  1-10% of fibers expressed dystrophin, and
a portion were bearing Y chromosomes.
<p>
Our laboratory has shown HSC contributing to cardiomyocytes and endothelium
in a cardiac ischemia/reperfusion model.

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells from Bone Marrow Differentiate
into Functional Hepatocyte-Like Cells
<p class="Para1">
MAPC selection and culture have been described elsewhere.  Differentiation
into hepatocytes from in vivo or from ES cells has been described,
and the particular extracellular matrix components and cytokines necessary
were determined.  Tests for differentiation include immunostaining with
albumin, CK18, and HNF3&beta;.
<p>
Optimal differentiation for mouse and rat cells was observed at 21,000
cells/cm<sup>2</sup> with 10 ng/ml FGF-4 and 20 ng/ml HGF on Matrigel.
After 14 d, 61% of cells were positive for albumin, CK18, and HNF-3&beta;
(combined).  17.3% of cells were binucleated.  On fibronectin, 53% of
cells expressed CK18 and HNF-3&beta;, with fewer (10.9%) of cells
binucleated.  It was also the case that treatment with either FGF-4
or HGF produced cells expressing the three differentiation antigens
in epithelioid cells, but counts (percentages) of cells were higher
when treated with both.  aFGF, bFGF, FGF-7, BMPs or OSM had no effect
on increasing counts of cells with these markers.  1% DMSO and 0.1-10
mM sodium butyrate did not support differentiation at all.
<p>
Higher percentages were seen with higher cell densities, tested in
the range of 2500 and 25,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, with the highest
proportion of cells seen with 21,500/cm<sup>2</sup>.
Human MAPCs were also tested for densities between 3000 and 30,000/cm<sup>2</sup>
on 10 ng/ml fibronectin or 1% Matrigel, using aFGF, bFGF, FGF-7, 1% DMSO,
HGF, and/or FGF-4.  As with the mouse and rat cells, only those cultures
treated with 10 ng/ml FGF-4, 20 ng/ml HGF, or combination of both
were able to differentiate.  Human cells plated at 3000/cm<sup>2</sup>,
died whereas those in the 15-30,000/cm<sup>2</sup> differentiated.
Matrigel on human cells also promoted higher proportions of differentiation
as it did for rat and mouse cells (91%); however the difference with
fibronectin was not signficant.  The proportion of binucleated cells was
slightly higher on Matrigel than FN (31.3% v 28.7%).
<p>
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy was used to evaluate hepatocyte
differentation for early (HNF-3&beta;, GATA4, CK19, &alpha;FP) and late
(CK18, albumin, HNF-1&alpha;) markers of hepatocytogenesis.  mMAPCs
and rMAPCs were plated to Matrigel with FGF-4 and HGF and went from 8
to 15 &mu;m diameter on average.  After 21-28 d, ca. 60% of cells were
epithelioid and surrounded by smaller round or bipolar cells.  Expression
of liver-specific transcription factors or cytoplasmic markers was not
found for unchanged mMAPCs and rMAPCs.

Marrow Stromal Cells Form Guiding Strands in the Injured Spinal Cord
and Promote Recovery
<p class="Para1">
Marrow was obtained from male Lewis rats (Harlan, Indianapolis) killed by carbon
dioxide. Cells flushed from diaphyses, filtered through 70&nbsp;&mu;m nylon
mesh, plated to 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks.  Nonadherents removed after 24 h.
Cells to confluency, passaged 2-5 time by 0.25% tryspin, 1 mM EDTA for 5&nbsp;min.
Replating at 5000 cell/cm<sup>2</sup>.  To track the cells,
a retrovirus was constructed including GFP and aminoglycoside phosphotransferase,
which is a neomycin (G418) selection marker, prepared using LXSN vector
(from Clontech).  Phoenix amphotrophic packaging cells (see Kinsella and
Nolan) were obtained from ATCC, transfected with LXSN-GFP using calcium
phosphate precipitation.  After 48 h, viral supernatants were collected
filtered through 0.45&nbsp;&mu;m, stored at &minus;80&deg; until use.
The packaging cells were analyzed for GFP expression at the time of harvest.
For infection, 100,000 marrow stromal cells are plated to 21 cm<sup>2</sup>
plates 1 day before, then 2.5 ml complete medium with 20% heat-inactivated
FBS added in presence of 0.5 ml viral supernatant and 8&nbsp;&mu;g/ml polybrene
(Sigma).  This procedure was repeated on day 2.  By day 3, fresh medium with
20% serum (not inactivated) is used to replace infecion medium.  On day
4 cells are split 1:3 into 55 cm<sup>2</sup> place in complete medium
with 0.2&nbsp;mg/ml G418, and selection takes 14-21 days.  MSCs which stably
integrate the gene are expanded by passaging 3-9 times.  Selected cells
are confirmed by fluorescence microscopy.  The morphology of GFP-labeled
cells was not distinguishable from native MSCs.  All cells were positive
for fibronectin, vimentin, laminin.  High density cultures revealed
fibronectin-positive filaments deposited in extracellular space.
Vimentin is a mesodermal intermediate filament which stains densely in
cellular processes, and also forms a filamentous network in cell bodies.
Some MSCs (a distinct subpopulation being 37.5% of cells) is reactive
with anti-nestin.  All cells were negative for neuron-specific markers
such as NeuN, NF, Map-2, and PGP 9.5.
<p>
MSCs were treated with medium containing 2% DMSO and 0.2 mM BHA for 48 h,
to induce neuronal differentiation.  Patch-clamp recordings were not
possible, perhaps because of changes in the membrane when the differentiation
medium was replaced by extracellular solution in which osmolarity shifted
from 646 to 310 mOsm.  Differentiation with 5&nbsp;mM 2-mercaptoethanol for
48 h made whole-cell recordings possible.  Resting membrane was &minus;11.4
mV.  Use of depolarizing currents resulted in no measurable action
potentials.  Voltage step protocol was used to activate voltage-gated
currents, but no inward currents could be read, indicating that MSC
do not express sodium channels of this type.  An outward rectifying
current of 203 &plusmn; 194.5 pA was found.  The low amplitude and
the unavoidable leaks seen with recording and the leak currents make
it unlikely that the current represents a voltage-gated outward potassium
current.  Thus differentiation by 2-mercaptoethanol treatment does
not induce true neuronal properties such as action potentials or
voltage-gated sodium or potassium currents.
<p>
Female Lewis rats underwent T9 laminectomy while under halothane, and
an impact rod fitted to the NYU device was centered and dropped from
2.5 cm.  MSC were detached and suspended in &alpha;-MEM medium so that
the final concentration was 30,000 viable cell/&mu;l (trypan blue).
Animals were given either immediately or 7 days following 5&nbsp;&mu;l of the
suspension or plain media as a control.  In addition there were
two 2.5&nbsp;&mu;l injections, one 2 mm cranially, one 2 mm caudally of
the injection.   Hence about 300,000 cells are delivered or vehicle
at a rate of 0.5&nbsp;&mu;l/min using a stereotaxic frame and glass pipette
with 0.1 mm tip diameter assembled to a 10&nbsp;&mu;l Hamilton syringe.
Muscle and skin are sutured separately.  Urinary bladders must be
emptied 5&nbsp;times a day manually for first week, then twice a day thereafter.
Hindlimb locomotor function was evaluated using the open-field BBB scoring
system, in which rats are placed on a 125 &times; 75 cm open field and
observed for 4 min by two observers, and are scored 0 (flaccid paralysis)
to 21 (normal gait).  The test is performed 1 day after surgery and once
a week until the 5th week after cell injection.
<p>
Immediate injection of cells does not improve locomotor function according
to BBB scoring.  The delayed implantation produced better BBB scores
however compared to sham-grafted animals (Mann-Whitney U test,
<i>P</i> = 0.013).  Five weeks after control animals cannot support their
weight on their hindlimbs, but 7 in 12 of the treated animals can lift
their trunks, and two have regained stepping patterns with bilateral
weight support and frequent forelimb-hindlimb coordination (BBB scoring
13).  Since injected cells were tagged with GFP, these were easily
discerned in frozen sections in the 5th week, usually found in the cell
body.  Larger numbers of cells were found in animals with delayed grafting
compared to those immediately grafted.  Cells were found in the periphery
of the injury zone if they had been injected immediately, but cells
injected a week later spread throughout the injury.  Cells had a bipolar
morphology with the long processes extending along the cord axis.
Cells expressed fibronectin-IR and weakly NeuN-IR.  MSCs had lost
detectable nestin-IR and vimentin and laminin-IR.  Nestin and GFAP reveal
two kinds of glial cells.  The astrocytes marked with these two
could be found in the margin of the epicenter of the lesion, tightly
interwoven with their processes.  Some nestin<sup>+</sup>-GFAP<sup>&minus;</sup>
showed similarity to immature astrocytes; these cells migrated to the
epicenter of injury.  Neurofilament (NF)-positive cells could be located
at the interface between MSC bundles and the scar tissue.  Some fibers
in implanted cells were positive for 5-HT.  Intraspinal MSCs  did not
show immunoreactivity for GFAP, NF, MAP-2, or PGP 9.5.

  Chimerism of The Transplanted Heart
<p class="Para1">
Hearts from female donors to male recipients were examined at autopsy.
FISH of the Y chromosome using CEP Y satellite III (Vysis) with nuclear
staining with propidium iodide was performed.  Nuclei in 3 cell types
(myocytes, corornary arterioles, and capillaries) were counted.
Antibodies to c-kit (Dako), MDR1 (Chemicon) and Sca-I (Cedarlane, Ont, Canada)
were used to indicate &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; cells.  Anti-sarcomeric
&alpha;-actin (Sigma), cardiac heavy chain myosin (Chemicon), desmin,
connexin 43, GATA-4 (Santa Cruz Biotech), MEF2D (SntCrzBio), and
nestin (Dev. Studies Hybridoma Bank) were used for myocytic characterization.
Antibodies to smooth muscle &alpha;-actin were used to find smooth muscle.
Anti-vimentin was used for fibroblasts.  Antibodies to Flk1, FVIII,
and CD31 used for endothelial cells.  Anti-CD45, -CD45RO and -CD8, and
-glycophorin A were used to show myeloid, lymphoid, and erythroid cell, resp.
<p>
Female donors were 43 &plusmn; 15 y old, and death was cerebral hemorrhage
or trauma.  Duration of the implantation was 4-552 d.  All recipients
treated with immunosuppression, and only grade I (low levels) rejection
was seen except one case.
<p>
Y chromosomes were measured in male hearts of male controls to establish
the effectiveness of the technique.  In nearly half of all cells of
each type was the Y chromosome visualized.  In the natural hearts of
females, no Y chromosomes were seen.  Transplanted hearts showed Y chromosomes
about one-fifth of the level as in male control.  Smooth muslce in
arteriolies was occurred 45% of the time (positive cutoff was considered
30%).  21-50 of cells in sections of vascular endothelium were carrying Y.
They were not CD45-bearing (inflammatory) cells.  Hence a high level
of chimerism with infiltration of recipient cells to donor tissue was seen.
<p>
Small sample size did not allow correlating between level of chimerism
and time in which the donor tissue was present.  Nonetheless high levels
of chimerism were seen within 4-28 d after transplantation, and lowest
levels were seen in hearts of longest duration (396-552 d).
<p>
Proliferation was tested with anti-Ki-67.  9% of myocytes were Y-bearing,
and of these 17% were replicating, while 1% of remaining 91% of myocytes
were replicating.  10% of smooth muscle was Y-bearing, and 14%
of those were Ki-67-positive;  7% of endothelial cells were male origin
and 16% of those Ki-67-positive.  Again a small (about 1%) fraction
of cells (smooth muscle and endothelial) that were from the donor
were replicating.
<p>
In 6 of the 8 cases, donor atria were sutured to recipient atrial sections,
and there was a question about whether undifferentiated cells would
originate from tissues outside the organ or from within. c-kit, MDR1,
and Sca-1-bearing cells were indicated in cells with a typical
stem cell morphology (small round cells with large nucleus and
thin rim of cytoplasm) in the atria and left ventricle.  c-kit and MDR1
were colocalized in cells, and Sca-1 was found by itself in other cells.
This cell type was also negative for CD45, CD45RO and CD8, and for
glycophorin A.  In addition, it was not differentiated as it was negative
for cardiac heavy chain myosin, sarcomeric &alpha;-actin, desmin, connexin 43.
It was also negative for CD31, FVIII, vimentin, SmM alpha-actin,
and vimentin.  These cells were from the recipient male, since FISH
showed them to be Y-bearing.
<p>
Control male hearts had low numbers of
c-kit<sup>+</sup>/MDR1<sup>+</sup>/Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells in their
left ventricles.  Donor hearts had about 4 &times; the number
for c-kit and MDR1, and 6 &times; for Sca-1 (P<0.001 in all comparisons).
12-16% of cells positive for any of the three antigens were Y-bearing.
In both donor and recipient myocardium, 29-40% of c-kit-positive cells
were also MDR1-positive, and 14-18% of MDR1-positive cells were c-kit-positive.
<p>
Presence of transcription factors related to myocyte differentiation was
also tested.  MEF2D and GATA-4 were found in Y-bearing cells.  Flk1
receptor was also found, indicating endothelial and smooth muscle
development.  Nestin presence also indicated advanced myocyte differentiation.

Pluripotency of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived from Adult Marrow
<p class="Para1">
Murine multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) were isolated from
bone marrow as for human MAPCs, except murine MAPCs required leukemia
inhibitory factor (LIF).  Our results show that cells can be expanded
to 120 population doublings.  This is demonstrated by plating bone
marrow mononuclear cells with EGF, PDGF-&beta;&beta;, and LIF on
fibronectin-coated plates.  After 3-4 weeks, cells negative for CD45
TER119 are plated 10 per well in FN-coated 96 well plates, and then
expanded to 500-1500 cell/cm<sup>2</sup>.  With each passage they
are enumerated by a hemocytometer.  Note that 10,000 cells at about
day 20 could be said to expand to 10<sup>36</sup> cells by day 300.
<p>
Cultured cells are negative for CD34, CD44, CD45, c-Kit, MHC class
I and II antigens.  Flk-1, Sca-1, and Thy-1 are expressed at low levels;
CD13 and stage-specific antigen I (SSEA-1) are expressed at higher levels.
This was shown by using FITC-labeled antibodies to CD45, Gr-1, Mac-1,
CD19, CD3, CD13, c-Kit, SSEA-1, Sca-1, CD34, Thy-1, Flk-1,
MHC class II (I-A<sup>k</sup>), MHC class I (H-2K<sup>k</sup>), CD44,
and Ig istoype controls, and analyzeing on a FACS-Calibur, plotting both
control and specific immunoglobulin.  This mouse cell is similar to the
human MAPC, but distinguishable from HSCs said to have &ldquo;transdifferentiation
potential&rdquo;.  Morphologically MAPCs are 8-10&nbsp;&mu;m in diameter,
mostly taken by nucleus with scant cytoplasm.  The telomeric length
for 40 doublings was 27 kb, which was unchanged after 102 doublings.
The telomeric assay involves
<p>
Cells from three SD rats were isolated and cultured and more than
200 doublings were possible.  Required factors included LIF, EGF and
PDGF-&beta;&beta;.  These cells were MHC class I and II negative, CD44-neg,
and showed high telomerase activity without telomere shortening.
<p>
Two transcription factors are important in maintaining undifferentiated
human embryonic stem (ES) cells:  Oct-4 and Rex-1.  These are expressed
in mouse MAPCs, with Rex-1 at levels similar to mouse ES and Oct-4
at levels 1000-fold lower.
<p>
1% of the wells seeded with ten CD45- and TER119-negative bone marrow cells
gave continuously growing cultures.  This means 1 in 1000 such cells can
initiate MAPC cultures.  Retroviral marking was used to prove that these
cells are derived from a single cell.  After a ten cell-per-well subcloning,
3 mouse and 2 rat eGFP<sup>+</sup> populations were selected and
expanded for more than 100 doublings.  All cells  expressed eGFP after
expansion.
<p>
Differentiation from cytokine treatment was tested.  MAPCs had to be plated
at 10,000-20,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, and medium had to be free of serum,
EGF, PDGF-&beta;&beta;, and LIF.  Control cultures were ROSA26 (two
independently derived), C57BL/6, and a rat MAPC that had expanded from
40-120 doublings.  Clonal mouse MAPCs transduced with eGFP after 50, 80, and
120 and rat MAPCs transduced after 50 and 80 were also tested.
The differentiation observed was the same whether the cells were obtained
after 40 or 100 doublings, and there was no difference between transduced
cells and those not treated.
<p>
Induction to endothelium (mesodermal type tissue) was achieved by culturing
mouse or rat MAPCs that were CD31-, CD62E- and von Willebrand factor
(vWF)-negative but with low expression of Flk-1 on fibronectin with
10 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor-B (VEGF-B) for 14 d, and
more than 90% expressed CD31, Flk-1 and vWF.
<p>
Neuroprogenitors are expanded with PDGF-&beta;&beta; and induced to
differentiate by treating with bFGF (after removing PDGF-BB).  Mouse
and rat MAPCs were cultured in FN-coated wells without PDGF-BB and EGF
and in 100 ng/ml bFGF.  After 14 d, 15% of MAPCs took on morphological
and phenotypic characteristics of astrocytes (were GFAP-positive),
12% were oligodendrocytes being postive for galactocerebroside (GalC),
and 68% were neurons, being positive for neurofilament-200 (NF-200).
Cells did not express phenotype characters that were present in more
than one type of differentiated cell (NF-200, GFAP, GalC were never
found in the same cell).  Quantitative RT-PCR of the bFGF-treated
mouse cells confirmed the expression of neuroectodermal characters.
Otx2 mRNA increases 50-fold by two days and is maximal after 5&nbsp;days
with bFGF.  By day 5&nbsp;Otx1 mRNA is upregulated 3- to 5-fold, and by
day 5&nbsp;Pax2, Pax5, and nestin mRNA are increased 400-800-fold.
Cells are cultured sequentially in 100 ng/ml bFGF, 10 ng/ml FGF-8,
and then 10 ng/ml BDNF, and they develop into a more mature phenotype.
30% of cells are TH-positive and express DOPA decarboxylase.  20%
are positive as serotinin-type neurons, and 50% are GABA-positive.
In addition tau and MAP2 are expressed in the axonal and somatodendritic
compartments, resp.
<p>
To test for endodermal differentiation, cells are replated on matrigel
with 10 ng/ml FGF-4 and 20 ng/ml hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and
60% of mouse or rat cells become epithelioid in morphology, and
10% are binucleated.  60% of cells stain for albumin, cytokeratin
(CK) 18, and HNF-1.  All cells staining positive for CK18 expressed
eGFP.  These cells show functional properties of hepatocytes, including
urea and albumin production, phenobarbital-induced P450, gluconeogenesis
and LDL uptake (see Schwartz et al.).
<p>
Southern blots and flanking region PCR establish that differentiated
eGFP<sup>+</sup> mouse and rat MAPCs contain a retroviral insert also
found in undifferentiated MAPCs.  The showing that 100% of differentiated
cells being eGFP<sup>+</sup> with only a single retroviral insertion
site indicates that a single MAPCs differentiates into cells representing
the germ layers.
<p>
Either 1 or 10-12 ROSA26 MAPCs obtained after 55-65 doublings were
microinjected into 3.5 day old blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice, and the
grafted embryos transferred to prepared females.  The # litters born
and the animals per litter were comparable to results of published
experiments.  Chimerism was determined by comparing Neo/&beta;-Gal
levels (from tail clippings) in 4-week old animals with tissue from
ROSA26 mice using quantitative PCR.  In 80% of mice derived from
blastocysts injected with 10-12 MAPCs and in 33% of blastocytes
inject with 1 MAPC was their chimerism.  Chimerism ranged from 0.1%
to 45%.  Whole mouse sections were taken from mice killed at 6-20
weeks and frozen in liquid nitrogen (see Reinhardt et al, Nature
401: 101, 2001 for method), and these were stained with X-gal.
No staining was seen in animals shown to be non-chimeric by tail
clip analysi, whereas an animal which was the most chimeric (45%)
by tail clip showed the presence of many stained cells, indicating
that many cells derived from a the single ROSA26 MAPC.  Tissue samples
from multiple organs were stained with FITC-labeled anti-&beta;-galactosidase
antibody, and PCR/tail clip-positive animals showed staining in
brain, retina, lung, myocardium, skeletal muscle, liver, intestine,
kidney, spleen, bone marrow, blood, and skin.  Surface marker analysis
using direct immunofluorescence showed co-positivity of &beta;-gal<sup>+</sup>
and CD45, Gr-1, Mac-1, CD19 and CD3.  Staining for pan-CK in lung and
intestine, and CK18 in liver was shown for beta-Gal-positive cells also.
No cell stained for all 3 antigens however (CD45, CK, and &beta;-Gal).
In muscle, &beta;-gal<sup>+</sup> cells stained for dystrophin in skeletal
type, and cardiac TnI in myocardium.  &beta;-gal<sup>+</sup> cells
that were neuronal (Neu-N<sup>+</sup>) and astroglial (GFAP<sup>+</sup>)
were found throughout the brain, in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus,
thalamus, and cerebellum.
<p>
Clarke et al (Science 288: 1660, 2000) have reported that ROSA26
neural stem cells injected into mouse blastocytes produce LacZ-expressing
cells not only in the brain but in meso- and endodermal tissues of
a chimeric mouse embryo.  These results are confirmed here, with cells
not only found in mouse embryos, but also in fully developed adults.
Some LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells were seen in gonads, and it remains to be
seen whether the MAPC contribute to the germ line.
<p>
6-8 week old non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID)
mice were injected through tail vein with undifferentiated ROSA26
MAPCs;  some mice were irradiated with 250 cGy.  Since the cells
had a &beta;-gal/Neo cassette, immunohistochemistry was done for
&beta;-gal and quantitative PCR for Neo.  Tests were done 4-24 weeks
after grafting.  Engraftment was seen in blood-forming tissues (blood,
marrow and spleen) and in lung, liver and intestinal epithelium.
Engraftment is defined as &gt; 1% of immunofluorescent and/or q-PCR
cells.  The &beta;-gal<sup>+</sup> cells were also positive for
CD45 (co-staining). 38-62% of the bone marrow &beta;-gal<sup>+</sup>
also stained for Gr-1, 9-27% for Mac-1, 18-31% for CD19, and 4-11%
for TER119.

<i>Information from supplementary sections online</i>.  In previous
work with human bone marrow it was found that <b>primitive progenitors</b>
co-purifiy with <b>mesenchymal stem cells</b>.  The primitive
progenitors are <b>multipotent adult progenitor cells</b>, or <b>MAPC</b>.
Mononuclear cells were cultured with variations including fibronectin,
collagen type IV, and laminin for substrata; doses of fetal bovine
serum, EGF, PDGF-&beta;&beta;, acidic FGF, basic FGF, bone morphogenetic
protein-4 (BMP-4), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and dexamethasone.
Cells are depleted (how? by sorting?) of CD45- and GlyA-containing subpops
and cultured on 0-2% FBS, 10 ng/ml EGF, and 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB.  This
provide proliferative capacity of MAPC.  These cells differentiate
into mesenchyme, endothelium, and hepatocytes.  See
<p>
Bone marrow mononuclear cells from two 8-week old C57BL/6 mice were
depleted of CD45 and TER119 using micromagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec)
to obtain <0.1% of the total cells.  These were plated in 60% DMEM-LG,
40% MCDB-201 with 1X insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS), 1X linolenic
acid-bovine serum albumin (LA-BSA), 1 nM dexamethasone, and 0.1 mM
ascorbic acid 2-phosophate.  Alus used were 100 U penicillin and 1000 U
streptomycin on fibronectin with 2% FBS.  EGF and PDGF-BB were also added.
This medium failed to support growth.
<p>
In another experiment, all mononuclear cells were plated 100,000/cm<sup>2</sup>
with 1-25 ng/ml EGF and 1-25 ng/ml PDGF-BB on fibronectin, laminin,
collagen type IV or Matrigel.  More than 8 in 10 cells were culled
in the first week (presumably HSCs).  Cells were maintained at
2000 to 5000/cm<sup>2</sup>.  After about 3 weeks, cells negative
for CD45 and TER119 were selected (~20% of total), and subcutltured
at 10 cells/well.  Cells were maintained between 500-1500 / cm<sup>2</sup>
with subculturing every 2-3 days at 1:2 dilution, but there was no
long-term proliferation.
<p>
Mouse ES cells require LIF (see );  human MAPC express LIF-R mRNA.
The marrow from three 6 to 8 week old mice of the C57BL/6 and
ROSA26 strains were plated on the four substrata listed above,
and with doses of 1-25 ng/ml EGF, PDGF-BB, and LIF.  CD45- and
TER119-positive cells were removed after 3 weeks (leaving 20% of cells),
and these were subcultured 10/well and maintained from 500-1500/cm<sup>2</sup>.
Conditions for MAPC were fibronectin with 10 ng/ml each of EGF,
PDGF-BB, and LIF.  Surface markers reveal negativity for CD3, Gr-1,
Mac-1, CD19, CD34, CD44, CD45, c-Kit, MHC class-I and -II.  Flk1
and Sca1 are at low levels, and CD13 and SSEA-1 at higher levels.
1 in 100 of these cells are perpetually replenishing.

Repair of Infarcted Myocardium by Autologous Intracoronary Mononuclear
Bone Marrow Cell Transplantation in Humans
<p class="Para1">
20 human males (mean age ~ 50) with transmural infarction were used
in this study. Four had involvement on the wall of the left anterior
descending coronary artery, 3 of the left circumflex, and 13 of the
right coronary.  10 patients
were in a group that combined standard (balloon angioplasty with stent
implantation) therapy with injection of marrow cells, while 10 patients
refusing cell therapy were given on the standard treatment.  A mean
of 7 days after acute coronary angiography, ~40 ml bone marrow was
aspirated from iliac crest, the mononuclear cells sep'd on Ficoll
(Lymphocyte Sep Medium, BioWhittaker), and RBCs lysed with water.
10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml were placed in teflon bags (Vuelife, Cell Genix)
and cultivated in X-Vivo 15 medium (BioWhittaker) containing 2%
heat-inactivated autologous plasma.  Cells were taken next day and washed
3 times with heparinized saline; mean viability was 93%.  The heparinization
and filtration (cell strainer, Falcon) was done to prevent cell clotting
and microembolization.  28 million cells of which a mean of 0.65%
were AC133-positive and 2.1% CD34<sup>+</sup> were used for injection.
Cells were transplanted to infarcted zone 5-9 d after infarction:
a balloon catheter was placed in the artery related to infarcted zone
and PTCA was done 6-7 times for 2-4 min each.  With each PTCA, high
pressure infusions of 2-3 ml cell suspension with each containing
1.5-4 million cells.  PTCA prevents backflow of cells and produces a
stop-flow beyond the balloon position.  This permits prolonged contact
for cell migration.
<p>
After 3 months a left ventriculogram was done to assess hemodynamics.
There was a 30% vs. 12% reduction in the infarct region in the cell
vs. standard therapy group, resp.  Wall movement velocity was also
significantly improved in the cell therapy group, with only slight
and insignificant improvement in the std therapy group.  Ejection fraction
increased in both, but not significantly.  Perfusion defect evaluated
by thallium scintigraphy was significantly decreased by 26% in the
cell group.  Significant improvement in the stroke volume index
was seen.

Selectins:  Critical Mediators of Leukocyte Recruitment
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Leukocytes are recruited from the blood stream by
a 4 step process involving <i>tethering, rolling, activation,</i> and
<i>firm adhesion</i>.  At each step specific families of adhesion molecules
are involved.  <em>Selectins</em> are involved primarily in the tethering and
rolling steps.  They are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent type I transmembrane
glycoproteins which bind to sialyated carbohydrates on target proteins.
<p>
P-, E-, and L-selectins are three identified in the process.  They are
closely linked on a gene cluster on chromosome 1.  The amino terminus
contains a lectin-like domain, followed by an EGF-like domain, then
various numbers of consensus repeat (CR) domains.  A single transmembrane
domain anchors them to the membrane, and a small cytoplasmic tail is
present.  Human P-selectin contains 9 CRs, E-selectin has 6, and L-selectin
only 2, which accounts for the structural differences between the members
of the family.
<p>
P-selectin is a 140 kDa protein originally purified from platelets but
also found in endothelial cells.  P-selectin is expressed in secretory
granules; &alpha;-granules in platelets and Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial
cells.  When signaled, these granules fuse with the surface membrane to
populate the membrane with P-selectin.  IL-4, IL-3, and oncostatin M
upregulate P-selectin expression transcriptionally and translationally.
TNF-&alpha;, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and IL-1 do not transcriptionally
upregulate P-selectin, which is possibly due to absence of NF-&kappa;B
binding site in the promoter of human P-selectin; in the mouse, NF-&kappa;B
control is found and its P-selectin can be upregulated by TNF-&alpha; and
LPS.  P-selectin presence on the surface is quite short-term,
with internalization following rapidly.  It is constitutively expressed.
P-selectin is also called by various names:  CD62P, GMP-140, PADGEM,
LECAM-3.
<p>
E-selectin is found in endothelial cells as well, but it is expressed
only by stimulation with mediators such as TNF-&alpha;, IL-1., Oncostatin M,
and LPS.  After 4 h, peak expression is reached, which declines after 24 h.
Regulation is under the control of NF-&kappa;B and AP-1.  E-selectin is
slowly internalized and degraded lysosomally.
Other names of E-selectin are CD62E, ELAM-1, LECAM-2.
<p>
L-selectin is found in most leukocytes and is the only adhesion molecule
responsible for recruiting lymphocytes in particular.  It is constitutively
expressed, but shed from surface when the lymphocyte is activated.  It
goes by other names:  CD62L, LAM-1, LECAM-1, gp90<sup>MEL</sup>, DREG.
<p>
All selectins bind with low affinity to sialyl Lewis<sup>x</sup>
(sLe<sup>x</sup>) groups on the carbohydrates of ligand proteins.
P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is found on myeloid, lymphoid,
and dendritic cells.  O-linked oligosaccharides on ligand proteins must
be fucosylated the sialylated.

Mobilization by Either Cyclophosphamide or Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating
Factor Transforms the Bone Marrow into A Highly Proteolytic Environment
<p class="Para1">
8-12 wk old female BALB/C mice were divided into three treatment
groups: (1) injected subQ 2x/day with 250&nbsp;&mu;g/kg recom hG-CSF
(Amgen) for 6 d; (2) injected IP 1x with 200&nbsp;mg/kg cyclophosphamide;
(3) combination treatment with CYP on day 1, and then rhG-CSF on days
2-6.  Controls were either not injected or injected with saline.
<p>
Marrow was recovered from animals and immunohistologically stained
for VCAM-1 (rat mAb M/K2-7 againt mouse VCAM-1; binds to VLA-4
binding site in first Ig-like domain of VCAM-1).  VCAM-1 was seen to
be upregulated 3 days following the CYP treatment, declining markedly
by day 6.  This pattern was the same for the CYP/rhG-CSF treatment also.
<p>
BM cell lysates were analyzed using Western blot for VCAM-1.  The absence
of VCAM-1 in the day 6 lanes indicates that the protein must have
been cleaved from the cell surface.  If it had internalized it still
would have been detected in the whole cell lysate.
<p>
Extracellular fluids from the marrow isolation/washing procedure were
incubated with a recombinant 98 kDa extracellular domain region of
human VCAM-1 expressed in CHO cells (75% identical to murine VCAM-1 domain).

ABC Transporters as Phenotypic Markers and Functional Regulators
of Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
HSC which can repopulate the entire lymphoid and myeloid tissue of
lethally irradiated mice express Sca-1 antigen, c-kit receptor
tyrosine kinase, and no differentiation markers.  Cells can be
selected by their ability to keep Rhodamine-123 fluorescent dye
low in their cells.  Rho<sup>low</sup> cells are able to provide
longer-term reconstitution of hematopoietic cells than Rho<sup>high</sup>
cells.  Hoechst 33342 dye efflux provides the same information on
these cells, and Hoechst<sup>low</sup>Rho<sup>low</sup> cells
are highly enriched for stem cell activity.  The biological basis
of a differential efflux of dyes in not known;  evidence for
decreased mitochondrial activation is supposed for decreased retention.
However, these dyes are likely moved by transmembrane pumps called
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.
<p>
Membrane-associated ABC transporters come in two forms, as full length
transporters with identical halves containing a nucleotide-binding domain,
and as half-transporters functioning in homo- or heterodimers.  The first
candidate identified was a 1280 amino acid multidrug resistance
P-glycoprotein, MDR1.  This is also known as ABCB1.  The MDR gene is
clearly duplicated, with identical halves connected by a flexible
linker critical for pumping action.  Each molecule half features 6
transmembrane regions.

Little Evidence for Developmental Plasticity of Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
A single GFP<sup>+</sup> c-kit<sup>+</sup> Thy1.1<sup>lo</sup> 
Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> (KTLS) bone marrow hematopoietic stem 
cell was obtained using a FACS on bone marrow sample from a transgenic animal 
constitutively expressing GFP under the control of the chicken &beta;-actin 
promoter in all tissues. Ca. 18% of recipients of single GFP KTLS HSC 
demonstrated long-term multi-lineage (both lymphoid and myeloid) hematopoietic 
engraftment seen in peripheral blood (blood was analyzed by flow cytometry at 
5&nbsp;and 14 weeks after injection, with lymphoid lines determined by CD3 and 
B220, myeloid by Mac-1 and Gr-1, and B cells determined by B and B220, and T 
cells by T and CD3 double-staining.  Myeloid cells were determined by M, Mac-1, 
Gr-1 triple-marking).  In some mice reconstitution was as high as 70%.
<p>
Tissues of engrafted animals were examined 4-9 months after transplant
using standard and confocal fluorescence microscopy.  Tissues of animals
showing reconstitution with GFP<sup>+</sup> blood were stained
with tissue-specific markers and anti-CD45.  The following criteria were
used to establish that GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were transdifferentiated:
<ul>
<li>GFP<sup>+</sup> stains with specific marker
<li>GFP<sup>+</sup> does not stain with anti-CD45 mAb
<li>cell is clearly differentiated and nonhematopoietic with respect to
morphology
</ul>
<p>
Frozen sections of tissues were used.  Under these criteria the majority of 
tissues did not show evidence of GFP<sup>+</sup> non-hematopoietic tissues.  No 
GFP<sup>+</sup> cells showed transdifferentiation in lung, kidney, gut or 
muscle, and the majority of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells stained for CD45, indicating a 
hematopoietic line.  GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in muscle were negative for 
&alpha;-actinin and dystrophin.  Green cells in lung and intestine were negative 
for pan-cytokeratin.  Cells in kidney were negative for lectin wheat germ 
agglutinin (WGA), and cells in brain were negative for MAP-2.  A single Purkinje 
cell in 60 sagittal sections of the brain was nonhematopoietic and 
GFP<sup>+</sup>.  As for the liver, as little as 1 in 70,000 cells were green, 
CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>, and expressed albumin (a hepatocyte marker).  The green 
cells in liver were single and isolated, which varies with the result of Lagasse 
and coworkers finding nodules of cells when they transferred 50-1000 KTLS HSC 
into fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient mice.
<p>
The data show that HSC transdifferentiation into non-hematopoietic mature
types is not typical.  If cells from bone marrow are isolated that have
this capacity, they are probably not HSC.  Liver hepatocytes have been
found with HSC-derived donor presence and their DNA is hyperdiploid,
indicating cell fusion rather than transdifferentiaton.
<p>
To understand whether circulating HSC contribute to transdifferentiation,
wild-type mice were parabiotically joined to GFP<sup>+</sup> transgenic
animal;  two pair for 7 months, and 1 pair for 6 months.  At the end of
that period, the blood, marrow and KTLS cells were analyzed for GFP
positivity by flow cytometry (KTLS cells were stained from the marrow
isolates).  Note an advantage of parabiosis is that the host's hematopoietic
system does not have to be ablated.  Chimerism in blood and spleen is
actually observed within 2-3 days, and reaches a steady state
(equilibrium?) by days 8-10.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>.  C57BL/J were used to make the GFP transgene.  The transgenic
mice were back-crossed to C57BL/Ka-Thy1.1 for 9 generations.  Transgenic
tissues were used when mice were 6-12 wk old, and recipients (nontransgenics)
used between 10-14 wk old.  MAbs used:  19XE5 (anti-Thy1.1), 2B8
(anti-c-kit), E13-161.7 (anti-Sca-1, Ly6A/E), anti-GFP (Alexa488 conj),
anti-&alpha;-actinin (Sigma), anti-dystrophin, anti-MAP2 (Chemicon).

Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Differentiate to a Cardiomyocyte Phenotype

Human marrow as from iliac crest aspirates to syringe with 6000 U heparin.
Samples wash with Dulbecco's PBS, spun at 900 <i>g</i>.  Nucleated
cells counted, then 10<sup>8</sup> loaded to 25 ml Percoll (1.073 g/ml)
in 50 ml tube, centrifuged 1100 <i>g</i> 30 min at room temp.  Upper
layer and interface cells collected, diluted with two vols D-PBS, spun
again.  Culture was with DMEM low glucose with 10% FBS (Hyclone lot AFE5185).
Adenovirus defective in replication carrying a <i>lacZ</i> reporter under
control of either CMV immediate-early promoter or the Rous sarcoma virus
long-terminal (RSV-LTR) repeat promoter were obtained from Iowa Gene
Vector Core (Dr. Richard Anderson).
<p>
Transduction by recombinant adenovirus under RSV promoter was more effective
than under CMV promoter.  A figure showing percent <i>lacZ</i>-positive cells
vs. log MOI shows that 100% of cells are positive with AdRSV<i>lacZ</i>
and an MOI of 1000 to 1500, a value never determined for AdCMV<i>lacZ</i>
at the range of MOI used in the experiment.  One month after transduction,
90% of cells continued to express &beta;-galactosidase, while 60% of
cells continued to make the protein after 2 months.
<p>
AdRSV<i>lacZ</i>-labeled cells (500,000 to 1 million in 0.1 ml via 32 gauge
needle) were injected into left ventricular chamber of immunodeficient mice
through their diaphragm (mice are CB17 SCID/<i>beige</i> adult
males 4-10 wk old, unable to produce a B or T or NK cell-mediated
response; abdominal wall closed with 5.0 silk).  After 96 hours,
the majority of &beta;-gal<sup>+</sup> cells were found in spleen, liver,
and lung.  No hMSCs were found one-fourth of the 16 animals, which could
be due to the technical difficulties of injection.  In the remaining 12
animals, cells were found throughout the myocardium between 4-60 days.
Serial sections evaluated quantitatively provide an estimate of ca. 2200
hMSCs within the ventricle 4 days after injection of 5&nbsp;&times; 10<sup>5</sup>
cells.  Long-term at least 1 &beta;-gal<sup>+</sup> cell was found per
section.  After 14 d labeled hMSCs became rod-shaped and took on characteristics
of adjacent host cardiomyocytes.  Immunofluorescence for &beta;-galactosidase
confirmed what X-gal staining revealed (this method is less sensitive
however).  Immunofluorescence for desmin, &alpha;-actinin, phospholamban,
heavy chain of &beta;-myosin, cardiac TnT, and MyoD was performed using
monoclonal with rhodamine-conjugaged anti-mouse secondary.  As a control
the hMSCs cultured in vitro did not react with any of these antibodies.
<p>
hMSCs at the injection site and those dispersed in myocardium did not
express desmin at day 4, from fluorescence immunochemistry.
Desmin and cardiac TnT-expressing cells that were &beta;-gal<sup>+</sup>
were seen at day 14, and all identified hMSCs were positive for desmin
at 60 days.  These doubly-labeled (anti-&beta;-gal as fluorscein green,
and anti-cTnT as rhodamine red) were also positive for &alpha;-actinin,
a component of Z bands.  Engrafted cells stained for heavy chain myosin,
as well as for phospholamban, which has a role in modulating the
cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase.  A greater magnification
shows a better organization of these proteins.
<p>
There was no reaction with MyoD antibody in the hMSCs.  hMSCs transduced
to express MyoD after infection with AdRSVMyoD began to express high
levels of nuclear MyoD.  Adjacent hMSCs fused and formed multi-nucleated
myotubes.  After one month differentiated cells expressed desmin, &alpha;-actinin,
and &beta;-MHC, but there was no detection of phospholamban or
cardiac TnT.  This shows that MyoD transduction results in development
more toward skeletal muscle than cardiac muscle.

Muscle-Derived Hematopoietic Stem Cells Are Hematopoietic in Origin
<p class="Para1">
Cells were taken from the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris of
many 6-8 week old mice from C57BL/6-CD45.1, C57BL/6 ROSA26, C57/M<i>lacZ</i>
strains.  Muscle was minced and digested in 37&deg; 0.2% collagenase
type II-filtered for 30 min, then with 0.25% trypsin for 30 min.
Using 10 ml pipet cells are passed through 70&nbsp;&mu;m filter, spun down
and resuspended for separation on Percoll step gradient (3 ml 70% Percoll
overlaid with 3 ml 40% Percoll overlaid with 3 ml sample) with spin
at 770 &times; <i>g</i> 25 min (brake off).  Cells at the 40-70% interface
are resuspended in DMEM in 2% FBS.  1-2 million cells per mouse are usual.
<p>
Cells are characterized for hematopoietic markers (Sca-1, CD45, c-kit,
CD34) by both antibody staining and flow cytometry.  43% of cells
are positive for Sca-1 and CD45.  5% are Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>.
CD34 and c-kit are undetectable in any population.
<p>
Magnetic sorting for Sca-1 and CD45 were tried.  In a preparation which
is 54% Sca-1-expressing cells, an enrichment to 95% was found in the
Sca-1-positive pool, while the negative cells were 74% pure.
Cells from pools of the sort were cultured in semisolid methylcellulose
containing cytokines to promote myeloid differentiation.
Sca-1-negative and -positive colonies of muscle-derived cells both
generate hematopoietic colonies.
<p>
An average of 53% of cells in muscle preps are CD45<sup>+</sup>.  These
can be enriched by magnetic sorting to 96% purity (the negative fraction
is 99% pure).  Hematopoietic colonies were obtained only from the CD45-positive
fraction.  The CD45-negative fraction produces confluent layers of
fibroblastic cells with twitching myofibers, while the CD45-positive cells
never produce such cells.  Unfractionated muscle also generates hematopoietic
colonies but at a lower fraction;  these are typically myeloid colonies.
<p>
Lethally irradiated mice were grafted with whole bone marrow from select
mouse strains with CD45 alleles which differ by a few amino acids, to
which monoclonal Abs have been developed.  Cells from muscle of
C57BL/6-CD45.1 were fractionated and transplanted to C57BL/6-CD45.2 mice
which was co-transplanted with congeneic cells (2 &times; 10<sup>5</sup>)
of C57BL/6-CD45.2 cells.  Peripheral blood was sampled at different times
for flow cytometry.  Those animals receiving Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells show
long-term engraftment, although the extent of engraftment (activity) varied
considerably.  Cells marked for donor CD45.1 also stained for Gr.1
and Mac-1 (showing myeloid contribution), Thy-1 (showing T cells), and
B220 (showing B cells); this showed multi-lineage potential.
No Sca-1<sup>&minus;</sup> cells showed such capability.
Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells with CD45 both present and absent were obtained by
FACS and animals grafted in this competitive transplantation assay scheme,
and these experiments proved that hematopoietic potential required CD45
and Sca-1 in muscle-derived cells.
<p>
Cells from muscle of C57BL/6-ROSA26 mice expressing &beta;-galactosidase
transgenically were sorted for Sca-1 magnetically and for Sca-1/CD-45
expression by FACS.  The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of C57BL/6 mice
was injected with cardiotoxin and then 24 h later with cell treatments.
Cardiotoxin is supposed to kill differentiated myofibers and prevent
muscle regeneration.  Sham-treated (HBSS-injected) muscle did not stain
blue for X-gal.  Unsorted muscle cells successfully incorporated into
damaged muscle, forming regenerating muscle.  These included both
Sca-1-negative and -positive cells.  Sorted cells also became incorporated
into regenerating fibers.  99.2% pure Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup>
was used in the graft (the minor contamination was from a
Sca-1<sup>&minus;</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup> gate).  Cells from C57/M<i>lacZ</i>
mice, which make nuclear-localized &beta;-gal under myosin light chain
3F promoter, were fractionated magnetically for CD45 and then FACS, and
then grafted to cardiotoxin-injured TA muscle in C57BL/6 recipients.
After 2 weeks the C57/M<i>lacZ</i>-derived CD45-positive cells were
found inside muscle fibers.  Where CD45-negative cells were in
high frequency in the muscle fibers, they could be seen to stain blue.
Hence, grafted cells originally CD45-positive shifted toward CD45-negative
as they acquired a myocytic differentiation, as evidenced by expression
of &beta;-gal.

Isolation and Characterization of Multipotential Mesenchymal Stem Cells
from Feline Bone Marrow
<p class="Para1">
Bone marrow was sampled from living cats from the femur (via greater
trochanter) or humerus (via greater tubercle), or at necropsy from
flushing femur shaft.  Cells were collected in Iscove's modified
Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) with 200 U heparin/ml.  Cells were filtered
through 100 &mu;m and then spun on Percoll (1.073 g/ml in 0.15 M NaCl)
at 1100 <i>g</i> for 30 min.  The mononuclear cells at the interface
were seeded 200,000/cm<sup>2</sup> in DMEM (1 g/l glucose) with 10% FBS.
Replating in serial passaging was at 8000/cm<sup>2</sup>.  After
passage 2, medium was changed to DMEM with 4.5 g/l glucose and 20% FBS.
<p>
Typical yields of cells per bone were 425 million to 1.1 billion cells
(mean 670 million).  Mononuclear cells (BMMC) represent 10.6-23.4% of
cells (mean 16.1%).  Morphologically and with respect to growth rates
of primary cells, feline MSC are similar to human and rodents.
CFU-F were 2-20 per million BMMCs.  There was no success in growing
feline MSC in low density culture (&lt;100 MSC/cm<sup>2</sup>).
<p>
Capacity to expand was evaluated by plating 15 million BMMC into a 75
cm<sup>2</sup> flask, in which there was a mean (n = 3) of 39 CFU-F.
After 9-12 days, these single cells expand to 530,000 cells/colony,
a 13,000-fold expansion, representing about 13-14 division cycles.
A three-fold expansion occurs in the next two passages, and two-fold
expansion thereafter.  Most cultures make it to passage 6, representing
an average expansion of the MSC 70 million-fold.
Feline-specific cell surface markers were evaluated.  MSCs are strongly
positive for CD9, CD44 (Pgp-1 or H-CAM), and MHC-I, and negative for CD45
(LCA).
<p>
Differentiation tests were performed.  Confluent cells at passages
3-5 were treated 3 days with &alpha;-MEM containing 10% FBS, 10% normal
rabbit serum, 10 nM dexamethasone, 5 &mu;g/ml insulin, and 50 &mu;M
5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, then stained with 0.3% Oil Red O in
isopropanol with 0.4% dextrin (all Sigma reagents).  60 hours after
start of induction, the monolayer of cells detaches and floats as a
homogeneous mass in culture, with few adherent cells.  The mass is
triturated into single cells and stained for trypan blue (&gt; 95%
viability) and OilRed O (92% of cells show lipid droplets, compared to
5.5% of controls);  700 cells from 5 fields were scored.  If cells
are seeded at lower density and induced, they do not lose adherence
and at least 70% of cells stain positively.
<p>
Osteogenesis induction  was done by seeding cells at 6000-8000/cm<sup>2</sup>
then putting them a day later in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 mM Dex,
10 nM &beta;-glycerophosphate, and 0.25 mM L-ascorbic acid.

Matrix Metalloproteinases: Regulation and Dysregulation in the Failing Heart
<p class="Para1">
The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the myocardium as much as the myocyte
in left ventricular myocardial remodeling in congestive heart failure.
The ECM is made of fibrillar collagen, basement membrane, proteoglycans,
glycosaminoglycans, and bioactive signaling molecules.  Collagen types
I and III ensure structural integrity between myocytes, and myofibrillar
alignment within the myocyte is through a collagen-integrin-cytoskeletal
myofibril relation.
<p>
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent enzymes with about
20 species identified.  Two classes exist: (1) secreted into extracellular
space and (2) membrane-bound.  Secreted number the most and are secreted
in a pro-enzyme state, activated by cleavage of a propeptide domain.
Plasmin (a serine protease) and active MMPs can convert proMMPs to active
state.  The catalytic domain is quite conserved between MMPs, with
substrate specificity determined by a large C-terminal extracellular
binding domain:  the binding to an ECM component determines specificity
by proximity to target molecules.
<p>
Membrane-type MMS (MT-MMPs) are novel for several reasons.  As they
are bound to the membrane, their action of ECM degradation is more
focal than for secreted molecules that bind with a broader distribution.
MT-MMPs also go through an intracellular activation phase via a proprotein
convertase pathway during trafficking to the membrane (they are not
activated on the membrane).  They also have substrate specificity for
other MMPs, and activate these (MT1-MMP will process pro-gelatinase
MMP-2 and interstitial collagenase MMP-13).  MT-MMPs are also subject
to no control by TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of MMPs). 6 MT-MMPs have
now been cloned and are found in normal and diseased tissue. Fibroblasts,
vascular smooth muscle, and cardiomycotes express them.  MT1-MMP is
the most well characterized, degrading fibrillar collagen and ECM
glycoprotein and proteoglycans.
<p>
Down-regulation of MMP activity is via autoproteolysis, but also by TIMPs.
Four of these low MW have been identified and bind 1:1 with MMPs.
TIMPs also bind the pro-MMP forms, and the suggestion is that they
promote MMP activation.  TIMPs may have multiple biological activity,
found to be able to signal/regulate cell growth and metabolism in vitro.
<p>
Gene expression of MMPs appears to be controlled by neurohormones,
corticosteroids, cytokines.  The cytokine TNF-&alpha; elicits activation
of transcription factors in several cell types that promote MMP
expression.  MMP promoters contain the AP-1 response element that is
bound by those transcription factors.  Down-regulation of expression
signaled by retinoids, TGF-&beta;, and glucocorticoids may come about
processes that sequester unbound AP-1 binding proteins.  Signaling
effects from the same signal can vary with cell type:  IL-1 promotes
MMP-1 and -3 in fibroblasts but not keratinocytes;  TGF-&beta; suppresses
MMP-9 in fibroblasts, but induces in keratinocytes.  MMP-9 is under the
control of NF-&kappa;B.  Phorbol esters induce MMP expression in several
types.  There is a transmembrane protein called an extracellular
MMP inducer protein (EMMPRIN) which appears important in the invasive
nature of tumors as they spread aggressively.

Bone Marrow-Derived Endothelial Progenitor Cells Participate in
Cerebral Neovascularization After Focal Cerebral Ischemia in the Adult Mouse
<p class="Para1">
Bone marrow cells (BMC) were obtained from transgenic mice constitutive for
lacZ under control of Tie2 promoter (FVB/N-TgN, TIE2LacZ, Jackson Labs),
and 2 million cells injected IV in tail vein.  Recipient mice were
two dozen male FVB mice subjected to focal embolic cerebral ischemia
by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery as a result of placement
of a single 8 mm long fibrin rich 24 h old clot via catheter; this model

<p>
Cerebral blood flow was assessed by perfusion-weighted MRI on BMC recipient
mice at 2 hours and at 1 month after arterial occlusion.  Blood flow
was confirmed reduced in right subcortex of all mice.  However 1 month
later, blood flow was elevated at the margin/boundary of the ischemic lesion.
vWF-stained blood vessels were found to be enlarged and thin-walled at
the boundary of the lesion, with some exhibiting sprouting and intussusception.
BrdU staining verified the neovascularization.

Expansion of Human Adult Stem Cells from Bone Marrow Stroma:
Conditions that Maximize the Yields of Early Progenitors and
Evaluate Their Quality
<p class="Para1">
Bone marrow from human iliac crest was sampled and mononuclear
cells isolated with Ficoll-Paque, then grown in &alpha;-MEM + 20% FBS.
25-71 million nucleated cells were plated to 180 cm<sup>2</sup>
with 20 ml medium.  Non-adherents were discarded after 24 h
and adherents washed twice.  After 4-11 days, cells harvested
and replated 3-50 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> into a cell factory
(Nunc Cell Factory, 6300 cm<sup>2</sup>).  After another 7-12 d
cells harvested, suspended in 5% DMSO/30% FBS in medium to 10^6/ml
and frozen in liq nitrogen (passage 1 cells).  Thawing was always
done in 60 cm<sup>2</sup> culture disk, incubated for 4 days
(passage 2 cells).
<p>
Marrow was sampled from five subjects (1 female) aged 19-29 with aspirate
volumes 2-12 ml, yields from 25-71 ml.  Primary culture took anywhere
from 4-11 days, with yields from 1.3-3.1 million.  There was no correlation
between yields of nucleated cells and marrow volume, nor between rates
at which nucleated cells expanded and their plating density.
<p>
Passage 3 from one donor expanded from 10/cm<sup>2</sup> by 500-fold
in about 12 days (about 9 cell cycles), while cells at 1000/cm<sup>2</sup>
expand 30-fold (about 5&nbsp;cycles).  Cells plated at 1000/cm<sup>2</sup>
make 1.6 million per 60 cm<sup>2</sup> dish (26,000/cm<sup>2</sup>),
but cells plated at 10/cm<sup>2</sup> make 0.3 million total cells.
Cells plated at low initial densities always retain a greater potential
to form CFU-F than those plated at higher densities.
<p>
Three morphologically distinct cell types emerge with time in culture
and as a function of initial plating density (as shown for human MSCs).
Thin spindled cells (bipolar), wider spindled cells, and the widest
spindled cells are designated RS-1A, -1B, and -1C, resp.  These appear
in that order during certain days in culture, and they depend on the
initial plating density.  RS-1A last for 4 days plated at 10 and 50/cm<sup>2</sup>,
only 3 days at 100/cm<sup>2</sup>, and only two days at 1000/cm<sup>2</sup>.
RS-1B last from days 5-7 at 10/ and 50/cm<sup>2</sup>, from days 4-5
at 100/cm<sup>2</sup>, and from days 2-4 at 1000/cm<sup>2</sup>.  The
rest of the cells appear as RS-1C from the days following RS-1B up to
the 12 days of culture that observations were made.  As both time
in culture and with passage of cells, large, stellate ("flat") cells emerge.
An image analysis program was used to measure cell areas and maximal
cell widths.  No significant differences were found between average values
of areas and widths, but this was because of a large proportion of small,
spindle-shaped cells.  Significant differences were found for the 10
largest cells in typical fields.  At day 5 incubation, lighter scatter
determinations in a cytometer  show that cells plated at 50/cm<sup>2</sup>
are smaller than cells plated at 1000/cm<sup>2</sup>.  There is no
difference in cell size at day 9 however.
<p>
Cells were plated at 50 or 1000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in complete medium
and expanded 4, 7, and 12 days, then re-plated at 5000/cm<sup>2</sup>
in adipogenic medium and cultured 21 days.  Cells plated at 50/cm<sup>2</sup>
and expanded 4 days generate more adipocytes than those at 7 and 12 days.
Adipocyte count was lower than cells expanded in complete medium for 12 days
instead of 4 or 7 days.  (Oil Red O was extracted with isopropanol and
the absorbance at 510 nm measured.)  These data show that the greater
number of adipocytes come from cells plated at lower densities for shorter
time periods and that are enriched in RS-1A cells.
<p>
Adipogenesis usually involves replating at near confluency prior to induction
with adipogenic medium.  MSCs were instead grown in colonies from single
cells, plated at either 50 or 1000/cm<sup>2</sup> for 12 days, then
replated to 1.5 cell/cm<sup>2</sup> for 12 days.  These were transferred
to adipogenic medium for 21 days;  the medium was prepared as for
Digirolamo et al (1999).  Adipocytes were found in all colonies.
Cells initially plated at 50/cm<sup>2</sup> generated larger number of
colonies of adipocytes.  Cells also plated at 50/cm<sup>2</sup> show
larger numbers of colonies by crystal violet staining.
<p>
Chondrogenic potential was tested by expanding MSCs plated at 50/cm<sup>2</sup>
for 4, 7, 12 days and pelleting into micromasses of 200,000 cells, then
exposing to chondrogenic medium for 21 days.  Chondrogenic medium
was 500 ng/ml BMP-6 [R &amp; D Systems, Minn MN <a
href="http://www.rndsystems.com/">http://www.rndsystems.com/</a>],
25 mM (high) glucose-supplemented DMEM and 10 ng/ml TGF-&beta;3,
0.1 &mu;M dexamethasone, 50 &mu;g/ml ascorbate-2-phospate, 40 &mu;g/ml proline,
100 &mu;g/ml pyruvate, and 50 mg/ml ITS+ Premix.  Pellets were embedded
in paraffin, cut into 5 &mu;m sections, stained with 1% toluidine blue
and 1% sodium borate for 5 minutes.  Cells from the RS-1B fraction allowed
to expand for 7 days formed larger cartilage pellets than did cultures
expanded only 4 days and enriched in RS-1A cells, or cells expanded
for 12 days riched in RS-1C cells.  RS-1C cells (expanded in 12 days)
also formed larger cartilage pellets than the RS-1A/4 day cells.

A Stem Cell Molecular Signature: Are There Hallmark Properties
That Are Shared By All Stem Cells?
<p class="Para1">
The finding that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can differentiate
into cell/tissue types (mature liver, muscle tissue, neurons) outside
their expected lineage potential indicates that we do not know
fundamental information regarding stem cells.  Stem cells isolated
from muscle and CNS tissues also generated mature blood cell
populations.  Weissman and colleagues cast doubt on transdifferentian
(de- and re-differentiation) by reporting failure to replicate these
experiments.  Lemischka demanded better evidence (experimental
rigor) of adult stem cell plasticity.
<p>
The laboratory of Lemischka looks at gene product profiling in
mouse and human HSCs at different developmental stages in the lineage.
These stem cells are the best characterized among stem cells and are
used for this reason.  HSCs first originate in the fetal liver, then
migrate to bone marrow.  The numbers of progenitor cells which will
serve to replenish themselves as well as provide cell numbers for
differentiation are proportioned according to the cell proportions found
in fully differentiated tissue.  Studies in mice show that their stem
cells divide at least once every 3-4 weeks, necessary for steady-state
blood production.  Only 10% of LT-HSC enter cell cycle each day in
young mice.
<p>
Fetal and adult HSC gene expression profiles were compared among LT-HSC,
ST-HSC, multipotent progenitors (MPP), and lineage-committed progenitors
(LCP).  Using cell-surface markers and FACS, selective depletion of certain
stem cell populations was done (Lin, c-Kit, Sca-1, Rho, AA4.1).
mRNA was isolated from cells and amplified as cDNA using
by reverse transcription and PCR amplification (fetal liver and bone
marrow from mouse, humans).  Libraries were then screened with Affymetrix oligo
microarrays which can screen 80% of HSC-related gene products.  Bioinformatics
and sequence alignments with the major databases was done to produce
an "Stem Cell Database" (SCDb), from which annotation and
analysis/detection of open-reading
frames is done to yield a gene profile.  The percentage of genes
expressed involved in categorical functions of the cell is reported.
<p>
There is a 70% overlap between fetal and adult HSC in the gene fingerprint.
Between human and mouse, 39% of homologous genes overlapped.  These
genes probably serve a regulatory rather than structural function.
Only 283 genes are shared by stem cells of all types, both in tissue and
development (hematopoietic, neural, embryonic).  This common set of genes
is called a "stem cell molecular signature" by Lemischka and "stemness" by
Melton.  Kateri Moore has focused on the stem cell microenvironment, in which
gene expression of surrounding cells is as important.
<p>
The Princeton SCDb contains information on these sets of genes and
classifications of these genes thought to be significant to stem cells
being stem cells.  Comparisons between cells that proliferate in response
to the normal repletion of tissues/organs (maintenance and repair of injury)
and those in the abnormal proliferation (cancer) will be part of this
database.
<p>
Certain factors in the microenvironment have been identified in the
regulation of stem cells.  Wnt, Sonic hedgehog, notch family proteins,
and <i>Bmi</i>-1, a protein in the stem cell itself are reported.
Wnt induces unlimited expansion and suppresses differentiation
in HSCs, and this is seen in other tissue-specific stem cells from skin,
gut, and brain.  <i>Bmi</i>-1 is a proto-oncogene expressed in high degree
in HSC and shown to be necessary for active self-renewal (found in profiling
experiments by Clarke and workers, but not by Lemischka group).  Lessard
and Sauvageau have reported that <i>Bmi</i>-1-deficient mice show
HSCs that differentiate but do not self-renew.  Grafting these deficient
cells into wild-type mice allowed only a temporary production of a normal
pattern of blood cells, since LT-HSCs dwindled.  <i>Bmi</i>-1 also
plays a role in leukemia (acute myeloid type).  Most cases are diagnosed
in adults although leukemia is the most common malignancy in children
15 years or younger.  Leukemia may thus correlate with the remaining
number of self-renewing stem cells.  These leukemias do not arise from
more mature types but from HSCs since the cells retain properties of these.
The idea is that it takes fewer mutations to cause loss of proliferative
control in stem cells as opposed to mature cells accumulating these
and de-differentiating.  <i>Bmi</i>-1 was found not essential to onset
and progress of disease, but is essential for proliferation.
Leukemic HSCs absent of the gene make mature leukemic cells that are
not self-renewing.

Neural Crest Stem Cells Persist in the Adult Gut but Undergo Changes
in Self-Renewal, Neuronal Subtype Potential, and Factor Responsiveness
<p class="Abstract">
<b>ABSTRACT</b>.  We found neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) in the
adult gut.  Postnatal gut NCSCs were isolated by flow-cytometry and
compared to fetal gut NCSCs.  They self-renewed extensively in culture
but less than fetal gut NCSCs.  Postnatal gut NCSCs made neurons that
expressed a variety of neurotransmitters but lost the ability
to make certain subtypes of neurons that are generated during
fetal development.  Postnatal gut NCSCs also differed in their
responsiveness to lineage determination factors, affecting cell
fate determination in vivo and possibly explaining their reduced
neuronal subtype potential. These perinatal changes in gut NCSCs
parallel perinatal changes in hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting
that stem cells in different tissues undergo similar developmental
transitions. The persistence of NCSCs in the adult PNS opens up
new possibilities for regeneration after injury or disease.

Why Size Matters: Altering Cell Size
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Cell size maintenance requires a homeostatis between
synthesis and degradation of macromolecules.  There is also a correlation
between size of genome and the cell.  Some cells make several copies
of the DNA genome (polyploidy) within a cell, and the size of the
cell increases proportionally.  However, since the DNA:cytoplasm ratio
is not constant for different cell types, DNA content is not a primary
determinant.
<p>
An important axis exists that involves insulin receptor (InR) and the
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway.  Activated InR through a
substrate and interaction with a p60 adapter protein recruits PI3K
to the membrane, which then phosphorylates PI-4,5-P<sub>2</sub> to make
PI-3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>.  PIP<sub>3</sub> interacts with phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase (PDK) to phosphorylactivate protein kinase B (PK-B).  To down regulate
the pathway, PTEN is a phosphatase that converts PIP<sub>3</sub> back
to PIP<sub>2</sub>.  Studies that add or delete these functions in
<i>Drosophila</i> show affects on cell size:  these changes in function
were to seven insulin-like peptides (dILP).   Overexpression of dILP2
results in large cells, and removing one of the two copies of <i>InR</i>
reduced dIL2 ability to promote change in cell size.  Certain
neurosecretory cells were ablated and this caused loss of several dILPs
and subsequent grwoth retardation, with smaller and fewer cells.
For a number of years, it has been show that increases and decreases in
PI3K leads to larger or smaller organ sizes, respectively, and that organ
size changes mirrored changes in the sizes of cells composing them.

Muscle-Derived CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>&minus;</sup>
Progenitor Cells Give Rise to Skeletal Muscle Myotubes In Vitro
<p class="Abstract">
<b>ABSTRACT</b>. A stem cell population isolated from murine skeletal
muscle has recently been shown to differentiate into hematopoietic
cells after transplantation in vivo. In the present study, we tested
the hypothesis that this cell population would also, under appropriate
culture conditions, differentiate into skeletal muscle cells in vitro.
Lower-extremity skeletal muscle tissue isolated from 3- to 4-wk-old mice
was dissected free from bone and vessels, enzymatically digested, and
flow cytometrically sorted to yield
CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>&minus;</sup> (S+) cells.
These cells were further sorted into
CD34<sup>+</sup> and CD34<sup>&minus;</sup> fractions and
examined for skeletal, cardiac, and hematopoietic lineage-specific
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts immediately after isolation and
after a 10- to 14-d culture period. Freshly isolated
S<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells lacked expression of
skeletal-, cardiac-, or hematopoietic-specific mRNA transcripts,
whereas S<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>&minus;</sup>
cells expressed c-met, a marker for skeletal muscle satellite
cells. During 10-14 d in culture, both
S<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> and S<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>&minus;</sup>
cell populations underwent a period of attachment followed by
elongation and, ultimately, fusion to create large multinucleated
contractile myotubes expressing skeletal muscle lineage mRNA
transcripts but not hematopoietic or cardiac lineage transcripts.
We conclude that murine skeletal muscle possesses two populations
of progenitor cells that can be directly isolated. One population
expressing the phenotype S<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>&minus;</sup> may
contain satellite cells, whereas the S<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>
population is devoid of satellite cell markers. Both populations
possess the ability to differentiate into skeletal muscle cells in vitro.

Gene Delivery to Adult Neural Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
Primary mouse neural stem cells were isolated from Charles River mice
by treating lateral ventricle tissue with trypsin and hyalouronidase,
culturing in DMEM/F-12 with B27 and EGF.  Cells were then aggregated into
neurospheres.
<p>
Clontech's pEGFP-N1 plasmid with CMV promoter was used for gene delivery
studies.  Neurospheres were dissociated into single cells 24 hours before
chemical transfection with 4 known systems:  LipofectAMINE (at 3.1 &mu;l
per &mu;g DNA), Cellfectin (at 4.7 &mu;l/&mu;g), Lipofectin (at
3.1 &mu;l/&mu;g) and DMRIE-C (at 1.6 &mu;l/&mu;g).  DNA was tested at
50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600 ng to examine dose dependence.
24 hours after transfection, cells were quantitated for transfection
efficiency.  DMRIE-C was the best performer, at 11% efficiency initially,
a final 15% using optimized transfection.  There was little toxicity
with this method.
<p>
Retroviruses were then evaluated.  VSV-G pseudotyped vectors were produced
in 293 GPG packaging cells.  Cells were transfected with 25 &mu;g plasmid
for 8 hours when fresh medium was added.  Medium was replaced every day
for 8 days, and the medium replaced was centrifuged 44,000 <i>g</i> for
90 min and pellet resuspended in 200 &mu;l DMEM/F-12.  COS-4 cells were
used to evaluate titer (found to be 1.5 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> TU/ml).
Secondary neurospheres were infected at MOI=3.5 and cells cultured at
20 h and then differentiation induced.
<p>
BOSC 23 or Eco Pack packaging cells produced virus particles that either
gave no or very limited transduction.  VSV-G pseudotyped viruses have a
broad host range because they interact with the phospholipid rather than
other retroviruses that require a specific receptor.  VSV-G gave 60%
transduction efficiency in NSC.  VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus was less
effecient than VSV-G pseuodtyped retrovirus.
<p>
Clontech GFP was cloned into pQBI-AdCMV5 vector (Q-Biogene) and an
Adeno-quest kit (Q-Biogene) used to produce Adenovirus type 5.  Virus
is cleaned up using CsCl gradients, and desalted on NAP-5.  Secondary
neurospheres are infected at MOI=161, which 20 h later are plated to
polyOrn-coated glass coverslips.  Cells were fixed 24 h later in 4%
paraformaldehyde 10 min, RT, stained, and counted.  Adenovirus was the most
efficient (at 68%);  the CVADR is the receptor expressed in NSC and specific
for adenovirus.  A drawback of adenovirus transduction is altered
differentiation protocol.
<p>
VSV-G retrovirus was engineered to express neurogenin 2, a basic
helix-loop-helix protein, and the vector included an IRES followed by
eGFP.  90% of the infected cells were immunoreactive for &beta;III-tubulin
(neuron-specific);  only 1% of cell transduced with control retrovirus
were positive.  Within those cells transduced with neurogenin 2, few expressed
GFAP after differentiation, compared to cell with no virus or control virus.
Hence VSV-G retrovirus can be used to induce differentiation to neuronal
fates.
<p>
NSCs are found in the ependymal layer which lines the ventricular system,
and they are also in the adjacent subventricular zone.  Because they express
CVADR at high levels, adenovirus can efficiently infect these cells.

The Impact of Progenitor Enrichment, Serum, and Cytokines on the
Ex Vivo Expansion of Mobilized Peripheral Blood Stem Cells:
A Controlled Trial
<p class="Para1">
Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were taken from 18 cancer patients
in complete or partial remission by chemotherapy plus filgrastim.
Mononuclear cells were prepared on Ficoll density gradient, and
CD34 cells enriched using magnetic bead cell sorting (Miltenyi).
Cells were plated in IMDM with 10% FBS or in a serum-free medium of
Stem Pro-34 plus Stem Pro-34 nutrient.  A cocktail of recombinant
cytokines IL-3, IL-6, GM-CSF and EPO (10 ng/ml except for EPO, which
was 2 U/ml) was used.  This cocktail was supplemented with either
thrombopoietin (5 ng/ml) or flt3 ligand (10 ng/ml), or both (medium
replacement was every 5 days).  Several measures were made at 10
and 15 days of culture:  total nuclear cell number and viability
(by trypan blue exclusion), progenitor assay count, flow cytometry
immunophenotyping.  Fold expansion was determined to be the count of
cells on the day of count divided by those on day 0.
<p>
The progenitor assay is a CFU assay done in a single layer
methylcellulose culture.  The enriched CD34<sup>+</sup> and
mononuclear cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF, 20 ng/ml G-CSF,
10 ng/ml IL-3, 3 U/ml EPO, and 50 ng/ml SCF and seeded in duplicate
at 2000/ml and 200,000/ml.  On day 14, the BFU-E, CFU-GM, and
CFU-granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM)
were scored.
<p>
Flow cytometric immunophenotyping included use of FITC-conjugated
antibodies to the markers CD34, CD33, CD38, CD41, CD45 and glycophorin A.
As controls FITC antibodies to isotype matches were available.
Cytometry was a Coulter EPICS-2 flow cytometer with 10,000 events
per sample.
<p>
A figure is shown with five parameters measured and with 4 variables:
(i) CD34 vs. mononuclear, (ii) serum vs. serum-free (iii) flt3 ligand
presence or absence, and (iv) time of measurment (day 10 vs. 15).
The five parameters measured were total cells, CD34/CD38, CD33 (myeloid),
CD41 (megakaryocyte), and glycophorin A (erythroid).
<p>
The greatest expansion was seen with CD34<sup>+</sup> enriched cells
grown in serum, followed by CD34 cells grown in serum-free.
The mononuclear cells expanded more in serum-free medium than in
serum-dependent.  There was no effect on whether flt3 ligand was
present in the medium.  There was generally an increase in the
ratio of CD34/CD38 under all growth conditions except for mononuclear
cells grown in serum.  The presence of an flt3 ligand generally
improved the ratio.  CD33<sup>+</sup> cell expansion was greatest
among CD34 cells and mononuclear cells grown in serum, although the
expansion dropped off in mononuclear cells expanded longer
in culture (15 days); there was virtually no expansion in serum-free
culture.  CD41 cells expanded best by 15 days in CD34-enriched
cells in serum-free medium with flt3 ligand present.  And finally
the GlyA<sup>+</sup> cells derived best in mononuclear cells
in serum-free medium, with or without flt3 ligand.
<p>
Progenitor cell expansion conditions were similarly examined.
The same 4 variables were examined

Molecular and Cellular Characterisation of Highly Purified Stromal Cells
Derived from Human Bone Marrow
<p class="Para1">
The STRO-1 monoclonal antibody was used in a magnetically based cell sorting
strategy to isolate clonogenic CFU-F.  In 20 experiments, STRO-1<sup>+</sup>
cells represented 75.3 &plusmn; 3.2% of total cells, compared to an
average 6.5% prior to sorting, a 12- to 13-fold enrichment.  Immunofluorescence
ranged over 4 orders of magnitude, with a majority of cells have low
(STRO-1<sup>DULL</sup>) fluorescence intensity, with an intermediate
(STRO-1<sup>INT</sup>) and very small high level (STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>)
subpopulations of cells also present.
<p>
Cells were then sorted on FACS and each sorted set (the 3 sets based
on fluorescence intensity with the antibody) evaluated for CFU-F
content.  74% of the CFU-F were found in the tiny STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>
subpopulation, and STRO-1<sup>DULL</sup> and STRO-1<sup>INT</sup> were
depleted in a corresponding fashion.  A 950-fold enrichment in CFU-F
was found for the STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup> from the primary sampling
of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC).
<p>
VCAM-1/CD106 is a marker on BMMNC which can be selected/sorted by FACS
to obtain cells with high yields of CFU-F.  Magnetically sorted
STRO-1<sup>+</sup> were dual-labeled for STRO-1 and VCAM-1 FACS analysis
shows that about 1.4% of cells in the STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup> fraction
express VCAM-1.  The CFU-F potential was found to be restricted to
that proportion of cells which are STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup>
co-expressors.  Limiting dilution assay for CFU-F on the co-expressing
cells shows a <i>mean frequency</i> of one CFU-F-derived colony for
every three STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cells plated
(each colony is &ge; 50 cells).  The <i>incidence</i> of all clonogenic
CFU-F (the sum of the colonies plus the clusters) was one CFU-F per
two STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cells plated (from
Poisson distribution statistical description).  Of the 50% of wells
plated with single STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cells
that failed to produce clones (colonies of &ge; 10 cells), about 30%
(a significant proportion) contained single cells or small groups
of stromal cells not producing colonies or clusters in these assay
conditions.
<p>
STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cells sorted from fresh
marrow samples are large cells with heterochromatic nuclei and prominent
nucleoli, agranular cytoplasm, and numerous bleb-like projections of the
membrane.  Electron microscopy shows extensive array of microfilaments
in the cytoplasm.  Weibel-Palade bodies typical of endothelial cells
are absent in enriched sorted cells.  Strong staining in &gt;90% of
cells for collagen type I is found.  There is no reactivity with antibodies
to factor VIII-related antigen (marker for vascular endothelial cells),
or to CD45 (common leukocyte antigen).  70% of
STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cells show expression of
&alpha;-smooth muscle actin with variable intensity among individual
cells.
<p>
STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup> cells do not show Ki-67 antigen staining in flow
cytometry, indicating that these cells are not replicating in vivo.
Magnetically isolated STRO-1<sup>+</sup> and FACS-sorted
STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cells show presence of
telomerase activity, a feature of stem cells.
STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cells were cultured long
term with serial passaging and found to show 40 population doublings
before going into cellular senescence.  These cells had been cultured
in bulk, so another experiment was done to obtain colonies from single
cells, and to determine proliferative capacity for these individual
CFU-F.  29 in 35 (83%) clones (colonies) showed only moderate growth
potential that did not go beyond 20 population doublings, but the
rest (6 in 35) extended beyond this producing an average of 300 million
cells per bone marrow stromal cell.  Cells from these highly proliferative
clones were evaluated for STRO-1 and VCAM-1 expression by flow cytometry,
and while VCAM-1 expression was retained in these progeny of initiating
cells, only a median 5.3% (<i>n</i> = 6) of cells were expressing
STRO-1 epitope.
<p>
STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cells were analyzed for other
gene markers using RT-PCR.  Osteopontin, parathyroid hormone receptor,
and osteocalcin, all bone markers, were undetectable.  The early
bone cell-specific transcription factors CBFA1 and osterix were also
not present.  Lipoprotein lipase but not leptin or PPAR&gamma;2 (an early
adipocyte transcription factor) were expressed;  such a profile is
characteristic of adipocytic phenotype.  Chondrocyte lineage proteins
collagen type II and aggrecan were not expressed, but collagen type X
was consistently found (a marker in hypertrophic chondrocytes).
Bulk culture of cells of STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup>
were expanded for 2-3 passages and then induced for adipo-, osteo-,
and chondrogenesis.  RT-PCR revealed CBFA-1, osterix, and osteopontin
in induced and non-induced controls, and osteocalcin and PTH-R were
found within 4-5 weeks of osteogenic induction.  2-3 weeks after
adipogenic induction PPAR&gamma;2 and leptin expression were detected.
Prolonged treatment of cell aggregate cultures with TGF&beta;3 (well-known
chondrogenic induction protocol) induced transcription of collagen
type II and aggrecan.
<p>
STRO-1<sup>BRIGHT</sup>/VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cells from 64 highly
proliferative clones showed von Kossa (bone mineral by silver) staining
after several weeks of osteogenic induction.  95% of these same clones
formed clusters of Oil Red O-positive cells when cultured in adipogenic
medium.  In chondrogenic induction conditions, 100% of 20 clones
showed collagen type II expression by IHC.  Beyond 25 population doublings,
this plasticity to produce adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes
was reduced or lost altogether.
<p>
Capacity of cells to produce mineralized matrix in vitro does not predict
the ability of cells to organize into bone tissue in vivo.  To evaluate
this 64 highly proliferative clones were grafted ectopically into SCID
mice using hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate particles as a carrier.
After 8 weeks, the grafts of human BM cells showed extensive blood vessel
and fibrous tissue network, with bone formation evident in 35 of the 64 clones.
Of these 35, 11 also showed hematopoietic and adipose elements.  There
was no cartilage development (shown by collagen type II staining).
To verify they were human cells, an in situ hybridization probe of
human repetitive <i>Alu</i> DNA was used to show that interstitial, bone
lining and osteocytes were human.  The endothelium lining of small blood
vessel, the hemaotpoietic cells, and the adipose and muscle tissue were
murine.

Differentiation, Cell Fusion, and Nuclear Fusion During <i>Ex Vivo</i>
Repair of Endothelium by Human Adult Stem Cells from Bone Marrow Stroma
<p class="Para1">
hMSCs from bone marrow were cultured to passage 3, with each passage plated
at 100 cells per cm<sup>2</sup>, grown in medium with 20% FBS, and cultured
to ~60% confluency.  cells were electroporated with plasmid expressing
GFP under control of CMV promoter (pIRESneo; Clontech), and cells from
single G418-resistant clone used in all expts.  Some cells labeled and
tracked with CMFDA.  Small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) were cultured
under conditions specified by supplier (Clonetic, San Diego).  SAECs were
heat-shocked (47&deg;, 30 min) and cooled (37&deg;, 1-2 h) and then
250-500 thousand GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSCs or dye-labeled cells added and
left 4 weeks.
<p>
Primary SAEC will grown in serum-free, defined medium and form an
integrated confluent monolayer of large, flat with elevated perinuclear
region.  GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSCs in their medium are fibroblast-like.  When
grown alone in SAEC medium these cells proliferate slowly and develop long,
thin processes as part of a spindled shape usually.  SAECs were heat-shocked
and a majority remained adherent but many lost cell-cell contact, with holes
opened in monolayer.  GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSCs were added 1-2 h after heat
shocked cultures had been cooled to 37&deg;.  After 12 h, ca. 1% of
adherent hMSCs lost characteristic fibroblast morphology and flattened
into translucent form with epithelial cell shape.  After 24 h, many of the
GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSCs were indistinguishable morphologically from SAECs
under phase-contrast.  At 48-96 h, there was a continuous monolayer.
Similar results were seen with dye-labeled hMSCs that had not been cloned.
Control SAEC cultures that had been heat-shocked by not inoculated with
hMSCs did not repair the monolayer.  GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSC added to SAEC
monolayers not heat-shocked adhere to the surface and did not differentiate.
When this experiment was tried with heat-shocked bronchial epithelial
cells, the added GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSC also differentiation and repaired
the monolayer.
<p>
Multinucleated cells that were GFP<sup>+</sup> and just SAECs or bronchial
cells appeared during the repair process.  The GFP<sup>+</sup> cells
were positive for the markers keratins 17, 18, and 19, as well as CC26.
All these distinguish epithelial cells, and CC26 appears in clara, serous,
and goblet cells.  Immunocytochemistry for E-cadherin and &beta;-catenin
showed that differentiated MSCs formed adherens junctions with SAEC.
Undifferentiated GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSC do not stain for E-cadherin,
stain light with &beta;-catenin, and do not form pseudostratified
epithelial associations characteristic of SAEC;  they also possess single
nuclei.
<p>
Cocultured GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted by differentiation and
non-differentiation.  Isolated GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from 3 week cocultures
express keratins 17-19 according to Westerns, and GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSCs
cultured in medium only express low levels of keratin 18.  SAECs express
all three keratins.
<p>
Total RNA was extracted from GFP<sup>+</sup> cells sorted from cocultures
and assayed on mRNA microarrays with chips containing ~12,500 human genes
(Affymetrix HGU95Ab2 array).  The genes with the highest signal intensities
were scanned first with 20 selected that are characteristically expressed
in epithelial cells.  A correlation of the 20 genes was shown in
expression between total GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (the epithelial-differentiated,
EPI/DIFF) and the SAECs (Spearman rank correlation, two-tailed &alpha;=0.01,
<i>r</i>=0.8617, <i>p</i> << 0.001).  A one-sample <i>z</i> test was
used for all two-way comparisons of <i>r</i> values (6 <i>r</i> values,
15 comparisons), and 5 of 6 <i>r</i> values were statistically indistinguishable.
The remaining <i>r</i> value was for the correlation between
gene expression of GFP<sup>+</sup> isolated from cocultures (EPI/DIFF)
and SAECs, which was found statistically greater than the other 5.
This supports the hypothesis that gene expression of GFP<sup>+</sup>
cells from cocultures of SAECs resemble SAECs more than any other
culture environment (control samples).  Microarray analysis of
undifferentiated hMSC revealed expression of several transcripts found
in epithelial cells (keratin 8, cytokeratin 10, keratin 18).
MICROSAGE experiments have shown expression of keratins 8 and 10 in these
cells.
<p>
The same heat shock with added hMSCs experiment was done and cocultures
photographed every 20 min for 4 days.  hMSCs adhere within an hour,
and after 24 h, GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSC with singlei nuclei are observed
to approach and contact SAEC.  Some hMSC begin differentiation, but others
were seen to fuse with cells;  fusion was preceded by extension of a
process of the hMSC.  Targeted cells fusing rapidly became GFP<sup>+</sup>
within 20 min.  Hybrid cells were motile as single large flat cells with
two nuclei, and nuclei typically reorganized to be within a single
perinuclear region.  Several cells had 3 or more nuclei, indicating
multiple fusion.  Fused cells had lower intensities of GFP<sup>+</sup>
relative to the undifferentiated hMSC, and GFP persisted in expression
for 4 weeks.  In tracking 381 cells for 4 days, at least 53 (14%) had
fused with SAEC.
<p>
CD24 is a mucin-like glycoprotein marker for epithelial cells not expressed
in hMSCs.  After 48 h of coculture, 1.3% of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells
were GFP<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>+</sup>.  After a week this proportion had
increased to 4%.  GFP<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>+</sup> were sorted into
chamber slides, fixed, then stained with DAPI.  From 3 experiments,
754 cells were examined:  23-26% binculeated, 2-3.3% were trinucleated,
and the rest single nuclei cells.  Half or more of the nuclei in
mononuclear cells were large or irregularly shaped.
<p>
GFP<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>+</sup> cells were taken from coculture
of male GFP<sup>+</sup> hMSCs and female SAECs were examined using
FISH for X and Y chromosomes.  Some cells had a single nucleus
with a Y and an X, showing differentiation in absence of fusion.
Some cells had nuclei with a Y and three X chromosomes, showing
male-female cell fusion.  Rarely was a cell with one Y and five X
chromosomes found, indicating a male + two female cell fusion.

Gene Delivery in Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells Using Recombinant
Adeno-Associated Viral Vectors
<p class="Para1">
Gene delivery systems include viral&minus;;adenovirus, retrovirus, lentivirus,
adeno-associated virus&minus;;and non-viral&minus;;naked plasmid DNA and
liposomal DNA complexes&minus;;systems.  Short transgene expression or
host immune responses a factors in the limited success of these systems.
Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is useful in that it can provide
long-term gene expression and minimize immune responses.  AAV are members
of the parvovirus family with six known serotypes (AAV1 to AAV6).  AAV2
is the most studied, with a non-enveloped icosahedral particle about 25 nm

UF11 is a plasmid representing the rAAV2-GFP vector.  A hybrid promoter
composed of CMV and chicken &beta;-actin controls the expression of a
&ldquo;humanized&rdquo; GFP (Zolotukhin et al., <i>J. Virol.</i> <b>70</b>:
4646, 1996).  HEK293 cells are double transfected to permit rAAV2 production
(Zolotukhin et al. <i>Gene Ther.</i> <b>6</b>: 973, 1999).  Plasmid pDG
contains both AAV2 <i>rep</i> and <i>cap</i> and E2a, E4, and VA-RNA from

a freeze-thaw technique.  Virus is purified on iodixanol gradient
ultracentrifugation and then heparin-sepharose affinity.  Ag-stained

Male Lewis rats (80-100 g) are anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
(30-40 mg/kg).  After an abdominal midline incision for a laparotomy,
the infrarenal segment of the aorta was cannulated just below the origin
of the renal arteries after clamping the suprarenal aorta, the right
renal artery, and aortic branches near left renal artery.  An incision
is made in the left renal vein and the left kidney is flushed with
saline (1.0 ml cold) through the renal artery via the infrarenal aorta.
The left renal vein is then clamped and saline or rAAV2 vector injected
into left renal artery (0.125 ml/100 g body weight; 10 billion
infectious units per ml).  Note that preliminary studies showed that 100
million and 1 billion IU/ml were ineffective.  After 45 min, the cannula
is removed and the incisions in the aorta and left renal vein sutured,
the blood supply restored to kidney.
<p>
After 2, 4, and 6 weeks, left and right kidneys are fixed in buffered
formalin and immunohistochemically checked for GFP and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase,
H&amp;E-stained, and probed by <i>in situ</i> hybridization.  H&amp;E
staining revealed focal areas of chronic interstitial infiltration with
mononuclear cells, tubular atrophy, and scar formation, found in both
saline and rAAV2-GFP-injected kidney at 6 wk.  These results most likely
indicate ischemic injury caused by the procedure itself.  Tubular cells
showed very minimal GFP expression at 2 wk after transduction, but
there were 8-10 cells per 400&times; field at 4 wk, and this increased
to signficant levels by 6 wk; no expression was seen in uninjected right
kidney or in saline-injected left kidneys.  Expression of GFP was seen
only in the outer medullary region and localized to proximal tubule
epithelium which have brush border.  Glomeruli, blood vessels and interstitial
cells showed no transduction.  Some cells in the collecting duct
in the medullary region were also GFP<sup>+</sup>: these were type A
intercalated cells with positive apical H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase immunoreactivity,
colocalized with GFP.  Based on GFP results, the most frequently transduced
cells were in the S<sub>3</sub> segment of the proximal tubules.  ISH
also confirmed GFP in vector-injected kidneys, absent in saline-injected.
<p>
The kidney and other organs were evaluated after 6 wk of the use of much
higher rAAV-GFP particle does (10<sup>11</sup> IU/ml).  There was no
difference in the weight gain of saline- and vector-treated rats.
Higher transduction rats were seen in renal tubular cells according to
GFP immunofluorescence, also confirmed by immunohistochemistry; the
cells were proximal tubular and intercalated cells, as in earlier
experiments at low dose.

Characterization of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Isolated From Murine Bone
Marrow by Negative Selection
<p class="Para1">
Plastic adherent cells from mouse bone marrow are a mix of fibroblastoid
and hematopoietic cells (the latter can persist even after serial passage).
In 1999 we reported a method to maximize fibroblastic cell type yield
which minimizes differentiation.  This involves an immunodepletion scheme
using sorter and antibodies to CD11b, CD34, and CD45, removing all
plastic adherent hematopoeitic types.  23% of the original cells before
sort are present after the sort.  Mice strains differ:  for BALB/C, the
yield is only 6.8% compared to FVB/N.
<p>
Immunodepleted cells expressed CD9, CD29, CD81, variable levels of Sca-1,
CD44, and CD106.  They were negative for the following markers:  CD11b,
CD31, CD34, CD45, CD90, CD117, CD135.  RT-PCR showed that the
immunodepleted cells express NST (a "stem cell marker") and nestin ,
but not for the Oct-4 transcription factor (typical of ES cells).
<p>
Immunodepleted murine MSCs (IDmMSCs) were treated with the PPAR-&gamma;
agonist ETYA with insulin and rabbit serum and Oil Red O staining
(with TBO counterstaining) was quite apparent.  About 20-50% of cells
showed adipogenesis, and high plating density seemed to inhibit the change.
When formed into a micromass with TGF-&beta;3 present, cells showed the
effects of chondrogenesis;  TBO staining reveals an ECM rich in
glycosaminoglycans.  In a Dex/BGP/ascorbic acid treatment, cells make
high levels of ALP and form an ECM strongly staining with Alizarin Red S.
The levels of the mRNA of osteocalcin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein
were measured by RT-PCR (GADPH is a positive control) and significant
increases by days 10 and 21 of culture were seen with osteogenic cells.
This differentiation was seen when cells were cultured in micromass with
10 nM Dex present (removed after 3 weeks);  cells showed and osteoblast
phenotype and formed lacunae, and the ECM stained intensely with anti-type
I collagen and with Alizarin Red S.  This osteogenic micromass could be
difficult to interpret since it did not always form bone, but sometimes
a mix of bone and cartilage, and sometimes only fibrous tissue.
<p>
A single fracture to tibia was created with 3-point bending in murine
females, and 50,000 BrdU-labeled IDmMSCs were injected into the
hematoma that formed.  After 3 weeks tissue showed that the
donor-provided IDmMSCs were indistinguishable morphologically
from host cells.  No cells were found distal to the fracture or
in the contralateral tibia.  Real-time PCR with primers and probe
specific for mouse Y was used to analyze tissue, found in females receiving
grafts, but not in control animals.
<p>
IDmMSCs will double their numbers only after about 5-7 days in culture,
and plating cells in densities ranging from 3 to 5000/cm<sup>2</sup> has
no affect on growth kinetics.  Transcriptomes (transcript profiles)
of fresh IDmMSCs and those cultured 7 days in vitro after immunodepletion
were compared.  71 transcripts showed differences of 5-fold or greater
in 7-day versus fresh cells, with 65 (92%) of these being down-regulated.
Down-regulated genes included those involved with proliferation of cells
and cell cycle progression (hence the poor growth).  Procollagens XV and
XVIII, the Spi2 protease inhibitor, and TIE1 were also down-regulated.
FGF2 was among the few (6) that were up-regulated;  A continuous 20 ng/ml
FGF2 treatment of fresh IDmMSCs results in a significant 4.5-fold increase
in the growth rate compared to untreated cells.  Curiously, a dose
of 5 or 100 ng/ml has no effect, but the 20 ng/ml dose does (a biphasic).
Treatment of IDmMSCs with IGF, SCF, or LIF causes a measurable but
insignificant growth rate increase.  Growth rates were reduced at passage
2 regardless of treatment with exogenous mitogens.  Transcript profiles
of FGF2-treated 7-day cells showed that 53 of the 65 (82%) down-regulated
transcripts were not changed if FGF2 was present immediately after
immunodepletion.  Procollagens XV and XVIII were down-regulated 41- and
99-fold in 7-day cells but only 2.7- and 1.4-fold in 7-day cells containing
FGF compared to freshly depleted, resp.  FGF2 stimulated transcription
in 34 genes and included those specific for adipose tissue (involved
in lipid metabolism) such as adipsin, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1,
11&beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, apolipoprotein C1, and adipoQ.
FGF2 also stimulated osteogenic differentiation products such as BMP2
and Dmp-1.  Semiquantitative PCR shows that there existed differences
in the level of mRNA for adipsin, procollagen XVIII and FGF2 in freshly
depleted, 7-day IDmMSCs, and FGF-treated 7-day IDmMSCs.
<p>
7-day FGF2 treatment inhibits the ready ability of IDmMSCs to differentiate
into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts in vitro.  Cells packed into
micromasses will not show chondrogenesis (even in 6 weeks of stimulation
with no FGF2 present).  Adipogenesis is inhibited by 10-fold even with
transient exposure to FGF2.  Decreased Alizarin Red S staining of ECM
and a 3.5-fold decrease in calcium content was found with 7-day + FGF2
compared to control 7-day cells under osteogenic conditions.  The
reversibility of FGF2 treatment was tested by treating IDmMSCs for 7 days
then withdrawing FGF2 2, 5, or 7 days prior to inducing differentiation.
With the longer period between treatment and induction, more cells were
able to differentiate.  There was no difference in the number of cells
forming osteoblasts in untreated IDmMSCs and those FGF2-treated cells allowed
to sit for 5 and 7 days after withdrawal before induction.  The same
was found for adipogenic differentiation.  Chondrogenic differentiation did
not occur until several weeks of withdrawal had occurred.  This is likely
because FGF2 down regulates certain adhesion molecules necessary for
chondrogenesis.

Mesenchymal Stem Cells Modified With Akt Prevent Remodeling and
and Restore Performance of Infarcted Hearts
<p class="Para1">
Plastic-adherent cells from the marrow from male rats were detached
and CD34-negative fraction was obtained using biotinylated anti-CD34
and avidin-coated magnetic beads.  Culture was continued with &alpha;-MEM
containing Glutamax and 10% FBS and antibiotics.  By day 15, 5 million
cells were obtained.  99% of cells were positive for CD29, CD71,
CD90, CD106, and CD117.  60% expressed Ki67 and 15% the Nkx2.5 and GATA-4
transcription factors.  Cells were negative for CD34 and CD45 and
cardiac myosin heavy chein (MHC), myosin light chain (MLC), cardiac
troponin I (cTnI), &alpha;-sarcomeric actin (&alpha;SA) and MEF-2.
These were all by immuncytochemistry with 3T3
fibroblasts and HUVECs as negative cell controls, and blocking
peptides/proteins (when available) or omission of primary antibody as
immunochemical controls.  RT-PCR was used to show expression of the
gap junction protein connexion-43.  Note that the CD34-negative cells
could not be induced to differentiate into megakaryocytes and erythroid
cells.
<p>
The Clontech IRES-GFP was cloned into its pMSCV (murine stem cell virus)
vector using <i>Xho</i>I and <i>Bam</i>HI digestions.  Murine Akt cDNA
was amplified by PCR (forward: 5'-GCAAGATCTGATACCATGAACGACGTAGCC-3';
reverse: 5'-CGGTCACCGTGTCGGACTCCTAGGATC-3') and cloned ito pMSCV using
<i>Bgl</i>II and <i>Bam</i>HI.  A LacZ expression plasmid that localizes
into nucleus was obtained from Harvard Gene Therapy Initiative.
<p>
Retroviruses were used to transduce MSCs with genes containing GFP, LacZ
or mAkt (&gt;90% efficiency).  Probes obtained by PCR amplification
from genomic libraries were used specifically to find changes in endogenous
rat and exogenous mouse Akt:  the transduced MSCs showed a three-fold
increase in total signal, indicating that the mouse gene was incorporated.
The amount of mAkt in mAkt-MSCs was higher by 7.8-fold than for rAkt
in MSCs, GFP-MSCs, or LacZ-MSCs.  Hypoxia (1% ambient O<sub>2</sub>) and
serum deprivation did not affect Akt levels, although <i>Hspa1b</i>
(formerly Hsp70) mRNA increased significantly.  Immunoblotting showed
that total Akt protein increased by 20-fold in Akt-MSCs in normal oxygen
atmospheres, but were unchanged after hypoxia.  In normoxia, Akt in
transduced MSCs was phosphorylated but low phosphate was found in
cells not transduced.  Hypoxia caused an increase in phosphorylation
in all cell forms.  Akt activity was higher in Akt-MSCs at normoxia
and increased in hypoxia after 24 h compared to other cell forms.
Endogenous Akt increased in response to hypoxia in untransduced MSCs
and in GFP- and LacZ-transduced cells.  The increase in Akt activity
appeared to result in a reduction in DNA laddering, a 27% reduction
in <i>Bax</i>, a pro-apoptotic gene, and a 50% upregulation in
<i>Bcl</i>2, an apoptotic gene.  Apoptosis was reduced by 80% in Akt-MSC
cells compared to GFP-MSCs in vitro after 24 h of hypoxia (from 53%
to 9%).  5 million Akt- or GFP-MSCs were injected into adult female
rat left ventricle 60 min after myocardial infarction, and after 24 h
sections of LV were stained for c-kit and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL).  A large number
of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells were in the myocardium while a small percentage
of these were positive for TUNEL.  The c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells were still
present in the myocardium after 2 weeks.
<p>
H&amp;E staining revealed finger-like extensions of organized
cardiac myocytes in the MSC-injected infarcted hearts.  Staining
of thick sections for &beta;-galactosidase injected with LacZ-MSCs
showed the intense blue in the peri-infarct zone in nuclear portions
of the stained cells; these cells were cardiomyocytes morphologically.
With GFP-MSCs injected, large multinucleated syncytiae were seen in the
border zone with fibrillar axis oriented parallel to native tissue.
The GFP staining colocalized with staining for MHC, cTnI, &alpha;-sarcomeric
actin, and MLC.  These GFP-positive cells also were positive for connexin-43
and N-cadherin at the junctional intercalations.  Y-FISH showed these
cells were male in the female recipient.  After 3 weeks of grafting,
cells that were GFP- and Y chromosome-positive no longer expressed c-kit
or CD90.  When GFP-MSCs were injected into uninjured myocardium, not
GFP-positive cells could be found in myocardium, endothelium, smooth
muscle, hematopoietic elements or remote areas of the heart.  As another
control, GFP-transduced c-kit<sup>&minus;</sup>/CD34<sup>+</sup> cells
were injected into ischemic myocardium and no GFP-positive cells were
found in myocytes.
<p>
The &ldquo;volume of infarct&rdquo; is a measure of the size of the infarcted
area, and this was evaluated with a number of treatments.  With a control
saline injection, the volume is maximal 3 weeks after ligation of the artery.
With injection of 250,000 LacZ-MSCs, there is about 10% reduction in
V<sub>infarct</sub>, and with 5 million, a 13% reduction.  Akt-MSCs
exerted a greater reduction, with 45% reduction with 250,000 cells, and
with almost complete reduction with 5 million.
<p>
Restoration of ventricular function and performance was evaluated using
isolated, perfused, isovolumetrically contracting heart 2 week posttransplation.
(Measurements that involve confounding effects of preload, afterload,
in vivo sympathetic activity and anesthesia were not used.)  For
saline-injected controls, there was a 58% decline in LV systolic performance.
Performance was also not improved by grafting of 250,000 or 5 million
LacZ-MSCs.  However, transplantation of 250,000 Akt-MSCs resulted in
a 37% increase in baseline LV systolic pressure compared to controls.
The effect of 5 million cells was even greater.  Dobutamine inotropic challenge
did not affect the measure of performance.  Diastolic function was also
assessed:  the &minus;d<i>p</i>/d<i>t</i> indicated deterioration in
saline-injected hearts but an improved baseline with Akt-MSCs, even with
dobutamine.
<p>
5 million Akt-MSCs were injected into infarcted tissue and the tissue
examined after 5 days.  There was less CD45<sup>+</sup> infiltration
into myocardium in MSC-injected tissue than for saline controls
(36 CD45<sup>+</sup> cells versus 227 cells per high-power field).
Collagen-area fraction and myocyte diameter in histologic cross-sections
were evaluated, and with Akt-MSC injection, there was complete inhibition
of changes, similar to levels of sham-operated animals.  Injection of
5 million LacZ-MSC had no effect.  Saline-treated animals had a larger
LV mass compared to shams, but with 5 million Akt-MSCs there was no
ventricular enlargement.  LacZ-MSCs had a moderate effect on enlargement.

Stem Cells:  Fusion Brings Down Barriers
<p class="Para1">
Two papers in this issue of Nature show evidence that stem cells can
repair damaged organs, but not by turning into the cells, but instead
fusing with them.  Cell fusion has been seen in vitro, known since the
1960s.  Mice have a fatal liver disease in which the enzyme
fumaryacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) is missing.  Purified blood stem
cells from mice with the Fah gene were used to rescue the liver in
a grafting procedure.   Massive areas of the liver in the recipient
were donor cells.  In the two papers presented, results show that this
occurs by cell fusion in Fah-deficient mice.

The Role of The Grb2-p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway in Cardiac Hypertrophy
and Fibrosis
<p class="Para1">
Cardiac hypertrophy in humans usually is a consequence of hypertension
or valvular heart disease.  Cardiomyocytes cannot divide, so the response
is enlargement.  Hypertrophy can lead to arrhythmias, diastolic dysfunction,
CHF, and death.  Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 ligands are released and
the effects are not understood.  Integrins (with &alpha;&beta; heterodimeric
pairs) bind to matrix proteins on the outside of cardiomyocytes;  this
binding activates a the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) which is a nonreceptor
tyrosine kinase.  This kinase recruits another nonreceptor TyrKinase,
c-Src, the adapter molecule Grb2, and other signaling intermediates.
The integrin activation works together with G proteins to help cardiomyocytes
grow.  Experiments with balloon-induced ventricular stretch in rats shows
rapid activation of FAK with an association of it with Grb2, and these
activating the ERK1/2 kinases.  Another lab showed activation of FAK and
c-Src, formation of Grb2 with FAK, and activation of p38 MAPK.  Moreover
use of an integrin &beta;<sub>1D</sub> inhibitor blocked phenylephrine-induced
hypertrophy and ANF expression.  Also expression of a dominant FAK negative
form, or a mutant unable to bind Grb2 blocked hypertrophy and ERK activation
in cultured cardiomyocytes.  Grb2 is a scaffolding protein with two
Src-homology type 3 (SH3) domains flanking a single SH2 domain.  SH3
dominas bind polyproline peptide sequences, and SH2 binds phosphotyrosinylated
peptide sequences.   The SH3 of Grb2 binds to a polyPro motif in the
Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS, and SH2 binds the PTyr present
in FAK, Src, and receptor tyrosine kinases.  It is known that <i>Grb2</i>
&minus;/&minus; mice are lethal, with defective endodermal differentiation
and unable to form epiblast.  Heterozygotes are normal at birth and fertile,
but the Grb2 content is reduced by 40-50% and there is a defect in T cell
signalling.  ERK activation is normal in <i>Grb2</i>+/&minus; mice, but
p38 MAPK and JNK activation are reduced.
<p>
Thus heterozygotes were used as a model for cardiac hypertrophy.
Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was done on 12-week wild-type <i>Grb2</i>+/+
mice and the ventricular tissue removed after 7 days.  TAC models
ventricular pressure loading that induces hypertrophy. Immunoprecipitates
were obtained using an anti-FAK antibody, and then immunoblotting was
done on these precipitates using anti-Grb2 antibody.  Results show that
Grb2 associated with FAK in the TAC-treated mice, but not in shams.
<p>
Strain 129/SvJ mice known to be heterozygous for <i>Grb2</i> show normal
cardiac structure and function (identical echocardiographic results with
wild-type) at 12 weeks.  Anti-Grb2 immunoblotting of ventricular lysates
shows a relative 40% reduction in protein expression compared to heterozygotes.
When TAC-treated heterozygous mice are examined, the association of Grb2
with FAK was also markedly reduced.
<p>
Heterozygous mice were subjected to TAC and left 7 days (12 of 13, 92%,
survived).  Ventricular lysates were subjected to anti-phospho-JNK
and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK immunoblotting:  compared to wild-type mice,
p38 MAPK and JNK activation were seen to be markedly decreased.
ERK kinase activity in ventricular lysates was assayed using an Elk-1
substrate, and activity was seen to increase in both TAC-treated
heterozygous and wild-type mice, although the increase in ERK activity
was slightly less in heterozygous in some experiments.
<p>
With TAC of wild-type mice, LV hypertrophy is evident in 7 days, along with
the biochemical changes.  The increase in the ratio of LV weight to body
weight is 25-30%.  Heterozygotes however showed no hypertrophic changes,
and the difference with wild-type homozygotes was statistically significant.
Echocardiography revealed a 39% increase 7 days after TAC in <i>Grb2</i>+/+
homozygotes, but only a 5.4% increase in heterozygotes.  The failure to
observe hypertrophy in heterozygotes was not due to a failure of TAC, since
the increase in proximal systolic aortic pressures was not different.
Histological examination of myocardium in +/+ homozygotes revealed
myocyte enlargement, myofibrillar disarray, and fibrosis, but in +/&minus;
heterozygotes the architecture was typical of a normal structure.
<p>
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine expression of certain
markers known to be altered by hypertrophy.  <i>&beta;-MHC</i> and <i>ANF</i>
transcription was increased in the wild-type 129/SvJ but not heterozygotes;
the increases were 23-fold for &beta;-MHC and 18-fold for ANF.
<p>
Many experiments have associated hypertrophic changes with changes in
p38 MAPK activity, but none has shown that Grb2-mediated p38 MAPK activiation
is required for hypertrophy.  Transgenic mice with dominant negative
mutants of p38&alpha; and p38&beta; MAPK were employed (the mutations
were in the Thr-X-Tyr activation loop).  DN-p38&alpha; or DN-p38&beta;
are put under the control of &alpha;-MHC promoter and incorporated as
transgenes into Swiss Black mice.  The lines expressing the highest
activity were employed (10 copies in DN-p38&alpha; mice and 15 copies
in DN-p38&beta; mice, both viable and fertile).  DN-p38&alpha; mice
exhibit reduced p38&alpha; MAPK activity and DN-p38&beta; mice show
reduced p38&beta; MPAK activity in ventricular lysates immunoprecipitated
with anti-phospho p38 MAPK.
<p>
These transgenic mice were then subject to TAC.  15 of 19 DN-p38&alpha;
mice and 11 of 17 DN-p38&beta; mice survived the procedure, a rate similar
in non-transgenic littermates.  In survivors hearts were examined 7 days
later, and there was a 34% increase in LV weight/body weight of
nontransgenic Swiss Black mice compared to 32% in DN-p38&alpha; and
51% in DN-p38&beta;.  By echocardiography, these increases were 48% in
nontransgenes, 39% in DN-p38&alpha; and 61% in DN-p38&beta;.
Cardiac hypertrophy in the transgenic mice was not due to a more intense
or robust aortic constriction as the increases in the proximal
systolic aortic pressures between wild-type and the transgenes did not
differ.
<p>
p38 MAPK is activated by MKK3bE and MKK6bE immediately upstream, and these
forms activated in a cardiac-specific way result in a phenotype of
cardiac interstitial fibrosis, systolic contractile dysfunction,
and induction of fetal markers;  moreover these particularly transgenic
mice do not develop hypertrophy.  DN-p38&alpha; and &beta; transgenics
were subjected to TAC.  Trichome staining 7 days later showed no evidence
of fibrosis with the myocyte enlargement, contrasting with the Swiss Black
mice nontransgenics that showed both cell enlargement and fibrosis.
<p>
ANF gene expression was evaulated.  It is induced in all TAC-treated groups,
both transgenics and the nontransgenic SB mice.  Cardiac <i>SERCA</i>
and <i>MCAD</i> gene expression were reduced on the other hand in all
lines.

Cardiac Progenitor Cells from Adult Myocardium:  Homing, Differentiation,
and Fusion After Infarction
<p class="Para1">
Cardiomyocytes make about 20-30% of adult mouse heart tissue, with the
balance being fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle, and endothelium.
A myocyte-depleted fraction of cells were isolated from heart by collagenase
digestion (perfusion with 0.1% collagenase, 30 min, 37&deg;); this treatment
usually kills myocytes, filtering through 70 &mu;m mesh.  Flow cytometry
showed that 14-17% of cells were Sca-1<sup>+</sup>, a 7-fold enrichment
compared total cells.  These cells are small and close to basal lamina,
express platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CD31), and are
in proximity to endothelial Sca-1<sup>&minus;</sup> CD31<sup>+</sup>
endothelial cells.  These cells are negative for CD4, CD8, B220, Gr-1,
Mac-1, and TER-119, all hematopoietic line markers.  They are also negative
for Lin, c-kit, Flt-1, Flk-1, vascular endothelial-cadherin,
von Willebrand factor, and CD45 and CD34.  They do not thus seem
to be hematopoietic progenitors or stem cells, endothelial progenitors,
or mature endothelial types.
<p>
Bone marrow cells were digested with collagenase and characterized by flow
cytometry both with and without collagenase digestion (the digestion did
not affect marker quantitation):  60% of cells Lin<sup>+</sup>,
70% CD45<sup>+</sup>, 35% CD31<sup>+</sup>, and 60% CD38;
negative for c-kit, CD34, Flk-1, and Sca-1.  CD31 and CD38, the receptor
for CD31, are cell-cell binding molecules.  Peripheral blood cells were
also typed and only 1 in 150,000 possess the Sca-1<sup>+</sup>,
lin<sup>&minus;</sup> CD45<sup>&minus;</sup> CD31<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup>
phenotype.  Total cardiac cells were also characterized for Hoechst 33342
dye staining and 3 in 10,000 cells showed dye efflux ability, the
&ldquo;side population.&rdquo;  In bone marrow, these make up 5 in 10,000
cells.  These SP cells were &gt;93% Sca-1<sup>+</sup> and unlike
bone marrow cells, they lack CD45 and c-kit.
<p>
The Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cell fraction was &gt;96% (five or more rounds
of magnetic separation) and the Sca-1<sup>&minus;</sup> was &gt;99%.
Telomerase activity was assessed using a telomeric repeat amplification
protocol, and activity was detected only in Sca-1<sup>+</sup> and not
Sca-1<sup>&minus;</sup> cells, at levels found in neonatal myocardium.
Telomerase activity is essential in proliferating cells.
<p>
RT-PCR was used to examine for transcription of the following cardiac-specific
genes:  &alpha;- and &beta;-MHC (myosin heavy chain), atrial and ventricular
myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2a and MLC-2v), cardiac and skeletal &alpha;-actin,
and muscle LIM protein/cysteine-rich protein-3.  None of these were found
in Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells.  Most of these were detected in
Sca-1<sup>&minus;</sup> cells.  Sca-1<sup>+</sup> did not express
Nkx2.5, and there were minimal levels of SRF.  GATA-4, MEF-2C, TEF-1
were all cardiac-specific transcription factors found in Sca-1<sup>+</sup>
cells (also reported in bone marrow stromal cells with cardiogenic potential).
Flt-1 and Flk-1 were examined by RT-PCR and found negative, consistent
with flow cytometry results.  Sca-1<sup>&minus;</sup> cells expressed
Tie-2 and angiopoietin-1, markers for vascular endothelial cells also
showing in marrow SP cells.
<p>
Microarray profiles found additional info.  Bop and popeye-3 are
cardiogenic transcription factors not found in the cardiac Sca-1<sup>+</sup>
cells.  CD45, CD34, c-kit, Flt-1 were not detected (as with flow cytometry).
Lmo2, GATA2, Tal1/Sc1 were not found (hematopoeitic stem cell transcription
factors).  What was found in Sca-1<sup>+</sup> was largely cell cycle
mediators, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines.  DNA methyltransferase-1,
histone deacetylase-1, Notch effector Hes1, and Groucho-binding proteins
runx1 and runx2, and these are all transcription repressors.
RT-PCR and microarrays were used to verify that Oct-4 and UTF-1 were
not present.
<p>
Makino et al. reported that 5-azacytidine can induce cardiac differentiation
of marrow stromal cells.  These were treated for 3 d in 3 &mu;M
5-azacytidine.  Cells developed multicellular spherical structures
and then flattened after 2 wk.  At 4 wk, 5% of cells were positive for
sarcomeric &alpha;-actin and 3% of cells for cTnI;  untreated cells did
not show this.  The genes Nkx-2.5, &alpha;MHC, &beta;MHC and type 1A
receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (<i>Bmpr1a</i> were all induced
and invovled in heart development.
<p>
Deletion of <i>Bmpr1a</i> is lethal in gastrulation although it is essential
in cardiac organogenesis.  Mice with genotype <i>Bmpr1a</i><sup>F/&minus;</sup>
with one loxP-flanked and one null allele were treated with adenovirus
having LacZ vs. Cre.  PCR confirmed the disruption of <i>Bmpr1a</i>
by Cre;  quantitative real-time PCR was used to compare differentiation.
<i>Tbx5</i> and <i>BMP-4</i> did not require 5-azacytidine for expression,
which occurred without dependence on <i>Bmpr1a</i>.  Deletion of
<i>Bmpr1a</i> impaired induction of BMP-2, MEF-2C and particularly
&alpha;-MHC.  Only Nkx-2.5 was induced by 5-azacytidine but unaffected
by knockout of <i>Bmpr1a</i>.
<p>
Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells were labeled with membrane dye PKH2-GL and injected
I.V. after induced ischemia/reperfusion.  At 24 h, 8 &plusmn; 0.5 in 1000
cells of the left ventricular myocardium but not present in the infarct.
Other parts of the body&minus;;the uninfarcted regions, lung, liver, kidney
showed presence of cells.  Sca-1<sup>+</sup> were also found in spleen.
Cells were still present in myocardium at 2 wk (considered engrafted),
seen in 10 of 14 mice, with an average of 5% involvement in the tissue.
More than 60% of cells stained for sarcomeric &alpha;-actin, and donor
cells were identified as 18% of cells in the infarct border zone.
If Sca-1<sup>&minus;</sup> were also injected, the Sca-1<sup>+</sup>
were 200-fold less.
<p>
A Cre/Lox recombination system was used to identify donor/recipient cells
more definitively.

Infarct Remodeling After Intracoronary Progenitor Cell Treatment
in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction (TOPCARE-AMI):
Mechanistic Insights From Serial Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging
<p class="Para1">
The demographic and pre-operative clinical data were obtained for
26 patients with acute MI (AMI) and given a variety of drugs
relevant to anticoagulation and inotropism.  Patients were given
intracoronary infusion of progenitors obtained from bone marrow (BMC)
or circulating blood (CPC).  To get BMC, 50 ml bone marrow aspirate
was taken, and for CPC, 250 ml venous blood (all within 24 h AMI).
Mononuclear cells were obtained according to described paper, cultured
ex vivo for 3 days then re-infused by over-the-wire balloon catheter.
Blood flow was blocked 3 min using balloon to permit adhesion.
This was done 3 times for the 10 ml infusion, with 3 min re-flow to
prevent ischemia.
<p>
The BMC suspension was characterized by FACS analysis with direct
antibodies to human CD34 (FITC, B-D), CD45 (B-D), and CD133 (Miltenyi).
About 5.5 million CD34/CD45-positive and 0.7 million CD133-positive
in total of 240 million cells were infused.  &gt;90% of the CPC
(mean cell count injected 13 million) were endothelial in nature,
shown by several markers:  DiI-acetylated LDL-uptake, lectin binding,
expression of markers VEGF-R (Relia Tech), endoglin (CD105) (NeoMarkers),
vWF (Oncogene), and PECAM-1 (CD31) (Dianova).  The ability of cells to
migrate was determined by suspending a sample of cells in 0.5 ml
endothelial basal medium and placing 20,000 CPCs or 1 million BMCs
in modified Boyden upper chamber and placing this in 24-well dish
containing endothelial basal medium with either 50 ng/ml VEGF for CPCs
or 100 ng/ml SDF-1 for BMCs;  after 24 h in 37&deg;, lower side filter
washed and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, then DAPI-stained and nuclei
counted in 5 random fields.
<p>
Global LV function was evaluated at engraftment and 4 months later.
Significant increases were seen in ejection fraction at mean to 44.1
to 48.9%,  and end-systolic LV volume decresed from 69.4 to 59.5%.
End-diastolic LV volume was unchanged (121.6 ml before, 116.9 ml after).
LV mass decreased slightly be significantly from 84.6 to 78.6 g/m<sup>2</sup>.
<p>
Regional LV function was assessed as well.  The count of akinetic
segments per patient fell from means of 2.7 at administration to 1.2
after 4 mon, and normokinetic segments increased from 9.9 to 12.3.
<p>
Infarct size was measured as late enhancement (LE) volume.  23 showed
hyperenhancement, and 22 had it at 4 month followup.  LE volumes decreased
signficantly ~20%, from a mean 46 to 37 ml.  Regional LV ejection fraction
in slices with hyperenhancement increased from 43 to 47% (p &lt; 0.005).
And there was a correlation between global and regional ejection
fractions within LE segments (<i>r</i> = 0.8, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).
There was no correlation between LE volume at engraftment and future
improvement in either global or region EF in slices with hyperenhancement.
There was a significant correlation between LE volume reduction and
improvement in global EF and wall thickening at 4 month followup.
<p>
Various factors in global improvement of contractile function were
analyzed by correlation to change in ejection fraction, and testing
the significance.  Age, sex, CK-MB max, time between infarct and MRI,
time between MRI and cell therapy, infarct region (anterior/inferior),
progenitor cell type used (BMC/CPC), intial LE volume, dysfunctional
vs. viable (as found by MRI) and reduction in LE volume were analyzed.
Only the negative correlation between reduction in LE volume and
&Delta;EF was found significant.
<p>
The count of infused progenitor cells did not correlate with improvements
in global or regional LV function or reduction in infarct size.  This
was true despite attempts to correlate total cells and subpopulations.
Migration of cells were evaluated in 15 of the 26 patients.  VEGF-induced
migration in CPCs range from 0.8-56 cell per hpf, with median 11 cells/hpf.
SDF-1-induced migration of BMCs was from 13.5-102 with median 52/hpf.
A significant relationship between migratory capacity and reduction
in LE volume was seen.  In patients receiving cells showing higher
migratory capacity, the reduction in LE was significantly greater.
Multivariate ANOVA of factors that influence infarct size or factors
that were signficant or nearly significant statistically was used to
evaluate independent predictors of infarct remodeling.  Sex, age,
time to revascularization, baseline EF, baseline LE volume, and
low/high migratory capacity of infused cells were evaluated for
standardized coefficient &beta; for change in LE volume.   Only
the baseline EF and the migratory capacity were significant, with
migratory capacity being the best predictor.
<p>
These results extend the previous study that engrafted progenitors
shows benefits in LV remodeling in AMI patients.  Hypoxic tissues
appear to elaborate VEGF and SDF-1 and may constitute homing factors.

Osteoinduction by Ex Vivo Adenovirus-Mediated BMP2 Delivery Is Independent
of Cell Type
<p class="Para1">
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were obtained from healthy
human donors using Ficoll-Paque PLUS to enrich mononuclears plated at
5 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, and detached prior to reaching
confluence.  Adenovirus type 5 was constructed to contain BMP2 substituting
the E1 region (Ad5-BMP2) using <i>in vivo</i> homologous recombination in
293 cells.  Ad5F35-BMP2 is a recombinant like Ad5-BMP2 except that it
is a type 35 fiber.  Additionally there are control vector Ad5-lacZ, a
reporter with CMV promoter-driven control; Ad5F35-HM4, which has no transgene
cassette.  Particle to pfu ratios are 12.5, 56, 20, and 562 for
Ad5F35-BMP2, Ad5-BMP2, Ad5-lacZ, and Ad5F35-HM4.  A549 cells were used
to evaluate whether wild-type virus (replication-competent adenovirus or RCA)
was present.  Cells are infected with virus in low serum (2%) overnight
and then serum is readjusted to normal (10%).
<p>
Ad5F35-BMP2-infected cells made more BMP in vitro than did Ad5-BMP2 cells.
BMP2 was not detected in cells transduced with control adenoviral
vectors Ad5-lacZ or Ad5F35-HM4.  Western blots showed that only extracts
of cells transduced with Ad5F35-BMP2 produced BMP2 in amounts sufficiently
detectable in blots.  A549 cells infected with 2500 particles Ad5-BMP/cell
produced more BMP2 than cells infected with Ad5F35-BMP2 at the same
particle/cell ratio.  Moreover, in studies with other cells, human skin
fibroblasts and diploid human fetal lung cells (MRC-5), infection with
10,000 virions/cell produced levels of BMP2 using Ad5-BMP2 that were detectable
in westerns whereas BM-MSCs did not show detectable levels.  No real
differences were seen with infection of SF, MRC-5 or BM-MSCs with Ad5F35-BMP2
as shown by westerns with standard curves of BMP2.
<p>
BM-MSCs, SFs, and MRC-5 cells were infected with MOI=2500 with all vectors
constructed.  5 million cells were then put into 100 &mu;l PBS and the
hind limbs of NOD/SCID mice injected bilaterally in the lateral region
of quadriceps muscle with 1 ml syringe/18-gauge needle.  (That's 24 mice:
3 cell types &times; 4 vectors &times; duplicate mice per group).
Animals were sacrificed after 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 14 d and the bones of
hind limbs fixed in neutral formalin.  Heterotopic bone formation was
evaluated radiographically and histologically.  Limb bones were
exposed 83 s to 31 kV energies for both anteroposterior and lateral
projections; images were digitized to 800 dpi according to gray levels.
Histologic evaluation was done by EDTA decalcification of fixed bone,
embedded in paraffin and 5 &mu; sectioning.  Sections were H&amp;E-stained.
Others were developed immunohistochemically with anti-human Mitochondrial
mAb 1237 (not cross-reactive with mouse), and counterstained with hematoxylin,
then dehydrated and cleared.  The histology was consistent with radiographic
results, where Ad5F35-BMP2 cells formed significant new bone.  This
new bone did not continue from the periosteum of the femure, but was found
between muscle fibers and split the muscle layers.  MRC-5 cells transduced
with Ad5F35-BMP2 were the best at forming cartilage.  Cell types infected
with Ad5-BMP2 produced little or no bone.
<p>
Cell origin was evaluated using antibody to human mitochondrial protein.
The staining pattern is typically punctate and could be seen between muscle
fibers on day 2.  Similar cell counts are seen on day 3, fewer on day 5,
and no stained cells are seen on days 6 and 7, either in bone or cartilage.

Adenoviral Gene Transfer of eNOS: High-Level Expression in Ex Vivo
Expanded Marrow Stromal Cells
<p class="Para1">
Ad5RSVeNOS is a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus carrying
bovine eNOS under control of RSV promoter. Ad5RSVntlacZ is a type 5 virus
which carries nuclear-targeted &beta;-galactosidase reporter under control
of RSV (both from Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core).  rMSCs came from
marrow of 6 wk Brown Norway rats grown in &alpha;-MEM + 20% FBS P/S/amphoB.
Adherents grew to confluence in about 7 days (passage 0).  Subculturing was
1:3 and passage 1-5 cells were used in all experiments.  For transduction
cells were plated at 10,000/cm<sup>2</sup> in 6-well plates or 25 cm<sup>2</sup>
flasks overnight.  Treatment was 48 h at various MOI (300, 1000, 1500,
and 2000).  Cells were immunostained for eNOS expression and efficiency of
transduction was &gt;60% for MOI=300 and &gt;90% for MOI=2000.  Cell
viability was &gt;90% for all MOI.  The lacZ viral vector showed &gt;90%
efficiency at MOI 300, and viability was comparable.
<p>
rMSCs were extracted for Westerns using anti-eNOS.  No bands were seen
for uninfected rMSCs or lacZ viral vector-infected rMSCs.  Only extracts of
cells infected with the eNOS viral vector showed bands, and this was
dose-dependent.  Endothelial cells were also infected with Ad5RSVeNOS, and
the expression in these was lower than for rMSC.
<p>
rMSCs were infected at MOI 2000 for 48 h and then grown in differentiation
media for 21 days.  In osteogenic medium, alizarin red S staining revealed
ossification changes.  This was not seen if the infected cells were not
induced by osteogenic medium.  The same was true for adipose cells, as
revealed by Oil Red O staining.  59% of cells differentiated into osteoblasts
in both control and Ad5RSVeNOS-infected rMSCs.  35 and 37% of cells in
Ad5RSVeNOS-infected and control rMSCs differentiated into adipocytes, resp.
Thus transduction does not affect plasticity.
<p>
eNOS expression was evaluated quantitatively in differentiated cells.
9% of cells were positive at day 21 in osteogenic medium, and 33% of cells
were positive in adipogenic medium at 21 days.  Positivity was maintained
even in differentiated cells (osteoblasts and adipocytes).
<p>
rMSCs were transduced with MOI=300 Ad5RSVeNOS particles for 48 h.
After washing cells extensively with PBS (3 times), cells where then treated
in low-serum medium (&alpha;-MEM + 2% FBS) for 21 days (medium changed
every 2-3 d).  &gt;60% of cells were expressing eNOS after only 2 days
but that number dropped to &gt;30% at 21 days.
<p>
500,000 Ad5RSVeNOS-transduced (MOI=300) cells were injected into corpus
cavernosum of adult (aged) Brown Norway rats and eNOS positive cells found
after 7 d in the proximal, mid, and distal corpus sinusoids.  More cells
were found in the endothelium.  Westerns verified this work, and that eNOS
expression was increased after 7 d.  Cavernosal nerves were stimulated
and changes in intracavernosal pressure were measured:  increases in pressure
and area under the curve were significanly greater with Ad5RSVeNOS-transduced
cells than in PBS-treated or Ad5RSVntlacZ cells (see table)

Ex Vivo Gene Therapy in Autologous Bone Marrow Stromal Stem Cells for
Tissue-Engineered Maxillofacial Bone Regeneration
<p class="Para1">
E1-deficient adenviruses with an insert coding for bone morphogenetic
protein 2 (BMP-2) were provided.  E3 is purposely kept in the genome
because it inhibits host immune response. 293 cells produce 10<sup>8</sup>
pfu/ml.  A specific anti-BMP-2 mAb is used to detect the antigen.
The medium from virus-transduced cells is recovered since BMP-2 is
a secreted growth factor:  immunoprecipitation recovers a 21 kDa band
that is additionally immunoreactive on Westerns.  The band was not present
in the supernatant of culture medium from Ad-&beta;gal-transduced MSCs.
MSCs even possess the tools to process post-translationally the propeptide
form of BMP-2.
<p>
Defects in the maxilla of miniature pigs were created bilaterally by
extraction of bone and periosteum.  A bioresorbable polylactic acid
plate was used to stabilize the defect and prevent soft tissue from
invaginating into it.  3 ml of collagen type I-cell mixture gelled and
implanted into the defect.  After 3 months healing had progressed well
without complications and with evidence of ossification.  The infraorbital
maxilla region was examined in sacrificed pigs.  For animals treated with
the BMP-2-transduced cell-collagen mix, there was uniform visible bony
formation.  For animals treated with &beta;gal cell construct, islands
of bone formation of variable thickness and marked notching in the
infraorbital rim were found.  3-D computed tomography (CT) confirmed
gross histological results.  A quantitative analysis using Analyzer
software was used to evaluate the 3-D CT images with bony formation,
and differences were judged signficant (2.63 vs. 1.78 cm<sup>2</sup>).
<p>
Histological sections were stained by H &amp; E and demonstrated cancellous
bone formation for BMP-2 cell constructs, with mature woven <i>de novo</i>
bone.  Osteoblasts were seen in the margins at the periphery of new bone.
Von Kossa staining revealed strong positive coloring indicating thorough
mineralization.
<p>
The BMP-2 MSC-collagen bone at 3 months was compared to normal maxilla bone
using a biomechanical stress instrument.  There was no significant difference
in maximal compressive strength (80.6 vs 81.6 MPa, only a 1.2% difference).
The effect size of the difference was 0.19, considered small.
<p>
Antibody to adenovirus hexon protein was used to stain the bone constructs.
Results were positive for BMP-2 cell constructs <i>in vitro</i>, but no
staining was seen in bone 3 months after implantation.  The adenoviral
vectors are thus removed.

Adult Human Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells Are
Capable of Adhesion-Independent Survival and Expansion
<p class="Para1">
50 million Ficoll-enriched bone marrow cells (BMCs) were placed in 50 ml
suspension culture of siliconized flasks and left 3 weeks.
No adherents were found in the spinners or in subculture.  Cell
suspensions were passed through 70 &mu;m filter to ensure absence
of aggregates.  Cultures were grown without added cytokines, with
SCF, IL-3, PDGF, SCF + IL-3, SCF + PDGF, or SCF + IL-3 + PDGF.
SCF + PDGF resulted in &gt;5-fold expansion in 21 days, but these
cells lost osteogenic plasticity.  Greater cell numbers were seen
with SCF + IL-3 than in the no-cytokine or SCF + IL-3 + PDGF groups.
<p>
As controls, cells allowed to adhere to flasks were grown in the same
conditions.  50 million cells were placed in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks
and a yield of 1-1.6 million cells were obtained after 3 weeks,
growing to 3.8-12 million cells after 6 weeks.  Far more cells
were grown by suspension culture however, according to the results.
<p>
Cells were selected into CD45-positive and -negative cells using
EasySep (SCT) immunomagnetic separation.  86.9% of cells in negative
batch were negative by flow cytometry.  About 80% of the cells in this
preparation showed values of CFU-F and CFU-O that were in that proportion.
<p>
(A colony forming unit-osteoblast, or CFU-O, assay involves plating
cells at 10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>, and 10<sup>5</sup> into
35 mm dishes in differentiation medium of &alpha;MEM + 15% FBS,
with antibiotics penicillin, gentamicin and amphotericin B, and including
10 nM dexamethasone, 50 &mu;g/ml L-ascorbic acid.  &beta;-glycerophosphate
to 3.5 mM is included in medium after multilayering of cell is observed
at about 2 weeks.  Media changes are 3 &times;/week for 5 weeks.  When
nodular areas form, cells are treated with tetracycline medium for 48 h,
fixed in Karnovsky's, then visualized on ChemiImager 5500.)
<p>
CD117 is the stem cell factor receptor (SCF-R), CD123 is the IL-3&alpha;
receptor (IL-3a-R), and CD45 is the common leukocyte antigen.  After
3 weeks in culture, significant differences were seen between the cells
first placed in suspension (57% CD45<sup>+</sup>, 13.7% CD123<sup>+</sup>,
and 1.6% CD117<sup>+</sup>) and those cells analyzed when grown in suspension
with SCF + IL-3 present:  CD123<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> were a significant
proportion in cytokine-treated medium.
CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>CD105<sup>&minus;</sup> and
CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>CD123<sup>+</sup> were found in signficant numbers
upon sorting and formed CFU-F when plated in assay (CD105 is endoglin).
Phenotypically these latter two cell types are different than typical
adherent cells.  Cells were also typed for MHC Class I (HLA-A, -B, -C)
and Class II (HLA-DR, -DP, -DQ) and the initial seed of cells were
17% HLA<sup>&minus;/&minus;</sup> (homozygous negative) and increased to
60% of those cells after 3 weeks.  No HLA-negative homozygous cells are
found in adherent cell cultures:  by passage 1, 36% of cells are
HLA<sup>+/+</sup> and by passage 2, they are 96% of cells (HLA-A, -B, and -C).
<p>
Suspension cultured cells were grown under CFU-F conditions (at 10,000
cells/cm<sup>2</sup> initial plating).  Colonies seen were
&alpha;-naphthyl acetate esterase-positive.  H&amp;E stains showed typical
fibroblasts forming the colony expressing type I collagen (shown by
immunofluorescence).  There were no statistically significant differences
between CFU-F counts from cells grown in suspensions containing SCF + IL-3
or SCF + IL-3 + PDGF.  There were fewer CFU-F counts in cells obtained
from adherent cultures containing SCF + IL-3.  CFU-F frequency from
Ficoll-enriched input cells is 1 in 6000 cells (approx).
<p>
Cells grown in suspension containing SCF, PDGF, SCF + PDGF did not
form cells with osteogenic potential.  Cells grown in suspension containing
SCF + IL-3 or SCF + IL-3 + PDGF showed a significant expansion compared
to cells from the no-cytokine grown suspension and produced determinable
CFU-O counts.   There was also a difference in CFU-O expansion between
SCF + IL-3- and SCF + IL-3 + PDGF-treated cells:  CFU-O expansion in
SCF + IL-3-treated cells continued for a minimum of 6 weeks.  Most cells
allowed to adhere (and detached continuously at various time points) that
were grown in SCF + IL-3 lost bone-forming potential.  Cells not detached
regularly but allowed to adhere and always grown in SCF + IL-3 retained
a higher potential to be bone-forming, but only 10% of the cells retained
that potential compared to suspension cells.
<p>
Total RNA from cultured cells forming osteogenic nodules was isolated and
semiquantitative RT-PCR performed with primers to human Cbfa1/Runx2,
human collagen type I, human osteocalcin, human alkaline phosphatase,
human bone sialoprotein gene, and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase.  Results show that suspension cells expressed the
Cbfa1/Runx2 (a transcription factor regulating osteoblast differentiation),
as well as express osteocalcin (demonstration of fully mature osteogenic cell).
<p>
CFU-F and CFU-O values were linearly correlated to the number of BMCs
plated over the range 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup>.  Such a correlation
suggests that a CFU-F initiating cell may be the CFU-O initiating cell
(although no data in this report proves that).  Ficoll-purified cells
have a CFU-F of 1 in 6200 and a CFU-O of 1 in 15,600.  Cells grown
in suspension for 3 weeks in SCF + IL-3 had CFU-F of 1 in 4200 and
CFU-O of 1 in 5100.  Because the CFU-O value is enriched significantly,
the growth conditions may have been a factor in selecting for these
progenitors.
<p>
While the proportion of CD45<sup>&minus;</sup> increased with cells
grown in SCF + IL-3, the absolute numbers of CD45<sup>+</sup> also
increased although their expansion was not as great as CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>
cells.  CD45<sup>&minus;</sup> growth was cytokine-dependent, more rapid
than in adherents.  A correlation was observed for the increase
in total counts of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in suspension and the increase
in total counts of adherent CD45<sup>&minus;</sup> cells, indicating
an interaction between cell types.  When no cytokines are present in
medium, CD45<sup>&minus;</sup> adherent cell expansion is modest and
CD45<sup>+</sup> counts decrease in suspension.

Treatment of Myocardial Ischemia with Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal
Stem Cells Overexpressing Hepatocyte Growth Factor
<p class="Para1">
Cells from bone marrow of 180-250 g Wistar adult rats was loaded on
20-60% Percoll gradients and spun 900 <i>g</i> for 30 min.  The top
two-thirds of the gradient was recovered and Percoll removed by PBS washing.
Cells are cultured in DMEM-LG/10% FBS.  Cells were spindled, adherent.
MSCs cultured in 5-azacytidine for 10 d stained positive for &alpha;-sarcomeric
antibody.
<p>
Marrow MSCs were infected with Ad-GFP at different MOI values.  The higher
the MOI the better the response: an MOI=150 produced little toxcity and
high efficiency.  Cells were co-infected with Ad-HGF (hepatocyte growth
factor) and Ad-GFP and the culture medium assayed for HGF by ELISA.
2 d after infection peak levels of 128 ng/ml HGF were obtained.  HGF
expression under adenovirus control continues for at least 2 weeks.
The ability of MSCs to differentiate myogenically was not affected by
infection with Ad-HGF.  Proliferation was also not affected, according to
the MTT assay.
<p>
Female rats whose left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated
were injected with 5 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> MSCs that had been
infected with Ad-HGF or Ad-GFP.  Injection was into the &ldquo;LAD risk
areas at three sites, including ischemic border and infarcted areas.&rdquo;
For positive control group, 10<sup>8</sup> Ad-HGF was also injected into
LAD risk areas.  4 weeks after engraftment, hearts were removed and stained
with 1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride.  Section were H&amp;E stained.
Capillary vessels counted in 200&times; fields, with 5 hpf randomly
selected in ischemic region, vessels in that field counted, and then
averaged for each field.  Capillary count was definitely higher in hearts
receiving Ad-HGF-infected MSCs, with collagen content reduced.
<p>
After 28 d engraftment, two middle slices of the heart were evaluated for
size of infarction and myocardial morphometry.  Infarct size was reduced
in group given Ad-HGF-infected cells compared to controls.  Moreover cells
transplanted into the scar of failing heart improved its function.
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was decreased but left
ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and LV peak velocities of contraction
and relaxation (<i>dP/dt</i><sub>max</sub>) increased substantially compared
to control and Ad-GFP group.
<p>
MSCs from male rats carrying HGF or GFP were injected into the ischemic
region of female rats.  After 4 weeks, <i>sry</i> gene-positive cells
were identified by peroxidase staining of cells probed by in situ
hybridization.  The cells were morphologically identical to surrounding
cardiomyocytes.

Pluripotent stem cells identified in multiple murine tissues
<p class="Abstract">
<b>ABSTRACT</b>.  Pluripotential stem cells (PSCs) have been
recently described in many tissues including skeletal muscle,
brain, and bone marrow. However, the true nature of these cells
is still unclear, and their precise definition has yet to be
determined. We hypothesized that a common, rare population of
PSCs with a broad tissue differentiation potential can be
identified in multiple murine tissues and that these cells
are capable of transdifferentiation into cells of different
primordial germ layer origins in response to diverse
microenvironmental cues.  To examine this hypothesis,
we isolated phenotypically defined cells from murine
skeletal muscle and cultured these cells under different
conditions tailored to promote differentiation into several
cell types including myocytes.  We report here that in conditions
permissive for hematopoietic differentiation, muscle-derived
CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>&minus;</sup>
cells differentiated into cells
expressing hematopoietic-specific mRNA; while in conditions
promoting myogenic, neuronal, and adipocytic differentiation,
cells morphologically typical of these cell types expressing
tissue-specific markers were identified 9-14 days in culture.
When CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>&minus;</sup>
cells from muscle or bone marrow
were transplanted intracerebellarly into Purkinje cell
degenerative (pcd) mice, the behavior of these mice improved
28 days after transplantation relative to mice injected with
vehicle alone, suggesting that these cells contributed
to the appearance of functional neuronal cells that may
have improved the ataxic condition characteristic of these mice.
Phenotypic analysis of single cell suspensions prepared from
brain, blood, and intestinal epithelium revealed the presence
of CD45<sup>&minus;</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>&minus;</sup>
cells in varying degrees.
These studies suggest that a phenotypically common,
multipotent cell can be identified in different tissues
and that this cell may represent a universal pluripotent
stem cell residing at different levels in multiple murine tissues.

One Strategy for Cell and Gene Therapy:  Harnessing the Power of Adult
Stem Cells to Repair Tissues
<p class="Para1">
Cohnheim said that all cells derive from the bloodstream and thus must
ultimately derive from the marrow.  Some experiments ruled out that
noninflammatory cells were involved in healing.  Small stem-like cells
are present in muscle, fat, liver, synovial membranes, and brain, and
likely serve to repair these tissues.
<p>
Some reports challenge the evidence that bone marrow can repair
nonhematopoietic tissue.  Wagers et al. transplanted single hematopoietic
GFP-producing cells into irradiated mice and examined parabiotic mice where
one of them was the GFP transgenic.  They challenged the idea that
hematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into nonhematopoietic cells.
Differences in experimental conditions included the subpopulations of
cells used and in the sensitivity and stability of genes to mark the donors.
Castro et al. labeled HSCs (SP cells) with <i>lacZ</i> and did an i.v.
infusion into irradiated mice.  After examining brains from recipients
and found a failure of bone marrow to transdiff into neural cells.

Plasticity of Marrow-Derived Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
Plasticity represents the flexibility of stem cells to cross lineage
boundaries and adopt expression profiles and functional phenotypes of
cells unique to other tissues.  Hematopoietic stem cells are only those
cells that can reconstitute the hematopoietic system of a myeloablated
host.  In mice isolation of HSC starts with lineage depletion by removal
of cells with typical markers of committed cells (CD11b for macrophages
and granulocytes, CD3 for T lymphocytes, B220 for B cells, Ter-119 for
red cells); the cells that remain are Lin<sup>&minus;</sup>, and purity
of HSC increased 1 to 2 orders.  The next step might be sorting out
cells actively excluding Hoechst or rhodamine dyes, or selected for
CD34<sup>+</sup> or for CD34<sup>&minus;</sup>.  In humans, the
CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>&minus;</sup> is HSC-rich.  Side population
(SP) cells, so named because they represent a cluster of cells low in
fluorescence for Hoecsht dyes to the side of the main population of cells
that have higher fluorescence, possess transporters of the ABCG2 family.
Whether SP cells in tissue represent resident stem cells or progenitors
of bone marrow origin that have migrated there remains a question.
HSCs of the type that reconstitute systems are often lineage-depleted
and then size-fractionated, and finally by an ability to home rapidly to
the BM of a lethally irradiated host.  A single cell from this can provide
long-term reconstitution 1 in 5 times injected into a lethally irradiated
host.
<p>
Marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are those that adhere to plastic and can
differentitate into adipocytes, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts.  Many
isolation techniques include physical selection, immunomagnetic depletion
or sorting, and use of cytokines (FGF2, FGF4, PDGF-BB, LIF).  Phenotypic
markers have no agreement, although it has been reported that Stro 1,
CD13, &alpha;-integrins (CD49a and CD49b), &beta;1-integrins (CD29),
hyaluronate (CD44), transferrin (CD71), Thy1 (CD90), VCAM-1 (CD106),
and IL-4R (CD124) are present on these cells.  It is generally agreed
they are nonhematopoietic (CD45-negative).
<p>
Multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) represent highly plastic,
adult-derived BM cells, and isolated from mice, rats and humans.
They are first selected with MSCs as adherents, but culture conditions
changed to elicit them (highly minimal medium, use of growth factors).
These can produce cells with markers for the three different germ layers.
MAPCs from transgenic mice that express &beta;-gal constitutively to
identify donor cells have been placed in murine blastocysts and later
produced chimeras with cells in all tissues.  IV administration of MAPCs
in sublethally irradiated immunodeficient mice differentiate to hematopoeitic
cells (in marrow, blood, spleen) and epithelial cells in liver, lung,
intestine.  Their replicative ability has been seen with a high telomerase
activity.  The MAPC may be a cell type that emerges through rigorous
in vitro selection processes rather than the successful isolation of
a cell that exists in vivo.
<p>
Alternatives to transplanation of bone marrow stem cells from a donor
to a recipient who differs genotypically or phenotypically and is
immunosuppressed or irradiated is to use parabiotic connections of the
circulatory system in which one animal is transgenic and whose cells can
be tracked or marked, or where male-female parabiosis is used and the
Y chromosome tracked.  Y chromosome FISH is technically demanding and
must control for false positives from nonspecific binding.
<p>
BMSC engraftment as hepatocytes has been shown in rats, mice, and humans
with male donor cells in female recipients, where liver damage provided
the stimulus.  Liver damage in rats induced by hepatotoxin and 2-acetylaminofluorine
(2-AAF prevents repair by endogenous cells) was followed by BMSC replacement
confirmed by Y-FISH and transgene expression.  In mice, the liver damage
was the result of myeloablative irradiation or chemotherapy, and Y-FISH
had identified donor hepatocytes.  KTLS (Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup>
Sca<sup>+</sup> Thy1<sup>lo</sup>) BM cells were injected to help in the
recovery of an inborn error of metabolism gene defect in hepatocytes, one
which is fatal;  as little as 50 cells from a ROSA-26 (&beta;-gal) transgenic
donor eventually allowed recipients to be weaned from a drug that keeps them
alive.  The strength of this study is that hepatocytes were functional.
<p>
How do cells exit from marrow and engraft as cells differentiating into
types that form tissue and organ in a recruitment to damaged organ?
Stromal derived factor-1&alpha; (SDF-1&alpha;) and its receptor CXCR4 play
a role in the homing of HSC to BM.  It has been shown that hepatocytes
will express SDF-1&alpha; in response to liver injury where oval cell repair
is called.  Oval cells can be derived from BM and HSC, and these cells
also express CXCR4, allowing BMSCs to mobilize and to home into to the
liver.

Stable Reprogrammed Heterokaryons Form Spontaneously in Purkinje Neurons
After Bone Marrow Transplant
<p class="Para1">
Bone marrow from transgenic C57BL/6 mice ubiquitous for expression of GFP were
injected into tail veins of lethally irradiated syngeneic mice.  After
several months, Purkinje neurons expressing GFP were found indistinguishable
morphologically from unlabeled Purkinje neurons, soma in Purkinje cell
layer (PCL) and large apical highly branched dendritic tree into cell-sparse
molecular layer (ML).  One axon extends into granular cell layer (GCL) and
through into white matter.  Laser-scanning confocal microscopy shows
the descending axon.  Other GFP cells present including microglia and
macrophages and throughout the brain.
<p>
GFP-expressing cells were examined for tissue-specific markers.
GFP<sup>+</sup>.  Calcium-binding <b>calbindin</b> is specific for Purkinje
neurons and this is show in GFP cells.  CD45 is a pan-hematopoietic marker
for bone marrow cells, CD11b for macrophate/microglia, F4/80 and Iba1
are also microglia markers, and the GFP cells with Purkinje neuron morphology
were negative for antibodies to these markers.  However the GFP cells
that looked like macrophages and microglia were positive for hematopoietic
markers.
<p>
Mice at 2 months of age were injected with bone marrow and then counts
of GFP-positive Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum scored in 20 mice over
a 1.5 year period (life span of mouse usu. 2 years).  Generally no GFP
neurons could be seen until several months after engraftment.  the maximum
count was 60 neurons in one mouse after 1.5 years.  The count of cells
increased linearly and correlated in a statistically significant way with
age.
<p>
Laser-scanning confocal microscopy was used to look at serial 1 &mu;m
optical sections of the entire body of a GFP-positive Purkinje neuron.
This was done 300 times to reconstruct the soma, and in two nuclei were
always seen.  The neuron also had not only primary dendrite from the
soma, but secondary and tertiary dendrites.  The endogenous Purkinje nucleus
was enlarged, had disperse chromatin, and prominent nucleolus.  The putative
BMC-derived nucleus was highly compact with condensed chromatin.
<p>
Bone marrow was transplanted from male donor mice into females.
Texas Red-labeled Y chromosome probes were available for FISH.  Brains from
females engrafted 1 year earlier were sectioned at 12 &mu;m and stained for
GFP and counterstained with To-Pro3 to visualize nuclear DNA.  A motorized
stage was used to assess 1 &mu;m optical section in all 3 dimensions
of sections digested with proteinase K prior to FISH staining (it was necessary
to locate GFP stains, then to re-stain for FISH, and used computerized
re-tracking and re-location).  The male nucleus could clearly be identified
by the Y-FISH staining and distinct from the female.  There was no
cytokinesis or karyokinesis, and fused cells showed stable heterokaryons
over time.
<p>
Half of GFP-positive cells had the large 'Purkinje-like' nucleus with
dispersed chromatin, and a the small bone marrow-like nucleus.
In other cells, both nuclei were Purkinje-like.  There were a range of
nuclear morphologies that were scored.  Results indicate that once fusion
occurs, the bone marrow-derived nucleus starts to resemble the Purkinje-like
nucleus, with a transition from dense compact chromatin to disperse large
nuclei.
<p>
Bone marrow from a transgenic mouse whose GFP expression is under the
control of a Purkinje-specific promoter (L7-<i>pcp</i>-2) was injected
into recipients.  The brains of transgenic mice donors had been sectioned
and the specific expression of GFP already confirmed:  only Purkinje neurons
were GFP-positive.  Moreover flow cytometry of bone marrow cells from the
L7-GFP animals indicated no flourescence from GFP (identical patterns with
marrow cells from nontransgenic wild-type animals), and distinct (signal
3 orders magnitude difference) from marrow cells from transgenics with
constitutive GFP expression.
<p>
4 recipients were killed 5 months after getting L7-GFP and cerebella
analyzed in all mice.  2-3 fully mature GFP-positive neurons in each mouse,
correlating with the count of cells as age goes on.  These were all binucleate.
No GFP-positive cells had microglial or macrophage-like features, although
these are present in GFP-expressing donor grafts where GFP is not under
specific control.  This indicates that the donor nucleus was re-programmed
after cell fusion.  Hence results seen previously in vitro are now confirmed
in vivo.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>. Recipient mice were killed by pentobarbital
lethal injection, brains perfused with PBS then buffered 4% paraformaldehyde,
with brains then removed and placed in phosphate-buffered 20% sucrose
overnight; 45 &mu;m thick sections were cut with sliding microtome;
sections soaked in anti-GFP (M Probes) for 12 h at 4&deg; after 2 h block
with 5% goat serum 3% BSA, 0.3% TX-100.

Bone Marrow Stromal-Derived Soluble Factors and Direct Cell Contact
Contribute to De Novo Drug Resistance of Myeloma Cells by Distinct Mechanisms
<p class="Para1">
In previous work it was shown that myeloma and leukemia cells adhere to
fibronectin with significantly increased resistance of cells to cytotoxic
drugs which include topoisomerase II inhibitors.  Mitoxantrone is a
topo II inhibitor lacking the fluorescence of the more typically used
anti-myeloma doxorubicin.  We examined the complexity of cocultures
to see the effect of MTX on myeloma cells if they were present with other
cells.
<p>
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were obtained from human iliac crests
and enriched for mononuclear cells on Ficoll-Hypaque and grown in
&alpha;-MEM + 10% FBS until 4-6 weeks.
BMSCs are primarly CD54<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts with some CD68<sup>+</sup>
macrophages; there is no CD31 positivity for endothelium and no
thrombomodulin.
<p>
H929 and BMSC coculture was for 24 h, followed for 24 h by
drug treatment.  With 1 and 2 &mu;M MTX for 24 h, H929 grown in suspension
cell death is 21 and 49%, resp.  In the cocultures, H929 cell death is
12 and 28%, resp.  Cell death was determined by the TUNEL apoptosis
assay (cells collected and washed by PBS, stained with PE-conj anti-CD38
antibody, then fixed 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS 15 min on ice, washing 2x
with ice-cold PBS, resuspending in 70% ethanol, and holding 2 h at
&minus;20&deg; and then staining with Apo-BrdU kit in which permeabilized
cells are labeled with BrdUTP with terminal deoxytransferase for 1 h at
37&deg;, then incubated with antibody to BrdUTP; two-color flow cytometry
tests for apoptosis and CD38).
<p>
A similar coculture and assay was done for BMSCs and RPMI 8226 myeloma
cells.  Cell death results were also the same.  This indicates that two
myeloma cell lines have signals leading to apoptosis reduced in the presence
of BMSCs.
<p>
To determine if this was the result of differences in drug accumulation
(reduced drug uptake) with and without the presence of BMSCs, cocultures
and myeloma suspensions were treated with <sup>14</sup>C-MTX.  There were
341 &plusmn; 112 cpm with suspension cells vs 282 &plusmn; 69 cpm with
cells adhering to BMSCs, which was no significant difference.  Thus
any difference in cell death is not the result of differences in drug
uptake.
<p>
Each well of a 6-well plate was plated with 10<sup>6</sup> H929 or RPMI 8226
cells with BMSCs already confluent on the floor.  After 2 h nonadherents
were removed by washing 3 &times; with serum-free medium.  About 70%
of myeloma cells remain adhering to BMSCs.  Cells were then treated
1 h with MTX and then left 23 h in medium without drug.  Myeloma cells
were tagged as CD38 cells using fluorescent anti-CD38, and the TUNEL
assay run to and then detected on CD38-gated cells.  The results showed
that cells adhering to BMSCs had their drug toxicity reduced 2.5-fold
(87.3% death for suspended cells vs. 37.5% death for adhered cells, P=0.03).
Duration of cell-cell contact before drug exposure did not alter these
results.
<p>
To determine if soluble factors are involved between stromal and myeloma
cells in the progression of multiple myeloma, BMSCs were separated from
either H929 or 8226 myeloma cells using Transwell inserts.  MTX-induced
cytotoxicity was reduced 2-fold in H929 when BMSCs were present (49% viable)
compared to H929 in suspension (23% viable).  Similar results were found
for 8226 cells.  Cells then exposed to medium conditioned with BMSCs showed
no difference in their survival compared to cells exposed to medium not
conditioned.  Thus myeloma cells and BMSCs must interact to enhance the
survival of MSCs to toxic drugs:  perhaps myeloma cells stimulate through
soluble factors BMSCs which then produce soluble factors that affect myeloma
cells, or BMSCs stimulate myeloma cells.

Controlling Mesenchymal Stem Cell Differentiation by TGF&beta; Family Members
<p class="Para1">
The TFG&beta; superfamily includes the TGF&beta; members, the bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), activins, and growth and differentiation
factors (GDFs).  These are all secreted dimeric proteins.  TGF&beta;1
was originally identified  by its ability to induce anchorage-independent
growth in rat kidney fibroblasts.  BMPs were first seen inducing bone
and cartilage at ectopic sites.  Activins were identified as factors
stimulating FSH release from pituitary and which potentiate erythroid
differentiation.
<p>
Many of current functions of TGF&beta; in mesenchyme differentiation have
been observed by human genetic disorders and mouse knock-outs.
Camurati-Engelmann disease is a sclerosis and progressive diaphyseal
widening of long bones due to TGF&beta;1 defect.  BMP2 or BMP4 defects
lead to embryonic lethal mutations.  BMP3, BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7 defects
lead to skeletal abnormalities.  A syndrome in humans affecting the ear,
patella, and short stature is seen comparably in mouse K/Os for <i>Bmp5</i>,
except that the human gene for BMP5 shows no mutation.  Mutations in
<i>CDMP1</i>, which codes for human GDF5, lead to chondrodysplasia
or brachydactyly.  In mice absence of GDF5 leads to brachypodism, and
GDF8 (myostatin) inactivation causes muscle overgrowth in mice and
&ldquo;double-muscled&rdquo; cows.
<p>
Receptors for the TGF&beta; family are heteromeric complexes of two
types, type I and II (also known as activin-like kinases, ALKs).
These are single transmembrane receptors with Ser/Thr kinase activty
whose targets are Smads.  Phosphorylated Smads are transcriptional
activiators which translocate to the nucleus to activate pathways that
signal for osteogenic differentation.
<p>
Noggin, Chordin, DAN family members, Sclerostin, Follistatin, and FSRP
(Follistatin-related protein) are extracellular proteins able to interfere
with the TGF-R/ligand interaction.  Noggin mouse mutants show excessive
cartilage formation and do not form joints;  also neural tube, somite,
and skeletal patterning is abnormal.  In humans the <i>NOG</i> gene results
in proximal symphangalism or multiple synotses syndrome I;  patients with
fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), which is progressive ossification
of striated muscle, also show <i>NOG</i> mutations.  Chordin has a structure
like Noggin, but its function is unknown, and null mutations in mice give
viable embryos with no bone formation defects.  <i>Dan</i> is
<i>D</i>ifferntial screening-selected gene <i>a</i>berrant in
<i>n</i>euroblastoma, a secreted protein that binds and inhibits BMP.
Cerberus and Gremlin are related BMP antagonists.  Mice null for Dan
or Cerberus are viable without bone formation defects.  Sclerostin
is encoded by <i>SOST</i> gene (<i>Sost</i> in mice) and is a secreted
Cys-rich protein with weak but significant sequence identity with Dan,
and mutations in <i>SOST</i> cause a progressive sclerosing bone dysplasia
seen as gigantism, syndactyly, massive overgrowth in skull, mandible and
long bones.  Sclerostin binds to BMPs and inhibits their signaling.
<p>
Follistatin and FSRP bind activins, BMPs, and GDFs.  Mice show decreased
intercostal muscle and mild skeletal patterning abnormalities when
deficient in follistatin.  Overexpression of follistatin in transgenic
mice show large increases in muscle mass;  could be due to binding of GDF-8,
which inhibits muscle formation.
<p>
T&beta;RIII (Betaglycan) is a co-receptor for TGF&beta; (particularly &beta;2).
Cripto is another co-receptor enhancing binding of the node to ALK4/ActRIIB
complex.  Endoglin is related to T&beta;III and probably involved
in TGF&beta; signaling of ALK-1.
<p>
TGF&beta; members act by one of two type I receptors (T&beta;R-I/ALK5
and endothelial-restricted ALK1) and one type II receptor (T&beta;R-II).
Activins work through one type I receptor

Contribution of Hematopoietic Stem Cells to Skeletal Muscle
<p class="Para1">
In preliminary experiments bone marrow side population (high Hoechst
33342 dye-excluding) cells were sorted and found to have high myogenic activity.
Myogenic cells also were CD45<sup>+</sup> and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>.
SPKLS (c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup>)
cells were isolated from SP by serial sorting from marrows of
GFP<sup>+</sup>CD45.1 C57BL/6 mice; they represent 1 in 10,000 cells
of the bone marrow, also highly enriched HSC;  these were clonally expanded
in 96-well plates and GFP and Hoechst filters were used.  Single
cells were transplanted to CD45.2 congenic recipients, along with 10<sup>6</sup>
CD45.1 cells that were GFP<sup>&minus;</sup> and depleted of HSC.
3 in 10 recipients has significant counts of GFP<sup>+</sup> cell in
blood after 4 weeks.
<p>
Mice with &gt;30% of blood cells originating from
single cell transplant and showing multilineage engraftment for &gt;16 weeks
were checked for GFP<sup>+</sup> myofibers.  The panniculus carnosus
muscle group and toxin-damaged tibialis anterior group were analyzed;
the panniculus is thought to be involved in shivering and is employed
because it is only 2-8 myofibers thick and helps in quantifying GFP<sup>+</sup>
cells.
For animals getting whole bone marrow, GFP<sup>+</sup> myofibers found
in most muscles, but in lower counts where the muscle was not damaged.
However, up to 5% of myofibers in the panniculus were GFP-positive at
16 months, a higher proportion than for other undamaged muscles.
<p>
2 of 8 single cell-reconstituted mice, there were 31 and 5 GFP<sup>+</sup>
myofibers in the panniculus seen by whole mount fluorescence microscopy.
Laminin immunoflourescence (encases myofiber) established differentiation,
as did anti-myosin showing sarcomeric patterns in staining.  Thus HSC
can contribute to formation of skeletal muscle in absence of a disease
or injury model.
<p>
Notexin (myotoxin) was injected into tibialis anterior muscles of three
single cell-reconstituted mice having high hematopoietic reconstitution.
One animal killed after 10 days had too much inflammation to observe
GFP<sup>+</sup> cells.  The other two were killed after 1 month
and GFP<sup>+</sup> myofibers were seen in the periphery of the damage,
although not in the contralateral undamaged tibialis or the panniculus.
<p>
HSC must be able to engraft and produce multilineage cells that repopulate
in secondary recipient.  Total bone marrow from single cell-reconstituted
animals was taken and engrafted to another mouse whose entire lineage was
repopulated.  In the primary recipient no GFP-positive myofibers were in
the panniculus; in one of three secondary recipients 4 GFP myofibers were
seen.   Because it was not seen consistent in transplanted mice (2 of 8)
and only when inflammatory processes were present, specific microenvironments
may be necessary.
<p>
Previous studies have given contradictory results.  In one study,
a single HSC was grafted and several BM-derived cells had epithelial
markers integrated into surrounding tissue.  In another, a single
GFP<sup>+</sup> Thy1.1<sup>lo</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Lin<sup>&minus;</sup>
Sca-1<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic is transplanted similarly and a rare
GFP<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes and single GFP-positive Purkinje neuron in
mice are found.  No myofibers were found despite thorough search.
<p>
<b>Method</b>.  2 million BM cells are incubated in 5 &mu;g/ml Hoechst 33342
and after 90 min, washed and antibody stained with cold HBSS.  These are
double-sorted into 1 cell/well of 96-well plates (with 50 &mu;l PBS).
Marrow from GFP<sup>&minus;</sup> congenic mice was prepared (depleted of
stem cells using anti-Sca-1) injected with a single SPKLS cell

Evaluation of Host Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Myocytes in Consecutive
Biopsies in Long-Term Cardiac Transplant Patients
<p class="Para1">
4 male patients ranging in age from 27-72 y (mean 54.5 y) received
cardiac transplants from female donors until death.  Indication
for transplant was either idiopathic dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Time from transplant to postmortem exam ranged from 0.5-10 y (mean 5.1 y,
median 8 y).  Three biopsies revealed interstitial filtrate and Grade 1A
rejection, and 1 case was an early Grade 3B rejection with later Grade 1B
patterns.  Moderate acute cellular rejection with moderate-to-severe
graft coronary atherosclerosis was in 3 patients, and mild and severe
graft artery atherosclerosis without rejection features was in the 1 patient.
<p>
FISH for sex chromosomes showed cardiomyocytes with XX chromosomes.
In 3 of 4 patients, two consecutive biopsies and final autopsy showed
no myocytes with XY pattern.  In a single case rare single myocytes had
an XY pattern in biopsy 7 years after transplant, none at autopsy.
<p>
These results indicate the very rare but not pervasive presence of
the occasional Y-chromosome bearing cell.  This is in contradiction to
the findings of Quaini et al. who indicated extensive chimerism in their
hearts, although more so in the atria than in the ventricles.  Our
biopsies were more about the ventricles and indicate chimerism is
little to none with respect to cardiomyocytes.  In Quaini et al study,
5 of 8 patients did not live more than 2 months and only 2 patients
more than 1 year, none more than 2 years.

Stem Cell Therapy for Ischemic Heart Disease
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Fetal cardiomyocytes have been shown to form stable grafts
when placed in the ventricular wall of normal and injured adult hearts.
These cells terminally differentiated and had both molecular and morphological
attributes of adult cardiomyocytes.  Fetal cells performed much better than
adult cells, and so cardiomyocyte maturity appears crucial for transplantation.
Donor cells also formed typical intercalated disc structures (fascia
adherens, desmosomes, gap junctions) with host cells.  Intracellular
calcium image analysis confirms that donor cells are functionally coupled
to host cardiomyocytes.
<p>
ES cells are taken from the inner cell mass and can be cultured indefinitely;
they can differentiate into all lineages ecto-, meso-, and endodermal.
Mouse embryo cells have been shown to differentiate into cardiomyocytes,
and so do human ES cells.  These cells resembled early embyronic cardiomyocytes
and did not develop into adult cells with the same molecular and morphological
character when cultured in vitro.  Only when implanted in vivo did these
cells fully develop into adult-type cells, indicating that certain
environmental and physiological cues were not yet found in vitro.
<p>
There are also problems with ES cells.  ES cells will differentiate into
multiple cell lineages, even in vivo.  Mouse ES cells have formed teratomas
injected in hearts of syngeneic recipients.  ES cell differentiation in
vitro is &ldquo;stochastic&rdquo; in nature, and cardiomyocytes are only
0.5-5.0% of the cells induced towards myogenesis.  Several modifications
have been tried to increase the proportion of cells that undergo change.

Further Proof of The Plasticity of Adult Stem Cells and Their Role
in Tissue Repair
<p class="Para1">
<b>COMMENT</b>.  MSCs can be found in human synovial membranes
(hSM-MSCs) and are characteristic in every respect to MSCs from
other tissues (bone marrow, etc).  In this journal De Bari et al.
report infusing hSM-MSCs into the tibialis anterior muscle of
nude after damaging the muscle with cardiotoxin.  10% of cells
were still in the muscle after 24 h, and twice as many after 1 month.
Thus the cells engrafted and expanded and differentiated into muscle.
This was true also after IV administration.  Engraftment occurs in
healthy or damaged muscle, but occurs to a greater degree in damaged
muscle.  Also engraftment before cardiotoxin-induced damage resulted
in repair that involved differentiation of the human cells.
<p>
In an mdx (muscular dystrophy) mouse model, injected hSM-MSCs also
induced the synthesis of dystrophin in cells.  The cells were pure
as they were plated at low density and generated from single cells.
<p>
What about cell fusion?  De Bari et al found cell fusion, but myogenesis
from myoblasts normally occurs by fusion of these cells into multinucleated
myotubes.  Careful time course experiments were taken to monitor
whether human nuclei were in the muscle fibers:  none were detected until
day 7.  After 24 h there was a sharp peak in human Myf5 expression,
a factor that directs myogenesis.

Therapeutic Implications of Cancer Stem Cells
Progenitor Proliferation
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  In leukemia and solid tumors it has been shown that only a
minority of cancer cells can proliferate to the degree that they form
new tumors.  Such cells are tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and can be
surface immunophenotyped or are known by cell markers.  They have lost
the ability to be regulated like the proliferative (stem) cells in normal
tissues.
<p>
Stem cells must never lose the ability to proliferate, although some of them
will stop proliferating and differentiate.  Committed progenitors retain
a limited ability to proliferate; in hematopoiesis they can hold for 6-8
weeks as a single HSC can restore an entire system.  Tumors take months
to years to form and are a heterogeneity of cell types.  Cancers occur
as a series of events that turn on proliferation and silence genes involved
in inhibiting proliferation.
<p>
Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) are similar to normal HSC in phenotype
except that expression of Thy1 and IL3R-&alpha; chain differs.  Possibly
early mutations in HSC alter stem cells or progenitors.  Patients with
CML show a BCR/ABL transcript in multiple hematopoietic lineages thus indicating
an HSC at the root.  A model of AML in mice has been produced as a result
of crossing hMRP8p210<sup>BCR/ABL</sup> promoter mice, which have a CML-like
disease and splenomegaly with hMRP8bcl-2 mice.
<p>
Typical cancer treatments target proliferating cells in a less than discriminating
manner.  In AML and breast cancer only a small subset of cells are tumorigenic.
Some studies target tumorigenic cells in the tumor more than the
non-tumorigenic.  CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>&minus;</sup> leukemic cells
are less sensitive to daunorubicin than committed CD34<sup>&minus;</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>
cells.  LICs are more resistant to cytarabine whereas the rest of the blasts
are killed by the drug.  Many leukemic progenitors can efflux mitoxantrone
and daunorubicin, agents used to treat AML.
<p>
Thus we need to identify the stem cells of a cancer and not just the normal
tissues, especially if it is to counter tumorigenicity.

Stable Transfection of MSCs by Electroporation
<p class="Para1">
Preliminary experiments in this lab using a cationic lipid (Gene Porter
and Gene Porter 2 from Gene Therapy Systems) or an electroporation system
(Nucleofector Amaxa Biosystems) shows 14-16% transient transfection
efficiency.  Viral vectors tend to be inactivated by methylation,
or induce immune reactions, or impose a limit on exogenous gene size.
<p>
Keating et al used electroporation to create stable cell lines of MSCs
by expressing the SV40 large T antigen, which immortalizes the cells.
hMSCs were isolated from iliac crest and enriched on density gradient
to plate mononuclear cells.  24 h later nonadherents are removed and
cells expanded 5-7 d.  Cells are passed once to a density of 50/cm<sup>2</sup>
then incubated 12 d.  Rat cells were similar treated, expanded from
50 cell/cm<sup>2</sup> for 10 d.  The Eppendorf Multiporator was
used since it provides a square wave pulse.
<p>
Cells are suspended in hypo-osmotic buffer and the plasmid DNA dose
varied (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 &mu;g) per 10<sup>6</sup> cells.
Optimal results (transfection efficiency, cell recovery) were obtained
with 10 &mu;g linearized DNA.  Voltage was varied in 100 V increments
from 300-700 V, and pulse time varied in 25 &mu;s increments from 50-125.
Cells are removed from cuvette and plated to three 10-cm dishes with complete
medium.  24 h after, plates were washed with PBS twice and re-fed with
medium.
<p>
One of the plates was used to assay for eGFP by flow cytometry, wherein
cells were electroporated with pEGFP-IRESneo at 600 V/125 &mu;s:  transient
expression was 12%.  After 72 h, cells positive for fluorescence were
seen on the microscope.
<p>
In another experiment, cells were transfected at 600 V/100 &mu;s and
incubated 72 h then treated with 200 &micro;g/ml G418 sulfate to select.
97% of cells were positive for eGFP by flow cytometry, and colonies
of cells were seen on fluorescence microscope.  The hMSCs stably
expressing EGFP had a phenotype characteristic of untransfected hMSCs.
85 clones could be found.   The clones were pooled and could be expanded
300-fold for a total of 89 million cells in 14 days.  98% of cells
were eGFP positive.  These were still expressing eGFP and were passaged
to 50 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> every 2 weeks for over 6 months.
<p>
There were still plastic, able to become adipocytes and osteoblasts.
Cells are plated at high density and medium changed to differentiation
medium after 24 h.  After 21 days in osteogenic medium, alizarin red-positive
deposits are pervasive.  After 21 d in adipogenic medium, cells with
large vacuoles are found which stain bright red with Oil Red O.
eGFP could be ascertained within the differentiated cells, both adipocytes
and osteoblasts.
<p>
Additional electroporation studies indicated that 700 V produces 340 clones
per million cells.  In another experiment cells were treated with
chloroquine to inhibit lysosomes and plasmid degradation transiently.
Transient expression increased from 12 to 50% as judged by FACS analysis.
Selection with G418 produced only one colony on a single plate, with
no colonies on 17 other plates.  Chloroquine clearly inhibits integration
of the plasmid into chromosomal DNA.

Computerized Determination of Adipocyte Size
<p class="Para1">
Subcutaneous adipose tissue taken from needle apsirate biopsies of
26 subjects (6 men and 20 women, 21-53 y range) who were either
healthy or patients in surgery for nonmalignant problems were studied.
Adipose from lean and obese rats (from parametrial or epididymal depots)
were compared and the data similar.  Tissue was immediately placed
in pre-warmed Parker medium 199 + 4% BSA (fr V Sigma).  250-500 mg
tissue pieces were divided into small 5-20 mg pieces and put in plastic
vial with 10 ml medium containing 8 mg Type A collagenase (Boehringer-Mannheim),
incubated 1 h @ 37&deg; in shaking bath.  Vial shaken twice towards end
of incubation to liberate more cells.  This was filtered through 250 &mu;m
nylon mesh, and cells washed and allowed to rise to surface.  After two
more washes of cells, cells were suspended (20% cells, 80% medium).
Cells were then dropped onto siliconized slide and a 24 &times; 60 mm coverslip
placed on top.  Density should be sufficient to have enough cells to
count (in a single field) but not so dense as to overlap.
<p>
100 cell diameters were measured with &ldquo;standard laboratory
photomicroscope&rdquo; (C. Zeiss) with eyepiece micrometer and total
magnification 256 &times; (16&times; objective, 16&times; ocular).
Eyepiece scale divided into 100 parts, each with 5 units (5 &times;
0.616 &mu;m).  An elaborate procedure for focusing cells is undertaken
(spherical aberration in the lens???).  This is repeated until 100 cells
are counted.  The method is called the <b>reference</b> (<b>R</b>) method.
<p>
The <b>computer-assisted image analysis</b> (<b>C</b>) method is done in the
same was as for (<b>R</b>).  The cells are placed on the stage of an
Axiovert 135 M (Zeiss) and magnification is 8&times;.  A sufficient number
of cells appear in a single field at this magnification without loss
of detail;  the narrowing the condenser diaphragm aperture increases the
focal depth so that maximum number of cells come into focus.  A 3-CCD Color
Video Camera (Sony) mounted on the microscope captures the image which
is transferred to a KS400 (Zeiss) image analysis system.  Contrast enhance
is automatic with contour delineation, with transformation to a bitmap
consisting of discrete areas representing fat cells.  The software is
capable of discriminating <i>roundness of areas</i> and <i>smoothness of
contours</i>, factors that help distinguish healthy cells from deformed
cells.  This analysis system can determine several parameters of several
hundred to 1000 cells and store the data within a couple of minutes.

Haematopoietic Stem Cells Adopt Mature Haematopoietic Fates in

Orlic et al. have previously reported the use of bone marrow cells
enriched for HSC (Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup>) which
transdifferentiates into myocardium and endothelial support after 9 d
subsequent to direct injection into ischemic heart.  Our lab obtained
3 sets of cells from GFP-transgenic mice:  c-Kit-enriched
(c-kit<sup>Enr</sup>), Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup>, and
c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Thy1.1<sup>lo</sup> Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup>,
called KTLS cellsand representing long-term reconstituting HSCs.

600,000 Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup>, and 4000 KTLS LT-HSCs
per animal, for <i>n</i> = 6, 2, and 6 animals, respectively
(total of 14 animals).
The 14 wild-type mice had their LAD ligated, and donor cells injected into
border zone of the ischemic myocardium.  After 10 and 30 d, heart tissue
was evaluated for GFP<sup>+</sup> cells.  At 10 day large numbers of

tissue and in the peri-infarct border zone (2 from c-Kit<sup>Enr</sup>,
3 from KTLS LT-HSC, and 2 from Lin<sup>&minus;</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup>
were sacrficed).  At 30 d, the rest of the animals from the remaining
two groups were sacrificed, and few if any of
the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were found in the c-Kit<sup>Enr</sup> or

Plasticity of Adult Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
When the embryo organizes into the three germ layers, and eventually into
organs and specialized tissues of systems, many tissues require homeostatic
cell replacement and keep resident within them a set of stem and progenitor
cells which proliferate and whose differentiation is committed to a lineage.
Recent experiments call into question this established thought of sets
of committed stem cells by showing <i>transdifferentiation</i> of one
set of stem cells into mature cell types they were not thought to populate.
That cells transdifferentiate, defined as the conversion of a cell of one
tissue lineage into a cell of an entirely distinct lineage, with concomitant
loss of the tissue-specific markers and function of the original cell type,
and acquisition of markers and function of the transdifferentiated cell type.
<p>
Auerbach (1961) did a study in which thymic epithelium was co-cultured with
mesenchyme separated by a transfilter.  The study indicated that endodermal,
and not mesodermal, cells as thymocyte precursors.  Later Moore and Owen
(1967) showed that rare mesoderm-derived precursors in the thymic endoderm
have rised to most if not all thymic lymphocytes.
<p>
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with ability to self-renew and
differentiate into mature progeny cells, including nonrenewing progenitors
and terminally differentiated effectors.  Developmental potential is
important here:  totipotent cells give rise to embryo and extraembryonic
tissues, pluripotent to all cell types of embryo proper, multipotent
to subset of cell lineages, oligopotent to a more restricted subset of
cell lineages than multipotent, and unipotent to one mature cell type only.
Pluipotent ES cells were first obtained (1981) in culture from inner cell
mass of blastocysts.  But the specific markers and nature of these cells
is not definitively characterized.
<p>
HSC is the best characterized multipotent cell and was isolated 15 years ago
in bone marrow.  High levels (85-95%) of purity can be obtained according to
clonogenic assays.  Marrow stromal cells are multipotent cells giving rise
to mesenchymal lineages;  Gronthos et al has described phenotypic markers
of MSCs.  The peripheral and central nervous systems and myocardium also
contain resident stem cells.  High levels of ABC (ATP-binding cassette)
transporters are a common feature of those cells called stem cells (but has
not been found in every type);  purification of the "side population" is
done by sorting those cells able to efflux Hoechst 33342.  Muscle contains
satellite cells, and the epidermis certainly features stem cells in the bulge
region of the hair follicle (of haired epidermis).  Intestinal stem cells
are thought to reside near the bottom of the intestinal crypts.  Whether
organs like the pancreas and liver have stem cells which regenerate them
is still unknown.
<p>
The ability of HSCs to transdifferentiate has been reported particularly
by Krause and co-workers who found donor-derived markers on cells of
nonhematopoietic tissues (skin, lung epithelium, intestinal epithelium,
kidney epithelium, liver parenchyma, pancreas, skeletal muscle,
in recipients injected with HSCs.  Stromal cells injected into
myocardium has been implicated in repair, and cell counts ranging
from 0.1 to 20% of differentiated cells reported.  Other studies also
report failure to find HSCs and MSCs proliferating and differentiating
in tissues.  Moreover in studies where transdifferentiation occurred,
it was not shown that they contributed functional changes or improvements.
Reasons for failure to find donor cells in tissues include differences
in injury models, strategies to detect cells, and identification of donor
markers, and cell purification techniques.
<p>
Studies have also been conducted to show the transdifferentiation of
nonhematopoietic stem cells to produce blood-forming tissue.  CNS stem
cells are cultured into neurospheres and then these are injected into
lethally irradiated mice which recovered to show donor-derived cells;
however it was difficult to reproduce this in other laboratories.
Muscle mononuclear and SP cells were injected intravenously into irradiated
mice and also showed recovery.  The problem with such experiments is
that HSCs have a wide distribution and small numbers of them can repopulate
the blood-forming tissues easily.  It thus requires the most rigorous effort
to prove that injected cells do not contain itinerant cells that can
confound results.  Experiments with muscle SP cells even show the presence
of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating committed hematopoietic precursors.
<p>
There are other mechanisms that are possible rather than transdifferentiation,
and experiments must be designed to rule out such mechanisms before
transdifferentiation can be accepted.  Transdifferentiation asserts that
lineage conversion occurs &ldquo;directly,&rdquo; in which there is activation
of an otherwise dormant differentation program to alter lineage specificity
of the cell.  Alternatively is the de-differentiation of a tissue-specific
cell to a more more primitive, multipotent cell that redifferentiates to
the new lineage.  Urodele amphibians regenerate amputated parts (limb, tail,
eye, jaw, heart) through a process in which mature cells on the edge of the
wound dedifferentiate and form a <b>blastema</b> (a cluster of &ldquo;naive&rdquo;
progenitors) which then goes through a developmental process similar to
the original formation of the part during embryogenesis/organogenesis.
Nonetheless these multipotent cells of the blastema retain memory of their
original identity, as iris epithelium transplanted to severed limb will
form a lens, and limb blastema transplanted to eye generates limb structures.
Too many questions remain about whether dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation
works and how it does, if it does.
<p>
In many experiments, a known heterogeneity (presumed because it was
unfractionated bone marrow or muscle SP cells) of cells formed the graft,
and thus multiple stem and progenitor cell populations are present.
This asserts that one or more of the stem cells will proliferate and provide
a daughter population that will receive the appropriate environmental cues,
and differentiate to become part of the repair process.
<p>
Perhaps a desired mechanism is the use of a rare pluripotential stem cell
in a graft that proliferates to form tissue-specific stem cells or which
directly differentiates to a mature cell type (lineage), bypassing formation
of tissue-specific stem cells.  The Verfaillie group's multipotent adult
progenitor cells (MAPC) may be these very pluripotent stem cells thought to
be available in bone marrow.  MAPCs have been injected into blastocysts
and participate in forming multiple germ layers.  MAPCs can be obtained
from bone marrow, brain, and muscle.  The problem is that such cells have
to be obtained by rigorous in vitro conditions that select for an altered
phenotype that may not exist in vivo;  that these cells are MAPC in character
in vivo as much as in vivo remains to be shown.  Others have obtained
neurospheres from mouse ependymal cells and then injected them into
blastocysts to show participation in multiple germ layers.  These cells
were cultured in EGF and bFGF, factors known to influence human ES cell
proliferation and differentiation.  Still it remains to be shown that
in vitro represents in vivo.
<p>
Cell-cell fusion also remains to be ruled out in mechanisms that posit
transdifferentation.  Fusion of cells occurs naturally in the
differentiation and maturation of skeletal muscle myofibers and also of
osteoclasts formed from monocyte/macrophage lineage cells.  Local inflammation
involves formation of granulomatous tissue that is a result of the
pathophysiological fusion of granular cells (e.g., Langhans giant cells
in primary tuberculosis).  While cell fusion may be promoted by viral
and bacterial processes, it may be because these agents exploit capacities
of cells to fuse rather than provide the means for it to occur.
<p>
Nonetheless recent reports indicate that cell fusion may be responsible
for grafted bone marrow cells in the renewal of liver hepatocytes,
cardiomyocytes, and Purkinje neurons.  The possibility that cell fusion
was involved was prompoted by verified findings of spontaneous fusion of
ES cells in vitro with CNS and bone marrow stem cells.  Fusion has not
only been demonstrated in vitro, but also in vivo:  donor bone marrow-derived
cerebellar Purkinje neurons contained both donor and host nuclei with
activation of Purkinje neuron-specific transgene present only in the
donor nucleus.

Adult Stem Cells from Bone Marrow (MSCs) Isolated from Different Strains

<p class="Para1">
Mouse MSCs (mMSCs) were obtained from C57Bl/6J (Bl/6), BALB/c, FVB/N,
and DBA1.  A transgenic strain expressing GFP was also available
[C57Bl/6-TgN(ACTbEGFP)1Osb, abbrev. GFPtg] that constitutively expresses
GFP.  Two mice of each strain were used to produce cells from males and
females 8-10 wk old and asphyxiated by CO<sub>2</sub>.  Bones were placed
in complete isolation medium (RPMI-1640 + 9% FBS, 9% HS, P/S/12 &mu;M Gln)
on ice.  Ends of long bones are clipped and the bones inserted into
adapted tubes and spun 1 min at 400 <i>g</i> to collect marrow.
The collection setup is a 1 ml pipet tip cut at the narrow end that is
inserted into a 0.6 ml centrifuge tube, and this assembly is inserted into
a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.  The recovered marrow is suspended in 3 ml
medium with 21 ga. syringe then filtered through 70 &mu;m nylon mesh.
Cells are plated in 175 cm<sup>2</sup> flask with 40 ml medium, nonadherents
removed after 24 h (washed PBS), and 30 ml fresh medium added.  Medium
changed every 3-4 d for 4 wk.  Cells detached with trypsin/EDTA for 2 min
at 37&deg; (neutralized by adding 3 vol medium).  Cells are replated in
175 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.  Passage 2 cells were plated from passage 1 at
50/cm<sup>2</sup> in a new expansion medium of IMDM + 9% FCS, 9% HS, and
P/S/Gln as above.  After 1-2 weeks, these cells (now passage 3) were detached
in 2 min trypsin/EDTA @ 37&deg; as usual, some frozen, the rest plated at
50/cm<sup>2</sup>.  Freezing is done @ 10<sup>6</sup>/ml in 5% DMSO, 30%

Mesenchymal Stem Cells:  Paradoxes of Passaging
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.
There is no universal agreement about what MSCs are.  A combination of
physical, morphologic, phenotypic, and functional properties generally
identify these cells.
<p>
MSCs can be seen in low-density cultures where they can proliferate 3 orders.
In human and mouse fetuses, there is a primitive hematopoietic layer
in the dorsal aorta called the aorto-gonadalmesonephric region.
The cells in this layer are densely packed, rounded and show no hematopoietic
or endothelial markers.  There is an ECM indicative of stromal cells.
These AGM cells have been cultured much like MSCs (plastic adherence,
10-20% FBS).  These cells support embryonic and adult hemaotopoiesis, but
have not been well characterized.
<p>
In embryos, there is also a high number of HSC and stromal cells circulating
in the blood (from 7 to 12 weeks gestation).  Such cells resemble adult
MSCs but have clearly greater multipotentiality and more CFU-F;  this
multipotentiality is not really lost through later passaging.
<p>
Fetal cells are found in maternal circulation and in tissues for decades
following pregnancy, and that they may participate in tissue regeneration
for in specific disease states (revealed using FISH with X and Y probes).
Mothers with autoimmune diseases also appear to have higher frequencies
of these cells in their circulation.
<p>
While circulating stromal cell counts decline after 12 weeks gestation as
the embryo matures, multipotent nonhematopoietic cells do persis in
circulation.  MSCs in cord blood show Class I antigen, CD13 and CD44.
Another cell type is nonclassic in phenotype (not Class I or II antigens)
but show progressive expression of embryonic markers Rex1 and SSEA4.
<p>
MSCs from mice, rats, humans, cats, dogs, rabbits, pigs, and baboons have
been reported.  Sources include adult trabecular bone marrow, compact
bone, peripheral blood, adipose tissue, cord blood, amniotic fluid,
and other fetal tissues.  Most methods make use of the Friedenstein plastic
adherence (popularized by Caplan).  Because macrophages, endothelial cels,
lymphocytes, and smooth muscle can contaminate early passages, type
purity is achieved by expansion and passaging in minimal medium with
serum.  Even CFU-F testing of low density cells shows morphological and
size heterogeneity somewhat.
<p>
While it is not possible to say definitively what phenotypic markers
MSCs may have, it is usually possible to say what they do <em>not</em> have.
CD11b, CD31, and CD45 are hematopoietic (lymphoid and meyolid) markers
not expected in MSCs.  Human and rat MSCs are CD34<sup>&minus;</sup>,
but mouse cells appear quite variable.  There appears to be variable
expression of CD90, CD117 (c-kit), SH2 (CD105 or endoglin), SH3 or SH4
(CD73) and STRO-1.  This variation is due to isolation method, tissue
and species origin, culture conditions.
<p>
While morphological and phenotypic features are controversial, perhaps the
best presumptive ID is one that is functional.  Induced differentiation
to bone, fat, and cartilage is a critical requirement.  The &ldquo;default&rdquo;
pathway is to osteogenesis:  a majority of clonally expanded cells for
proteoglycan-rich nodules staining positively with alizarin red and by
von Kossa.  A significant fraction of cells will form lipid droplets.
A few clones can produce glycosaminoglyan proteins depending on species
and culture conditions, thus forming chondrocytes.
<p>
With population doublings comes senescence and the loss of multipotentiality.
Rat MSCs never seem to lose it, but human cells lose it after 40 population
doublings.  Problems come also with experimental reproduction between
laboratories.  Functional character may not be the best determinant of what
is an MSC because of this.
<p>
MAPC were characterized by Verfaille et al.  They have a wider potential
with respect to differentiation (endothelial, epithelial, mesenchymal).
When single MAPCs are transplanted into blastocyts, the donor cell expansion
if found in tissues and organs.  MAPC may be a true pluripotent progenitor
of MSCs themselves.

Adipogenic Differentiation of Human Adult Stem Cells from Bone Marrow
Stroma (MSCs)
<p class="Para1">
Adipocytes are plentiful in the bone marrow of patients with osteoporosis
and aplastic anemia, apparently occurring as differentiation of a population
of cells.  Expression microarray analysis helps in the analysis of the timing
sequence of differentiation in cultured cells, done for a cultured line
3T3-L1 but not primary cells.  Cells of human iliac crest aspirates were
collected on Ficoll as usual and plated in 20% FBS-containing alpha-MEM.
25-71 million mononuclear cells in 20 ml medium are plated to 180 cm<sup>2</sup>
plastic and nonadherents removed after 24 h with twice wash with PBS.
After 4-11 d cells are detached and replated at 3-50/cm<sup>2</sup> in
a Nunc Cell Factor (6300 cm<sup>2</sup>).  After 7-12 d cells are again
detached, suspended to 10<sup>6</sup>/ml for cryopreservation in 5% DMSO
with 30% serum in medium (p1 cells).  Revitalization is done and plated
to 60 cm<sup>2</sup> and left 4 d, and then detached as p2 cells.
100 p2 cells are plated to 60 cm<sup>2</sup> flask and cultured for 7 d
in complete medium.  Cells are then placed in adipogenic medium for
21 d; this is 500 nM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM IBMX, 50 &micro;M indomethacin.
Cultures are fixed in 10% formalin for more than 1 h and then stained
with fresh Oil Red O for 2 h (prepared by mixing 3 vol of 0.5% stock in
isopropanol with 2 vol water and then filtering with 0.2 &micro;m filter.
Plates are washed with PBS three times and dried, and positive colonies
counted.  Counterstaining is with crystal violet, and CFU-F are determined.
<p>
Standard adipogenesis typically brings cells to confluence in culture in
complete medium prior to the adipogenic medium application.  In this
study a clonal assay was done since human MSCs usually generate colonies
from single cells if plated at very low densities.  100 cells in a 60 cm<sup>2</sup>
were plated and precultured 7 days, showing some colony formation is seen.
When adipogenic medium is added for 21 day, the colony size increases until
day 14, and Oil Red O-positive colonies can be seen 14 d after exposure.
This is about 30% of colonies at day 14 and doubles to 60% at day 21, with
an increase in lipid vacuole count per cell in that time.  The adipogenic
medium inhibits proliferation in half the cells.
<p>
Within a colony, the adipogenic cells were usually found at its center.
MSCs were plated at 3/cm<sup>2</sup> in 6-well plates and cultured in
regular medium for 14 d with each colony scanned by time-lapse photomicrography.
Adipogenic medium was then added for 7 d and colonies scanned again.
For undifferentiated colonies, the most rapidly dividing cells are at the
periphery, while adipocytes were found at the center.

Transdifferentiation Potential of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived
from Bone Marrow
<p class="Para1">
MSCs from marrow of human patients (n=4, ages 47-81) were isolated and
expanded in DMEM with 10% FBS + P/S/Fungizone with twice weekly medium
changes.  Passaging was 1:3 and done at 85% confluence;  differentiation
was on passage 3 cells.
<p>
hMSC were induced to form osteoblasts first:  cells at
10,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> were expanded in 10 nM dexamethasone,
10 mM &beta;-glycerophosphate, 50 &mu;g/ml L-ascorbate 2-phosphate
and 10 nM 1&alpha;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (BIOMOL Research)
for 30 days.  Differentiation is marked first by proliferation, then its
cessation with secretion of ECM, and then mineralization of ECM.
Cells induced to differentiate to osteoblasts are thought to be committed
and unable to differentiate to other lines.  After 30 days, cells are
expressing alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, and
calcified ECM.  Cells after 10, 20, and 30 days induction were then
changed to adipocytic induction conditions and found to produce adipocytes.
They also were changed to chondrocytic induction conditions and produced
sulfated proteoglycan, collagen type II, and link protein.
<p>
hMSCs that were fully differentiated into adipocytes (after 20 d) could be
transdifferentiated into osteoblasts or chondrocytes.  MSCS induced to
chondrocytes in serum-free, 3-D alginate cultures with TGF-&beta;3
were dissociated and the cells induced to osteoblasts and adipocytes.
Transdifferentiation was confirmed by RT-PCR of lineage-specific mRNAs
only after a 2nd round of differentiation in which osteocalcin was
used to determine osteogenesis, lipoprotein lipase for adipogenesis,
and collagen type II for chondrogenesis.

Doxycycline Alters Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Adhesion, Migration, and

They are placed inverted in plate centrifuge and spun at 0, 100, 200, and 400 &times;
<i>g</i> for 5 min.  Cells remaining on plate are fixed and stained 0.5% toluidine
blue and OD595 measured (done in triplicate and repeated three times); ANOVA
with Fisher's protected least significant difference test.  Cell attachment is
significantly greater with the 31 &micro;M Dxcyc than UT.  UT and 10 &micro;M Dxcyc
were detached with 200 <i>g</i>. but the 31 &micro;M Dxcyc-treated cells required
at least 400 <i>g</i> force.

Interference reflection microscopy (IRM) using confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad
MRC-600)

SMCs are grown 48 h
in 6-well plate then growth arrested (FBS: 10% &rarr; 0.5% for 24 h) and the
arresting medium is replaced with 0.5 FBS containing 0, 10, 31 &micro;mol/L
doxycycline for 24 h, then replaced with Dxcyc medium with 10% FBS to re-stimulate
growth (this is time = 0).  Cell adhension is evaluated at t=0, 2, 4, and 6 d;
cells washed in PBS, exposed to 0.05% trypsin.  Detached cells are counted, balance
of cells fixed 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde; adherents are "counted" by staining
toluidine blue and measuring absorbance at 595 nm (cell count linear to OD595);
data analyzed by ANOVA with Holm-Sidak posthoc test.

Derivation, Characterization, and In Vitro Differentiation of Canine Embryonic
Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
Animal studies were approved by IACUC.  Female animals were monitored for
serum progesterone daily.  Preovulatory surge of LH having a duration of 12 h
occurs at the time progesterone rises above 2 ng/ml, designated day 0.  Ovulation
occurs at day 2.  Males are placed with females at first signs of proestrus
and mated naturally.  Routine ovariohysterectomy is done at days 12-16 post-LH
surge and blastocysts obtained.  Zona pellucida is mechanically removed and
blastocysts placed on primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) inactivated by
40 Gy &gamma;-radiation.  Medium is DMEM/F-12 with 15% FBS, 0.1 mM nonessential
amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 U/ml and 1
&micro;g/ml pen/strep.  Human LIF (Millipore) was added to 20 ng/ml to the initial
culture to stimulate murine LIF from the MEFs.  After 3 passages on primary MEFs
they are transferred to SNL 76/7 feeders, derived from the STO cell line (Sandoz
inbred Swiss mouse, thioguanine-resistant, ouabain-resistant) which express LIF
and obviate hLIF supplementation.  Subculture can be done by cutting out central
area of colonies during initial subculturing.  TrypLE select (Invitrogen) was used
for detachment and subculturing, but single cell passaging may cause aneuploidy,
so mechanical passaging was done.
<p>
<b>Embyroid bodies</b>.  Induction to EB is with Costar Ultra Low Attachment
plates (Corning).  Cells hold in suspension for 5 d, then plated to gelatin-coated
dishes using density and serum concentration variables and with and w/o growth
factors for differentiation.
<p>67 embryos were taken from 10 pregnant dogs at 12-16 d after LH surge predicted
by a 2 ng/ml serum progesterone.  Collections were made before implantation
which occurs at day 20.  In day 12 embryos no outgrowth formed on MEfs.
Day 13-14 embryos has mature blastocyst morphology and robust cellular outgrowths.
Day 15 embryos had larger diameters and a thin zona layer; outgrowths were
robust but there is no <i>Oct4</i> expression.

Isolation and Characterization of Cancer Stem Cells from Canine Osteosarcoma
Stem Cells
<p class="Para1">
Canine osteosarcoma (OSA) most common bone tumor, with 85% of tumors originating
from bone. OSA aggressive in older large breed dogs, with metastasis to lungs;
only 1 in 5 survival rate in less than 2 y.  Amputation is std therapy combined
with chemo (humans too).
<p>
Sarcospheres were generated in vitro in all OSA cell lines (3 dog, 1 human)
within 7-10 days.
