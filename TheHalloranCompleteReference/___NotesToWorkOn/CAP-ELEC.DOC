ry (halogen lamps).  Its greater use is as a pharmaceutical.  Organically bound iodine is a x-ray contrast medium and alcoholic iodine is an antiseptic.  Radioisotopes of iodine are used to control hyperthyroidism.  Preparative organic chemists may use it
 as a Grignard reagent (alkylmagnesium iodide).  Aqueous KI}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886  solutions are used for analytical chemistry for some iodometry of certain substances.

HI is colorless gas of unpleasant odor, dissolves easily in water and is a strong acid.  When oxidized, the aqueous acid forms a strong yellow color.  Iodides of the metals Ag, Hg, Tl, Cu, and Pb are barely soluble in wa
ter when compared to their respective bromides.  All other iodides are soluble.

e density gradients form in the separation medium, caused by samples of different density than the buffer or by Joule heating, producing convective flows.  Stabilizers of microporous properties can be added, but they themselves can contribute to rather th
a
n mitigate zone broadening if the solute interacts with the stabilizer and by eddy migration, depending on the nature of the porosity of the stabilizer.   Joule heating also is a factor in zone broadening, and although heat is generated uniformly in the m
edium, the existence of a temperature gradent starting from the capillary wall to the center means that convective flows are established.  Electrophoretic mobilities generally increase by 2% for each 1\'b0
C increase.  This results in parabolic flow profiles, t
he center more mobile than ions at the wall.  Sample concentration also affects zone broadening in as much as it can alter medium conductivity if its concentration is significantly comparable to carrier electrolytes.  Sample concentration can distort the 
electric field in the medium, resulting in broadened and asymmetric zone, an effect discussed by Mikkers et al. (}{\i\insrsid10057886 J. Chromatogr.}{\insrsid10057886  }{\b\insrsid10057886 169}{\insrsid10057886 
: 11, 1979).  A last factor in zone broadening is simple molecular diffusion, but its contribution is little compared with the factors above.
\par Capillary tubes are interesting alternatives to gels.  They can be considered microporous \'93capillaries\'94 present in gels or paper as a medium, these stabilizing against convective flow.  Mikkers et al have called this anticonvective property as the 
\'93wall effect.\'94  With decreasing capillary diameter (and increasing surface area to volume) the stabilizing influence increases.  The absence of the porous stabilizer (gel, paper) means eddy migration effects are eliminated.  Temperature inequalitie
s will be significant, the magnitude of the temperature difference being proportional to (tube diameter)}{\up6\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 
.  Heat dissipation improves with ever smaller diameters, and this can eliminate the gradient effect.  It can be theoretically shown that the average n
et migration of all molecules is the same in a given system in smaller capillaries and that the potentially damaging effects of larger temperature gradients are offset so as not to contribute signficantly to zone broadening.
\par Electrophoresis in open t
ubular capillaries is done by filling the capillary with buffer and introducing sample at one end.  An electric field is established and migration occurs.  The substances of interest are then detected as they pass through the capillary, a recording of the
 changes similar to a chromatogram but essentially an \'93electropherogram.\'94
  The terms migration time (retention time), theoretical plates, and resolution can be borrowed from chromatography to describe the effects of this electrophoresis.  Migration time will be a function of the length of the capillary, the solute\rquote 
s inherent mobility in an electric field, and the applied voltage:

aration decreases the resolution.  Zones may be sharper, as indicated by N, but resolution is poor.  We have derived an equation to express all the factors which have significant effects on solute resolution (as derived with the help of Giddings, 1969):

Zone detection is accomplished by detection of fluorescence or UV absorption.  Mikkers et al have experimented with conductance detection but is not as sensitive.  Capillaries tried include borosilicate glass of 80 \'b5
m or less and as much as 1 meter long.  An applied potential of 30 kV has been tried.  Larger diameters and shorter lengths result in poor separation because of thermal overloading.  Borosilicate glass is unsuitable in the lower UV since it 
absorbs.  Here fused silica is better.  Proteins were found to adsorb serious to glass and sillica capillaries.  Teflon capillaries were tried which are transparent to the low UV, but surprisingly showed significant adsorption of proteins.  Teflon is limi
t
ed by its poor thermal conductivity as well, and must be used at lower voltages.  To deactivate the active surface of fused silica, modifiers such as trimethylsilane, octadecylsilane, aminopropylsilane, and cross-linked methylcellulose were tried.  A meth
od reported by Chang et al. for bonding glycol-containining groups to the surface proved effective.
\par Our particular work made use of fluorescent detection in which dansyl- and fluorescamine-dervatized amines were separated.  The concentration of sample can b
e made especially low with the sensitivity of fluorescence detection.  We examined effect of solute concentration on zone broadening using a 75 \'b5
m x 100 cm long glass capillary filled with 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 and a potential of 30 kV.  Dansyl le
ucine was evaluated at 0.4, 5, and 10 mM.  With increasing concentration, peak height was not seen to uniformly increase, with only peak width seen to increase.  With low sample concentrations we found that separation efficiency was proportional to applie
d potential and that migration time was inversely proportional to voltage, in agreement with the equation.  The efficiencies we achieved were approximately 250,000 theoretical plates at 30 kV.
\par The effect of mass and molecular size on separation was also obs
erved.  Fluorescamine-derivatized alkylamines differing by addition of single methylene groups (4% increase in masses on average, 1% increases in molecular diameters) were resolved.  The sensitivity of fluorescene detection is also demonstrated, as each z
one detected was roughly 7 picomoles.
\par Human urine was diluted 10-fold and allowed to react with fluorescamine.  Many components were resolved whose identity remains unknown, all migrating between a time of 7 min to 25 min.  The effect of EOF is also demonst
rated here.  All dansyl amino acid derivatives, no matter the net charge of the molecule, are seen to migrate toward the negative electrode.  Small triply charged molecules are similarly conducted to the cathode.  This is also demonstrated with treated gl
a
ss, in which borosilicate is modified with trimethylchlorosilane.  This would be expected to reduce a negative charge surface on the glass and to reduce EOF.  It is in fact observed that the separation is now slower, but resolution is increased, in agreem
ent with all equations related to the effects of altering EOF.
\par Of interest are large and polyvalent solutes such as proteins and peptides.  Their larger size means lower diffusion coefficients, which should mean better separation efficiencies (sharper zones
).  For a tryptic digest of egg white lysozyme, derivatized with fluorescamine, the improvement in efficiency is seen, approaching 1 million theoretical plates.
\par One would think proteins, even larger, would also be better resolved.  A problem with proteins 
is their resistance to derivatization.  The number of potential modification sites also means tremendous heterogeneity of products since not all reactions are completed.  This requires use of a less sensitive UV detection, done at 230 nm.  The lower sensi
tivity means that sample concentration must be higher as well

\insrsid10057886 EDTA added to 2.8 L HPLC water.  This is then combined with 1.0 L HPLC acetonitrile and mixed.  The pH is adjusted to 6.8 \'b1
 0.1 with 85% phosphoric acid.  Running conditions 2.0 ml/min.  An iodide standard from ultrapure KI (Alfa) is prepared as 1 mg/L.  50 \'b5l samples of
 a standard diluted to 0.04 mg/L were injected in duplicate with 2 nA FS (2 nanoamp full scale) setting on the detector.  Peak heights were measured in these samples and standards.
\par Precision was first tested by injecting standard ten times and a pooled serum extract ten times.  The 2 ng iodine standard showed a CV of 0.7% in these studies, while the serum extract was measured to be 4.8 \'b5
g/dl (after comparison to standard) with a CV of 1.4%.  Iodide recovery was measured by adding an internal standard to poo
led serum.  Three different amounts of standard were added and the recoveries were between 91-94% (mean 93.1%) of added iodide.  The lower limit of detection for this method is 0.4 \'b5g/dl.
\par The range of linear response was determined by injection of 0.5 ng o
n the low end to 100 ng on the high end in increments between 1-10 ng.  Regression analysis indicated a coefficient of 0.988.  Detection can also be manipulated by adjusting the applied voltage on the detector, and this was done from 0 to +150 mV.  It was
 seen that, as applied voltage increased, the peak height decreased.  The use of 0 mV gives a maximum peak height but the noise is too much; an E}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 0}{\insrsid10057886 
 of +10 mV provided a decent compromise.  From 0 to +150 mV, the peak height falls by about 30%.
\par Both the use o
f the Ag electrode and the applied voltage makes detection finely attuned for sensing iodide in preference to other anions.  When the system is run under UV detection at 210 nm, several anions in addition to iodide are observed, although iodide is well-se
p
arated and the slowest eluting in the system (at 17 min).  With electrochemical detection, only the iodide standard is seen in preference to other anions (detected at ~14 min in the run shown).  A chromatogram of human serum shows iodide at the same posit
ion in addition to another anion running noticeable at 11 min.
\par Pooled human serum was analyzed every day over two weeks and the overall CV was 3.6%, indicating very good precision for within- and between-run analyses.  The mean of the samples was about 4.5 \'b5
g/dl.  Serum iodide levels have typically been measured between 3-8 \'b5
g/dl.  The use of the Ag electrode was ideal for iodide detection, and the electrode required cleaning for about every 600 injections (cleaning by polishing with alumina and washing with water and methanol).
\par The most common method of determining iodide from any matrix (and liberated from any protein to which it may be bound) is the Kolthoff-Sandell reaction in which iodide serves as a catalyst in the redox reaction between cerium(IV) and 
arsenic(III).  The change in color at 420 nm as yellow-colored cerium(IV) is reduced to colorless cerium(III) is monitored, and is proportional to the amount of catalytic iodide present.  The assay is not without problems:  there is a need to adjust the l
evel of cerium used by doing test assays, and contaminating metals can serve as efficiently as catalysts as can iodide.
\par Other methods do not attempt to analyze iodide by butanol-extractable iodide.  Serum is first acidified and butanol added and its phase r
ecovered.  The butanol is then back-extracted with Blau reagent to remove interfering substances.  Butanol is then evaporated away, and a digestion step then follows.  (We have that the digestion step is unnecessary;  just add analysis buffer once the but
anol is removed.)
\par The use of a large particle C}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 20}{\insrsid10057886 
 pre-column sample cleanup helped both column and electrode longevity.  Use of disodium EDTA is for passivating the system and is recommended by the detector manufacturer; its presence clearly reduced baselin
e noise.  Thermostating the column also eliminated some noise.  The use of both water and acetonitrile in the extraction of protein-bound iodide is supported by an article by Taurog and Charkoff (JBC 176: 639, 1948) who reported that iodide does not stabl
y bind to protein.

CE methods can be grouped in four areas:  (1) free solution, where separation is a function of solute size and charge at a particular buffer pH; (2) SDS-PAGE, where the separa
tion is only a function of solute size; (3) isoelectric focusing, where separation is based on isoelectric point; and (4) micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography, where a pseudo-stationary and mobile phase separates the solute according to its pa
rtitioning in either phase.  Resolution between two mobile species in the medium is expressed by the equation:

\i\insrsid10057886 n}{\insrsid10057886 ) and its charge (}{\i\insrsid10057886 q}{\insrsid10057886 ).  Forty different peptides ranging in
 size from 3 to 39 amino acids and in charge from 0.33 to 14 and run in a buffer of 20 mM citrate acid (pH 2.50) showed excellent correlation when m was plotted against ln(}{\i\insrsid10057886 q}{\insrsid10057886  + 1)/}{\i\insrsid10057886 n}{
\fs16\up6\insrsid10057886 0.43}{\insrsid10057886 .  In addition to size and charge, hydrophobicity, stereochemistry (}{\scaps\insrsid10057886 d}{\insrsid10057886  vs. }{\scaps\insrsid10057886 l}{\insrsid10057886 
 configuration), and conformational alterations clearly influence mobility.  To illustrate, a 13-amino acid peptide derived from leukocytes was synthesized, and the synthetic peptide (shown to have the same sequence as the native) was run on CE with the
 native.  Two peaks were resolved, the native slightly faster.  What CE showed here was that the native peptide was actually a modified form (later shown by FAB-MS to have a C-terminal amide) whereas the synthetic peptide was free acid.  A significant con
s
ideration for peptide work is solute-silica capillary interactions, as the silica wall acquires significant negative charge at higher pH and can influence solute mobility in this way.  Two approaches can be taken in that case:  either (1) do solute separa
tions using a buffer pH well above the isoelectric point of the solute, thereby resulting in repulsion between wall and solute; or (2) use a buffer pH (around 2.0) where the capillary surface has lost all of its charge character.
\par Separations of small peptid
es (<5000) using conventional gel media is often problematic, which is typically why such peptides are resolved by HPLC.  Paper electrophoresis is used a fast method for peptide separation, but is useful only for qualitative separations; it is also labor-
i
ntensive.  CE in free solution is much more rapid and provides alternative selectivity with equivalent resolution.  Some peptides that resolve only under ideal conditions on HPLC resolve without difficulty on CE:  b-endorphin, g-endorphin, and their [Des-
T
yr] derivatives separate on HPLC only with a special reversed-phase column employing a ternary gradient (difficult to reproduce).  These plus N-acetyl endorphin were separated on a first attempt without any optimization.  A major disadvantage with CE over
 HPLC is that it is strictly analytical and not preparative.
\par The usefulness of CE comes also from its ability to resolve the products of synthetic peptide analysis (confirmation of quality control) better than does HPLC.  In one example, HPLC results indica
te a peptide with 99.2% purity whereas the CE results show at least 6 components, the major peak representing only 50% of the total.  But rather than substituting for HPLC, CE might be used in tandem.  For example, subsequent to a peptide sample purificat
ion on HPLC to be submitted for sequencing, the purified fraction might be submitted to prior CE to confirm peptide homogeneity.
\par Often identification of unknown peptides involves synthesizing the presumptive sequence and then comparing physicochemical behav
ior using different separation chemistries.  Such techniques were used in elucidating a 27-amino acid peptide called STP-3.  Two synthetic peptides were prepared with the N-terminal residue side chain in the amide form and one in the acid form.  Mobilitie
s
 of the synthetic peptides were matched to that of the unknown, and the mobility of the unknown peptide was seen to be the amide form.  Addition of the amide synthetic peptide to the unknown did not resolve into two peaks, again confirming a single specie
s.
\par STP-3 also contains a single disulfide bridge.  CE was similarly used to monitor the rate of reduction of this bridge in the presence of 0.1 M DTT.  A second peak was detectable on a pherogram after 3.5 h, indicating how changes in mass or conformation c
an influence the separation.
\par Ribonuclease A, B1, and B2 are all 124 amino acid polypeptides with the same primary structure but differing in the glycosylation as Asn-34.  Ribonuclease A is the unglycosylated form, B1 has two GlcNAc residues to which is att
ached a poly-mannose with branched mannoses.  B2 is the tailored version of B1, with all mannoses but the one attached to GlcNAc having been removed.  CE resolves all three proteins very well (over a 1-minute range) (peaks identified by using a concanaval
in A affinity column first to purify then analyze the enriched components).  The buffer was necessarily a system with high pH (~11) in order to provide charge character to the sugar residues, this the means of separation.  A sample of commercially \'93
pure\'94 ribonuclease A was also revealed to contain traces of B1 and B2.
\par An important step in performance of immunoassays is the separation of bound antigen-antibody from the unbound components.  CE allows the visualization of this process easily.  Anti-hGH IgG (150
 kDa), hGH (22,125 Da) and a mixture of these proteins were analyzed on CE (system parameters:  50 \'b5m x 95 cm (80 cm to window) capillary; 0.10 M tricine, pH 8.0; 30 kV @ 25 \'b5A, T = 25\'b0
; 11.5 nL injection).  The IgG elutes first at 8 min.  The hGH elutes m
uch later at 9.2 min.  With a 1:1 mix, a much reduced hGH peak is seen at 9.2 min, no IgG peak is seen, but a peak at 8.5 min is observed.  With 2:1 IgG:hGH, the hGH has completely disappeared, the 8.5 min peak is evident, but so are some peaks at its fro
nt.

Inclusion of organic solvents in electrolyte systems used in CE is useful in altering analyte selectivity and to assist in analyte identification as well.  Methanol is one often-used solvent for isotachophoretic procedures, and the use o
f pure methanol in CE has yet to be explored.  Information theory and cluster analysis represent methods for evaluating resemblance or dissimilarity of analytical systems used in a general mode.  Cluster analysis will be used here to compare different ele
c
trolyte systems involving water and methanol and manipulation of other factors.  Cluster analysis involves the following steps:  (1) selection of the taxonomic units (data units);  (2) selection of the variables (or properties, attributes, features);  (3)
 defining the criteria for what constitutes similarity;  (4) construction of a dissimilarity matrix;  (5) selection of a clustering procedure for the agglomeration of units and visualization (by a dendrogram); and (6) intepretation of the grouping.

\par RESULTS.   Table 1 (not sh

an example, one system (code 3) is water possessing }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-alanine chloride at pH 3.0.  Another (code 8) is water with Tris chloride at pH 8.0.  Another (code 10) is water with ethanolamine chloride at pH 10.  As for methanol, one system (code 7) is methanol wit
h triethanolamine perchlorate at pH 7.76, while another (code 9) is methanol with Tris perchlorate at pH 9.22.  The coding scheme represents a rank order for the pH systems for either water or methanol systems.
\par The relative mobilities (}{\i\insrsid10057886 R}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 E}{\insrsid10057886 ) are related to the ionic mobility (}{\i\insrsid10057886 m}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 i}{\insrsid10057886 ) and the mobility of the leading ion (}{

\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 E}{\insrsid10057886  values (zero mean, unit variance).
\par First, do the actual data units based on the attributes of the 55 anions in pure aqueous solvent represent a larger data set of 263 anions investigated elsewhere?  In this case, we need to construct a similarity matrix (see table).

relative Euclidean distance are related to the largest distance (between systems 3 and 10, distance = 1).  The systems were coded as indicated above.   The smaller the relative distance between any pair of systems, the more similar the systems are to one 
another.  The smallest values in the table belong to system pairs <7,8>, <6,7>, <8,9>, <6,8>, and <7,9>.  These compare with pairs <8,9>, <9,10>, <7,8>, <7,9>, and <6,7> in a previous study.

 values, this time including methanol systems, is constructed to check for resemblance.  Dendrograms are calculated with an average linkage and with a single linkage algorithm.  The dendograms show clear subclusters with high similarity, e.g., with }{

of agglomeration.  The average linkage algorithm has both systems consisting of methanolic and aqueous systems:  <3,4,7*,8*> and <7,8,6,9,10,5,9*,10*>.  With the single linkage algorithm, systems 9* and 10* are found together in one and the other aqueous 
and methanolic systems in another large subcluster (the single linkage algorithm seems less successful than other hierarchic clustering algorithms).
\par Electrolyte systems selected from these three subclusters show identical results when processed through both
 algorithms:  the three subclusters are <9*,10*>, <7*,8*,3,4> and <5,6,7,8,9,10>.  It is interesting that one cluster represents the lowest pH values of the both aqueous and methanolic systems which were tested (the one containing systems 3, 4, 7*, and 8*
) and that behavior was considered similar.  Also, it did not appear to make a difference that aqueous system at pH 5 differed much from system at pH 10.  Clearly methanolic systems 9* and 10* (high pH) are unique in any case.
\par What about the plausibility of the results?  Does the structure generated by the analysis represent the final word about the relationship of the systems?  It should be noted that anionic mobility is a function of the degree of dissociation where it applie
s and by the current of total charge moved in the system varying with pH.  The degree of dissociation is a function of pK}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886 
, and this constant is also influenced by the presence of organic solvents.  Organic solvents particularly influence neutral acids of type HA.  Addition of solvents such as MeOH, MeCN, and Me}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 
SO to water increase the pK}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886  of these acids.  Indeed the average increase is 3-4 pK}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886 
 units higher when the acid is dissolved in pure methanol as opposed to water.
\par This can be understood in terms of the results of the cluster analysis.  Analytes with pK}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886  values of 3-5 in water have pK}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886 
 values of 6.5-9 in methanol, and it should be no wonder that methanolic solutions at pH 7 or 8 behave similar to aqueous buffers at pH 3 or 4.  That is why group <3,4,7*,8*> could be clustered.  Since most of the anions have pK}{
\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886  of between 3-5, it is therefore no wonder that pH systems above 5 and on up to 10 were grouped in a single cluster.
\par What about the decisions involving clustering?  A check on validity was done by 
an interpretation of the clustering results, but what sort of refinements can be made to make proper decisions concerning clustering?  One might use the same criteria as used for hypothesis testing in statistics.  Testing the validity would involve theref
o
re variables with randomly chosen values.  A value of 2.58 and 5.0 were taken as the mean and std dev, resp., of a normal distribution of random numbers (these being the parameters for the relative mobilities of all compounds tested).  A Poisson distribut
ion with }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'6c}{\insrsid10057886  = 2.58 was similarly used as a source of random numbers.  Both distributions of numbers used actually produced identical results, so only the Gaussian distribution results are discussed.
\par Twelve units (as for the 12 electrolyte systems) were analyzed but this time using different numbers (}{\i\insrsid10057886 N}{\insrsid10057886 ) of attributes, varying from }{\i\insrsid10057886 N }{\insrsid10057886 = 5 to }{\i\insrsid10057886 N }{
\insrsid10057886 = 500.  Results were determined using the average linking algorithm and dendrograms of the twelve units (labeled A to M, excluding J) presented.  For N = 5 attributes, the
 clusters are well-structured.  For N = 10, the structure shows distinguishing clusters, although random numbers show interrelation of the data.  However, with N = 50 and greater, clusters are less well defined and agglomeration is seen to occur with a lo
w level of similarity (}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'44}{\insrsid10057886  < 0.3).   With much higher numbers of attributes (variables), clustering should not really be intepreted as similarity since agglomeration is with }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'44}{

.  Nonetheless, at some injection they will converge.  The effect suggests a hysteresis phenomenon which is not dependent on the applied voltage (since the same change in mobility occurs if an equ
ivalent amount of time is allowed to elapse without any applied voltage).
\par To see if column flushing was inadequate or if pH variation from reservoir to reservoir was responsible, a cycling experiment between pH 12 and pH 4 was done.  Two injections were do
ne at pH 4, the column flushed with pH 5, and four injections done.  A plot of }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'6d}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 eo}{\insrsid10057886

 would be expected to increase.  Similar results are seen with pH 2 to pH 12 cycling or vice-versa.
\par These data suggest that equilibration of surface groups on the fused silica is very time-dependent and not at all rapid.  At an intermediate pH, the equilibration could take weeks in fact.  A plot of }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'6d}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 
eo}{\insrsid10057886  vs time in pH 4 buffer for a column initially equilibrated at pH 12 shows that }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'6d}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 eo}{\insrsid10057886  varied over 3-fold for a period of 2 weeks before }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'6d}{

 was not much different.  The capacity factor, }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61}{\insrsid10057886

INTRO.  The use of capillaries in electrophoretic separation has increased a great deal as continued refinements take place.  Mikkers used CZE for separating small anions (Cl}{\fs16\up6\insrsid10057886 \endash }{\insrsid10057886 
) detecting conductimetrically in a Teflon capillary with 200 \'b5m diameter.  Jorgenson and Lukacs reported extensively on the behavior of glass and fused-silica capillaries using optically based detection; they repor
ted separation of dansyl amino acids with a 250,000 theoretical plates in a voltage gradient of 300 V/cm.  They also examined urine and serum proteins.  This report expands on this early work, emphasizing the clinical value of CE.

ith voltage 200 V/cm (5 kV).  Buffer used for serum protein separation was a propietary buffer from Beckman (pH 10.0).  Another propietary buffer, pH 8.6, was used to separate Hb variants A, F, S, and C.  All buffer 0.45 \'b5
m filtered.  Serum samples were diluted 1:20 with 75 mM NaCl and 20 mM KP}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 i}{\insrsid10057886 
, pH 7.0.  For Hb controls, dilution was 1:10.  These are injected.  As a control the Beckman Paragon system for analyzing protein using agarose gel electrophoresis is done:  SPE and Acid-Hb gel products are used.  S
erum controls and Hb variants A, S, and C are from Beckman.  Variants Hb A, F, S, and C are controls available from Isolab.
\par An electropherogram is shown separating Hb variants C, S, and A, in order of appearance, in an uncoated capillary (OD 415) with time
s of between 6-7 min for all peaks, with resolution comparable (perhaps better) than with agarose gels.  Migration is toward the cathode because of electoendoosmosis.  Separation is large achieved by differences in electrophoretic mobility toward the anod
e
, variant A being more negatively charged and migrating slowest then.  Separation of a four-variant mixture using applied potential of 7.5 kV (rather than 5 kV) shows C, S, F, A in that order migrating between 8.5 and 9.5 min.  [The authors fail to commen
t on the slower migrating despite the higher voltage:  this may be because repulsive effects become more significant than EOF at higher voltages.  Peak resolution at the higher voltage is the same, if not slightly better.]
\par In analyzing serum proteins, the e
lectrophoretic pattern (UV detection at 214 nm) is virtually identically with the densitometric analysis of stained gels of the SPE Paragon system.  (The electropherogram is reversed on the time axis to do this to compare the anode-to-cathode gel pattern 
r
ead by the densitometer.)  Gamma globulins migrate first, being the least negatively charged, then beta, alpha-2, alpha-1, and then albumin.  Times on CE are between 3.5-6.5 min.  An abnormal control with gamma globulinopathy shows identical stained gel a
n
d electropherogram patterns.  Other abnormals analyzed included patients with IgG kappa myeloma, IgM lambda myeloma, and IgG3 myeloma, with patterns fairly the same.  There are problems with consistent migration times, but variations in peak times are usu
ally less than 10 s (analysis of 20 repeated runs); the pattern is generally the same.
\par UV spectra from 200 to 240 nm of serum proteins dissolved to 50 \'b5g/ml in isotonic saline was taken.  Purified albumin, alpha-1 antitrypsin (representing alpha-1 globulins
), IgG (representing gamma globulins), and hapto-globulin (representing beta globulins) were used.  The spectra were virtually identical in this range, indicating that one protein or another does not have a significant advantage in being detectable (more 
s
ensitive) at particular wavelengths in this range any more than a particular protein varies as to staining.  Indeed with agarose gels, it is known that protein fractions vary with regard to dye binding in staining and quantitation is not reliable on a mas
s basis.
\par Analysis of CSF in many cases can be by direct injection as the protein is 0.3 mg ml}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -1}{\insrsid10057886 
 in healthy individuals.  CSF shows distinct patterns, with a peak of pre-albumin observed.  Dialysis of CSF with a 14 kDa cutoff membrane shows many UV-absorbing
 peaks disappear, and so these small molecules may be low MW peptides.  Urine was analyzed at 214 and 254 and shows a complex pattern at both wavelengths.  Urea and creatinine absorb, and the balance are likely peptides.
\par DISCUSSION.  Adsorption of proteins
 is a problem in CE separations using fused-silica capillaries.  Surface-modified capillaries have been used by have a limited pH range.  High salt buffers appear to reduce adsorption.  Lysozyme (pI 11) migrates as a sharp zone faster than EOF in a pH 9.0
 high salt buffer.  These results show separation Hb variants.  It is emphasized that capillaries are washed and reconditioned to produce reliable results.

INTRO.  CE is very good in uncoated capillaries with acidic buffers.  Use of CE in resolving proteins and peptides under such conditions is complicated by t
he fact that proteins are unstable at low pH.  Insufficient differences in charge/mass and stability considerations at low pH make design of another system necessary.  A problem with surface chemistries of both proteins and fused silica present two obstac
l
es to resolution of proteins at their physiological pH:  electro-osmosis and solute adsorption.  Adsorption will affect sensitivity and accurate quantitation; it also alters the capillary wall surface and induces variations in electro-osmotic flow, again 
influencing quantitative precision.  We report here the conditions for resolving proteins on a coated capillary system using buffer components which reduce EOF and solute adsorption and procedures for washing/purging the capillary between runs.

 titrated with phosphoric acid to pH 2.5 is prepared as stock.  50 ml of 0.1 M phosphate with MeOH and 4 M urea added as indicated, brought to 100 ml, and the appropriate amount of CD added.
\par Enantiomeric resolution in CZE can be direct, in which the chiral environment interacts with the chiral molecules and forms differing stability complexes which account for separation, or indirect, in which complex formation is stronger and preferential to
 
one enantiomer, altering its mobility as a complex.  CDs have been used to provide such environments.  It has been shown that the chiral center of a particular compound must be at a favorable distance from the rim of CD to enable hydrogen bonding with the
 hydroxyl groups of CD.
\par At the pH of the system used here, terbutaline and propanolol analytes move at cations.  Plots of migration time of the enantiomers against various concentrations of CDs are determined.  In particular, racemic terbutaline is seen to 
resolve immediately at the lowest concentrations tested in two CDs, namely }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD and di-OMe-}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-CD at 5 and 2.5 mM, resp.  The separation of migration times becomes greater with increasing CD concentration (up to 20 mM tested).  The plot appearance suggests t
hat the derivatized (methylated) CD is the better chiral resolver.  Migration times uniformly increase with addition of either cyclodextrin, less so with }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD than with methylated }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{
\insrsid10057886 -CD;  this may reflect a poorer interaction with the underivatized }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD.
\par Th
e resolution is plotted against the concentration of the two CDs used above.  This plot essentially confirms what appears to be the case in the migration time plots, assuming sharp peaks in all cases (peak width information would not be given in the latte
r plot, essential for determining resolution).  The underivated }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD is a poor resolver than the derivatized CD.  However, except at 5 mM in the case of }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-CD, both CDs at all concentrations produce baseline resolution of terbutaline.  Maxima were observed in these plots, at 5 mM for methylated }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD and 15 mM for }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-CD.  Electropherograms are presented of separation of terbutaline at these concentrations of respective CDs (0.1 M phosphate, pH 2.5, injection by 8 kV for 10 s, 10 \'b5M terbutaline; run at 9 kV at 19 \'b5
A constant current).  The UV traces show that the (+)-isomer has a lower mobility toward the (\endash )-isomer, meaning the latter has a shorter migration time, and this is true for either }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD or di-OMe-}{
\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD.  In this case, the (+)-isomer likely has a better interaction with the CDs than the (\endash )-isomer.
\par Experiments were performed with }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61}{\insrsid10057886 - and }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'67}{\insrsid10057886 
-forms of CD and produced no resolution.  The only change observed was in the migration time of racemic terbutaline.  This is likely due to changes in the shape of the cavity of the CD molecules.  The }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61}{\insrsid10057886 - and }{
\f3\insrsid10057886 \'67}{\insrsid10057886 
-CD molecules are likely too small and too large, resp., to form inclusion complexes.  Other CD forms similarly were incapable of resolving enantiomers:  the tri-OMe-b-CD had no effect except on migration time.  Unlike for }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61\'2d}{
\insrsid10057886  and }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'67}{\insrsid10057886 -CD, inclusion complexes are likely formed in the b-CD derivative, but show no enantioselectivity.
\par With propanolol, all chiral environments were tried.  }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61}{\insrsid10057886 -CD had no influence on migration time or resolution, whereas }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'67}{\insrsid10057886 -, }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-, di-OMe-}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -, and tri-OMe-}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-CD forms all showed increasing migration times with increasing concentration, demonstrating complex formation.  Resolution was not possible with the tri-OMe-}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-CD system, the maximum being < 0.5 at 40 mM (the best).
\par A problem with CDs is their limited solubility, which can nevertheless be enhanced by addition of urea.  Urea does not apparently bind to CDs in achieving this solubilization.  With 50 mM phosphate, pH 2.5 in 4 M urea, a range of }{\f3\insrsid10057886 
\'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD from 30-80 mM was tried but racemic propanolol was not resolved.  Methanol was then added in varying amounts (0-40% v/v) as an organic modifier to the system with 4 M urea and }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-CD held constant at 40 mM.  At 10%, resolution is at the level of the peak heights; with 30%, it is near baseline, and this was the best of conditions (the }{\i\insrsid10057886 S}{\insrsid10057886 
-isomer detected at the shorter time).  It is likely that MeOH is affecting solvation of the enantiomer-CD complex.  Alterations in b-CD produced no effect, and resolution was not possible with a phosphate-MeOH solution system when tri-OMe-}{
\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD is used.
\par We note that the short length and small diameter of the capillary may be significant in CZE applications involving chiral separations.  Detection limits (assuming S/N=2) were 0.1 \'b5M for terbutaline.

-column derivitization.  Precolumn labeling usually has a drawback of requiring extensive sample treatment and manipulation and is also not appropriate for all samples.  Postcolumn labeling for CZE requires elaborate (expensive) setups and is therefore no
t
 practical.  Indirect fluorescence removes the need for sample pretreatment and reaction chambers ("mixing Ts") and provides excellent detectability, but complex sample may not be amenable as some components can react with the chromophore and create confu
sing interpretations.
\par Fluorescence spectra of the three metal-HQS}{\up6\insrsid10057886 -}{\insrsid10057886 
 complexes studied here have broad maxima for exicitation near 400 nm and for emission at 505 nm.  This matches nicely for UV excitation by an argon laser operating in all-lines mode (several lines between 330-365 nm).  Magnesium was sensitive to a 1 \'b5
M concentration.  Because the laser at this power setting damages the fused silica after a short time, an He-Cd laser was subsequently tested for this work.
\par Variations in [HQS}{\up6\insrsid10057886 -}{\insrsid10057886 ] were tested as we
ll.  Shifts to higher concentrations promote greater complexation and increase the fluorescence signal.  A drawback is also an increase in fluorescence background (noise) presumably because of buffer impurities and an increase in current which results in 
efficiency losses.  Also higher [HQS}{\up6\insrsid10057886 -}{\insrsid10057886 ] did not improve sensitivity for all metals.  While Ca}{\up6\insrsid10057886 2+}{\insrsid10057886  and Mg}{\up6\insrsid10057886 2+}{\insrsid10057886

he Zn peak was asymmetric (front-tailing) and the peak height much reduced.
\par The effect of pH was similarly tested.  Since reducing pH reduces }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61}{\insrsid10057886  in eqn 2 and the concentration of the complex, peak areas/heights would be expected to decrease.  However, incre
asing pH does not always lead to improved detectability, as losses in efficiency may contribute to band broadening and reduced peak heights.  The best results were seen with [HQS}{\up6\insrsid10057886 -}{\insrsid10057886 
] of between 1-5 mM with pH slightly alkaline (pH = 8).  Limits of detection using a 2.5 mM HQS}{\up6\insrsid10057886 -}{\insrsid10057886  at pH 8 with a S/N = 2 (as considered minimal detection) and samples injected at 7 nL were 15 \'b5M for Ca}{

he linear range of measurement showed high correlation coefficients for over two orders of magnitude in the range of measurement.  A high fluorescence background (200 nA) is attributable to impurities, and sensitivity may be improved both with the use of 
a stabilized laser and with ultrapure water.

Separations of inorganic cations using CE were first reported in 1967 and 1974.  First reports for inorganic anions began to appear between 1979 and 1990.  The first reports for anions used isotachophoretic conditions;  capillaries were made from PTFE (Te
f
lon), and detectors were constructed to sense the changes in potential gradients of the migrating zones.  In this early work, 16 anionic species were separated in < 10 min.  Detection sensitivity is influenced by many factors:  (1) separation efficiency; 
(
2) matching ionic mobilities of carrier ion and analyte (peak spreading results from mismatches); (3) capillary diameter, in which sensitivity improves with larger diameters; (4) sample introduction method, in which electromigration improves sensitivity; 
(
5) the separation potential, with higher voltages improving detection but possibly limited by overheating of electrolytes; (6) capillary length (the shorter the better); (7) improved cooling systems, with intensive cooling eliminating noisy baselines and 
allowing higher voltages.

A history of the applications for detecting anions shows major improvements in sensitivity, with as little as 1-8 \'b5M detection.  Many use indirect UV detection, and use of this method imposes other factors (limitations) on the abil
ity to sense anions:  (8) the molar absorptivity of the absorbing carrier anion, in which the optimized system attempts to increase the dynamic range by increasing signal to noise as much as possible; (9) light source energy (the higher energy output, the
 better).  Micromolar range sensitivity has been shown possible with indirect UV detection.  Combined with electrokinetic sample introduction under isotachophoretic conditions, detectability is enhanced by several orders.
\par RESULTS.  Water is of the highest quality (Mill-Q).  Chromate electrolytes used here are 0.1 M analytical-grade Na}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 CrO}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 
 with 0.34 mM sulfuric acid.  A 20 mM OFM-BT electroendoosmotic flow modifier is used; final concentration is 0.5 mM.  The final chromate concentration was varied.  Benzoic acid, trimesic acid, phthalic acid, }{\i\insrsid10057886 p}{\insrsid10057886 
-anisic acid, 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid, and salicylic acid were all used.  These are made to 5 mM with 0.5 mM OFM-BT and adjusted to pH 6.0 with 0.1 M LiOH.  1 mM solutions were used to evaluate molar absorp
tivity values.  Carrier electrolytes are prepared fresh each day, filtered with Millipore-HA filters, and degassed.  Standard anions are made from 1000 ppm stocks.  Polypropylene vessels are necessary for ppb level work.  A Waters Quanta 4000 with negativ
e high voltage is used and equipped with 75 \'b5m capillary with effective length of 52 cm.  Detection is at 254 nm (Hg lamp).
\par Chromate is a carrier with mobility suitably matched for eight common inorganic anions (F, CO}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 , Cl, NO}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 , Br, NO}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 , PO}{
\dn6\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , and SO}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 ).  UV 
spectra were taken for these anions and for the organic compounds listed.  Both vanadate and chromate show broad absorption in the UV whereas other inorganics absorb only at the very low end.  It should be noted that significant absorption of an analyte a
t
 particular wavelength decreases the sensitivity (dynamic reserve) where indirect UV detection is desired.  In this case chromate is the more suitable carrier as it absorbs at ranges not at all absorbing by particular analytes.  A particular limitation wi
th vanadate is its precipitability with materials in the EOF modifier (at 0.5 mM) at pH values below 10.
\par Calibration charts for anions can generated for different concentrations of anions (from 2-50 ppm) and correlation coefficients are at least 0.995.  (Electrolyte is 5 mM chromate and 0.5 mM EOF modifier, adjusted to pH 8.1; voltage was \endash 
20 kV, and injection was hydrodynamic with loading at 10 cm height for 30 s; detection limits are expressed in \'b5M, where S/N=3).  Another linearity test (evaluation of the
 slope of log[peak area of signal] vs. log[concentration]) shows that linearity assumption is not seen.  It is only within a narrower range that linearity is confidently observed for particular ions.  The effective linear range can usually be extended by 
i
ncreasing the carrier electrolyte concentration;  for example, sulfate increases its linear range to 2-50 ppm in 7 mM chromate systems.  This is further illustrated for sulfate in the range between 50-200 ppm.  At 7 mM, linearity is only slightly improved
.  At 9 mM chromate, the linear range for sulfate increases to between 0.5 and 200 ppm, three orders of magnitude.
\par Organic carboxylates are useful as carriers for particular anions, namely the less mobile (F, carboxylic acids, alkylsulfonates, etc.), whose 
peaks are very asymmetric in chromate.  These carboxylates are not suitable for complex inorganic anion mixtures however.  Of the carboxylates mentioned above, UV spectral determinations indicate that benzoic, phthalic and trimesic acids are the most prom
i
sing.  Relative molar absorptivity was calculated by dividing the absorbance relative to benzoate absorbance at 254 nm and 1 mM and this plotted to relative peak area (area with respect to benzoate area) in which the analyte was 10 ppm propionate.  This p
lot shows a good linear correlation.  Chromate shows a relative molar absorptivity of 3.07.  This plot can be used in the optimization of detection sensitivity.  Sensitivity can be enhanced  20-fold by using }{\i\insrsid10057886 p}{\insrsid10057886 
-anisate as opposed to salicylate, for example.
\par With electromigrative sample introduction, an isotachophoretic distibution of ionic concentrations is reached with the distribution specified by the Kohlrausch regulating function:

The preconcentration also depends on a terminating electrolyte with an anion of slower mobility than the analyte.  In some samples, conductivity is too low and must be adjusted to permit suffi
cient electric charge into the capillary.  Chromate, citrate, carbonate, and octanesulfonate were evaluated as additives.  The addition of the carrier electrolyte anion should not allow establishment of the isotachophoretic steady state, and so there shou
l
d be no enrichment by electromigration.  This was confirmed with chromate added to a chloride sample.  Citrate, carbonate, and octanesulfonate did show trace enrichment however, as their mobilities were less than chromate carrier and the analytes.  Best r
esults were obtained with octanesulfonate between 15-40 \'b5
M.  It is noticed that the terminating anion is also enriched by these procedures.  [This paper shows a nice illustration of the four stages of sample introduction by electromigrative isotachophoresis.]

INTRO. Low MW inorganic and organic anions are generally analyzed by ion chromatography (IC).  Columns 
are chosen with specificity (selectivity) for particular ions.  However, with many anion-exchange columns, ions such as short-chain monocarboxylic acids co-elute with fluoride, chloride;  trivalent anions usu require gradient elutions.  CE separates based
 on charge/mass considerations instead of stationary phase interactions.  Separation in a capillary depends on field strength (V cm}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -1}{\insrsid10057886 
) and not capillary length:  hence, use of very small capillaries which can dissipate Joule heat generated by high field strengths would be ideal.  The maximum number of peaks that can be resolved (peak capacity }{\i\insrsid10057886 n}{\insrsid10057886

hen preparing 5 mM chromate with 0.5 mM of EOF modifier (NICE-Pak OFM Anion-BT).  The EOF modifier comes as a 20 mM concentrate.  0.1 M NaOH is used to adjust the pH for chromate electrolyte in the pH study.  Standards are prepared as 1000 ppm stocks, pre
p
ared fresh every 6 months, stored in 200 ml polycarbonate tissue culture flasks.  Dilutions are prepared fresh for each experiment.  Highest quality water and polymethylpentene containers used always.  Injections for electrolyte studies were by hydrostati
c
 means (capillary immersed in sample at height 10 cm above running electrolyte for 30 s; cap is lowered to 0 cm and then immersed in normal running electrolyte).  Voltage is ramped to 20 kV.  Electomigration injection is used only in some cases (1 kV for 
15 s).  Purging for 2 min using 12-15 psi vacuum applied to receiving vial is done between all injections.
\par Peak capacity is first assessed.  Under the conditions (5 mM chromate with 0.5 mM EOF modifier) used here 30 anions (from thiosulfate to }{\scaps\insrsid10057886 d}{\insrsid10057886 -gluconate) 
are resolved in the space of almost 1.5 min.  A previous separation reported elsewhere utilized 20 kV using a 75 \'b5m capillary, but use of 30 kV and a 50 \'b5
m capillary has improved the plate count by 2-fold.  The trade-off for higher efficiency is lowered se
nsitivity:  the same loading time was used and there is a shorter optical path length.  Electromigration can be used however to enrich samples to produce detection limits in the sub-ppb threshold.
\par Ionic equivalent conductance values can be obtained from the literature (CRC Handbook of Chem. and Phys.) and the migration times can be plotted with these values.  The points appear to follow a second-order polynomial curve which can be fit with }{
\i\insrsid10057886 r}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886  = 0.967.  Still, predictions of migration time with the curve are
 only likely in the region of the anions.  When only the more hydrophilic monovalent anions are plotted, the curve fit improves to }{\i\insrsid10057886 r}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 
 = 0.993.  When divalent anions are plotted, it is seen that their migration times are slower than their ionic equivalent c
onductance values would indicate.  The single trivalent anion citrate is also shifted by an equal amount from the divalents and the latter are shifted from the monovalents.  This consistency may come from various factors, likely wall charge effects (the w
all has some positivity associated with it thanks to the EOF modifier).  This wall effect could be eliminated by reducing the ionic equiv. conduc. of divalents by 5 S cm}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886  equiv}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -1}{

nalyzing the known hydrophobic anions (iodide, thiocyanate, and perchlorate), these monovalents have very long retention times on resin-based anion-exchange, largely due to reversed-phase interactions rather than ionic;  their lipophilicity also has an ef

is found to by 0.2 \'b5l/min producing a linear velocity of 10.2 cm/min.  In a 75 \'b5m capillary at 20 kV with the same electrolyte, EOF is 0.32 \'b5l/min and linear velocity is 7.42 cm/min.

 chromate electrolyte.  As background electrolyte is increased, EOF decreases.  Efficiency is also increased largely because of the higher field strength.  Selectivity changes are subtle but significant.  There are no changes in the EOF modifier as chroma
te is altered.  At high chromate concentration (7 and 9 mM), sulfate and nitrite essentially co-migrate.  Migration times are increased steadily but only a few percent (from 5 to 9 mM).
\par Changing the pH from 8 to 12 in 0.5 pH intervals shows predictable effects on migration time.  The effects are greater for the weakly acidic anions.  The strongly acidic anions with pK}{\i\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886 
 well below 8 are unaffected in migration between pH 8-10.  Borate, carbonate, and phosphate show gradually increasing mobilities with pH increases (the effect is most pronounced with borate, pK}{\i\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a1}{\insrsid10057886 
 = 9.24).  These curves are essentially titration curves.  At pH 8, fluoride and phosphate are well-resolved; they virtually co-migrate between  pH 9.5 and 11.5.  At pH 12, phosphate reaches its third pK}{\i\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886 
 and begins to move ahead.  Carbonate is complex in that is changes the relative order of elution depending on the change in valency that occurs within this range:  from monovalent HCO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 \endash }{

 as boric acid is present in borate/boric acid mixtures (pH 8 to 10.5), the borate peak shows fronting rather than predicted tailing; fronting increases as the pH is increased to pH 9.24 (the first pKa).  The tailing that is predicted is not seen until th
e
 pH is 10.5.  This can be explained by the unusual nature regarding boron acidity.  In order to show tailing phenomenon consistent with the electrophoretic diffusional process described by Mikkers et al., borate must move faster than the chromate electrol
yte.  As OH}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 \endash }{\insrsid10057886  ion increases, B(OH)}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886  forms a polar bond with this very fast, indeed the fastest, anion with ionic equivalent conductance of 198 S cm}{

s anion an ideal indicator of electrolyte pH.
\par It should be further noted that at very high pH values (pH 11), the weak acid silicate is observed as a peak following borate.  This silicate was found extracted from the borosilicate glass vial.  Hence it is im
portant to use polypropylene or polycarbonate vials as sample containers when using elevated pH samples.
\par EOF modifiers alter the direction of EOF in mild acid or alkaline solutions.  The EOF modifier used here is an alkylammonium compound electrostatically
 attracted to silanol groups on the capillary wall.  A net positive wall charge is created by this wall coating.  The EOF is normally of greater magnitude than the mobility of most organic anions and some inorganic anions.  Still the fastest ions (thiosul
f
ate, bromide, chloride) would take 30 min using 5 mM chromate, pH 8.0 at 30 kV to reach the detector.  The EOF modifier selected here is able to remain in solution with background electrolytes and does not contribute to the specific conductance of the ele
ctrolyte.  It also has no effect on the selectivity except at concentrations greater than 0.5 mM, where the detection order of Br, Cl, SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 
 with 0.5 mM modifier becomes Cl, NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 , Br, and SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886  at 5.0 mM modifier.  Among all anions, the migration time of Cl
 remains absolutely constant.  The migration of NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886  is only slightly slowed, but those of Br, and SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886  are slowed by 10%.  With increasing modifier, Br and SO}{
\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886  likely form ion pairs with modifier which may be in excess and floating freely.  This would slow 
the anion movement considerably.  This has been verified by measuring conductivities of the various salt forms of the modifier.  Chloride salt of the EOF modifier is more highly conducting than the bromide since it forms no ion pair with the EOF modifier.

ve the range of analysis:  the weak Immobiline base with morpholino derivatives of pK 6.2 and 7.0 have been altered using thiomorpholino derivatives with pK 6.6 and 7.4.  We similarly produced a new Immobiline with pK 8.05 to close the 7.0 to 8.5 gap.  Pr
oblems include the fact that Immobiline can be degraded by (i) hydrolysis of amide bonds to produce an amino acid or diamine and an acrylic acid molecule or (ii) spontaneous autopolymerization can occur in which oligomers become }{\i\insrsid10057886 n}{
\insrsid10057886 -mers.  These effects are mitigated by dissolving alkaline Immobilines in }{\i\insrsid10057886 n}{\insrsid10057886 -propanol and acidic Immobilines in water with low concentrations of an inhibitor added.

 in water and 0.4% ammonium persulfate.  The reaction proceeds overnight at room temp in air-equilibrated vessel.  Detection is at 214 nm and set at 0.1 for many of these analyses.
\par An electropherogram is presented for separation of 5 acidic Immobilines (4.6, 4.4, 3.6, 3.1, and 1.0).  Order of migration/dete
ction is 4.6, 4.4., acrylic acid, 3.6, 1.0, and 3.1.  Conditions are more optimal for the faster peaks, with fronting seen in the late ones (mobility of  phosphate matches with the analytes).  What is curious is the elution of 1.0 prior to 3.1 peak (altho
ugh the difference could be due to mass).
\par Basic Immobilines are similarly separated using different running conditions.  The more basic peaks again elute first, and overall migration time is faster for all analytes since EOF and intrinsic mobility are in the same direction.
\par Acrylic acid was calibrated by serial dilution from 10 to 0.2 m}{\scaps\insrsid10057886 m}{\insrsid10057886 
.  A very good line with decent correlation (r = 0.986) can be fit.  This was then used to evaluate the presence of acrylic acid in Immobilines.  A 1 mol % acrylic acid was prepared in Immobiline, i.e., 20 mM of a pK 6.2 Immobiline was prepared with 0.2 m
}{\scaps\insrsid10057886 m}{\insrsid10057886  acrylic acid.  Adjustment of the absorbance axis and time axis to 10- and 5-fold greater senstivity, resp., shows a tiny speak seen as a normal peak.
\par Detection of oligomers 
is more difficult.  It is done by polymerizing a gel within the capillary, but that is difficult itself in that air bubbles can become trapped.  Alternatively, the capillary can be filled with a liquid polymer.  This liquid polymer is able to separate mon
omers from oligomers.  An electropherogram is presented with just pK 8.5 Immobiline monomer injected and then with pK 8.5 monomer treated overnight with polymerizing substances.  The pH 2.5 phosphate buffer contains 1% Ficoll 400, separation at 25 kV.

\par Various conditions are altered for optimizing Hb variant analysis:  different capillar
y lengths, buffer pH, voltage, and current.  A buffer of pH 2.5 was initially selected as producing the fastest migration with good resolution.  In the 20 cm capillary at 8 kV/15 \'b5A, all Hb species (}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61}{\insrsid10057886 , }{

) migrate within 4 min to the detector.  The fastest is the alpha chain.  Peak area integration shows a 56:44 alpha:beta ratio, which is close to the expected 1:1 ratio and given that extinctions for both chains are identical at the wavelength used.

\par A cons
tant current setting also appears to produce better results than constant voltage.  That latter shows reproducible peaks but migration times shift from run to run (the runs are not thermostated).  The mean, standard deviation, and relative standard deviat
ion are presented with respect to migration times of Hb A:  alpha, 3.23 min, 0.059 min, 1.83%; beta, 3.58 min, 0.061 min, 1.70%; gamma, 3.78 min, 0.028 min, 0.74% (n = 6).
\par Resolution was much improved with a longer (50 cm) capillary, although the total run time increases to 15 min.  All globin chains are essentially detected within 8 min of the run however.
\par A figure is presented of an HPLC chromatogram of tryptic }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886  globin chain.  The protease produces 15 fragments identifed as T1 to T15.  The enzyme also app
ears to have a chymotryptic-like activity, making cuts in some places.  All peptides were characterized by FAB-MS.  The entire HPLC analysis takes 80 min.  With CZE, the analysis is done in 25 min using the 20 cm capillary with clear resolution of all pep
t
ides.  The reproducibility for four runs was very good, essential for a complex mixture to be used in fingerprinting variants.  Another advantage over HPLC is the smaller sample size required by CZE (in the nanograms per injection).  No absorbance shiftin
g is seen as when a change in solvent composition (by gradient, for example) is observed in CZE.
\par Many variants are known and will cause hemoglobinopathies.  Hb C represents a variant of the b-globin chain.  An electropherogram shows a Hb C/Hb A heterozygote with three important peaks: }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61}{\insrsid10057886 , }{

\par Cooley's disease results from defects related to globin gene switching during development.  Essentially, adults have failed to make the switch to Hb A from the fetal form, Hb F.  The chain identified as }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'67}{\insrsid10057886

 zero thalassemia).  The globin variant was separated on HPLC and digested with trypsin.  CZE was done for the peptide map:  T13 was absent and another peak appeared.  The other peak was faster migr
ating (more cationic), accounting for the overall increase in cationicity of the entire globin.  The variant was identified as HbO-Arab after FAB-MS identified }{\i\insrsid10057886 m}{\insrsid10057886 /}{\i\insrsid10057886 z}{\insrsid10057886

\par Rats are killed using pentobarbital sodium i.p. (50 mg).  Before total apnea occurs, the carotid artery is transected to ex
sanguinate the rats and the trachea thereafter cannulated with a blunt 18 gauge needle secured by ligature.  Lungs and trachea are excised from the thoracic cavity en bloc, and the heart and esophagus removed.  Lavage involves 6 sequential lung washes wit
h
 8 ml of normal saline at room temperature (saline prepared with chromatography-grade water).  Lungs are massaged gently during the infusion and aspiration with saline in each cycle.  Usually greater than or equal to 97% of instilled fluid volume is recov
ered and fluid collected in a centrifuge tube.  Centrifugation at 300 g for 10 min removes cellular matter.  The supernatant is then centrifuged at 2300 g for 10 min to remove other material.  The remaining supernatant is frozen for storage.
\par Sample is made 0.2% in trifluoroacetic acid and 6 M in guanidine HCl since the lavage fluid is rather cloudy.  The samples are diluted with PBS containing 0.2% TFA and loaded into a 0.2% TFA-equilbrated reversed-phase HPLC column (C}{

 0.2% TFA followed.  Elution was by a combination of gradient and stepwise changes in acetonitrile and finally in isocratic elution with methanol.  Flow rates were all 1 ml/min.
\par Ideal loading conditions for the complex lung fluid mixture using high performance capillary electrophoresis require that total protein concentration be at least 0.1 mg ml}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -1}{\insrsid10057886 
.  Membrane ultrafiltration leads to apparent loss by protein adsorption and precipitation.  Use of PBS in the lavage fluid complicated an acetone precipitation 
procedure in that phosphate salts are precipitated as well;  use of normal saline does not lead to salt precipitation in the 90% acetone solution.  Lung fluid is then mixed with 10 volumes of acetone and left overnight at 4\'b0
.  Precipitate is recovered by light centrifugation, washed with acetone.  Drained pellet is then resuspended in 0.2% TFA (a decent solubilizing agent which does not affect HPCE at low pH).

i}{\insrsid10057886 , pH 2.5.  Detection is 200 nm with 0.005 AUFS to 0.050 AUFS recorded.  A standard protein mixture is also used to monitor machine performance; injection is by electromigration using 8 kV at 8 s, but for l
ung fluid sample, 10 kV for 10 s.  Injection was done under high resistance conditions to achieve stacking of proteins in the sample.
\par RESULTS.  HPCE of the standard protein mixture always produced sharp peaks but analysis of the complex lung fluid mixture 
was complicated by broad peaks.  This is likely due to the standard proteins being smaller peptides and to electromigration injecting which loads polypeptides in nonuniform distributions.  The variation in migration times of proteins made it necessary to 
i
nclude internal standard analysis.  Experiments with different protein loads indicates higher protein loads affect migration time, a 5-fold increase in transferrin increasing migration time 1% and a 10-fold increase increasing time by 15%.  The ideal rang
e is somewhere between 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml.  Use of the 25 \'b5m capillaries resulted in capillary plugging and so a 50 \'b5
m capillary appeared to alter that effect.  Electrophoresis at 12 kV (the limit for the HPE-100) also produced arcing, and samples were loade
d using 10 kV for 10 s, then run at 8 kV.  Phosphate at 0.1 M was varied between  pH 2.5 and 5.0 and proteins were observed to be more mobile at pH 2.5 and had the best resolution; the higher pH results in signficant peak tailing and longitudinal diffusio
n becomes a significant factor in loss of resolution.
\par It was expected that lung fluid proteins should be enriched in plasma proteins due to the toxic effect of PFIB causing increased permeability of the alveolar lining.  Albumin, transferrin, and IgG would 
be predicted findings in an electropherogram.  Albumin standard is fastest with a single peak, transferrin next with two peaks.  Peak identification of the lung fluid samples was based on internal standardization.  Albumin was clearly observed to be prese
nt in fluid, the second most abundant protein.  Transferrin was identified as well.  IgG was not detected, but its sensitivity is weak with this method since standards migrate as broad peaks and a small amount of Ig would be difficult to detect.
\par HPLC analys
is of UV-absorbing peaks in lung fluid identify 9 protein-containing fractions, and comparisons indicated the presence not only of albumin and transferrin, but separable populations of IgG as well.  These fractions were prepared for CE and single HPLC pea
k
s in some instances resolved as single CE peaks (indicating homogeneity for that separation).  Electrophoretic variants of albumin were potentially identified in some HPLC fractions.  A 10 min peak on HPLC was identified as a UV-absorbing guanidine HCl sa
lt peak; this is surprising in that salts are expected to elute in the void volume (it is likely a contaminant of the salt).
\par [There is more to report in this paper, but the results are not really concisely stated and they demonstrate relative inexperience concerning the principles of CE.]

pH is the mobility rate change with respect to pH.  Variables which can be manipulated include E, with higher voltages producing better resolution, and dpH/dx, which is essentially the choice of ampholyte 
range taken.  Hjerten (1985) postulated that stably focused zones in IEF required elimination of electroendoosmotic flow (EOF).  For this reason he developed capillaries coated with methylcellulose and linear polyacrylamide for doing CIEF.  In these coate
d
 capillaries, the column is loaded and the field applied until a steady-state current is reached.  Subsequent mobilization of the focused zones is achieved by adding salt to anode or cathode.  Electroneutrality rules state that an anion will move in place
 of OH}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 \endash }{\insrsid10057886  or a cation in place of H}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886 
 where the salt is added.  This will distort the pH gradient, causing shifts toward the cathode where excess H+ is present of toward the anode if OH\endash  is present.
\par }\pard \s19\ql \fi475\li0\ri0\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\insrsid10057886 Two disadvantages presented by CIEF.  First is the poor perfo
rmance of coated capillaries in producing narrow zone pH gradients.  Linear polyacrylamide-coated are anchored via covalent bonds unstable in an alkaline medium and subject to hydrolysis certainly at the cathodic end, where NaOH and severe focusing gradie
n
ts are produced.  Washing of the capillary between runs to remove proteins also involved use of 0.1 M NaOH usually, and this can not be done.  A second problem is the use of salt mobilization.  For example when is mobilization to be begun (when current ha
s reached a value or when dI/dt approaches zero?).  Another is turning off the field, allowing diffusion to complicate the results during the time between ending focusing and beginning mobilization.
\par The approach taken here is to use uncoated capillaries and
 exploit the presence of EOF as a mobilizing factor in CIEF.  The balance between the existence of EOF and the need to complete focusing is crucial.  Control of EOF may be achieved by using statically coated capillaries but in which not every site on the 
capillary wall producing EOF is modified.  Another is the dynamic coating process, wherein additives or modifiers are added.  Methylcellulose polymers in high concentrations thoroughly eliminate EOF.

d-silica capillaries of 50 or 75 \'b5m diameter are used (60 cm long with 40 cm to detector).  A 50 \'b5m capillary with 0.1 \'b5
m-thick polyethylene glycol coating is from J&W Scientific.  Proteins and Pharmalytes from Sigma, the rest from Aldrich.  Hemoglobin at 
3 mg/ml is dissolved in 5% solution of pH 6.0-8.0 Pharmalyte with either methylcellulose or polyvinylpyrrolidone as additive.  Catholyte and anolyte for the coated capillary was glutamic acid and arginine, resp., both 40 mM.  For uncoated capillaries, cat
h
olyte and anolyte were 20 mM NaOH and 10 mM phosphoric acid.  Focusing is at 30 kV in coated caps, 20 or 30 kV for uncoated.  Mobilization when done is by putting the cathodic end in 40 mM arginine + 50 mM disodium phosphate;  mobilization commencement wa
s varied according to the current during focusing (from 0 to 6 \'b5A, intervals of 1 \'b5A).  Detection is at 280 nm.  Capillaries are rinsed between runs with 0.1 N NaOH and water.  Proteins used in analysis include cytochrome }{\i\insrsid10057886 c}{
\insrsid10057886  (pI 9.6), chymotrypsinogen A (pI 
9.1), horse heart myoglobin (pI 7.2 and 6.8), carbonic anhydrase I (pI 6.6) and II (pI 5.9), and BSA (pI 4.8).  Proteins dissolved to 1-2 mg/ml in 5% Pharmalyte 3-10 for wide-range analysis.  Methylcellulose was from 0 to 0.4%.  Tetramethylethylenediamine
 (TEMED) can be used a pH gradient extender between 0 and 2%.  A 100 mg/ml commercially available bovine Hb sample in Tris buffer was diluted 1:400 with final 5% Pharmalyte 3-10, 1% TEMED, and 0.1% MC and analyzed.
\par The first experiment was characterizing Hb
 using deoxyHb (pI 7.1) and methemoglobin (pI 7.1) with polyethylene glycol-coated capillary (previously described method used).  PEG-coated capillary used here did not entirely eliminate EOF and MC addition (to 0.05%) was found necessary.  A figure is pr
e
sented in which a Hb/ampholyte mixture containing 0.1% MC is separated.  Salt mobilization were attempted although residual EOF was of sufficient magnitude to produce nearly identical migration times.  Moreover, resolution was not better with the salt-mob
i
lized runs.  With the use of an uncoated capillary in which the concentration of MC was 0.4%, migration times of deoxyHb and metHb are virtually identical.  The resolution was a bit sharper in the uncoated caps as well.  Without the MC additive the uncoat
ed caps do not perform at all.  Other additives tried included polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and Triton X-100.  None did better at resolving peaks, but 3% polyvinylpyrrolidone reduced migration time.
\par CIEF using broa
d range ampholytes and a protein mixture covering the spectrum was done with 0.05% MC present.  All proteins except those with pI values in the basic range were well-resolved within a 25 min analysis time, and trace contaminants could be identified in the
s
e mixtures.  The peaks of chymogenA and myoglobin (separated by nearly 2 pI units) could not be resolved to baseline in 0.1% MC (30 kV applied).  Resolution between BSA and myoglobin (also separated 2 pI units) was more than sufficient.  It was noted that
 
proteins with acidic pI values show more diffuse zones than do basic proteins.  This is exacerbated when the MC concentration is increased.  These data indicate that the acidic proteins (always migrating last) will show zone broadening the longer they rem
ain in the capillary, such as when EOF is reduced or when the protein is especially interactive with the wall.
\par Poor focusing on the basic side may be due to less than optimal control of the EOF, namely when EOF is too fast.  Hence MC should be adjusted upwa
rd.  It was seen that varying MC from 0.1 to 0.4% resulted in very poor peak formation of the acidic proteins with increased MC.  Another consequence of too slow and EOF was the chymogenA no longer appeared, presumably because the focusing time was too lo
n
g and focusing of the pI 9.1 protein has occurred in a zone formed beyond the detection point.  Assuming a gradient spanning seven pH units along a 60 cm capillary, the completion of focusing in this system would allow detection of only a range of protein
 from pH 3 to 7.7.
\par In order to be able to read the entire pI range intended, adjustments 
would need to be made.  One is extending the point of detection to where it is close to the cathod.  Another is to lengthen the capillary, i.e. making anode to detection point longer while keeping the detection point-to-cathode distance the same.  Another
 is to mobilize proteins past the detection window toward the anode, opposite EOF.  Another is to use an extended pH gradient such that the portion of the gradient at the cathode is higher to bring the protein into detectability.
\par Machine limitations did not
 allow bringing the detection point closer to the cathode.  Lengthening the capillary from anode to detection did not improve resolution or detectability, and only increased migration times.  This is because a lower field strength is present in the capill
ary and allows greater zone broadening since the steady state level focusing is not as tight.
\par Anodic mobilization by adding 80 mM NaCl to the cathode produced no peaks at all.  This is likely due to the opposing EOF being of greater magnitude.  Finally exte
nding the pH gradient was tried using TEMED mixed in with the ampholytes.  TEMED supposedly increases focusing range to 12.  Indeed with TEMED addition, all protein from 9.6 to 6.8 showed sharp peaks and good resolution in the figure.  MC was present to 0
.1%.  With extension of the gradient by TEMED, proteins on the basic side had completed their focusing and so less MC could be added to prevent too fast an EOF.
\par Attempts to measure EOF with varying MC using a neutral compound were without result.  Acidic pr
oteins may serve as a decent indicator however, as they focus near the anode boundary.  The presence of MC not only affects EOF, but the higher viscosity also reduces longitudinal diffusion as the major factor contributing to zone broadening.

INTRO.  Conventional gel IEF can separate components with a resolution as small as 0.02 pH units.  Limitations of the technique inclu
de sample prep, gel running conditions, nonlinearity of staining reactions.  Hjerten and Zhu first described IEF using capillaries without gels with pressure loading.  Proteins must be focused into their zones and then brought past the detector:  this is 
d
one by either replacing catholyte with acid or anolyte with base.  Other means include adding salt to the catholyte or anolyte.  Capillary IEF is rapid (complete in 15-20 min and zones detected by on-tube monitoring.  As EOF is unacceptable in uncoated ca
pillaries for IEF, coated capillaries are required to obtained stabilized zones in the ampholyte mixture.  CIEF has been used in analysis of hemoglobins, transferrins, and immunoglobulins.

 between runs.   Ampholytes in samples were 2% final conc.  Focusing at 6 kV const. voltage using 1
0 mM phosphoric acid at anode and 20 mM NaOH at cathode.  After focusing is complete (amperometric dropping monitored), mobilization is initiated by replacing the 20 mM NaOH catholyte with the appropriate mobilization catholyte;  mobilization then uses 8 
kV constant voltage field.  Detection is at 280 nm.  IEF can be visually monitored using colored proteins with 200 \'b5
m i.d. coated glass capillaries.  The IEF sample mixture is hemoglobins A and C, phycocyanin, myoglobin, and cytochrome c; diluted 1:10 in 2%
 BioLyte 3/10 ampholytes.  Heat generation along the capillary length was measured using a special liquid crystal sheet which is temperature-sensitive.  Focusing and mobilization in this system is 3.5 kV const. V and limit 25 \'b5A.
\par The pH gradient along the 
length of the capillary is primarily determined by the composition of the ampholytes.  EOF becomes significant and interferes with zone formation in uncoated capillaries.  Coated capillaries become necessary to provide resistance to EOF and to contribute 
to stable zone formation.  Zones are sufficiently narrow that protein concentrations are 200- to 300-fold higher than in the sample.  CIEF shows the greatest potential for micropreparative applications.  With focusing complete, OH}{

 the anode end.  Addition of salt induces mobilization by ion replacement which alters the pH:  if salt is sodium chloride, Na}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886  enters to reduce H}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886 
 on one end, causing pH to increase.  If Cl}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 \endash }{\insrsid10057886  enters the cathode end, OH}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 \endash }{\insrsid10057886  drops and pH decreases.  Protein
s and ampholytes acquire charge and move toward the electrode.  Salt should be added to the end nearest the detection window, as proteins will move toward it.  The pH gradient is essentially maintained during mobilization, with zone broadening and loss of
 resolution minimal.  Resolution is ~0.02 pI units.
\par As the pH gradient is formed along the entire length of the capillary, proteins focusing past on the side of the detection window past the mobilization direction will not be registered.  If broad-range amp
holytes with short capillaries are used, considerable information is lost:  on a 14 cm capillary with 3-10 ampholytes with 2.8 cm between catholyte and detector region, this means proteins >pI 8.6 are not detected (~20% of the gradient).  TEMED has been d
e
scribed as a means to extend the range and thereby bring proteins known to have high pI values within range.  TEMED is added to ampholyte-sample to 0.5% (v/v).  It fills the cathodic segment during focusing, making the pH gradient steeper (and possibly co
ntributing to some loss of resolution).  Proteins such as cytochrome c (pI 9.6) are then detected.
\par Mobilization depends upon the movement of co-ion into the capillary (and is thus influenced by co-ion concentration and mobility) and upon buffering capacity 
of the ampholyte (type and concentration) to resist changes in pH.  The slope of the pH changes gradually and the slope becomes shallower toward the other end of the capillary; for this reason, proteins at the far end are mobilized with lower efficiency a
n
d exhibit diffusion and defocusing, sometimes resulting in no detection.  We have found that zwitterionic agents allow proteins across the entire gradient to be mobilized.  Either the basic catholyte or acidic anolyte is replaced with the zwitterion havin
g
 a given pI and then mobilized.  The mechanism is such that zwitterion moves into the capillary to induce a pH shift as does NaCl mobilization, and that it moves to a point in the gradient equivalent to its pI, stops and induces displacement of the contig
uous zones.  For zwitterions with pI in the acid range, acidic proteins are visualized.  For zwitterions in the neutral range, only neutral and basic proteins are visualized.
\par Salts (neutral salts, buffers, ionic detergents) in the sample are deleterious to 
resolution.  High (100 mM) salt can cause zones to focus in the center of the capillary (100 mM NaCl in a sample on a 14 cm capillary caused zones to focus in the central 3-4 cm).  Also focusing and mobilization time are increased (4- to 5-fold) and zones
 
are diffuse.  Following the production of heat during focusing of samples without salt shows that primary zones form at the capillary margins and heat generation increases as electrical resistance increases at these segments.  Heat then extends to the cen
t
er part of the capillary and then extends the length of the tube.  In samples with 100 mM salt, initial current is high and overheating was already a risk.  This heat then forms in the center of the capillary where the gradient is largely formed, the heat
 being sufficiently high that protein denaturation and precipitation is a reality.  Prior desalting of samples is nonetheless recommended.
\par Precipitation is a problem anyway as proteins in IEF are at their pI, a point of minimum solubility for many proteins.
  Precipitation in CIEF causes poor reproducibility both of peak area and migration time.  Sharp peaks (spikes) are evidence of precipitation.  Inclusion of non-ionic detergent (Triton X-100) or ethylene glycol to sample+ampholyte reduces this possibility

INTRO.  CE analysis of anions using the indirect UV with a background absorbing co-ion of similar mobility brings detection sens
itivity to the micromolar range.  Detection limits can be lowered to nanomolar ranges if electromigrative sample introduction under isotachophoretic conditions is employed.  This occurs by loading a component of relative low mobility to the sample.  The c
a
rrier ion becomes the isotachophoretic leading electrolyte while the sample additive becomes the terminating electrolyte.  The effect is to produce preconcentrated narrow zones at the entrance of the separation capillary.  The Kohlrausch regulating functi
o
n is relevant.  The concentration of ions in the isotachophoretic zones is adjusted close to the leading (carrier) electrolyte concentration.  If sample was originally in pico- or nanomolar range, and the carrier is in millimolar range, the concentration 
e
ffect is a million- or billion-fold!  It is necessary to monitor nanomolar anion concentrations in water used in steam generation, in ultrapure water in semiconductor production, and in other industrial water samples.  Accepted methods involve use of IC b
ut using complex techniques such as coupled separation modes or gradient elution schemes.  CE may be relatively simpler and more cost-effective.

l of 70 mM octanesulfonate is added to the 100.0 ml standards.  Contamination is very probably if gloves and disposable polyethylene pipettes (Samco Pipettes) are not used.  The 2 ml sample vials are similarly soaked in 18 M}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'57}{
\insrsid10057886  water for 24 h prior to transfer of standard.  Two 45 second electromigrative injections at 5 kV are employed and yield decent results.  If the additive is half the concentration (35 \'b5M), only one inject
ion is possible and trace enrichment is prevented.  A second injection produces ~20% lower values than the first injection.
\par Detection of anions in the ppb range was previously reported using electromigrative trace enrichment in the CZE/indirect UV detectio
n system.  The system included a 5 mM chromate electrolyte.  Resolution of fluoride and phosphate was less than complete when hydrostatic injection is employed as an alternative.  PO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 
 migrates to shorter times, largely because the isotachophoretic conditio
ns produce an increase in the pH of the chromate buffer.  Peak resolution can be obtained by increasing chromate concentration (to 10 mM), which actually worsens the resolution (although not to baseline) of the SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{
\insrsid10057886 /NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886  pair.  But since NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886  is largely absen
t in industrial water samples, the change to higher chromate achieves the more important goal of optimizing separation of F and PO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 .  The F and PO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 
 peaks are also resolved from formate which migrates in between, useful in that it is a contaminant of \'93pure\'94
 water samples.  Oxalate, acetate, and propionate are separated in this system.  A figure presents a trace analysis of common inorganic and organic anions (45 s/5 kV injection with 75 \'b5M octanesulfonate in the sample; run at \endash 15 kV in a 75 \'b5
m x 60 cm uncoated capillary (52 cm effective).  Carbonate is by far the largest peak;  it cannot be standardized since concentrations are difficult to control.  It may be used as a reference for normalizing migration time variations.
\par Chromate concentration also influences trace enrichment.  Three concentrations of chromate were tested in which SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 
, and Cl were injected in fixed amounts, and their peak areas per 1 \'b5equiv per liter were determined.  The peak areas increase in all respects (although the ion concentrati
ons were never varied).  Sensitivity almost doubles for the anions in going from 5 to 10 mM chromate.  The Kohlrausch regulation function states that the relationship between concentration of sample zones on one hand and concentration of chromate on the o
ther should be linear.  Nonlinear behavior observed at > ~7.5 mM is likely due to increased EOF which decreases the efficiency of electromigrative trace enrichment.
\par The voltage was 15 kV rather than the 20 kV of the previous work because low frequency basel
ine oscillations were observed due to electrolyte overheating.  These changes are compared in electopherograms of a 15 kV separation using 45 s trace enrichment and 20 kV with 30 s enrichment.  With the latter conditions, one peak (propionate, 5 ppb, 4.23
 min) is approaching its detection limit.  The former conditions give overall better sensitivity (increased by 1.5) because of longer trace enrichment.  Oscillations of frequency 0.25 min are very apparent in the 20 kV record.
\par A table is presented showing t
he sub ppb detection limits using the trace enrichment method (5 kV, 45 s) for the common anions.  IC is capable of similar or better detection limits in matrix-free pure water, but trace enrichment times are of the order of 5-10 min.  Another disadvantag
e of IC is that separation of fluoride from short-chain alkyl carboxylates and from strongly retained anions (SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 
, oxalate) requires longer than 15 min compared to less than 6 min with CZE and coupled separation modes or gradient elutions are required.
\par The effective range of analysis was determined for 9 anions (Cl, SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , PO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
, F, and four organic acids) to check the usefulness of quantitation.  A table is presented which shows the correlation coefficient, and the slope and intercept of the line for each anion.  Analyte concentrations were between 0.1 and 1 \'b5
M for the range used and the lowest correlation was 0.993.  Intercepts were found high for SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 
, formate, and acetate, but this was because they are contaminants of octanesulfonate used in trace enrichment.  It is interesting that the slopes of mono- and divalent ions are within \'b110% of one another.  Yeung first looked into the possibility of a 
\'93universal\'94 calibration standard with indirect UV detection using IC.  A single standard calibration may also be possible with CZE if indirect UV detection is employed.  In addition to analyzing the range, sample precision was evaluated for 0.5 \'b5
M for inorganic anions and 0.4-0.5 \'b5M for carboxylates.  For each an electromigrative trace enrichment was done on a 2 ml volume containing 70 \'b5
M sodium octanesulfonate.  The table presents the ppb value and the relative standard deviation data.  The highest RSDs were found in acetate and propionate (7.5% and 7.2%, resp.) and the lowest was in formate (2.0%).
\par Trace analysis of industrial water must be performed using methods which spike samples with and which detect other ions.  Primary water (PW) is water from nuclear p
ressurized water reactors containing 500-2000 ppm boron added as boric acid (2855-11420 ppm boric acid).  Li is also present at 3 ppm (as LiOH).  As boric acid will fluctuate, CZE was performed on samples containing various borate levels with Li at 1.7 pp
m
.  For the common inorganic anions, 5 ppb is considered normal, the maximum allowed being 40 ppb.  If borate ion is present at unknown but high concentrations, it is most likely going to contribute to changes in isotachophoretic conditions used in the tra
c
e enrichment procedure; this effect is also likely to be pH-dependent.  Increases in pH would cause borate to become the terminating electrolyte in such procedures.  Three electropherograms are presented in which octanesulfonate was varied (0, 25, and 75 
\'b5M).  Electromigration loading is 5 kV for 30 s.  The sample without octanesulfonate produces no peaks, indicating borate clearly contributes nothing to trace enrichment.  At 25 \'b5M and 75 \'b5
M octanesulfonate anion peaks are clearly observed, with not much difference in peak areas between the two.  Anions in the PW-matrix were calibrated in the range between 0.1 and 2.0 \'b5
M:  all lines had perfect or perfect correlations for the four inorganics determined, and a universal calibration standard is possible even in this borate-containing, complex matrix.
\par The influence of boric acid presence on the migration times and quantitation of four anions (Cl, SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
, and F) was assessed.  In the range of 500-2000 ppm boron, there is little effect on migration time.  If the
 analysis is extended to 3000 ppm boron however, migration time is seen to increase clearly.  Increasing boric acid has a signficant effect on the pH of the sample:  pH 7.3 at 500 ppm, pH 6.85 at 1000 ppm, pH 5.65 at 2000 ppm with LiOH remaining constant.
 
 The lower pH increases electrical resistance in the sample segment initially in the run, causing a slower increase of current.  When these times are normalized by dividing the migration times of the anions with the migration time of carbonate, the normal
i
zed times are now seen to be equal to one another.  Such normalization procedures can be done with carbonate (always present) as an internal standard and used in the normalization.  This obviates an effects contributed by sample pH.  Analysis on the effec
ts of peak areas from 500-5000 ppm boron, it is seen that peak areas increase for SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886  and Cl increase overall more rapidly than for NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
 and F.  The intercept values for Cl and SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886  clearly show that these are contaminants of boric acid as well.  The actual variance is <10% as indicated by RSD of NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{
\insrsid10057886  and F.  All practically possible samples (from 500-2000 ppm boron, detection limits up to 40 ppb) are analyzable with this system.
\par A second sample was investigated in which the industrial water is characterized as secondary water (SW).  It normally contains ammonia or morpholine at 3 ppm.  Reaction products of basic additives and ion-exchange resins are also present.  Permitted maxim
a
 of inorganic anions and carboxylates is at 40 ppb, but the typical values present are at 5 ppb.  An electropherogram is presented of anions in the presence of 3 ppm morpholine.  The carbonate peak is bigger largely because of the higher pH of the sample.
  There is also a slight shift toward greater migration times.  Calibration of the anions is similar in quantitative reproducibility to the previous samples with their complex matrices.

\par RESULTS.  Kraft Black liquo
r from pulp and paper production is the most challenging for IC analyses, with a high pH matrix with reactive sulfur and polyphenolics often poisoning columns.  As capillaries are free of packing materials susceptible to these agents, there is no pronenes
s to fouling, with simple 1000-fold dilutions in water used in analysis (see previous work).
\par Some samples can interact with capillaries however.  Repearted injections of brewed coffee consistently increase migration times (somewhat proportionally) of the analytes (chromate buffer system with tradename modifier, pH 8, }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'6c}{
\insrsid10057886  = 214 nm); a simple rinse occurs between injections (2 min purge with electrolyte).  Automated three-stage rinse cycles of 0.1 M LiOH (2 min), 18 M}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'57}{\insrsid10057886  water (1 min), and running electrolyte (2 m
in) eliminated this time shifting altogether and was necessary between sample injections.
\par Anionic disinfection products in drinking water require monitoring.  CIE using the electrolyte system above separates 8 common inorganic anions with certain oxyhalide
s and halogenated organic acids also resolved in less than 5 min.  In IC, three common problems are chlorate/nitrate resolution, separation of fluoride from acetate and monovalent organic acids, and perchlorate determination (this anion has a very long re
t
ention time on resin-based IC columns).  Alterations in modifier (Waters OFM Anion-BT) concentration had effects on order of elution of some ions, e.g., reduction from 0.5 mM to 0.3 mM placed the more hydrophobic perchlorate anion ahead of fluoride (an io
n-pairing interaction between perchlorate and OFM perhaps is more significant at higher OFM concentrations).
\par Chemical lot analysis is complicated the product ion being in excess contaminant ions, with inability to resolve (detect) trace impurities.  Dilutio
n is obviously no answer since trace ions would fall below detection limits.  With IC, consideration both for analyte selectivity and total ion-exchange capacity is necessary.  Attempts to compensate for sample overloading come at the expense of shorter a
n
alysis times, with column re-equilibration following overloading often exceeding 1 h.  A 1500 ppm trisodium citrate solution is spiked with 1 ppm of chloride and sulfate in the chromate-acetate-OFM system and CIE show a huge, very back-tailed peak of the 
c
itrate with relatively tiny chloride and sulfate peaks eluting ahead, in that order.  The detection limits for chloride and sulfate (S/N=2) would be estimated at 48 ppm and 25.7 ppm, resp., for the solid trisodium citrate dihydrate salt.  The electrophero
g
rams are utterly reproducible in that overlays of traces from four injections appear as one signal trace.  The hydroxide form of OFM Anion-BT was used (converted to hydroxide using anion-exchange resins) and final pH of the chromate system adjusted with a
cetic acid.  On IC, this trace analysis  is likely to require 1 h (as opposed to 3.5 min in CIE) with isocratic elution as citrate has a long retention.  
\par The CIE-resolved citrate shows a sharp front and very severely back-tailed peak:  this would mean trac
e impurities eluting after citrate would be on a downward sloping baseline caused by the major peak.  Such peak asymmetry is a result of electrodiffusional processes thoroughly understood and manipulatable [see Hjerten, }{\i\insrsid10057886

trate analysis, and a vertical drop after the peak apex is reached is observed.  The hexanesulfonate co-ion is less mobile and helps to provide analysis of the trace components of interest.
\par Hypochlorite and persulfate present another challenge insofar as th
eir potential reactivity with separation chemistries.  This has made quantitation using IC a difficult task, in addition to reducing column life.  In the last twenty years, only one IC methodology each for persulfate and hypochlorite is reported, the latt
e
r using amperometric detection before anion-exchange (this is really flow-injection analysis (FIA)).  This latter method works only if no other electroactive species are present to augment the hypochlorite signal.  The persulfate method requires excessive
 
run time (37 min) esp. if weakly retained species have to be separated.  A first consideration is electrolyte selection to prevent reactivity with the analytes:  persulfate has the highest ionic equivalent conductance value of the 36 anions analyzed above
 
and would be predicted to migrate ahead of thiosulfate and bromide.  Persulfate added in high amounts (500 ppm) to the 36 anion mixture showed a very badly shaped peak observed late in migration; a reaction with the OFM modifier is suspected.  Eliminating
 the modifier requires a polarity reversal and bring the chromate electrolyte to pH 11 (with LiOH).  The high pH produces a \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 eo}{\insrsid10057886  greater than the \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886 
 of the analytes, and this draws the components to the detector rather than pushes them.  The selectivity of anions is therefore reversed, with lower mobility anions reaching first compared to higher conductivity ions.  Persulfate elutes last and after br
omide anion as expected.
\par This same electrolyte system was used for hypochlorite and the anion is seen to migrate ahead of chlorite, carbonate, chlorate, perchlorate, and chloride.  Hypochlorite is observed to decompose rapidly with a 10% reduction in peak a
rea from a 31 ppm solution in 10 min.  Nonetheless, hypochlorite standards prepared from 31-77.5 ppm were prepared and analyzed, and the plot trace was linear with r = 0.997.

\par CIEF resolution is as low as 0.02 pH units, which makes this techni
que ideal for Hb variant analysis, where mutations result in separations at least this large.  Hb is water soluble and is present intracellular at concentrations of at least 300 mg/ml;  this is important in evaluating the susceptibility of Hb to precipita
t
ion during the focusing of proteins.  pI values for the unusual variants are 7.15 for Hb F, 7.25 for Hb S, 7.50 for Hb C.  The normal variant Hb is pI 7.10.  High resolutions are obtained because high field strengths (400 V/cm) are possible during focusin
g
 when currents fall to near zero, hence Joule heating minimized.  Also because electroendoosmosis is eliminated with coating, mobilization does not occur before focusing is complete.  The small bore of the capillary allows excellent heat dissipation as we

l, reducing zone broadening by convection.  Ampholytes 3-10 were found to absorb strongly in the UV below 225 nm.  Multiwavelength scanning between 200-360 allows identification of these ampholytes.  Hb also shows a characteristic spectrum which is identi
fiable using multi-wavelength scan mode.  In the visible, Hb also shows various spectra depending on variant as well as depending on state (oxy- or deoxy-).

tters are reported for larger capillaries, while smaller capillaries must be loaded by pressure or electromigration.  With electromigration, there is bias in sample introduction (only ions).  This paper discusses factors influencing detection of metal cat
ions, changes in detection wavelength, mobility of co-ion, detection cell length, and injection mode.

mM; Aldrich) which complexes the metals.  Detection at 214 nm is at low- to mid-ppb levels.  Detection at 185 nm gave much better extinction despite the apparent increase in background noise.  Fronting is observed in all peaks at the UVCat-1 mobility is l

ignificant, the latter an important effect whenever analyte ions have mobilities different from the running co-ion.  Electromigration dispersion is a function of analyte ion concentration, and a technique of reducing such dispersion is the make the runnin

\par Mobility matching is also better.  UVCat-1 was then replaced with more mobile UVCat-2, and the UVCat-2/HIBA complex has a nat

with electromigration (or at least more resolved).  The reproducibility of the electromigrative injection mode is assessed for 5 consecutive injections (electrolyte is UVCat-2/tropolone, 185 nm detection, bubble path capillary, sample is 1:800 dilution of
 
standard):  reproducibility increases with increasing dilution, but the range of relative standard deviation (RSD) was between 3-12% (Li the best, Ba the worst).  In terms of migration times, reproducbility was < 2% RSD.  For higher concentrations, reprod
ucibility is < 1% RSD.  Calibration curves of peak area vs. cation concentration should be constructed and show excellent correlation.  Valid curves are done for a concentration range of 1.5 orders of magnitude.

ually one of the enantiomers is active, the other less active, inactive, or producing unwanted side effects.  The need to produce and market single enantiomers requires a suitable analysis system.  Advances in chiral analysis have been made in GC and NMR,
 
with separations mostly seen in HPLC.  Protein phases, mobile phase additives, cavity phases, and Pirkle phases are used in HPLC to separate chiral cmpds.  Separation efficiencies are often low and baseline resolution conditions hard to attain, making tra
ce level determinations difficult.  Recently CE chiral analysis of }{\scaps\insrsid10057886 d,l}{\insrsid10057886 
-amino acids has been done, using methods such as ligand exchange or MECC using chiral additives.  Also pharmaceuticals have been separated chirally.  In one CZE separation, epinephrine i
nteracts stereospecifically with derivatized cyclodextrin added to the carrier electrolyte.  This report demonstrates the power of cyclodextrins to create separations.

n of the b-amino alcohol GGR1 also using the same conditions.  The therapeutically preferred enantiomer is (R)-GGR1 and can be stereospecifically synthesized.  Chiral HPLC separation of this compound is formidable:  a number of columns and mobile phases h
ave been tried, but the separation was achieved only with the ion-pair reagent }{\i\insrsid10057886 N}{\insrsid10057886 -benzyloxycarbonylglycyl-}{\scaps\insrsid10057886 l}{\insrsid10057886 
-proline, which has been used for other b-amino alcohols.  This method depends on a non-aqueous environment in which chiral selector and analyte form a
n ion-pair.  The (R,S)- and (R)-GGR1 are prepared as salts, being insoluble in HPLC mobile phase.  With CE the salt is dissolved and analyzed directly.  Also monitoring is at 214 nm rather than 300 nm:  this makes it more sensitive as the extinction is 13
 times greater at the lower wavelength.  Costs are rather low too:  the most expensive compound is the cyclodextrin, with a series of injections consuming only 360 mg (that is only $0.50 if }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD costs $1.50/g).

-CD increases resolution, a urea solution was tried but 6 M urea + 16 mM }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD caused full loss of chiral resolution.
\par Migration time, resolution, and tailing were plotted against changes in ionic strength.  Dilution of th
e electrolyte caused increased tailing and loss of resolution.  Greater ionic strengths had just the opposite effect.  The increased time is a result of more carrier charge in the electrolyte.  Electrolyte should essentially be 100 times greater in ionic 
concentration than the analyte.  Also electrolyte mobility should be similar to analyte or tailing is severe.  Peak tailing was worse for GGR1 (a +2 ion compared to Na}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886  co-ion) than fro clenbuterol (Na}{
\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886 ).
\par Additionally different buffers and pH values were te
sted.  EOF decreases with pH and can result in increases in migration time as EOF flow is with the solute mobility.  Calculations of chiral resolution shows that amino alcohols are best resolved at pH 4.0, where clenbuterol has a +1 charge.  It was observ
ed that citric acid/sodium acetate buffer had a specific effect on GGR1 which was related to ionic strength:  clenbuterol migrates faster in this low ionic strength system than did GGR1, and this may be due to ion-pairing.
\par The Beckman P/ACE system uses a li
quid cooling to avoid Joule heating which contributes to band broadening or which decreases analyte-additive binding.  Here we have used relatively high molarity solutions and not observed deleterious temperature effects.  Resolution, migration time, and 
ratio of solvent viscosity at 25\'b0 vs. viscosity at the running temperature (}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'68}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 25}{\insrsid10057886 /}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'68}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 T}{\insrsid10057886 
) were plotted against thermostated temperature.  The resolution for both GGR1 and clenbuterol enantiomers falls steadily and in a linear fashion, although it was still baseli
ne.  Migration time is correlated with resolution in a steadily observed decrease.  The current was seen to increase from 84 \'b5A to 153 \'b5A, and with a voltage gradient of 13 kV across 57 cm, the Joule heating is about 1.9 to 3.5 W cm}{
\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -1}{\insrsid10057886 .  Migration times also scale with solvent velocity; this plot shows that viscosity is the dominant effect which cause the migration times of analytes to decrease.

\insrsid10057886  down to 3.13 x 10}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -4}{\insrsid10057886  cm}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886  V}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -1}{\insrsid10057886  s}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -1}{\insrsid10057886 
, an order which is the same obtained using paper electrophoresis.  The transition metals showed a range of mobilities greater than the alkaline earth group and do not interfere with the analysis of the latter.  The fact that Fe(III) shows a \'b5}{
\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886  comparable to all divalents suggests that it is likely present in an effectively divalent state such as [Fe(OH)EDTA]}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 2\endash }{\insrsid10057886 .  Note that EDTA has a \endash 4 c

\par A relationship between mobility of a relatively unhydrated ion and its molecular mass has been shown:  \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886  }{\insrsid10057886 {\field{\*\fldinst SYMBOL 181 \\f "Symbol" \\s 10}{\fldrslt\f3\fs20}}}{

line earths (with Mg chelate showing a deviation greater than expected).  As for other metals the relationship is not obvious.  Mobilities of metal chelates increase within the same period of metals according to the increase in atomic number, with fourth 
period mobilities in agreement with those of the Irving-Williams series (Irving & Williams,}{\i\insrsid10057886  J. Chem. Soc.}{\insrsid10057886  1953: 3192).  Where mobility-mass relationship is not obeyed, the influence must come from hydration.
\par In particular, ion chromatography to resolve Ca a
nd Sr is difficult as they show identical chemistries.  Four electropherograms are presented showing separation of Ba, Sr, Ca, and Mg (in that order).  Three show variations in effective length of the capillary:  the 25 cm cap provides little sep., 50 cm 
a
 little more but Ca and Sr are not fully resolved.  The 75 cm cap resolves better, but not to baseline.  All runs were at 20 kV.  If the 75 cm cap is run at 30 kV, not only is analysis 10 min shorter (between 13-17 min for all four peaks) but Sr and Ca ar
e almost baseline-resolved.

 (theoretically it should not), this may be attributable to Joule heating, which affects mobility as a 2% increase for each 1\'b0 C increase as a rule.  If this relation is true, the change in \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886 
 suggests that carrier temperature increase 2\'b0 C for every 100 V/cm increase.  While high field strengths make for shorter analysis times, noise is considerable.  We recommend using 20 kV with a 70 cm capillary.

EDTA chelates many multivalent metal ions stably, but some chelates dissociate at low concentrations of excess EDTA.  Barium and strontium can dissociate during migration if only borate is present.  Inclusion of EDT
A (to 2 mM) was therefore necessary to maintain a complex.  Still, while Ca-EDTA and Mg-EDTA complexes are quantitative, Ba and Sr complexes are not during migration.
\par The effect of carrier electrolyte concentration was also assessed with Ba, Ca, and Mg ana
lytes.  Naturally as any ion presence is increased, migration times of analytes are increased as they compete to carry current.  Consequently, no borate added causes all three ions to migrate rapidly (< 10 min time), but peaks were asymmetric or malformed
 
and sensitivity lost.  With 2 mM borate, peaks are immediately sharpened but Ba and Ca are hardly resolved.  At 10 mM, there is near baseline resolution of Ba and Ca, and at 30 mM, all ions are well resolved.  Lower borate concentrations contribute to a g
r
eater EOF since the charge density of the silica capillary is not masked by the ion.  The effect of electrolyte in the sample is also assessed:  if electrolyte is present (borate at 20 mM + 2 mM EDTA in 0.2 mM metal) peaks are not as sharp (fat peak width
s) as samples with no borate.  This demonstrates the stacking effect occurring at the sample-electrolyte boundary.  Peculiarly, 0.1 M NaCl + 2 mM EDTA added to the metal samples did not effect electropherograms.  This is likely because Cl}{
\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 \endash }{\insrsid10057886  ion has a very sm
all mobility relative to divalent chelates and again does not alter the stacking effect.  Water samples could generally be analyzed with 0.01 M borax and 2 mM EDTA used as carrier, and only serum and seawater would necessarily be diluted as they are in ex
cess of 0.1 M NaCl.
\par The effect of pH was tested by adding either solid boric acid or NaOH solution to 0.02 M borate + 2 mM EDTA carrier.  Electrophoretic mobilities for alkaline earths from pH 8.0 to 10.5 really showed no pH-dependence with the 50 cm capill
ary at 20 kV.  This generally attests to the stability of complexes formed during the run.
\par Reproducible migration times and peak heights and areas are affected by EOF.  A table is presented to show reproducibility of t}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 m}{\insrsid10057886 , \endash \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886 
, peak height, and peak area of the chelates.  Mobilities are very reproducible, but t}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 m}{\insrsid10057886  and t}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 0}{\insrsid10057886 
 (neutral water marker) showed slight daily variation.  PH and PA are sufficiently reproducible.
\par Sample size was also tested by varying the time of loading in the vacuum system (\endash 127 mm Hg).  1
 second is about 3 nl.  The PA is linear from 1 to 8 seconds, while PH is linear from 1 to 6 s.  The stacking effect appears to be limited above 6 s, and PH values are disturbed as peaks become broader.
\par The method used here can be used to assess Ca and Mg present at > 10 \'b5M.  Curves were calibrated from 10 \'b5
m to 1 mM using 3 s loading.  The RSD values were calculated for peak heights and areas and they were the same for both when assessing Ca.  The RSDs for Mg were almost the same as for Ca.  Reproducibilit
y in quantitation of PH and PA appears to fall off with use of shorter capillaries (25 cm effective).
\par This method was applied to an analysis of Ca and Mg in water and serum.  In a previous report using the chelator 1,2-cyclohexanediamine-N,N,N,N-tetraaceti
c acid (CyDTA), endogenous substances interfered with Ca determination.  With this method, both Ca and Mg are well detected and matrix interference is not observed.  Serum analysis required washes with 1 M NaOH and water for good reproducibility.

Using pKa values taken from the literature, curves showing pH dependence of the effective mobilities of individual subspecies can be approximated using an iteration procedure.  A table is presented showing pKa values and actual mobilities (}{
\i\insrsid10057886 u}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 act}{\insrsid10057886 ) of the benzenedi- and benzenetricarboxylic acids; these are calculated using eqn 5 from the measured or effective mobilities (}{\i\insrsid10057886 u}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 eff}{
\insrsid10057886 ) given in Table 1 at the different pH values.  Then a curve for the actual mobility of the molecule as a sum of the ionic subspecies present is fit by least squares (this is presented as a mobility vs. pH figure).

ficiency is also affected by selectivity, with plate height and number affected by the effective charge number (see Intro).  The actual mobility and degree of dissociation will affect the separation.   Both the latter and charge number are dependent only

 will illustrate the influence of the charge of analytes on this charge-dependent factor in the equation.  The factor increases with increasing charge on analytes, the 
change steep at smaller values than at larger values.  Although the maximum value is at the highest charge number where the system has the highest separation efficiency, this does not necessarily indicate resolving power.  The factor is undefined for char
g
e values of zero for both analytes, as it should be, since there is no electromigration.  The factor is zero whenever one analyte is zero and the other of finite value;  the resolution is itself undefined however since the selectivity coeffiecient becomes

actor with system in which charge varies with pH.  The voltage and, to a certain degree, temperature will be the other factors in CZE resolution.  The nature of voltage dependence is discussed elsewhere by others, but the equations already given indicate

 for pairs of components at various pH values.  For the six test substances combined into their pairs (15 possible), we drew figures (3D) in which }{\i\insrsid10057886 R}{\i\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ji}{\insrsid10057886  is a function of pH and of }{
\i\insrsid10057886 U}{\insrsid10057886 .  These curves are more complex than those for monovalent acids since more sets of p}{\i\insrsid10057886 K}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886 /}{\i\insrsid10057886 u}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 i}{
\up6\insrsid10057886 eff}{\insrsid10057886  combinations are possible.  In some cases, resolution improves with increasing pH, showing a maximum, then resolution falls as the pH continues to rise.  At some
 pH values, resolution falls to zero as a minimum, basically indicating identical effective mobilities of the analytes.  In all cases, increases in voltage results in resolution increases, some dramatic, but for the most part slight at all pH values.  The
r
e is likely to be more than one point at which resolution falls to zero at several pH values; theoretically two trivalent acids can show up to five pH values with a resolution of zero.  The test of theory is demonstrated in a plot of the experimentally de
termined }{\i\insrsid10057886 R\-}{\i\dn6\insrsid10057886 ji}{\i\insrsid10057886  }{\insrsid10057886 
vs. pH:  the experimental values are imposed on the theoretically drawn lines using both eqns 7 and 11 (which show different lines) and it is observed that the d
ata points closely adhere to theory.  Agreement is excellent where resolution is low or high between two analytes.  Such equations can therefore be used to calculate the range of pH values at which resolution exceeds the desired minimum, 1.5 for eqn 7 and
 
6 for eqn 11.  The 15 possible pairs for the 6 analytes have their pH ranges evaluated at which the minimum resolution requirement is met.  Then the pH ranges at which all 15 possible pairs show resolution from one another are evaluated for overlap.  Theo
r
etically, all 6 analytes should be resolved from one another at a pH value which falls within the pH range overlap.  One such pH value, pH 3.73, was tested and it was shown that the 6 analytes did resolve.  If the pH is 4.37, which is outside the overlap 
regions by only 0.04 pH unit, it can be seen that one pair shows less than adequate resolution.
\par Another parameter of interest outside the resolution is analysis time.  It is a important to reduce the analysis time to the minimum possible while maintaining d
esired resolution.  The total time depends upon the migration time of the slowest component, which is a function of mobility, itself a function of pH.  This is where the overlapping pH range chart comes in again.  The pH at which the slowest analyte has i
t
s highest effective mobilities in which resolution is reached or exceeded should be the electrolyte pH.  For our 6 analytes, this pH is 4.33.  The electropherogram for the pH 3.73 system mentioned earlier shows the slowest component migrating in about 9 m
in, but at pH 4.33, it migrates to detection in about 5.7 min.  Hence analysis time is improved by about one-third in this case.
\par It is important to note that effective charge not only influences selectivity but efficiency as well.  The use of pH values can 
be used to limit the number of experimental guesses at which analytes will resolve and in the time it will require.  Unfortunately, for many charged substances which are polyvalent, there is a paucity of data regarding pK values or ionic mobilities in par
t
icular.  It should be noted that actual and effective charge number (the latter important in the use of these equations) are distinct, and can be very different in magnitude particularly for ions of high charge density, which tend to associate with counte
r ions and to alter the effective charge.  The effective charge of ionic polymers is often related to a }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'7a}{\insrsid10057886 
 potential rather than any nominal charge number.  Another experimental limitation is concentration overload, producing asymmetrical peaks

INTRO.  High performance CZE combines the effects of electrophoresis and electroosmosis to produce excellent resolutions of ionized substances.  Only in recent years have methodologies for inorgan
ic analysis started to catch up with other applications of HP-CZE.  Efficiency of CE for these ions might be excellent, but resolution may remain a problem.  Complexing agents added to running systems help to improve selectivity since metal complexes show
 
varying stabilities in the separation process.  Foret et al have used indirect UV detection in separations of lanthanides with a hydroxyisobutyric acid complexing counter ion.  Swaile and Sepaniak have used laser-induced fluorimetric detection of complexe
s of metal/8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid (HQS).

Another technique might be to produce fully stable anionic chelates (rather than an equilibrium between free metal and chelate) which nevertheless move at different mobilities.  Detection would be direct 
as in IC.  An evaluation of HQS-metal chelates is given for alkaline earth and transition metals as pre-formed chelates.  Special attention is directed to differences between pre-column and on-column complexation on mobility, resolution, and detectability
.
\par RESULTS.  HQS is obtained from Alrich (Steinheim, Germany):  it is made 0.005 M in 0.01 M sodium tetraborate as a stock.  Metals are prepared as their nitrates at 0.002 M in 0.01 M nitric acid.  Borate running electrolyte is made in double-distilled water
 containing 10}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -4}{\insrsid10057886  M HQS, with pH adjusted with HCl or NaOH as fit.  The Waters Quanta 4000 CE system is used and Waters AccuSep capill. of 75 \'b5
m i.d. are used.  Detection is UV absorbance at 254 nm.  The capillary is conditioned with 5 mM tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (Fluka) once a week for 15 min followed by water then running electrolyte.  All electrolytes are 0.45 \'b5
m filtered.  Injection is by siphon.  Electroosmotic flow (EOF) velocity is made using acetophenone as the neutral marker with polarity reversed.  Samples of tap water are acidified to pH ~ 2 with conc. HNO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
 and stored in polyethylene at 4\'b0 prior to analysis.
\par Mobility is dependent directly on charge and inversely on mass.  EOF is opposite in direction in these studies with the electrophor
etic vector, but reversed polarity produces ipsidirectional movement and was the case in the work of Swaile and Sepaniak.  Subtle manipulations of differences in \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886  and \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 eo}
{\insrsid10057886  components can produce the resolutions desired.  Several conditions were set up for the separation (in all cases, running direction is toward the anode):
\par (1) untreated capillary with borate electrolyte:  the capillary wall is expected to be quite anionic given the silanol dissociation constants.  In this case | \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 eo}{\insrsid10057886   | >> \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{
\insrsid10057886  and is expected to contribute significantly to migration.  \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 app}{\insrsid10057886 
 is found to be < 0, and therefore no peaks are detected in the run, as they move in the opposite direction.  An alternative possibility for failure to observe peaks is that chelates decompose because of 
ligand-exchange reactions with silanol groups, a finding shown with reversed-phase chromatography.
\par (2) capillaries are dynamically coated with tetraalkylammonium salt (TTMAB) in borate:  surface silanols are expected to be neutralized somewhat and now EOF becomes less significant.  Now | \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886  | > | \'b5}

 > 0, which means peaks should be seen as complexes migrate with less EOF component.  Indeed the Ni- and Cu-HQS chelates are seen at 5.5 and 9.5 min, resp.  The order of elution of these particul
ar chelates is reversed in ion-pair RPC.  The CE separation is part chromatographic and part charge of solute.  A plot of log (\'b5\rquote }{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 app}{\insrsid10057886 ) vs. log }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 n}

\par (3) capillaries are dynami
cally coated and run in a borate buffer containing free ligand (HQS):  the mobility components due to particle nature and EOF, including observed mobility are the same as in condition (2), although EOF is somewhat further decreased.  So mobilities are exp
e
cted to increase and indeed Ni and Cu complex both elute 1 minute earlier compared to condition (2).  Adsorption of HQS to capillary walls by hydrophobic not to mention electrostatic interaction is also likely to occur.  While EOF may be reduced, shorter 
m
igration times of complexes may also occur as result of HQS (with its hydrophobic chemistry) competing with the TTMA alkyl chains serving as pseudo-stationary phase;  uncomplexed HQS would compete for adsorption with TTMA to metal/HQS complexes (a sort of
 \'93chromatographic\'94 effect), and the resulting association may produce a super-complex with enhanced mobility.
\par (4) If this hypothesis obtains, then some effect of altering HQS concentration in the running electrolyte should be seen.  Plots of \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886  vs. [HQS] d
o show an increase in mobility with 0.1 mM HQS as opposed to none, but this increase is not sustained at 0.2 mM which has the same mobility for all tested chelates, and mobilities are severely reduced with poorer resolution of some chelates when HQS is do
ubled to 0.4 mM.  In this case | \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886  |}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'20\'b3\'20}{\insrsid10057886 | \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 eo}{\insrsid10057886 
 | although the direction of observed mobility is still toward the anode.  The likely explanation is formation of another adsorption layer to the capillary wall caused by hydrophobic interaction of excess HQS wi
th HQS already adsorbed at the lower concentrations.  The anionic portion of another HQS added in effect re-establishes a charge separation between capillary wall and the electrophoretic medium, the basis for EOF.  Hence the \'b5}{
\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 eo}{\insrsid10057886  component once again increases.
\par It is easier to produce a model 
which assumes maintenance of complex formation under electrophoretic conditions.  Not all metal chelates are stable however, and an equilibrium between complex and non-complexed metal will contribute to a net mobility which is the average or combined mobi
lity of the individual forms.  Lessons taken from HPLC work indicate that higher concentrations of chelating reagent in injected samples or inclusion of agent in the electrolyte buffer compensate for such possibilities.
\par Insofar as use of precolumn complexat
ion, it is found that stoichiometric HQS concentrations show complete complexation only for metals with high complex stability, e.g., Cu(II), Fe(III), and to lesser extent, Ni(II).  HQS is usually required to 3-fold excess to produce more complete complex
a
tion for all metals.  Detectability is very much improved for Zn(II), Co(II), Cd(II), and Mn(II), with less stable alkaline earth complexes also detectable.  Greater than 3:1 molar ratios start introducing interference, and as uncomplexed HQS migrates bet
w
een Zn and Fe chelates, its increased signal is undesired.  HQS also has a limited pH range:  pH > 9.5 or < 7.5 reduces complexation or causes zone spreading.  If the pH goes below 6.5, peaks are too broad or split (divalents can react to form both 1:1 an
d 1:2 complexes).
\par Including the reagent in the buffer instead should promote complete complexation.  Four electropherograms are presented in which the [HQS] in the running buffer is varied: 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mM (other conditions:  15 kV running, sample contains 180 \'b5
M metal ion, 2.8 mM HQS).  Increased peak intensities were obtained with HQS presence, but with higher HQS presence, especially at 0.2 and 0.4 mM, band broadening, reduction in mobility, and increases in absorbance background are evident; such
 factors reduce detectability.  Complexation without addition of HQS is not complete in the run, and this is true even if 0.4 mM HQS is present and for the more stable complexes.  Both small migration times and low flow mixing in the narrow bore of the ca
pillary account for this incomplete complexation.
\par The effect of [HQS] in the sample is also presented in three electropherograms.  The [HQS] were 2.5, 2.8, and 3.0 mM, with other conditions as in the previously described run and the HQS in the buffer is 0.1
 mM.  The peaks in the 2.5 mM sample show less intensity as if the complexation has not yet completed.  Peaks in 2.8 and 3.0 mM HQS looked nearly identical, which is why 2.8 mM HQS is used (to save on reagent).  Lower pre-column complexation HQS:metal rat
i
os result in peaks with small heights and poor efficiency for Ni, Co, and Zn complexes (less stable Mn, Mg, and Ca chelates form broad, asymmetric zones).  Sample containing no complexing reagent led to additional unfavorable detection effects:  slow, pos
i
tive baseline drift, a small rapidly migrating peak and a matrix dippeak ("chromatographic" effects in that they are observed with HQS-complex resolution on RP-HPLC).  Larger increases in sample [HQS] produce no additional effect on peak heights but will 
instead interfere with detection of the Fe(III)-complex, which migrates closely with uncomplexed HQS peak.
\par The effect of running voltage on resolution was examined.  Higher voltages improving efficiency are mitigated by the small differences in migration ti
me of the analytes.  The voltage of 15 kV in these analyses was selected largely because of the desire to keep analysis time short.
\par The effect of buffer selection shows that borate buffers were best:  complexation, detectability, and resolution are all opt
imized.  Phosphate buffers produced peak broadening (with less stable complexes) and a lower mobility is observed; this poorer efficiency may be due to complexing interactions between phosphate ion and metal (more so than with borate).  Selectivity was go
o
d with carbonate buffers, but the lower average mobility meant longer analysis times (with migration times > 20 min).  The effect of borate buffer concentration on both EOF and metal complex mobility is presented in a table:  with rising borate buffer con
c
entration, metal complex mobility decreases.  This is natural since there is now more competing ion for the same voltage (with little change in specific conductance).  Similarly the EOF decreases.  The EOF, opposite in direction to the analyte mobilities,
 
is only about 40% of the analyte mobilities.  At 10 mM, both EOF and analyte mobilites do not change much with increasing borate concentrations.  Resolution is not similarly improved at higher borate concentrations; at 10 mM both selectivity and detectabi
lity are at their most optimal.
\par Altering pH not only affects pH-dependent mobility of ionic components, but the EOF as well.  Curiously, EOF was found to decrease with increasing pH in the system employed (from 22 x 10}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -5}{\insrsid10057886  cm}{
\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886  V}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -1}{\insrsid10057886  s}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -1}{\insrsid10057886  at pH 8.7 to 15.5 x 10}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -5}{\insrsid10057886  cm}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 2}{

 at pH 9.5).  This may be related to the partiallly hydropphobic nature of the capillary walls.  A plot of the difference in migration times between certain complexes and pH (}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'44}{\i\insrsid10057886 t}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 m}{
\insrsid10057886  vs. pH) shows a bell shape for many complexes, which would indica
te an optimum pH range for highest resolution.  This range is in fact very narrow, as at high and low pH values negative effects on efficiency are pronounced.  Ionic strength exerts an effect as well, as revealed by use of a pH scale in which ionic streng
t
h was fixed.  Increases to 15 mM (10 mM sodium tetraborate was buffer to which salts are added) slow migration times by 4-7 min, depending on the metal ion, whereas decreasing pH by only 1.5 units decreases the migration time by only ~0.6 min.  This is co
nsistent with the double layer theory in which pH changes and ionic strength influence EOF in the opposite fashion.  pH has less of an effect than does ionic strength.
\par It was discussed above that HQS has a pronounced effect on EOF.  Shorter migration times 
in some HQS-containing buffer systems can decrease selectivity.  Optimum conditions were investigated and an electropherogram is presented:  2 s injection with 15 kV running voltage, 10 mM borate with 0.1 mM HQS electrophoresis buffer, and metal ions of 1
00 \'b5M Ni, Zn, Fe, and Cu and of 200 \'b5M Co and Cd were used; 0.002 AUFS should detect.  It should be noted that Mn, Mg, and Ca complexes migrate in the narrow time frame between Fe and Cd complexes;  Al complex co-migrates with Fe chelate.
\par The metal chelates were also calibrated (25 s injections,}{\i\insrsid10057886  n}{\insrsid10057886 = 4-6).  Correlation coefficients for 9 metals (Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) were all > 0.991.  The range of analysis was from 0.4 \'b5
M for more color-producing complexes to 900 \'b5M.  Slope and intercept values 
are given in a table for interpolation within the analyzed ranges.  The range is at least 2 orders of magnitude in most cases, and 3 orders for metals forming the most stable complexes or complexes with higher absorptivities (Cu(II), Zn(II), Fe(III), Ni(I
I
), Co(II)).  A table is presented which gives the detection limits of these 9 ion complexes (defined as S/N=3).  Injection was 5 s using hydrostatic pressure (elevation at 10 cm).  Detection at 254 is not optimal but a constraint of the instrument.  Relat
ive standard deviations of the peak areas for six replicate analyses with metal conc.=40 \'b5M was calculated as being very small (1.5% was the largest value for one metal chelate).  This reproducibility is such that internal standard use is unwarranted.

m have been tried.  Coated capillary use mitigates EOF which permits stable zones to form which can later be mobilized past a detector (other approaches to detection have been used as well).  Mobilization techniqu
es have also included use of hydrodynamic flow while maintaining voltage.  Recently Mazzeo and Krul and our group have demonstrated that EOF present in uncoated capillaries and adjusted to a proper magnitude can allow focusing to occur within a time perio
d
 before any detection is done;  subsequently, the EOF brings the focused zones past the point of detection.  In the work by Mazzeo and Krull however, they used completely filled capillaries, necessitating the use of other additives to make basic proteins 
detectable.  This paper continues to define the factors influencing this type of CIEF.

 70 cm capillary (50 cm to detector) was employed.  Unless stated otherwise, catholyte is 20 mM NaOH containing 0.06% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and anolyte is 10 mM phosphoric acid.  Applied voltage is 10 kV with currents starting between 25-30 \'b5
A, falling to 1-2 \'b5A.  Sample is loaded by vacuum for 20 s, which fills an estimated 20% of the capillary  (the ABI system is equipp
ed with a 20 and 5 inches Hg vacuum system, 1 in. Hg = 3386.4 Pa).  Ampholines are present to 2.5% and the protein load is 160 \'b5
g/ml.  Detection is at 200 nm (for carrier ampholytes) and 280 nm (for proteins).  Capillaries are rinsed 10 min with catholyte between runs.  Both MC and HPMC are obtained as 2% aqueous solutions  (4000 cP at 25\'b0
) from Sigma.  HPMC and MC are added only to the catholyte unless stated elsewhere.
\par CIEF under our conditions is done by first filling the capillary with catholyte and the

 that EOF modifier addition to catholyte was essential for this CIEF procedure, else the EOF was too fast to permit focusing to occur and resolution to be achieved.  A range of HPMC concentrations (0.015, 0.030, 0.060, 0.100, 0.150%) were tried and all pr
o
duced good results, although 0.06 and 0.1% HPMC seemed best.  EOF-reducing polymer addition to sample helped to resolve which have a pI close to each other.  Resolution was not helped by adding polymer to catholyte.  Polymer concentrations also affected t
he introduction of sample, with lower concentrations allowing more sample.  [This is obviously due to changes in solution viscosity, not noted by the authors.]
\par Migration times are also influenced by the presence of catholyte vs. sample zone at injection.  Presumably EOF magnitude is lower with less catholyte in the capillary, and so retention times will be longer.
\par MC was also analyzed for its effects at 0.15, 0.10, 0.06, and 0.03%.  No significant differences were observed with respect to EOF and protein int
eraction with capillary walls.  It was observed that these polymer additives, having differences with respect to their own interaction with the proteins in the sample, can significantly influence the migration behavior the proteins, some or all, in the sa
mple.  Concentrations of HPMC of 0.03% and MC at 0.015% were sufficient to bring about the desired results.  Some insignificant improvements were achieved with addition of urea (1 M), glycine or glycylglycine (1% w/v).
\par The effect of varying the electrolyte 
concentration was observed as well.  With MC present at 0.03%, variation in the NaOH concentration very much influences the retention time (this clearly dictates EOF and would be expected to have such an effect).  With increased NaOH concentration, retent
i
on times are considerably longer, which permits improvements in resolution during focusing.  Higher concentrations of phosphoric acid have the opposite effect, resulting in shorter retention times.  Retention times are also longer with increases in both c
atholyte and anolyte will maintaing the 2:1 molar ratio of NaOH:H}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 PO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 .
\par The pH 3.5-10 ampholyte range was adjusted to 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0%.  The 5% ampholyte mixture produces faster migration than the 2.5%.  Indeed for the three proteins used a reduction is ti
me of 6-7 min (5% from 18 to 22 min, 2.5% from 24 to 30 min) is seen with the higher ampholyte range.  Mobilization was very slow with 1% ampholyte.  One expects that higher ampholytes permit faster focusing and keeps the sample zone length smaller, maint
aing NaOH longer in the capillary and thereby increasing EOF.
\par Electric field strength effects were also tested at 10, 15 and 20 kV.  Increased voltages result in shorter migration times.  Isoform differing by tenths of pI units were not resolved well at 20 
kV.  Hence resolution and speed of analysis are very much affected by ampholyte concentration and voltage.  Longer capillaries do provide better resolution in the end.
\par The effect of different sample injections was tested (10-30 s on one instrument, up to 1
 min on another).  As sample zone length is increased, higher resolution was observed;  this is largely because focusing occurs throughout the length of the sample zone, and the longer zone will produce a flatter gradient.  Also longer sample zones means 
the ampholyte reaches the zone detector slower than shorter length zones, largely due to the effects of increasing or decreasing EOF-producing catholyte.

INTRO.  EPA has certified iorganic contaminant analysis using ion chromatography (IC), yet there are problems with analyte ion co-elution.  CIE is emerging as a better means of making such analyses:  few
er moving parts; uses low cost, easily replaceable open tubular capillary instead of packed column.  Sample prep is minimal and analyses are done in less than 5 minutes.  Amount of electrolyte consumed is at least an order of magnitude smaller than for IC
 eluent.  Only nanoliters of samples are used.  The method given here shows how CIE is used to analyze drinking water, groundwater and wastewater for Br, Cl, F, NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{

RESULTS.  A Waters Quanta 4000 CE system is used with a negative power supply.  Hg lamp for indirect UV at 254 nm, with a polyimide-coated fused silica 60 cm x 75 \'b5
m capillary.  Injection is hydrostatic with 10 cm elevation of sample for 30 s.  Time consta
nt is 0.1 s; data acquisition at 20 Hz.  Ion chromatography (IC) is also done with a Waters Action Analyzer with 700 WISP Satellite autosampler and Model 431 conductivity detector.  Data is collected at 1 Hz.  The column is a Waters IC-Pak Anion HC (150 x
 
4.6 mm i.d.) methacrylate-based anion exchanger.  For CIE, a 100 mM sodium chromate tetrahydrate + 0.056 mM sulfuric acid stock is used to prepare electrolyte.  The EOF modifier used was a 20 mM concentrate of CIA-Pak OFM Anion-BT from Waters.  Working el
ectrolyte is 4 mM chromate\endash 0.3 mM OFM Anion-BT, pH 8.1.  Methods used here are patented.  A MilliTrap H}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886 
 membrane cartridge is used with a modified eluent containing borate-gluconate, prepared from analytical-grade reagents boric acid, gluconic acid, and LiOH H}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 
O.  Glycerin and HPLC-grade acetonitrile are also used.  Eluents and working electrolytes are prepared fresh daily, filtered, degassed.  Standard anions are present as 1000 ppm stocks.  Particulates in samples are filtered with pre-rinsed Millex-GV 0.22 
\'b5m filters; in some cases, run neat or in others diluted with water.
\par As the electric field is applied to the capillary, free zone separation occurs as the components separate according to mobility.  The carrier co-ion should have a different UV absorban
ce but similar mobility to the analyte to provide optimal peak symmetry.  Detection sensitivity is maximized when the background ion has both max. molar absorptivity and matching ionic mobility.  The EOF modifier present ensures flow is directed to the de
tector.
\par In a figure presented, a 7-anion standard in the low ppm range is shown separated in CIE.  The order of elution is Br, Cl, SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{

er migration times are tailing somewhat.  This occurs when analyte ion mobility is slower than electrolyte co-ion.  Analytes much faster than electrolyte co-ion generally front.  Peak asymmetry also increases when analyte concentration is high relative to
 
electrolyte.  CIE selectivity is completely a function of ion charge and mass, viz., mobility.  Peak capacities in CIE are quite high, with efficiencies of > 500,000 theoretical plates.  Other factors affecting selectivity include pH, ionic strength, EOF 
modifiers, complexing agents, and organic solvents.
\par Two electropherograms are presented, one of well water in which Cl, SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 , and CO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
 are clearly resolved.  The first three are well resolved and quantitated; carbonate is a weak acid with low mobility at pH 8.1 (existing largely as HCO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 \endash }{\insrsid10057886 
).  At a higher pH (pH 12), carbonate is its dibasic form and elutes just after NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 .  The shape of the carbonate peak is not sharp and this is attributable to \'93electrostacking\'94
:  sample zones in hydrostatic injection must have lower ionic strength than the electrolyte carrier for such stacking to occur, since sample ions accumulate inside a very narrow zone at the sample-carrier electrolyte boundary.  CO}{
\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886  is present in excess though and produces an adverse effect, a broad, 
asymmetrical peak.  Diluting with water is one solution.  The second electropherogram is of tapwater and shows the same four ions plus fluoride at its minimum level of detection.  With IC, fluoride elutes early and very close to the void volume of cations
, neutral species, and the classic water dip.  Note the sensitivity of F in CIE:  this is due to its \'93lightness\'94:  as UV detection is based upon displacement effects of the electrolyte co-ion (chromate), it would take two F}{
\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 \endash }{\insrsid10057886  ions to displace one CrO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 2\endash }{\insrsid10057886 .  Fl
uoride is a light ion with more molecules per unit concentration.  Consider that 1 ppm F (MW=18.9 g/mol) is 0.05 mEq/l, while 1 ppm Cl (MW=35.5 g/mol) is 0.03 mEq/l.  Hence, mass to mass, F produces a greater response than does Cl.
\par An electropherogram of a groundwater sample taken from an EPA-identified hazardous waste site shows a 5-ion separation:  Cl, NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 , F, PO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , and CO}{
\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 .  The carbonate is present in great excess but does not interfere with the other analytes due to its selectivity.  There appears to be
 no effect of counter cations present in the sample.  The water peak does not appear until 8 min.  In another, very high carbonate sample, Cl, NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
, and F are easily distinguished.  In particular, detecting F with the amount of excess carbonate present woul
d be impossible using IC;  60 ppb F is detected here.  In another groundwater sample, sulfate is present in high amounts, yet chloride, which elutes just ahead is still resolved.
\par The principle of selectivity for IC vs. CIE is altogether different:  in IC, 
anion retention is a function of valence state and affinity to anion-exchange sites, with monovalents eluting first and analysis times of 10 to 20 min.  An IC chromatogram is presented for the analysis of both untreated and treated industrial wastewater. 
 
Present and identifiable in both chromatograms are carbonate, chloride, and sulfate.  Present at the beginning (near void volume) of the untreated water analysis are some other peaks not present in treated water.  Water, cations, neutral organics will all
 elute at the void volume, while weakly retained anions (F, CH}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 \endash }{\insrsid10057886 ) elut
e early and are poorly resolved.  If voided materials are in excess, the tails of their peaks are likely to interfere with early anion elutions; similarly with elevated carbonate levels.  Corrective action often requires methodology developments employing
 gradients or coupled IC systems.  The treated wastewater sample represents wastewater passed through a Millitrap H}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886 
 cartridge, which removes cations, reduces carbonate, and neutralizes high pH samples altogether.
\par With CIE, sample cations never proceed into the separation area.  Strong acid anions, i.e., Br, Cl, SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
, F, and phosphate have high charge-to-ionic radii ratios and are thus the first to migrate through.  Organic acid are also common in wastewater (formate, acetate, propionate) and migrat
e later, being signficantly removed from their migration time band.  While they are fully ionized at pH 8.1 (pK}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 a }{\insrsid10057886 
values being in 3-5 range), their smaller charge/mass explains the lower mobility.  Carbonate migrates among the short chain carboxylates.  Onc
e the last peak of interest is detected, purging and preparing the capillary for the next run is commenced without need to wait slower anions or neutral cmpds.  The capillary is refilled with running electrolyte.
\par In the wastewater sample evaluated by IC, a
n electropherogram is run and a fluoride peak which failed to be detected by IC, even after pre-treatment with the Millitrap membrane cartridge, could be detected in CIE.  Additionally presented is a wastewater sample from a powerplant.  Cl, SO}{
\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886  are found along with CO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
.  The nitrate peak is present at 2.2 ppm, and considering the sample is a 1:10 dilution, this means nitrate is detectable at 220 ppb.  The linearity of quanitation extends 3 orders of magnitude.  As for reproducibility, the RSD for peak
 areas is < 0.5% for 15 injections, < 1.4% for four injections.
\par The four water samples analyzed by IC and CIE are compared in a table, with results in ppm presented.  The Cl, SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , and NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
 correlate well, and these ions are not really a problem for either method.  Fluoride peaks found in CIE were never detected in IC.  This new method has been submitted to ASTM committee D-19 on Water.

INTRO.  Indirect UV detection of analytes involves a limited dynamic range for analysis.  In general, the limit of quanitation must be three times the limit of detection.  Detection is lowest (best) when a chro
mophore has a large extinction coefficient and its concentration is adjusted for optimum photometric sensitivity.  Background absorbance should not exceed 0.1 AU in a circular cell.  Others have found detection limits are strongly influenced by concentrat
i
on and molar absorptivity of the running electrolyte.  Moreover, it has been reported that one-to-one displacement between analyte and indirect chromophore occurs only when mobilities are matched, and so mobility can affect matters a great deal.  At the h
i
gh end, loss of resolution may occur from concentration overload rather than photometric signal saturation.  Dispersion at high analyte concentrations occurs as a result of unequal analyte and electrolyte mobilities; of course there will never be a mobili
t
y match between electrolyte co-ion and all analytes since the driving force for separation is differences in analyte mobility.  The recommendation is to keep the analyte concentration a fraction of the electrolyte.  Strategies for optimizing the dynamic r
anges in CZE are presented.

RESULTS.  Acetic, propionic, and butyric acids and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (Aldrich), b-cyclodextrin (Advanced Separation Technologies), high quality water, and NaOH to adjust electrolyte pH are prepared.  An ABI 270A-HT CE system with 50 \'b5
m x 72 cm (50 cm effective) capillary is used.  T=30\'b0, V=30 kV positive, and detection is indirect at 240 or 283 nm.  Injection is by vacuum for 5 s.
\par The strategy involves proper chromophore-electrolyte conditions and analyte concentrations.  Matching electrolyte and analyte mobilities will be a feature and will be termed as \'93mobility tuning.\'94
  Such tuning is to be achieved with complexing the electrolyte with cyclodextrin.  As cyclodextrin is slow and the electrolyte is fast, the tuning
 will be to an analyte of intermediate mobility.  Finding an electrolyte of optimum mobility is difficult under any circumstances.  The electrolyte should have large extinction in the wavelength range of the detector and complex with cyclodextrin.  2,6-na
phthalenedicarboxylic acid (2,6-NDC) appears to match these properties.  At pH 9, its mobility is faster than for acetate and EOF is fast enough to permit short analysis times.
\par Case 1:  When the analytes are present at similar concentrations and these are >
 1mg/ml, the electrolyte should also be concentrated to prevent concentration overload.  Unfortunately, the current imposes an upper limit on electrolyte concentration, otherwise Joule heating is a problem.  For the system employed here, 7 mM electrolyte 
i
s fine; this varies for capillaries that are thermostated differently or for different column voltages and dimensions.  Now a wavelength is chosen from a spectral scan of the chromophore (in the electrolyte under conditions to be used) which produces a ba
c
kground of ~ 0.1 AU;  this is 283 nm in the case of 2,6-NDC.  This produces an analytical dynamic range of 1-400 mg/l in analytes of equal concentrations.  The range depends on electrolyte mobility, which should fall ideally in the middle of the range of 
m
obility of analytes.  In the electropherograms of acetate, propionate, and butyrate, the highly loaded samples show severe fronting (slanted front sides, vertical back sides on the peaks) which says the mobility of 2,6-NDC is slightly faster than the anal
ytes.  If }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-cyclodextrin, which complexes many aromatics, is added to 5 mM, 1000 mg/l analytes then show faster migration times and close to baseline resolution.  The C4 compound, eluting always first, is still a bit fronted, the last cmpd., C2, is now back
-tailed.  This shows that }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD/chromophore complex alters the mobility (slows it down), with peaks of equal mobility becoming symmetrical and tailing when the effective or \'93tuned\'94
 mobility becomes equal to or less than analyte mobility.  The C3 component was symmetrical under these conditions and its dynamic range extended to 1000 mg/l.  When 2,6-NDC was reduced from 7 to 1 mM and }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 
-CD included in 10 mg/l samples at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mM, the alterations in tailing and symmetry of peak are dramatically observed.
\par Case 2:  Suppose analytes are at similar concentrations and < 1 mg/ml.  In such event, detection limit should be optimized at the expense of a lowered upper concentration limit.  Here the wavelength is selected to be 240 nm, where extinction is highes
t and represents a }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'6c}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 max}{\insrsid10057886 , or close to it.  The chromophore is reduced to 1 mM to keep background absorbance to 0.1 AU.  The detection limit for analytes is now 25 \'b5
g/l, but the upper limit for analysis is reduced to 50 mg/l as well.  Chromophore mobility is now tuned to match the C3 (middle of analyte mobility range) by adding }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -CD to 3 mM in this case.
\par Case 3:  Suppose analytes are present at widely varying concentrations (trace component analysis).  A combination of electrolyte selection, mobility tuning, 
and flow reversal are used in this case.  The trace component can emerge on the sharp side of the overloaded component.  Mobilty of the chromophore is tuned to match trace component for highest sensitivity.  The relative molar responses (normalized for mi
g
ration time) for acetate, propionate, and butyrate with 2,6-NDC are 1.00:0.77:0.57.  With mobility tuning, sensitivity is greatly increased.  If the trace component falls on a tail or front of the major peak, adjusting the mobility tuner should help a gre
at deal.

  PS-CZE has not been exploited in separation of protein or nucleic acid.  Polyacrylamide gels serve tw
o functions in that they prevent zone broadening as a result of convective forces and they provide a size-excluding sieve.  The large surface-to-volume ratio in capillary geometry guards against convective Joule heating, while linear polymers in solution 
s
erve to provide a sieve.  Linear polyacrylamide and polymers of methylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose have been used to sieve oligos and DNA fragments using PS-CZE.  PS-CZE has several advantages over capillary gel CE (CGE), being fast, simple,
 and providing an abundance of systems without capillary changeover.  Separations have been enhanced by complexing DNA with intercalators such as ethidium bromide (EthBr).  These things are studied here.

+ 7 M urea, pH 8.85 (TBEU) and using an HEC polymer solution varied as 0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75%.  The applied voltag
e is 20 kV and detection at 260 nm.  ~1.6 ng sample is injected (approx full range is 0.01 AUFS).  The largest fragments of DNA are detected first, as would be true in gel filtration column system.  This is because, although the inherent mobility is towar
d
 the anode (injection end), EOF is greater and the net migration is toward the cathode.  In general, migration times in all three runs start at 14 min, but the last migration time vary because HEC apparently improves separation.  The lowest HEC concentrat
i
on does not resolve the 11 identified fragments well at all except for the two largest (and then only marginally), but the higher HEC concentration very much improves resolution of small fragments.  Hence, larger fragments are separated well with lower po
lymer concentrations while the reverse is true for small fragments and higher polymer mixes.
\par Ion-pairing compounds were used to see what effect they might have on EOF.  TEA, TMAH, TBAP, and THAB were all used at 5 mM and these agents had no effect whatsoeve
r on modifing EOF (the EOF under these conditions, using TBEU buffer with neutral marker injected, was 4.3 }{\insrsid10057886 {\field{\*\fldinst SYMBOL 180 \\f "Symbol" \\s 10}{\fldrslt\f3\fs20}}}{\insrsid10057886  10}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -4}{

).  In the EOF measurement, pGEM DNA fragments in the ion-paired medium emerged unresolved at various migration times for each of the ion-pair systems, but all times are longer than with buffer alone.  The data are clear that ion-pair agents associate str
ongly with DNA but to different degrees, and ion pair have no resolving power.
\par EOF measurments were also performed on polymer solutions.  Increasing HEC of 0.25%, 0.50% and 0.75% produce EOF values of 4.13, 3.89, and 3.71 }{\insrsid10057886 {\field{\*\fldinst SYMBOL 180 \\f "Symbol" \\s 10}{\fldrslt\f3\fs20}}}{\insrsid10057886  10}{

, resp., indicating the significant effect of solution viscosity on particle movement.  The relative viscosity (relative to 20\'b0 water) was 1.66, 3.82, and 7.26 for these respective HEC concentrations.
\par When ion-pairing agents ar
e mixed with polymer solutions, an effect on EOF is observed.  While there was no effect with ion-pair reagents alone, and the effect of a polymer such as HEC has been shown to alter EOF as a result of viscosity changes, the table of data in which differe
n
t concentrations of ion-pair reagent are added to a solution of HEC at 0.50% all show variations in EOF.  For TEA at 3, 5, and 7 mM, the EOF values are all 3.6 but reduced from 0.50% HEC in buffer alone (value = 3.9).  For TMAH at 1, 3, and 5 mM, EOF valu
es were 3.8, 3.6, and 3.6, resp.  TBAP was evaluated at 1, 3, 5, and 7 mM and the EOF was 3.8, 3.6, 3.4, and 3.2, resp.  THAB at 1, 3, and 5 mM showed EOF at 3.7, 3.5, and 3.5, resp.
\par The effect of these ion-pair reagents at different concentrations in the presence of polymer solutions was now tested on the changes in migration times of DNA fragments (}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'46}{\insrsid10057886 
X174 DNA digest was used).  The migration times are plotted against fragment of different sizes (but not on a linear or log scale): this plot merely demonstrat
es that increasing ion-pair concentration has the effect of increasing migration times particularly as the fragment size gets smaller and for particular ion pair agents.  For example, with no reagents in 0.50% HEC, the 1353 bp and 72 bp (largest and small
e
st) have migration times of 7.3 and 14 min, resp.  With 5 mM TBAP present, the respective times are 11.3 and 27.7 min, representing an increase of 55% and 98%, resp.  With all ion pair agents an interaction with DNA is apparent, slowing the time of migrat
i
on.  Beyond a certain concentration (a critical concentration) of ion pair agent, no further resolution improvements are observed.  TEA is observed not to show any improvement in resolution at beyond 1 mM.  TBAP showed the best resolution of all agents, b
ut TMAH and THAB also showed resolution enhancements.
\par The theoretical explanation for these affects is attributable to an interaction between DNA and ion-pair agent which could either be electrostatic, meaning DNA phosphate to ion-pair charge group, i.e., a
mmonium or hydrophobic, i.e., between bases and alkyl chains of ion-pair.  Either way, the complex has a greater mass and a reduced effective electric field.  TEA and TMAH have similar alkyl chains and would interact hydrophobically in a similar manner wi
t
h DNA; but differences in migration come more significantly because of charge differences at pH 8.8 (one is titratable and fractionally charged, the other is a quatenary ammonium compound).  The observed effect which ion-pairs have on linear polymers can 
in part be explained by hydrophobic interactions which affect dynamic viscosity or dynamic \'93porosity.\'94
\par The effect of EthBr addition was seen to reduce peak widths and decrease migration times for fragments.  EthBr had little effect on EOF.  Increasing [EthB
r] to 0.15 mM had the effect of broadening peak width and doing little to affect migration time.  Larger DNA fragments do not resolve in EthBr.  Specific fragments, for example, 271 bp and 281 bp at > 0.06 mM EthBr, were resolved in particular systems.  T
B
AP alone increases resolution of larger and smaller fragments with moderate peak widths, but migration times were increased.  The combination of EthBr and TBAP broadens all peaks and prolongs migration time, largely because of decreased EOF.  Electrophero
g
rams generally indicated that combinations of linear polymer and ion-pair (such as TBAP) were effective in resolving fragments.  It is noted that lower ion-pair concentrations can be used with longer capillaries, and that higher ion-pair concentrations sh
o
uld be used with shorter caps.  The ion pair is expected to interact hydrophobically with the bases, while EthBr intercalates with GC base pairs and alters the length of the chain (a fully saturated chain is expected to increase its length about 50% as Et
hBr fills one site for every other base pair).    This would explain the reason for reduced migration times with EthBr.
\par While a Z-type flow cell (3 mm) can improve detection (as little as 8 ng DNA or 8 fmol being 71 nM), a problem occurs for resolving fragm
ents differing by only a number of base pairs (for example, 179 and 222 bp can not be resolved as they are in the path together).

The use of gradients in liquid and gas chromatography is used to change the equilibrium distribution of solutes and to alter selectiv
ity.  Only recently has gradient work been used in CE, particular in manipulating organic solvent compositions in micellar electrokinetic chromatography.  The change in pH has been dynamically programmed.  There is also a transient ionic matrix method in 
w
hich analytes encounter an ionic pulse migrating in the opposite direction and have their migration velocities altered.  Temperature programs in CZE also alter selectivity inasmuch as they affect pH and viscosity.  There is a strong need to solve the elut
i
on problem of oppositely charged species, and two approaches have been reported which take advantage of a strong and constant EOF.  One approach is the coupling of capillaries with different intrinsic EOF, and this enabled a rapid and efficient analysis o
f proteins.  In the other approach, EOF was altered by applying an external potential across the separation capillary.  Constant, elevated EOF can reduce the resolution particularly of substances detected early.

DNA migration in free solution electrophoresis is based on molecular size since charge/mass is constant.  Agarose
 gel electrophoresis is the usual way, but CZE provides speedier analysis, only minute amounts, and automation with on-line data acquisition.  Early work with single-stranded DNA using 7.5%T 3.3%C polyacrylamide in 7 M urea was successful.  dsDNA separati
o
ns were reported using 3%T 5%C.  Interest has shifted to using non-crosslinked polyacrylamide gels, or polymer networks.  This because bubble-free crosslinked gels are difficult to make and their lifetime is short (sometimes only a few runs!).  Also gel m
atrices accumulate sample precipitates, accounting for rapid clogging.  Bode in 1977 that the sieving mechanism in liquid linear polyacrylamide is similar to the kind in crosslinked gels;  the model shows that macromolecules migrate through \'93
dynamic pores\'94 
form by a fluctuating polymer network.  De Gennes put forth the concept that once a polymer solution reaches a critical concentration in solution, called the overlap or entanglement threshold, it exerts a sieving action on a particle.  Other polymers that
 can be used to sieve DNA in particular include hydroxyethylcellulose (~0.4% as its entanglement threshold).  The group working with HEC showed that the average pore radius (}{\i\insrsid10057886 R}{\sub\insrsid10057886 p}{\insrsid10057886 
) falls from 21 nm in 0.5% HEC to 8.5 nm in 2% HEC, obeying the law:  <R}{\sub\insrsid10057886 p}{\insrsid10057886 > = 6.0 }{\i\insrsid10057886 C}{\super\insrsid10057886 \endash 0.63}{\insrsid10057886 , where }{\i\insrsid10057886 C}{\insrsid10057886

problem with reagent contribution to a high background signal reducing sensitivity, even with ultrasensitive detection methods such as laser-induced fluorescence.

requires attention to more parameters.  Recent work with KD mode separations using PAR chelates showed only control of pH was a factor in optimizing the system:  the 1-hydroxy group of PAR chelates all had different acid dissociations constants, which wer

 exploited for their different mobilities.  This is an important clue regarding ligand design, in which one functional group expresses the characteristics of the central metal in changes to the acid dissociation constant of the species.  It is impossible

\par Various ion association agents were tested as to size and chemistry (type) in a 0.02 M phosphate pH 7.0 buffer.  Using TMA, no separation of the M(III) 
chelates was possible, using 5 and 25 mM concentrations.  At 25 mM, the broadening of the M(III) group peak is seen and interpretated as adsorptive processes with the capillary wall.  Using TEA at 5 mM, separation is noticed but not to the baseline; at 25
 
mM each M(III) chelate is resolved but fall on the tailing shoulder of the DHABS chromophore and the peaks are broadened.  TPA at 5 and 25 mM shows sharper peaks but is still on a broad DHABS tailing shoulder, and there is some peak overlap between V(V) a
n
d Co(III) and between DHABS and Al(III).  With 25 mM TBA everything is well resolved and DHABS now follows the elution of metals, as it was showing a shift with the smaller modifiers already.  TAA is larger than TBA, and at 5 mM shows similarly good elect
ropherograms with TBA.  At >15 mM TAA however, separation of M(III) chelates becomes poor.  TPP is the bulkiest and shows a }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'70}{\insrsid10057886 
-electron conjugation system; at 5 mM, it behaves like 25 mM TBA except V(V) elutes earlier and is shifted in order of elution.  5-10 mM TPP is considered optimal for this system; at 25 mM EOF is very slow (\'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 eo}{

), and so migration times are longer (DHABS is the last peak at 65 min!).  Also peak broadening is observed and this translates to sensitivity losses.  Two tables constructed showing the relationship between \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{
\insrsid10057886  of chelates and DHABS in the counter ion systems at two different counter ion concentrations reveals that larger counter ions slow mobility by half (comparing TMA or no counter ion with TPP, for 
example).  5 mM TMA is a special case, in which mobility was seen to decrease significantly and then increase with use of 5 mM TEA (no explanation is given as to why it happens).  The data indicate that attraction between the metal chelate and counter cat
ion is not only electrostatic, but also hydrophobic.  Non-zero and positive \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886 
 values indicate that that ion associates are net anions.  Resolution of chelates is best with the bulkier ion associates used, but size is not a strict factor since TBA (in the 
middle range) gave the best resolution.  TAA and TPP should be used at lower concentrations because of their greater hydrophobic interaction contributes to association.
\par In ion-association chemistries (including ion-association extraction and ion-pair RP-HP
LC), the analyte ion must form an ion associate with suitable counter anion in the polar phase and be desolvated before partitioning or adsorbing to a non-polar secondary (stationary) phase.  In applications of MEKC HPCE and electrochromatography, the ion
 
association agent modifies (enhances) phase transfer abilities of the analyte in the pseudo-micellar or bonded hydrophobic phase, resp.  Unusual in this study is the absence of a secondary phase:  separation is achieved in a homogeneous system.  Hence, th
is form of HPCE may be better termed IA-CZE or ion-association CE (IA-CE).  These separations need not involve only inorganic molecules but highly charged organics as well.

ined, usually by precipitation procedures/gravimetric analyses using barium salts.  IC is replacing gravimetry because of its speed and automatability.  CZE (a form of CE) is a separation technique in which inorganic and organic ions are separated based o
n mobilities in an electric field.  Narrow bore caps (10-100 \'b5
m) are operated at high potentials (10-30 kV).  Photometric detection is indirect.  Hjerten (J. Chromatogr. 9: 122, 1967) first reported use of CE to determine ions but CZE has been more recently
 used to separate many classes of ions reported by many others.  Note that indirect detection in this instance involves using an absorbing anion (pyromellitate) to produce a background signal; anions in the sample will displace the background ion in formi
ng their zones, thereby producing a negative peak.  An EOF modifier is added to the reversed polarity system to cause the anions to move in the direction of EOF; the modifier in this case is hexamethonium hydroxide.

Direct UV detection of negatively charged metal chelates of low mobility offers advantages to CZE of metal complexes using i
ndirect UV detection.  Complexes migrate towards the anode against electro-osmotic flow (EOF), which is reduced by dynamic coating of the capillary.  Sufficiently large EOF can result in overall net movement in the direction of EOF toward the cathode.  In
clusion of micellar surfactants can alter selectivity (MEKC).  This paper looks at decelerated movement of complexes against EOF, movement with EOF, and movement with EOF with micellar partitioning effects.

ium iodide (TEAI), and tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) are from Merck, all chemicals analytical grade.
\par EOF has been reduced in previous work using quaternary ammonium salts, namely the detergent-like tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide.  Complexes migrate
 from cathode to anode according to ionic mobilities with little influence from oppositely directed EOF mobility (now diminished by the salt).  Resolution is good among the metals tested (Ni, Co, Zn, Cd, Fe, Cu, detected in that order).  Migration times a
re longer however, and consistent migration times depend on the capillary pre-treatment with EOF modifier.  Separation is also influenced by ion-pairing with the quaternary ammonium groups, accounting for the decelerated movement.
\par With reversed movement (an
d polarity), and proper selection of pH to adjust EOF, anionic analytes move against their ionic mobility and are detected in shorter times (less than half the time than in the modified system).  Cadmium and manganese are less stable complexes and migrate
 
relatively faster than would be expected.  Certain other complexes (Cu) converesely show smaller migration velocities.  Changes in migration velocity may be due to absence of ion-pairing effects.  Increased efficiency is seen (translating into resolution 
i
mprovements).  Theoretical plate calculations are presented for these conditions and those comparing EOF modification (decelerated movement) and micellar partitioning involving reversed movment.  Theoretical plate numbers are highest for all metals in the
 
reversed movement (without detergent) system.  With higher efficiency comes sensitivity (detectability) too.  Another table is presented looking at the minimum detectable concentration and the effective calibration range (dynamic range).  With reversed mo
v
ment compared to forward, decelerated movment, sensitivity is much higher (in the submicromolar range).  Two more advantages of reversed vs. EOF-modified movement is (1) presence of HQS strongly affects EOF by extending the migration time range (increased
 resolution) and (2) with no capillary pretreatment required, inconsistencies in migration time are no longer influenced by this variable.
\par The conditions inducing reversed-movement CZE were studied under MEKC conditions.  Selectivity between anionic complex
es with similar mobilities can be enhanced with partitioning between micellar and aqueous pseudostationary phases.  An electropherogram of 6 metal chelates with and without 50 mM SDS shows no real difference in efficiency although there is a big differenc
e
 in migration times (the longer times in the SDS-containing sample being due to its effect on altering EOF).  A plot of effective mobility (calculated as the difference between apparent mobility and electroosmotic mobility) vs. [SDS] shows that this param
eter does not change significantly (despite the reduction observed with the detergent) for any of the metal ion chelates (SDS at 50, 100, and 150 mM tried).  There is an increase observed in the capacity factor, k}{\insrsid10057886 {\field{\*\fldinst SYMB

\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 0}{\insrsid10057886 ], for each metal chelate with increasing SDS concentration; the extended elution ranges come at the expense of increased analysis times.
\par Ion-pairing effects between tetraalkylammonium salts and complexes were then studied (75 \'b5m x 50 cm, effective 42
 cm capillary; 10 mM borate with 0.1 mM HQS, 50 mM SDS, and the iodide of the quaternary ammonium at 10 mM) with SDS micelles present.  Capacity factors are presented for four metal chelates.  When sodium ion is replaced by ammonium and tetramethylammoniu
m
, mobilities decrease because of a stronger ion association:  this shields the charge in the micelle in the electric field, reducing its mobility.  There is no improvement in selectivity nonetheless.  More hydrophobic quaternary ammonium salts (tetraethyl
-
 and tetrabutylammonium) change mobilities but in the opposite way, with retention reduced.  It is likely that longer alkyl chains stabilize the positive charge (by delocalization) on the nitrogen and make it less able to form ion pairs with the anionic g
r
oups in the metal complexes.  Another effect may be that the more hydrophobic salts may partition into the SDS micelle and hinder transfer of metal complex into micelle.  From these data it is clear that separation of complexes in a micellar medium is con
trolled more by the aqueous phase.  Partitioning is likely controlled by a repulsion between anionic metal complex and the negatively charged micelle.

A problem with alkali and alkaline earth metals is their identical mobilities (e.g., Na and Mg).  Weston et a
l (1992) showed use of a-hydroxyisobutyric acid or citric acid in the carrier by altering analyte ion effective charge with differences in complexation equilibria.  Beck and Engelhardt used imidazole rather than aromatic amine as a carrier electrolyte to

Addition of organic modifiers has been shown to alter the migration order of anions.  The effect of ethylene glycol (HOEtOH) at 10 and 20% was investigated on cations, plotting \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886 
 vs. %HOEtOH (carrier=CuSO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 ; 20 kV).  The cations
 tested include the monovalents Na, K, and Li, and the divalents Cs, Rb, Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Ni, Mn, and Zn.  In all cases, increasing HOEtOH reduces mobility in a very linear fashion, although slopes differ.  With no HOEtOH to 20% HOEtOH, the decrease in 
\'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886  
is uniformly in the range of 15-25% for all ions.  Some change in order is seen, notably the migration times of divalents relative to Na or Li.  The results were similar with the carrier being imidazole.  The effect of the organic modifier might be to alt
e
r the hydration sphere surrounding anions.  If HOEtOH was increased to 60% (with 5 mM imidazole, pH 4.5) even certain previously irresolvable transition metals could be separated.  High concentrations of organic modifier cause significant decreases in EOF

 with 0, 10, and 20% HOEtOH, resp.), so higher running voltages will be necessary to keep times right.
\par The \'b5}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 ep}{\insrsid10057886 
 value was plotted against increasing ion-pair reagent concentration, in this case, 5 and 10 mM SDS.  7 divalent cations are plotted.  Peak tailing with as small as 0.5 mM SDS in an imidazole buffer is very pronounced and is useless.  Sharp peaks with no 
tailing are possible using 10 mM SDS in a CuSO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 
 electrolyte.  In particular elution order is drastically altered:  Ba and Sr without SDS migrate ahead of all other cations, but when SDS is added at all, Ba and Sr become the slowest of these cations;  indeed
 their mobility is slower than that of the neutral marker.  Such a fact suggests an equilibrium  between these cations and SDS which is adsorbed on the capillary inner surface.  The EOF is seen to increase considerably with SDS added, being 9.6 x 10}{
\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -5}{\insrsid10057886  with no SDS (units as above) but jumping to 26.5 x 10}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -5}{\insrsid10057886  with either 5 or 10 mM SDS.  Na in SDS also produced peaks interfering with alkali ion determination.

\par Na in serum samples is as high as 140 mM and can affect separation efficiency in CZE.  The sample focusing (\'93sample stacking\'94
) phenomenon is not possible if analyte ion concentration is on the order of carrier electrolyte.  Electrical conductances of biological samples are considerably higher than those of carrier electrolyte even when diluted 10- or 20-fo
ld.  It is possible however to analyze all ions if the analyte ion in excess has a greater mobility than trace analytes and these are faster than the carrier ionic species.  Cu(II) has a mobility slightly lower than those of alkali and alkaline earth meta
l
s and meets this criterion.  Peak tailing--occurring when analyte ions are much too fast for electrolyte co-ion--is not a problem since there is not a significant mismatch between mobilities.  For our serum samples, K is not likely to focus since it is fa
s
ter than Na.  Serum was diluted 1:20 and a 20 s injection time made.  Concentration overload with Na ion is a danger; dynamic range is limited by carrier electrolyte since changes in signal are possible only as long as there are enough UV-absorbind ions i
n the carrier.  A 1 mol Na to 0.5 mol Cu does not in fact result in total displacement; the transfer ratio is even lower because the faster analyte ions have lower transfer ratios than electrolyte ions.  In 3 mM CuSO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{
\insrsid10057886 , response to Na presence is linear up to 250 ppm (5000 ppm prior to dilution), and this should cover the range of both normal and pathological serum samples.
\par Internal standardization became necessary because of changing injection volumes.  Li is used since it migrates closely to peaks of intere
st and is negligible in biological samples.  Migration times are seen to increase from run to run, probably owing to adsorption of proteins to capillary inner surface, and reducing }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'7a}{\insrsid10057886 
 potential (and hence EOF).  Use of 0.1 M NaOH between runs eliminates this effect.  Interference from proteins is not observed in the analysis.
\par The RSD for cations were 7% for K, 1% for Na, 5% for Ca, and 7% for Mg, which is not particularly good but was sufficient to meet needs.  As for the quantitated peaks, the values were c
ompared to a value certified by atomic emission spectrometry.  Values were close enough to give value to CE as a means of distinguishing pathological conditions from normals.  It must be considered that some ions are measured in their totality:  Ca exists
 protein bound in some measure, but total ion is released in the running system.
\par Serum anion analysis was similarly evaluated.  The presence of Cl, SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , PO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , CO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 
, and acetate is within the range of CE work.  Electrolytes previously used for anions include chromate, phthalate, and benzoate.  Cu(II) EDTA}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 2\endash }{\insrsid10057886 
 can similarly be employed, being able to select between monobasic carboxylic acids and dibasic acids.  5 mM chromate/0.5 mM OFM Anion-BT provided the best system for serum anion determination (serum is dilut
ed 1:20).  Migration times are not seen to change from run to run as with cations;  this is likely due to the presence of a modifier which itself adsorbs to the capillary surface.  An internal standard (10 ppm malonic acid) is included (it migrates betwee
n sulfate and phosphate).  References were not available to check against mean values.

INTRO.  Hb variant analysis is particularly useful in that, over the lifetime of the RBC, the protein is subjected to chemical conditions in the body which modify its structure.  As blood glucose concentrations vary, the extent to which nonenzymatic
 glycosylation of proteins, including and especially hemoglobin, will vary;  in particulart the analysis of the chemical forms of Hb can be used as an indicator of diseases in which regulation of blood glucose levels (viz., diabetes) is a symptom.  Hb A i

, is present in relatively high levels in diabetes because of the high blood glucose levels in people suffering from the disease.  Methods analyzing variants include star
ch gel electrophoresis, cellulose acetate electrophoresis at alkaline pH, citrate agar gels at acid pH, polyacrylamide IEF, HPLC, immunochemical methods, and structure analysis.  CE has been used for analyzing proteins in serum, urine, saliva, cell lysate
s
 and single cells.  Some groups have determined Hb and globin chains and their tryptic digests using CZE.  IEF has been used to study variants; coated capillaries and mobilization using salts or EOF were used to make detection possible.  Recently CIEF usi

 is 16.86 mM, and pH adjusted with 20% acetic acid to 7.0.  Detection is at 415 nm.  For pathological Hbs, a gradient of 20-80% is used.  Hb samples are obtained from venipunctures into EDTA-containing tubes, cells pel
leted at 2300 g for 10 min, cells washed three times with saline, then lysed with 1 mM KCN (50 \'b5L RBC to 700 \'b5
L of 1 mM KCN).  Hemolysate is centrifuged 10000 g for 3 min and its supernatant stored.  Hemolysates with 0.4 to 2.2 mM Hb are ready as is for HP
LC and gel IEF, and CIEF samples are made by diluting with 1 mM KCN and mixing carrier ampholyte (Hb final concentration is 2-11 \'b5M).  Commerical standards of Hb variants are diluted to final 1:1000 in the ampholyte mix.
\par Carrier ampholyte concentration was
 important.  Broad or narrow range ampholytes do not resolve well at all, but a mixture is just right.  Best results are when the narrow range is greater than the broad range.  Total ampholyte concentrations of < 3.75% w/v show elongated run times and poo
r
 resolution.  A 4.5% concentration proved superior.  Substituting the very broad range 3.5 to 10 ampholyte with narrower ranges (5-7, 5-8) did not help at all.  Initial sample zone volume (length) was also important.  Injections of 30 and 90 s were tried 
and the 90 s proved better.  Use of voltages > 20 kV resulted in severe baseline noise (spikes).
\par Analyses are complete in < 20 min under these conditions.  Hb A has pI 7.10 and is >90% of total Hb species.  Hb A}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 1c}{\insrsid10057886  has pI 7.00 and is about 4-6% in normal individuals.  Hb A}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{
\insrsid10057886 
 has pI 7.40 and is <3.5%, and Hb F has pI 7.15 and is present < 1% in the adult (often not detected).  Blood from 30 day old baby is also analyzed and shows significant Hb F as a fraction of the total still present.  Resolution is to 0.05 
pI units, as judged by separation of the Hb samples.  Hb concentration should be in the low \'b5M range for best results.  It is possible to use, e.g., 20-fold higher concentrations to analyze minor peaks as well.
\par Results of the work show a superior separatio
n using gel IEF largely because of a flatter pH gradient.  The CIEF, gel IEF, and HPLC work are all in agreement however when blood of a diabetic is analyzed.  Diabetics typically have a 2- to 3-fold elevation of Hb A}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 1c}{
\insrsid10057886 .  This species elutes close to Hb A in CIEF, being better separated using HPLC.  Older HPLC columns are sometimes unable to resolve Hb F, whereas CIEF did a decent job of identifying Hb F presence.
\par Long term storage at 4\'b0 is also demonstrated.  Samples stored for over a month are analyzed by
 CIEF at intervals with no change in the pattern.  Hb mixed with ampholytes undergoes a sort of aging if left at room temperature.  It is likely that Hb is being oxidized to methemoglobin and accounts for other peaks being observed.
\par Capillaries appear to undergo a conditioning effect.  The first couple of runs are marked with poor resolution and short detection times.  This improves with more running.  RSD is 5% for migration times and 1.6-7.2% for peak areas (}{\i\insrsid10057886 n}
{\insrsid10057886  = 10).  Generally larger peaks give a lower RSD than the minor peaks.
\par Presence of other substances, such as a marker dye (aminomethylated nitrophenol with pI 6.2, l}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 max}{\insrsid10057886 
 = 415 nm, MW 389) also affected migration time of Hb peaks.  As dye concentration is increased, migration time is uniformally reduced
.  This reduced detection time also affects resolution.  EOF pumping is increased with dye addition.  These changes in EOF are perhaps factors of the marker dye being outside the range of the narrow range ampholytes in which linearity between 6.7 and 7.7 
should be significant.

INTRO.  Precolumn complexation of metals has advantages for CE in comparison to other methods:  (1) complexation before separation eliminates interference produced by sample matrices (serum, pharm. preparatio
ns, ores, electroplating solutions); (2) complexing conditions can be varied to give metal selectivity; (3) metal ions with kinetically slow complexing ability can now be distinguished or removed from interferences produced by running electrolytes.  We ar
e
 using MEKC as a possibility to increase the number of metal cations which are detectable.  This expands analysis as chromophoric metal chelators now need not be charged to enable detection (see the works of Saitoh et al., who separated metal acetylaceton
a
to complexes using SDS).  Negatively charged metal chelates have been analyzed, but only for a limited number of metals and long migration times.  We recently reported use of 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonate in an SDS-containing electrolyte, but the effect 
was minor as the metal chelate probably has little solubility for the micelle.  In this work, we have examined other chromophoric chelators, 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) (Merck, Germany) and Arsenazo III \{
2,7-bis(2-arsonophenylazo)-1,8-dihydroxynaphthalenedisulfonic acid\} (Aldrich Chemie) as chelators in MEKC.

 are unaffected by increasing SDS concentration.  Both of the 1-hydroxy groups of PAR would be expected to be ionized at the pH us
ed, resulting in strong repulsion of the negatively charged chelate with the negatively charged surfactant to suppress partitioning.  Any increase in migration time is really a result of decreased EOF (73.6 x 10}{\fs16\up4\insrsid10057886 -5}{

\par The effect of phosphate in the electrolyte buffer on resolution was examined (all buffers 10 mM, with 50 mM SDS and 0.1 mM PAR; caps are 75 \'b5m i.d. x 35/42 cm, 15 kV, 254 nm).  In borate, the Cu-, Ni-, Fe-, and Zn-PAR chelates could not be resolved
 (Co-PAR was).  With phosphate alone (Na}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 HPO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 /NaH}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 PO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886

, now the Fe- and Zn-PAR are partially resolved, but not to baseline.  Mobilities are observed to decrease as sodium is replaced with ammonium and are given in a table.
\par These data can be explained by ion-pairing reactions occurring between chelate and cationic component of the electrolyte.  Ammonium is stronger in ion-pair interaction than is sodium, decreasing the effective negative charge of the complex in ion as
sociation, facilitating interaction with the micelle with its negative surface charge.  Still the order of elution is dictated more by electrophoresis than by micellar-based chromatography.  Use of phosphate buffers at lower pH increased migration times c
onsiderably (presumably because of lowered EOF, a component of overall observed mobility) without affecting selectivity.
\par Having redefined the buffer electrolyte, the effect of changing SDS concentration was examined once again.  As migration times increased
 in the ammonium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), increasing SDS causes a decrease in migration time.  This is attributable to cooperative effects of changes in phase ratio and electroosmotic mobility (due to viscosity and ionic strength changes).  Moreover res
o
lution was enhanced.  SDS up to 150 mM was examined, but 75 mM SDS in the buffer used was found to be optimal (analysis times reduced to about 10 min).  Some metals do not form stable complexes (e.g., Mn, alkaline earths) and are therefore not detected.  
S
ome metal complexes migrate very close to one another (V-PAR and Cu-PAR) and others produce broad asymmetric peaks.  Triethanolamine (TEA) must be added to assist in Cr(III) complexation (it forms an auxiliary ligand).  Varying the reagent-to-metal ratio 
can cause a decrease in the PAR peak (uncomplexed PAR) until it disappears.  Differentiating between iron oxidation states is also possible.
\par Further optimization of this PAR chelate system was directed toward enhancing detectability.  With detection limits 
considered to be S/N=3, two CE systems (Waters Quanta 4000 and ABi 270A) were compared.  Detection in the visible range is expected to be more sensitive.  Injections were altered to deliver 8 nl volumes rather than the same duration times since the ABi 27
0A delivers 5 times more with the same time.  Detection limits are in the submicromolar range at the 500 nm wavelength on the ABi but in the micromolar range when UV (254 nm) is used on the Q4000.  Co(II)-PAR was the most sensitive complex.
\par A table is prese
nted of the effective mobilites and capacity factors of metals in borate (pH 9.0) buffer alone, with 0.1 mM Arsenazo III present, and with Arsenazo III present along with 50 mM and 100 mM SDS.  Comparing to the PAR chelates in the first table, Arsenazo II
I
-complexes have greater retentions in normal and micellar CE conditions.  Several ionizable groups in the complex not participating in complexing but influencing electrophoretic mobility are responsible.  This ligand can bind metal 1:1 and 1:2 ligand:meta
l
, and this ought to contributed to a higher mobility.  All Arsenazo complexes migrate to the cathode (detection side), indicating the great magnitude of EOF.  And whereas high acidity eliminates complexing ability for many chelators, optimum complexation 
with Arsenazo III is indeed achieved by adding nitric acid 1:1 to metal prior to reagent addition.
\par Using ammonium phosphate as buffer instead, changes in effective complex mobility were assessed as a function of [SDS] detergent.  With increasing [SDS], rete
ntion of chelates increased (lowered mobility), but this effect was caused by changes in EOF.  Mobilities in the complex are essentially insensitive to pH due to strong acidity of arsenic and sulfonic acid groups.  As with HQS complexes, dependence of cha
r
ge on pH cannot be exploited to obtain better micellar CE separations.  Electrostatic repulsion seems likely between the highly charged complex and the micelle.  Moreover, the complex has size dimensions which are significant with the micelle, and solubil
i
zation of large aggregates is not favored.  Unlike with the PAR complexes, migration was completely due to the solute (complex) itself without interaction with the micelle.  Inclusion of micelle actually made analyses longer and there was no increase in s
e
lectivity.  Two electropherograms are presented with 8 metals separated in ammonium phosphate and A-III with and without 50 mM SDS, the separation without SDS being superior.  A non-micellar CE system using phosphate at pH 7.0 is considered optimal for th
i
s system.  Rare earths comigrate with lanthanum, and Zr complex has a mobility close to that of Fe complex.  Tantalum and niobium form mixed-ligand complexes with tartaric acid present.  Ni, Cr, and Mo complexes form very badly asymmetric peaks.  Zn, Mn, 
V, Bi, and alkaline earth metal complexes are not observed to migrate.
\par Some real sample separation are shown.  Zr ceramics containing niobium and tantalum as alloying additives are analyzed.

Sample concentration/mass influences electrophoretic migration a great deal.  We want to report on how sample injection length influences migration time
 under stacking and non-stacking conditions.  Stacking occurs when analyte is contained in a zone of low specific conductivity relative to carrier electrolyte, i.e., resistivity of analyte zone (}{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'72}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 1}{

\insrsid10057886 ), so the field strength is greater in the analyte zone/sample plug.  Analyte ions migrate rapidly to a steady state boundary formed between the analyte zone and the edge of carrier electro
lyte (depending on ion charge, cations or anions move to leading or trailing edge of analyte zone).  If analyte ions progress into the carrier electrolyte zone, they experience a lower field strength and their migration is immediately slowed.  Hence the a
nalyte zone becomes narrow or is concentrated, what is seen as stacking.  In cases where conductivity of the sample plug is equal to or greater than carrier electrolyte, no stacking effect is expected.

 a function of injection time (}{\i\insrsid10057886 t}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 i}{\insrsid10057886 ) for non-stacking runs of Br, SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 , and NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886

er widening analyte zone.  Regression analysis shows the curves were (absolute values) 0.996, .995, and .98, for the three respective ions.

 plot was constructed for the three anions.  However this time migration time is
 seen to increase steadily (though not linearly) with injection time.  To understand this nonlinear change, it is useful to picture what is happening in the run.  Once sample is injected, the analyte zone length will change unlike under nonstacking condit
i
ons, shrinking to a small zone.  The sample concentration will increase and is essentially a functon of time.  As zone length alters, so will many parameters:  resistance, voltage and field strength, and all are a function of time.  While the concentratio
n of carrier electrolyte is a constant during stacking, changes in field strength, voltage and resistance are likely.  If }{\i\insrsid10057886 l}{\insrsid10057886 (}{\i\insrsid10057886 t}{\insrsid10057886 ) = length of sample zone at time }{

 (15% of migration time).  Large injection volumes lower separation performance, but in practice some compounds would have to be present at very low concentrations to be in compliance with certain standards (e.g., t
he EC drinking-water directive specifying pesticides at < 0.1 ppb).  Hence special injection methods are likely necessary to accomodate such demands.  It is to be kept in mind that variations in injection affect migration time, and so means of identifying
 components not based on consistent times must be considered.

\par Ions do not absorb UV directly but can be detected if they displace a UV-absorbing co-ion set as a background electrolyte.  The UV maximum of the co-ion should be outside any absorbance of the metal ion.  Pyromellitic acid absorbs between 250-260 nm, whic
h
 is outside any potential interference of ions.  Both peak symmetry and analyte sensitivity will be affected by co-ion mobility.  Where the co-ion has a mobility significantly higher or lower than analyte ion will cause either tailing or fronting, resp.  
PMA is well-matched to Cl, NO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 3}{\insrsid10057886 , and SO}{\fs16\dn4\insrsid10057886 4}{\insrsid10057886 
.  Other co-ions from a family of them can be selected for other analytes;  phthalate is useful for intermediate mobilities anions (organic acids), while p-hydroxybenzoate is useful for low mobility anions.
\par EOF should 
be in the direction of analyte movement, cathode to anode.  Addition of aliphatic quatenary amines to the electrolyte serves the purpose of dynamically coating the capillary, reversing the direction of EOF.  EOF is normally dependent on pH in absence of m
odifier.  Anion selectivity can now be adjusted by altering pH without altering EOF in modified systems.
\par The system uses 2.25 mM pyromellitic acid, 6.5 mM NaOH, 0.75 mM hexamethonium hydroxide, and 1.6 mM triethanolamine in a pH range from 7.5 to 7.9.  The 
hexamethonium compound is supplied as the bromide and should be converted to the hydroxide using a strong anion exchange resin (AG 1-X8, BioRad).  All reagents can be obtained from Sigma.  A 50 cm x 50 \'b5
m uncoated capillary can be used.  Solutions are 0.45 \'b5m filtered.
\par The analyte range on the 50 \'b5m capillary is likely to be 0.1 to 10 ppm.  Samples with > 10 ppm should be diluted to promote proper stacking which is prevented by sample overload;  dilution should be in water rather than running electrolyte.  
For trace component detection in the presence of another excess analyte, the optimal result will be obtained if electrolyte mobility matches the analyte of interest and if it is possible to increase the ionic strength of running electrolyte.  Injection is
 5 psi sec (pos. pressure), running 20 kV (const. V) with current limit set at 50 \'b5A.  Detection is 250 nm, total run time of 8 min, 0.01 AUFS.  A rise time of 1 sec is set.  All conditions are 20\'b0.  Purging is for 4 min with background electrolyte.

\par Backgro
und electrolyte should be made fresh each day and filtered (the filter should be pre-rinsed with de-ionized water to leach potential contaminants).  The BioRad Pressure diagnostics system can be used to condition new capillaries:  (1) Purge 5 min with dei
onized water (2) then 10 min with 0.1 NaOH (3) then 5 min with deionized water (4) then 4 min with background electrolyte.
\par Running electrolyte should be replaced every 5 runs.  If the same capillary is used on consecutive days, at the end of the day, purge 
capillary (1) 2 min with de-I water, (2) 5 min with 0.1 NaOH, (3) 2 min with de-I water, and then (4) 4 min with running electrolyte.  Vials can be left in the up position to prevent drying.

ating prevents analyte adsorption).  All reagents can be obtained from Sigma.  HIBA is prepared as a 40 mM stock.  1 N acetic acid is similarly prepared.  A 30 mM creatinine-acetate + 4 mM HIBA buffer is prepared as electrolyte with pH 4.8.  A 25 \'b5

Laminar flow and fluid velocity in a tube depends on tubular cross section, with velocity a parabolic function such that the maximum is at the tube center (tube axis) approaching zero at the wall.  The dispersion called Taylor\rquote 
s dispersion results from a combination of molecular diffusion and the effect of nonuniformity in fluid velocity.  The following relationship governed by Fick\rquote s law applies to mass flux along the tube axis:

\par A table is presented for analysis of D for various molecules.  Presented are the conditions of the experiment as well:  capillary diameters, solvent system (either water for uncoated caps or Tris-borate for coated caps).  The literature values are conside
r
ed to be accurate within 0.1%.  The error (difference) for KOH is rather low, whereas that for citric acid is very high.  This points out a limitation of this method:  it does not work well for substances in which diffusion coefficient depends on the conc
e
ntration.  Citric acid as three dissociation constants, and since diffusion coefficients vary with degree of dissociation, so it depends on concentration as well.  Another effect observed is the increased error (difference) when only capillary diameter is
 changed:  smaller capillary diameters exhibit greater wall effects on solute movement in bulk fluid flow.  The error (difference) for Phe in 75 and 100 \'b5m is not siginficant, but increases 10-fold with a 50 \'b5
m capillary.  It is also dramatic for Trp, where a 75 \'b5m cap gives a 4-fold greater error difference than a 100 \'b5m cap.
\par Determination of diffusion coefficient is important in understanding macromolecular mass and shape.  Stokes (JACS 72: 763, 1950) had proposed use of a diffusion cell to obtain relative
 data.  Others were using the analytical ultracentrifuge with Schlieren optics for measuring sedimentation coefficients.  More recent methods use the dynamic light scattering approach (Berne & Pecora, }{\i\insrsid10057886 Dynamic Light Scattering}{
\insrsid10057886 , Wiley: New York, 1976).  Stil
l this requires expensive and dedicated equipment.  A CE system is now affordable to many labs and more versatile than for just D measurements.  It is suggested that slow flows be used in capillary-determined measurements to keep errors low.

RESULTS.  A Crystal CE System Model 310 (ATI Unicam, UK) with UV detection at 200 nm was performed.  The system is equipped with 75 \'b5m x 55 cm (45 cm to window).  Coated capillaries are used in some experiments:  coating is with polyacrylamide 
done after vinylation with vinylmagnesium bromide (see Cobb, Dolnik, Novotny, Anal Chem 62: 2478, 1990).  Serum is analyzed immediately after centrifugation and collection; where storage is done, it is at \endash 26\'b0.
\par Counter ions used in these experiments were restricted to Na}{\up6\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886 , Tris, and methylglucamine.  Buffers are generally used at the pK}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886 
 values by mixing with NaOH in equimolar amounts.  A figure is shown with protein mobility against changes in pH with the differing buffers (running voltage = 11 kV, serum diluted 1:4, loading by pressure at  10 mbar for 3 s).  Naturally as pH goes up, th
e mobility of all proteins are increased.  Significant is the separation/resolution however.  With the counter ion always Na}{\up6\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886 
, the  buffers tested included Tricine (pH 8.12), asparagine (pH 8.91), boric acid (pH 9.24), glycine (pH 9.86), GABA (pH 10.58), and }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'65}{\insrsid10057886 
-aminocaproic acid (EACA) (pH 10.93) (Note mixture is 50 mM NaOH + 100 mM co-ion).  With the lower pH systems, the a}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 1}{\insrsid10057886 
-globulin and albumin fractions are not resolved at all, but do resolve near pH 10.  However,  resolution between }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 - and }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'62}{\insrsid10057886 -globulin dim
inishes with the higher pH systems.
\par When the counter ion Na}{\up6\insrsid10057886 +}{\insrsid10057886 
 is replaced with Tris [Tris-Tricine (pH 8.06),  Tris-Asn (pH 8.41), Tris-Borate (pH 8.17), Tris-Glycine (pH 8.84), Tris-GABA (pH 9.27), and Tris-EACA (pH 9.36), with 0.1 M Tris + 0.1 M co-ion], o
verall mobility of all fractions is reduced somewhat at all pH values.  But the pH of the systems here is also relatively lower than for the Na-counter ion systems.  The plot of mobility vs. pK}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 a}{\insrsid10057886 
 of the co-ion is more suitable to understanding the behavior.  Only the Tris-EACA system could resolve the }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'61}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 1}{\insrsid10057886 -globulin/albumin pair in this case; the resolution of }{\f3\insrsid10057886

\par With methylglucamine as the counter ion however, the best separations were achieved.  Six electropherograms are shown for each MGA system.  The 0.1 M MGA-Tricine (pH 9.10) shows a very slow }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'67}{\insrsid10057886 
-globulin (indeed, it runs with zero mobility); pH differences between Na-Tricine, with anodically migrating }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'67}{\insrsid10057886 -globulin, and MGA-Tricine systems may explain the difference.  Also ion-pairing between }{
\f3\insrsid10057886 \'67}{\insrsid10057886 -globulins and MGA may likewise explain the lower mobility.  Comparison of the electropherograms between MGA-Asn (pH 9.47) and MGA-Tricine show the MGA-Asn }{\f3\insrsid10057886 \'67}{\insrsid10057886 
-globulins to be somewhat more cationic (the Asn is significantly absorbin
g and reduces S/N quite a bit).  MGA-boric acid (pH 9.20) achieved little or no separation largely because of the predictable interaction between vicinal diols on MGA and borate to form a complex.  With MGA-glycine (pH 9.92), all zones observed in agarose
/veronal are similarly observed here.  The same was so for MGA-GABA (pH 10.26) and MGA-EACA (pH 10.62).

Bile salts and double-chain surfactants show significantly different molecular structures compared to SDS (a traditional detergent used in MEKC).   In MEKC, the capacity factor (k') is
 the ratio of analyte molecules within a micelle to those in the aqueous phase, and these are related to the volume of the aqueous and micellar phases:

RESULTS.  Na chromate from Aldrich and tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) from Sigma were used.  Urine was co
llected over 24 h from apparently healthy individuals and from those with kidney stones.  10 g boric acid is added as preservative.  10 mL/L urine phosphoric acid is added to acidify the urine (near to pH 2-2.5);  samples not assayed immediately are froze
n at \endash 20\'b0.  Samples are heated to 55\'b0
 C for 30 min prior to analysis to dissolve calcium oxalate (dilution prior to frozen storage can obviate the need).  100-fold dilution with deionized water is done prior to analysis (dilution will vary according to desi
red range).  A Waters Quanta 4000 with negative power supply and Hg lamp set for 254 nm filtering is used.  A 75 \'b5m \'d7 60 cm capillary is used, the run set at constant current of 25 \'b5
A.  Data acquisition is with Waters Millenium software.  Buffer system is 
10 mM sodium chromate with 0.5 mM TTAB (pH 8.1 without adjustment).  Degassing and sonication were used to prepare buffer.  Sample loading is by gravity with capillary at 10 cm for 100 s.  Voltage varied from 15-18 kV during the constant current run.  Pur
ging between runs involved 1 min with 0.1 M KOH, 1 min with 0.1 M HCL, 2 min with buffer.   The Sigma kit 591 procedure was used to measure urinary oxalate by use of a oxalate oxidase and detection of H}{\dn6\insrsid10057886 2}{\insrsid10057886 O}{

C]oxalate is used to check recoveries.  Citrate is estimated by a Boehringer-Mannheim kit.
\par Technique of Wildman et al. uses 5 mM chromate and 0.5 mM EOF modifier, but oxalate and nitrate do not resolve well with this system (current=12.5 \'b5
A).  As nitrate is normally present 3-fold greater than oxalate in normal urine, this is a problem.  Selectivity can be altered by buffer system electrolyte or EOF modifier concentration or by changes in pH.  Increasing chromate
 by 2 resolved nitrate and oxalate and made the peaks sharper.

A method for the rapid and sensitive determination of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in cultivation media by an affinity assay using capillary electrophoresis is presented.  For that purpose we evaluated protein A conjugated with a fluorescent
 dye such as fluorescein diisocyanate or dichlorotriazinyl-aminofluorescein as an affinity ligand.  The ligand formed a fluorescing complex with immunoglobulin G in the sample and rapid separation from excess protein A was performed by capillary zone elec
t
rophoresis.  However, only partial resolution of the zones was achieved when protein A as a whole molecule was utilized.  In contrast, baseline resolution of the zones was obtained when recombinant fragments of protein A were used as affinity ligands.  Im
m
unoglobulin concentrations in the range of two orders of magnitude were determined.  Due to the specificity of protein A for immunoglobulin G, analysis can be carried out even in the presence of high concentrations of other components and in cultivation m
edia.  Thus, the capillary electrophoretic affinity assay was successfully applied to monitor monoclonal antibodies in a cultivation process.

The effect of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,3-butanediamine (TMBD) in the running electrolyte on the electroosmotic flow and the migration 
behavior of four standard basic proteins in bare fused-silica capillaries was examined at pH 4.0, 5.5, and 6.5.  Depending on the electrolyte pH and additive concentration the electroosmotic flow was either cathodic or anodic.  A similar Langmuirian-type 
d
ependence of the electroosmotic flow on the concentration of TMBD in the running electrolyte was found at the three experimented pH values, which may be indicative of the specific adsorption of the additive in the immobilized region of the electric double
 
layer at the interface between the capillary wall and the electrolyte solution.  Electrophoretic separations of the four standard basic proteins performed at the three above pH values, showed well-resolved, efficient and symmetric peaks, demonstrating the
 
utility of this additive for protein electrophoresis in bare fused-silica capillaries.  The variations in separation efficiency, peak capacity, resolution and reproducibility of migration times as a function of the additive concentration at pH 6.5 were al
so examined.

Polyethylene oxide-mediated capillary sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis is a recently established, high-resolution separation method for fast purity 
check and molecular mass assessment of protein molecules.  The effects of the sieving polymer chain length and concentration on the separation mechanism of sodium dodecyl sulfate-protein complexes were examined.  The studies aimed to clarify whether the s
e
paration can be described by either the Ogston sieving theory, or the reptation or reptation-with-stretching theory.  Polyethylene oxides with molecular masses of 100,000, 300,000 and 900,000 Da were used as separation matrices at various concentrations r
a
nging from 1-4%, 0.5-2% and 0.25-1%, respectively.  The separation phenomena was examined using a standard protein test mixture containing six proteins in the molecular mass range of 14,200-97,400 Da.  A possible separation mechanism of reptation with str
etching is suggested, where separation performance was improved with increasing sieving polymer chain lengths and/or concentration.

The effects of different buffer concentrations and compositions on the elution order and separation of H1 histone subtypes and their phosphorylated modifications isolated from several species was studied using hig
h-performance capillary electrophoresis (CE).  Various cations and anions were tested in an untreated silica capillary and low pH buffers, in the presence of the dynamic coating agent hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.  It was found that the cations and anion

 of buffers have a remarkable influence on both the efficiency and the selectivity of protein separations.  A triethylammonium methanephosphonate system proved efficacious for the separation of rat histone subtype H1c from H1e and a perchlorate/triethylam

Capillaries with 150 microns inner diameter were packed with a perfused protein G chromatographic support and used as immunoaffinity preconce
ntrators for capillary zone electrophoresis.  Antibody was loaded onto the protein G support to form an immunoaffinity stationary phase.  Injection of samples onto the column caused selective retention and preconcentration of antigen.  Injection of approp

iate buffers onto the column caused desorption of the antibody and antigen which were then separated by capillary zone electrophoresis.  The combination was used on-line and off-line.  For on-line combination, a flow-gated interface coupled the two column
s
 and allowed injection of desorbed zones onto the electrophoresis system.  Off-line coupling required collection of desorbed fractions and then injection onto the electrophoresis system.  Flow rates as high as 100 microL/min were used to load sample onto 
t

0-fold preconcentration.  The use of the preconcentrator with serum samples spiked with insulin was demonstrated.

The effect of pH and ionic strength of running buffer on peptide behavior in capillary electrophoresis (CE) is studied.  A system for predictions of peptide migration in CE (SPPMCE) deve
loped in our laboratory has been tested in a wide range of pH and buffer concentrations.  The SPPMCE consists of a computer program for calculating peptide pKa values, an equation which relates peptide structures to their electrophoretic mobilities and a 
c
oupled computer program for the prediction of electropherograms.  More than 25 different buffers have been employed, covering a pH range of 2-11 and a concentration range of 5-100 mM.  Results from experiments are compared with the theoretical predictions
.  Good agreement is observed, which confirms the utility of the SPPMCE and allows fast and easy optimization of peptide separations in CE, with nothing more than the amino acid sequence of the linear peptide as the input.

Several factors related to sample matrix which can influence peak height in micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography were studied.  The ionic strength of the sample did not affect greatly the peak height.  High concentration of surfa
ctants or organic solvents in the sample decreased the peak height.  On the other hand, using a surfactant in the sample different from the one in the electrophoresis buffer or the addition of polyethylene glycol to the sample enhanced slightly the peak h
e
ight.  A high surfactant concentration in the buffer increased the migration time as well as the plate number and the peak height.  Matrix effects are more profound with large than with small sample injections.  In general, the effect of sample matrix in 
MECC is much less than that observed in capillary zone electrophoresis.  It is recommended to prepare the standards in the same matrix as that of the sample or to add the analytes directly to the sample to avoid any bias in the results.

\par   Because the local electrical resistance is inversely proportional to the local cross-section of a capillary, the intensity of the electric field varies along the migration 
path if the inner diameter of the capillary is not constant.  Therefore, fluctuations of the lateral dimensions of a capillary can directly affect the net elution time as well as the peak width, and, hence the final resolution.  In this article, we develo
p
 the theoretical framework for the study of such effects.  We then examine the simple case where both the mobility and the diffusion coefficient are field-independent; in particular, we demonstrate that resolution can be severely reduced if the inner wall
s
 are not flat, and that optimal resolution is always obtained for perfectly flat walls.  Generalized to ultrathin gels, our results clearly indicate that both random and systematic variations of the gel thickness can greatly affect the performance of the 
separation process.  Acceptable degrees of flatness are estimated for both geometries.  This study thus provides a quantitative understanding of the type of quality control one requires to obtain optimal results with capillaries and ultrathin gels.

 The conjugation of three amine reactive fluorescent probes, each containing the fluorophore fluorescein but different reactive moieties, was compared using the protein myoglobin and the amino acid L-lysine as reagents.  The three different reactive moiet
i
es were an isothiocyanate group (FITC), a succinimidyl ester group (CFSE), and a dichlorotriazine group (DTAF).  The relative performance was based on the degree of conjugation to myoglobin, the rate of reaction, freedom from hydrolysis, and the stability
 
of a conjugate with lysine.  Performance was evaluated by separating the conjugation reaction reagents and products on-line, using capillary zone electrophoresis, and assessing relative amounts by absorbance detection.  Each of the reactive probes demonst
r
ated the ability to achieve a similar degree of conjugation, which depended mostly on allowed conjugated reaction time, and a rate of conjugation that rendered hydrolysis of the reactive moiety insignificant.  For the relative rate of conjugation between 
p
robes and stability of the resulting conjugate, CFSE demonstrated superior performance, followed by DTAF and then FITC, for both the protein myoglobin and the amino acid L-lysine.  The FITC conjugation reaction was much easier to control, however, which m
ay be significant for applications that require a precise degree of conjugation.  With regard to conjugate-bond stability, the FITC conjugate demonstrated inferior performance when subjected to incubation at 37 degrees C.

nsequence, drifting ionic mobilities due to the formation of hydroxyl ions at the cathode, 1 mM of 5,5-diethylbarbiturate was added to the background electrolyte.  Moreover, fused silica capillaries were coated with a 0.0003% solution of hexadimethrine br

\par   It is common practice in capillary electrophoresis to perform some sort of capillary washing step(s) between separations.  In many analyses little consideration is give
n to optimization of the wash, and typically a rather standard washing procedure is used involving a few minutes wash with 0.1 M NaOH followed by a few minutes reconditioning with the run buffer.  As an alternative to this procedure, we have investigated 
t
he use of wash solutions containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).  This type of wash has been used in the analyses of both small molecules and proteins, with encouraging results.  After the SDS wash, the electroosmotic flow has been shown to be restored t
o
 values close to normal in a capillary which had previously been coated with plasma proteins.  Separation efficiency for a test compound (dextromethorphan) is improved if an SDS rather than a HCl-NaOH wash is used after injection of plasma.  In a direct-i
njection analysis of plasma proteins using a pH 10 borate buffer, an SDS-based washing procedure (total time, 1 min) gave better migration-time reproducibility than an NaOH-based wash, which took 5 min in total.
