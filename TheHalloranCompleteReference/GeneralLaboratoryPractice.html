			Note that this document was originally composed for scientists in proteomics
			although its principles apply to anyone in a laboratory doing chemistry,
			biochemistry, and advanced chemistry (of all kinds). There may be references
			to the word <q>proteomics</q>, but the word can be dropped and the meaning should
			generally apply. A revision may come later.
			<hr>
			This document actually should be called <q>General Laboratory Experiences</q>
			because a great deal of what is written here is an opinion about how to do
			things in the laboratory. Different people have different ideas of what works
			for them. Take this into consideration when reading the content below.<p></p>
			<p>
				A great deal of the advice and comment presented here might be considered to
				fall under the category of <q>common sense,</q> but given the often high-pitched
				disagreement about so-called common sense, perhaps judgment should be reserved
				about what is considered intuitively obvious.</p>

			<h1 id="firstprinciples">First Principles</h1>
			<p>
				[This section was inspired by, if not entirely plagiarized from
				Chapter 2 <q>Common Apparatus and
					Basic Techniques</q> in <i>Vogel’s Textbook of Quantitative
					Chemical Analysis</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> Ed., GH Jeffery, J Basset,
				J Mendham, RC Denney, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">eds.</span>,
				(Longman Scientific &amp; Technical:
				Essex, UK), 1988, pp. 71-123. Recommended reading for the scientist.]
			</p>
			<p>
				The proteomic scientist should adhere to a basic set of principles which
				probably fit partially into the category of common sense, since these are
				principles that work outside the laboratory as much as inside.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Cleanliness and Bench Cover.</b>
				The bench must be clean. A bench cloth (plastic-backed absorbent
				paper is common) should be used to remove spills of solid and liquid chemicals
				(solutions) immediately.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Glassware</b> should be scrupulously clean. If left standing (in cabinets
				or other storage) for any length of time, it should be rinsed with distilled
				or de-ionized water and allowed to drip-dry or air-dry before use. A cloth
				can be used to dry the outside (or parts not contacting chemicals) with
				a lint-free glass cloth, but this should never contact the inside.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Labeling</b>. While the memory of scientists is often remarkable,
				all containers that will contain any chemical substance or solution, whether
				for a day (in an assay) or for months or years (as stored product), should be
				labeled, and preferably <em>before</em> the chemical or solution is added.
				A good time to label containers is during the preparative stage of the experiment
				in assembling equipment, apparatus, and when preparing reagents. It is
				good to have a permanent, write-on-glass, does-not-wash-off-with-water
				in the laboratory coat breast pocket. The <b>Sharpie</b> is a reliable brand
				of this type of marker. One pen with a fine and one with a large tip are
				useful. Gummed labels are useful for containers which will be dedicated
				to storage of a particular reagent.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Workspace</b>. The bench area ideally should be as wide (1.5-2 m) as
				the scientist's arms extended right and left, and a 1 m in depth...the workspace.
				The workspace where the experiment or assay will be done
				should be free of everything except equipment and supplies necessary to do the
				job. Items not immediately used should be placed behind those being used
				now.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Use and Store</b>. When a stock reagent bottle is used to prepare
				a solution or dilution, it should be used/sampled, and then immediately
				returned to the location where it is typically found or expected to be found.
				This prevents a type of clutter that usually occurs during work and which
				can create confusion.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Replicate Determinations</b>. Statistical significance of results is
				a goal of the scientist, and so when doing assays, the scientist must
				account for the trustworthiness of results. Use of duplicate or replicate
				(two or more) determinations of samples is one way to persuade your colleague
				that the results you get are reproducible.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Record of Observations/Thoughts/Results</b>. It is still a wise idea to
				record all calculations (or at least the results of those made in the head)
				in a bound, standard laboratory notebook, using pen whose ink does not run
				when any aqueous solution is spilled on it. New experiments or assays should
				be given a descriptive title, and the date (and possibly time) recorded
				as well. For results recorded electronically, it is advisable to get a
				printout of data if it is available and fix (tape) it to the notebook.
			</p>

			<h1 id="quantitative">Quantitative Practice: Making Calculations</h1>
			<p>The greatest struggle of inexperienced—and even some
				experienced—scientists is calculating reagent concentrations, volumes,
				and masses.</p>
			<p>
				This section will provide guidelines for calculating everything related
				to solutions and reagents, as well as tips for making solutions and reagents.</p>

			<h2>Setting Up A Calculation: The Numerator-Denominator Principle</h2>
			<p>A calculation is really an <b>equation</b>, and an equation must have an equal
				sign in standard mathematics.</p>
			<p>
				On one side of the equal sign is the <b>answer</b>, the <b>result
					of the calculation</b> (usually on the right side of the equation for
				people who think left-to-right).</p>
			<p>
				On the other side of the equation are the <b>factors</b>: all the numeric
				values that will be used to make the calculation. By defintion, factors
				are multiplied to one another, and that is the case for pretty much 99.9%
				of all calculations in this setup. In rare cases, you will use algebra
				where you set up numbers that are added or subtracted from one another,
				but they become quantities (values enclosed in parentheses) either in the
				numerator or denominator of a factor.</p>
			<p>
				All the factors will be represented in a numerator or denominator fashion.
				That is, if a factor is used in a division operation, then it will appear
				as its inverted value (that is, if value <i>x</i> is used to divide the
				factors in the calculation, it will be represented as 1 / <i>x</i> and
				multipied to all factors).</p>
			<p>
				The equation will then have the form that looks much like this:</p>

			<table class="eqnserif" style="margin:0 -1em;width:105%;">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td class="numer" style="width:2em;"><i>w</i>
							<span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim1</span>
						</td>
						<td rowspan="2" style="width:0.5em;">×</td>
						<td class="numer" style="width:2em;"><i>x</i>

							<span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim4</span>
						</td>
						<td rowspan="2" style="padding-left:0.5em;width:4em;"> = <i>a</i>
							<span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim1</span> [1]
						</td></tr>
					<tr>
						<td><span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim2</span></td>
						<td><span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim3</span></td>
						<td><i>y</i> <span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim4</span></td>
						<td>1</td></tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>
				The <span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim<i>n</i></span>
				actually refers to the name of a dimension or unit, such <b>mg</b>
				(milligram) or <b>µl</b> (microliter). The values <i>w</i>,
				<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> are numbers expressed in any form
				(real or floating point or decimal; integers; scientific notation);
				they are the factors in this product. The product itself is
				the value <i>a</i>. Note that the value of <i>y</i> is in the denominator,
				that is the factor is 1/<i>y</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				But what is important here is not the values <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, etc.
				It is the dimensions <span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim<i>n</i></span>.
				The values were merely arranged in this style in order to arrange the
				dimension to produce the desired final dimension with its value.
				Note how <span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim2</span>,
				<span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim3</span>, and
				<span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim4</span> all
				cross out, leaving <span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:bold;">dim1</span>
				in the final answer. One can remove the dimensions and then just be
				left with multiplying all numbers in the numerator, then multiplying all
				in the denominator, and finally dividing the product in the numerator
				by the product in the denominator to get the final answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				In constructing the equation (calculation):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is essential to know what one really wants as the answer, which is
					a value and possibly a dimension. For instance, if a volume is asked for,
					then the dimension must be in units that represent a volume (µl,
					ml, L). If the target answer is a mass, then it should be in some form
					of grams (mg, g) or possibly moles. For concentrations, this is really
					solution density, or mass units per volume units.</li>
				<li>Write down all the factors available, even if they will not be used in
					the final calculation.</li>
				<li>The missing factors in a calculation are typically <b>conversion
						units</b>. That is, the conversion of one expression of the volume into
					another. Thus there are 1000 µliters (µl) in 1 milliliter
					(ml), and 1000 milliliters in 1 liter (L). Know your conversion units
					by reflex. Note that these are not <b>constants</b>: a constant is
					value reflecting a fundamental physical or chemical property in nature or
					the universe. Planck’s constant is 6.62 × 10<sup>−34</sup>
					J s, and not a conversion of one value into another form.</li>
				<li><b>Constants</b>. A typical constant in solution density determinations
					is the molecular or atomic weight of a substance, which is the amount of
					grams in one mole of the substance. This is typical missing factor whenever
					one factor is expressed in grams and the answer sought in some form of moles.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Lots of Examples</h2>
			<p>These are some real-life examples of where you will encounter these calculations
				in proteomics.</p>

			<div class="question">
				1. Make up just enough, but not really more than necessary, of a DTT
				and iodoacetamide reagent for adding to a complex protein mixture prior
				to digestion with trypsin. The following facts are available:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
					<li>The protein mixture in the 500 µl tube is in a 25 µl volume.</li>
					<li>You will need to make the mixture slightly alkaline, which promotes
						the reaction of DTT, iodoacetamide, and trypsin; we use ammonium bicarbonate
						(NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>) at a final 50 mM for this purpose. The
						NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> has the added benefit of being volatile under
						a vacuum, which means it can be removed by a centfriugal evaporator.</li>
					<li>DTT will be added to a final volume of 10 mM to the alkalinized protein
						solution, and then left for 20-30 minutes; the reaction is promoted at
						a warmer temperature (say 30-37°).</li>
					<li>Iodoacetamide is added to 50-55 mM (calculate for 50 mM). It is added
						at 5 × the amount of DTT because some of it will react with DTT.</li>
					<li>Finally trypsin will be added. It comes lyophilized in a 20 µg
						amount. The manufacturer provides a resuspension buffer, which is
						50 mM acetic acid, and recommends that 200 µl be added to resuspend
						the material. Our trypsin treatment will be at 10 ng/µl, based
						on the literature.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="answer">
				The first thing to add to the protein mixture will be the NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>,
				and must be at a final 50 mM. There are two ways to calculate.
				<ul>
					<li><b>Quick and dirty</b>. Generally, if a stock reagent is prepared
						that is <b>10 to 20 times</b>
						greater than the final concentration, it is as simple as dividing
						the volume of the solution to which it will be added by the fold-difference
						in the concentration between the reagent concentration and the final
						concentration. Suppose the DTT reagent stock is 500 mM (0.5 M). With a
						25 µl protein solution, the amount of reagent to add is thus:

						<table class="eqnserif">
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td rowspan="2">25 µl ×</td>
									<td class="numer">50 mM</td>
									<td rowspan="2"> = 2.5 µl [2]</td></tr>
								<tr>
									<td>500 mM</td></tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<p>
							Some things to note about the equation above.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Equation [2] is a classic demonstration of the <i>conservation of
									mass</i>. How? The concentration of a solute in a solution multiplied
								to the volume of the solution gives the mass of the solute in the solution.
								Thus <i>concentration</i>&nbsp;×&nbsp;<i>volume</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>mass</i>. And using
								algebra, <i>mass</i>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<i>volume</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>concentration</i> (because
								mass divided by volume is also an expression of <i>density</i>, this
								equation is also called <b>solution density</b>).</li>
							<li>Note that equation [2] uses the format of doing calculations in formula
								[1] above,
								arranging the dimensions so that they always divide out and yielding a
								dimension that we want in the end (a volume).</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							So you add 2.5 µl of the 500 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>
							to the 25 µl of the protein
							solution to get 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub> as a final concentration.</p>
						<p>
							Actually, that's not entirely true. Because 2.5 µl of the reagent
							is added, it contributes to the final volume as well, and so the final
							volume must be taken into account. To get the true final concentration,
							one must divide the actual mass of DTT added by the final volume:</p>
						<table class="eqnserif" style="text-align:center;">
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td class="numer">2.5 µl × 500 mM</td>
									<td rowspan="2"> = 45.4 mM [3]</td></tr>
								<tr>
									<td>(25 + 2.5) µl</td></tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<p>
							Is this acceptable? Many scientists can live with the difference between
							45+ mM and 50 mM, about a 10% difference from the desired. Suppose
							a 1000 mM (1 M) NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> reagent stock was prepared
							and used in instead; this is a 20× concentration.</p>

						<table class="eqnserif" style="text-align:center;">
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td rowspan="2">25 µl ×</td>
									<td class="numer">50 mM</td>
									<td rowspan="2"> = 1.25 µl [4]</td></tr>
								<tr>
									<td>1000 mM</td></tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<table class="eqnserif">
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td class="numer">1.25 µl × 1000 mM</td>
									<td rowspan="2"> = 47.6 mM [5]</td></tr>
								<tr>
									<td>(25 + 1.25) µl</td></tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<p>
							Of course the difference will be less with use of higher stock concentrations
							as expected. The problem is in using stock reagent volumes too small to
							pipet accurately. I like to use no less than 2 µl although it is
							possible to pipet 0.5 µl (500 nl) accurately with some sophisticated
							measuring devices. Be mindful of how small a volume you can pipet
							confidently.</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>The Truly Accurate</b>. In order to get that exact 50 mM ammonium
						bicarbonate concentration, one must use algebra to compensate for the
						added volume. All these equations are conservation of mass equations,
						and this one is no different. An unknown value <i>x</i> represents
						the volume of the reagent to be added, and the equation must reflect the
						fact that a final 50 mM concentration is desired.
						<p style="text-align:center;" class="eqnserif">
							(25 µl × 0 mM) + (<i>x</i> µl × 500 mM)
							= (25 + <i>x</i>) µl × 50 mM [6]</p>
						<p>
							Note that one has mixed operations here. Addition and subtraction of
							numbers can only occur when the dimensions are the same, and dimensions
							are serialized with multiplication and can be deleted with division.</p>
						<p>
							The equation is distributed:</p>
						<p style="text-align:center" class="eqnserif">
							(25 × 0) µl mM + (500<i>x</i>) µl mM
							= (25 × 50) µl mM + 50<i>x</i> µl mM [7]</p>
						<p>
							All the units are the same now, so all operations can be done with the
							numbers. So looking at just the numbers, we re-arrange the equation
							to get <i>x</i> on one side:</p>
						<div style="text-align:center;" class="eqnserif">
							500<i>x</i> − 50<i>x</i> = 25 × 50 [8]
							<p>
								<i>x</i>(500 − 50) = 1250 [9]
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>x</i> = 1250 / (500 − 50) = 2.78 [10]
							</p>
						</div>
						Note that the 25 × 0 drops out of equation [7]. In equation [9]
						we distribute out the concentration as a quantity out of the unknown
						volume <i>x</i>. Both sides of the equation are divided by the quantity
						(equation [10]), and the result is the volume of 2.78 µl.
						<p>
							We verify this calculation using the equation [3] (also [5]) form:</p>
						<table class="eqnserif" style="text-align:center;">
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td class="numer">2.78 µl × 500 mM</td>
									<td rowspan="2"> = 50.0 mM [11]</td></tr>
								<tr>
									<td>(25 + 2.78) µl</td></tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
					</li>
				</ul>
				Thus if you have a very accurate pipet and the time to do the algebra,
				you can get the very accurate concentration.
				<p>
					The next step is to add the DTT. From here on, it will be assumed that
					the Quick &amp; Dirty method was used to calculate volumes to add, and
					that the stock reagents are all made up as 10×.</p>
				<p>
					Assuming that 2.5 µl of NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> was added,
					then the volume is 27.5 µl. If we add about 3 µl of
					10× DTT (100 mM), then one will have very close to 10 mM. And, yes,
					the ammonium bicarbonate will be diluted out again, and be less than the
					45 mM already calculated, but that's okay. An alternative might be to
					prepare DTT in ammonium bicarbonate, but that is probably not a good idea
					since it tends to chemically activate (make reactive) the DTT.</p>
				<p>
					One thing left out is the preparation of those NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>
					and DTT stock reagents. In proteomics, it is generally best to prepare
					many reagents fresh from the solid/powder. Ammonium bicarbonate is volatile,
					and so any stock is probably best frozen or again, just made fresh.
					DTT stock can be frozen, but after a year (and some think 6 months), it is
					probably better to make up new reagent.</p>
				<p>
					In our real life example, we had several tubes and added up all the volumes
					for the NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> we would need, and came up with
					200 µl. At 500 mM, we want to calculate how many milligrams to
					weigh out:</p>

				<table class="eqnserif" style="text-align:center;">

				<p>
					Equation [12] is how anyone would first set up such a calculation,
					and follows a numerator-denominator approach so that it is easy to cancel
					out dimensions, and be left with the final dimension. Note that the
					final dimension is <b>mg</b>, and so we know that a <i>mg</i> value
					must occur in the numerator at some point. We also see that µl
					stands alone in a numerator value and will have to be canceled by
					another µl in the denominator. Likewise for the <b>mmol</b> and
					the <b>L</b> value. Following the principles above, we know that the
					missing factors in the equation are dimension conversion values and
					also a constant, which is the molecular/formula weight of
					NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. The rest of the factors (symbolized by
					the <q>. . .</q> in the equation) are then added
					in order to do these cancellations of dimensions and end up with the
					right value:</p>

				<table class="eqnserif" style="text-align:center;">

				</table>
				<p>
					We have added two factors. A conversion factor for the volume, and the
					molecular weight for ammonium bicarbonate. Notice that the dimensions
					cancel each other out in a numerator-denominator like fashion, and we
					are left with mg.</p>
				<p>
					Someone might be confused by looking at the molecular weight, and say,
					<q>isn’t the molecular weight actually 79.06 grams per mole
						(79.06 g/mol)?</q> Well, yes it is. And it is also 79.06 mg/mmol,
					and 79.06 µg/µmol, 79.06 ng/nmol, and so on. Notice that
					these conversions are made instantly in the numerator and denominator,
					in each case dividing by 1000 in the numerator and denominator to get the
					dimensions shown. These sorts of conversions can be made in one's head.
				</p>
				<p>
					But supposed that this conversion stumps the neophyte. In that case,
					one adds the factor as follows:</p>

				<table class="eqnserif" style="text-align:center;">

				<p>
					It is necessary to add the <q>. . .</q> because clearly there
					are missing factors. These are now added:</p>

				<table class="eqnserif" style="background-color:inherit;font:normal 75% inherit;text-align:center;margin:0 -3em;width:120%;">

				<p>
					Now all the dimensions cancel out to give the right value, and all
					we have by adding the conversion factors is divide by 1000 in the numerator
					and denominator (the 1000 values will cancel themselves out).
					The final value in mg is easily calculated:

					So to make 200 µl of 500 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, 7.9 mg
					needs to be weighed out.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the chemical was actually weighed out, more than 7.9 mg was weighed.
					Actually 10.4 mg was weighed out into the 500 µl conical tube in which
					it was to be prepared. Rather than spend too much needless time trying
					to weigh out exactly 7.9 mg, it was decided to use the 10.4 mg. Why?
					First we had 1 kg of the material (that is 1 million mg!) and the cost
					of this is just tens of dollars (maybe just 10 dollars). The time spent
					trying to weigh out exactly 7.9 mg could buy another kilogram of
					NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. So instead we re-calculate the amount
					of water to add to dissolve the salt to the correct concentration, because
					it is much easier to pipet microliters of water than milligrams of salt:

				<p>
					Notice that in going <q>back in the other direction</q> in
					calculating microliters from the milligrams, we invert the factors that
					were involved in calculating milligrams from microliters. We wanted
					200 µl and calculated 7.9 mg, but had 10.4 mg and calculated it
					should be in a total of 263 µl. Note that we since we calculated
					7.9 mg needs 200 µl for 500 mM, then 10.4 mg would need
					200 × 10.4 / 7.9 = 263, an obvious way of calculating proportions.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the addition of NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, DTT is added.
					DTT is rather expensive, so a 10× stock is made up in a small volume
					and whatever is ununsed is frozen away at −20°. Since 10×
					is 100 mM, we want to make 3-5 ml in a 15 ml conical tube. The molecular
					weight of DTT is 154.3. So we calculate the range from a minimum of 3
					to a maximum of 5 ml:

					The first three factors are the essential data we need (the 3rd factor
					is actually a constant, the molecular weight), while the last (4th) factor
					provides a dimension conversion. Again, when all the dimensions cancel
					out, then you can do the math on the numbers alone.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the balance, 51.7 mg of DTT powder was added to a tared 15 ml conical
					tube. So again, it is now necessary to calculate the water to add to
					dissolve the DTT:

				<p>
					So with a P-1000 pipet set at 1,000 µl, I pipet water three times, then
					set it to 350 µl and pipet it once. When ready, I add 27.5 / 10
					= ~2.8 µl of the DTT stock to the alkalinized protein solution.
				</p>
				<p>
					After 20-30 minutes, I figure that I have to add (27.5 + 2.8) / 10 =
					~30 µl / 10 = 3 µl of a 10× iodoacetamide solution.
					Since the final concentration of iodoacetamide in 50-55 mM, the concentration
					should be 500-550 mM.
				</p>
				<p>
					If it is calculated that one needs 150 µl of 500 mM iodoacetamide,
					then add enough (usually 15%) for pipetting error, which means one needs
					about 170 µl. The molecular weight of iodoacetamide is 184.96.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;">

					So we try to weigh out as close to that number as possible, since

			<h1 id="weighing">Weighing Out Chemicals</h1>

			<h2>Balances</h2>
			<p>
				[Parts of this section on balances may come from <b>Vogel's</b>].
			</p>
			<p>
				Most balances the scientist work with are <em>preparative</em>,
				that is, the scientist uses them to weigh out chemicals for the
				preparation of reagents and solutions and mixtures.
				<em>Analytical</em> balances are used to make <b>gravimetric</b>
				determinations in analytical chemistry laboratories, that is, they
				are used to determine the mass of a sample (typically solid) that is
				the result or product of a reaction or analysis.
			</p>
			<p>
				In most cases, one should have preparative electronic balances in the
				proteomics laboratory, although occasionally a beam (knife-edge)
				pan balance is seen and still useful. With electronic balances,
				make sure that the balance is level: balances feature leveling
				bubbles with balance feet adjustable to level with balance, required
				for accurate weighing. Balances should be located in a room with
				no air currents or drafts, or at least away from ventilation ducts
				blowing directly on them or near to them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Absolute care must be taken to weigh chemicals, particularly strong
				mineral acids or bases, that might damage or corrode the balance.
				It is best to pour or spoon out chemicals away or off the balance,
				and then place the container in briefly to determine weight.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cleaning of balances is typical, since chemicals get spilled
				on to the pan easily as well as off the pan. The modern balance
				has easily removable pans and surfaces usually, which allows for
				cleaning the chemicals by washing them off the balance parts into
				the sink (or appropriate waste for very toxic materials).
			</p>
			<p>
				Balances need to be calibrated from time to time. They usually come
				with set of weights should be kept clean in their cloths or
				boxes; they should not be handled with the bare hand (some use
				ivory-tipped special forceps). Weights are usually a nonmagnetic
				alloy (80:20 nickel:chromium) and U.S. official classes are
				<i>M</i> (reference standards, for work of the highest precision),
				<i>S</i> (working reference standards, typically used), <i>S</i>-1
				(precision analytical weights for routine analytical work),
				<i>J</i> (microweight standards).
				Follow the manufacturer's directions for calibrating the
				balance. Some balances, particularly analytical, may need
				a relible professional service with experience doing the calibration.

			</p>
			<h2>Weighing</h2>
			<p>
				There are several problems with those trying to weigh out chemicals.
			</p>
			<p>
				One is that chemicals get contaminated from those trying to weigh
				out chemicals in containers not intended to be weighing containers, such
				as cut-up pieces of copier paper. This paper wastes more chemical
				than it weighs out, and moreover, fibers in the paper get put into
				solutions and reagents.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best weighing containers are those plastic weigh boats that come
				in various sizes from extremely tiny to huge. They are very lightweight
				so as not to contribute to the weight limits of the balance regarding
				tare plus weight. Moreover, if weighing out simple inorganic salts,
				they can be extensively rinsed with water and re-used.
				Glassine paper designed for weighing also certainly acceptable.
			</p>
			<p>
				When proper official weighing containers are not available, try actually
				weighing it out in the container in which the solution will be made and
				stored. Or, the lids of these containers can be used, and solvent
				carefully used to wash the contents from the lid into the container.
				Quite a few scientists routinely use the containers in which the solution
				will be stored to weigh out the chemicals, because it reduces the risk
				that the chemical will be contaminated by substances on weighing
				or intermediate containers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The sample should also be the same temperature as the balance. As a rule,
				wait 30-40 minutes to allow samples to reach temperature, unless the
				sample is unstable or loses its specific or biological activity.

			</p>
			<h2>Being Exact Not Required</h2>
			<p>
				If weighing out a single chemical to prepare a reagent stock solution of
				that chemical, it is absolutely not necessary to be exact in weighing
				out the chemical. Too many people struggle at the balance either to
				spoon out or to spoon back in chemicals in order to get the balance
				to read exactly as they have calculated.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is often not necessary. If the chemical is part of multicomponent
				solution to be prepared, it is often better to prepare a stock solution
				than to weigh out the chemical as part of the process of making a
				multicomponent mixture; the exactness comes from pipetting out the
				correct volume/aliquot of the stock, rather than measuring out a mass
				in grams.

			</p>
			<h2 id="immeasurable">Do Not Try To Measure Masses That Cannot Be Measured</h2>
			<p>
				Ever see someone pull out a tiny Sigma brown reagent bottle and see that
				the substance inside weighed 0.1 mg (100 micrograms!), and they wanted
				25 micrograms of it? The fretful look on their faces could be seen as they
				wondered how they were going to measure out 25 µg.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fact is, when faced with the complexity of weighing out something
				that cannot possibly be weighed out, then believe what is written
				on the bottle and go with it. Thus add the solution in which the reagent
				will be resuspended directly to the vial. For instance, if the vial
				is at most 0.5 ml, and there is 0.1 mg, then add between 100 to 500 µl
				of the solvent in order to make 1 to 0.2 mg/ml of the reagent, respectively


			</p>
			<h2>Weighing Out Multiple Reagents Into A Single Container</h2>
			<p>
				Often it is not possible or prudent to prepare an intermediate stock
				concentration of a chemical, from which a small volume will then be
				used to prepare a multicomponent mixture. Often it is better or
				required to weigh out the chemical directly into a multicomponent mixture.
			</p>
			<p>
				A few scientists prefer to weigh out multiple reagents into a single
				container because this minimizes loss and contamination of the multicomponent
				mixture.
			</p>
			<p>
				This can all be done in a single container if one is careful to follow
				a few rules.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Work from small/low to big/high.</b> This means that it is better
					to weigh the substances with lower amounts first and then the substances
					with larger amounts last. The reason is that the substances in larger
					amounts form piles that bury the substances with smaller amounts.
					From the top of the larger pile, excess reagent can generally be recovered
					and placed back in the reagent bottle without fear of contamination from
					the other substances.
				</li>
				<li><b>Keep the loads/piles separated when possible</b>. When weighing
					out reagents, especially those in small amounts, try to use parts of the
					container than have not come in contact with other chemicals.
				</li>
				<li><b>Weigh Out Unused Areas</b>.
					If using a lid of the container to weigh out, it is often possible to
					wash the previous chemical into the container with a small amount of
					solvent (typically water) to provide a clean area on the lid for the next
					chemical to be weighed out.
				</li>
				<li><b>Keep It Simple</b>. Do not make this complicated. If using glassine paper or weigh boats
					for the separate chemicals makes things less complicated or allays certain
					fears, then use them. To hell with filling the environment up with
					laboratory consumables.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 id="stirbar">Using Stir Bars</h1>

			<h2>Selecting The Right (Correct) Stir Bar</h2>
			<p>
				Given that I have seen too many laboratory workers picking a tiny 3 mm
				stir bar to put in a 1 liter beaker, or individuals selecting an oversized
				stir bar that does not even rest flat (and thus move freely) in the
				container, it is not always clear about how to select the correct stir
				bar.
			</p>
			<p>
				My own sense tells me that the stir bar should be just about half the
				diameter of the container. And so thus a decent range in terms of a
				minimum and maximum for the stir bar size should be one-third to
				two-thirds the diameter of the container. This should give decent mixing
				at almost any speed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, one has to work with what one often has. But if the place of
				work is a laboratory with a magnetic stirrer, there should be a good
				selection of stir bars in a wide range of sizes.

			</p>
			<h2>Retrieving Stir Bars</h2>
			<p>
				I personally do not use or like to use those magnetic stir bar retrievers.
				They often hang or sit in areas where they get dusty, and one never really
				knows where they have been. They are encased in a polyethylene mold that
				often becomes ragged and which makes it difficult to wash them.
				(You are going to wash the retriever, right? Since you don't know where
				it's been, right....?)
			</p>
			<p>
				So how do you get stir bars out?
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, if you must get them out of the container they are in, use another
				larger stir bar against the outside of the container to attract the
				stir bar out of the container. The fields are sufficiently strong to
				allow that. You can also fish out the bar from solution to catch it with
				a third stir bar (or your retriever) that you manipulate in your other
				hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another less cumbersome, perhaps clever way is to pour out the stir
				bar. That is, if the solution just stirred is to be transferred to
				another container (storage bottle, etc.) then just pour the solution
				out into the other container with the lip of the container being poured
				close to the lip of the receving container. If the bar comes out, it
				is caught on the lip or falls outside the bottle, without falling into
				the next bottle.

			</p>
			<h1 id="pipetting">Pipetting</h1>
			<p>
				The Gilson Pipetman for variable volume pipetting is a virtual standard
				in the laboratory. There are certain rules involved in using these
				pipettors, rules usually given by the manufacturer and not read and thus
				understood.

			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Vertical pipetting</b>.
					Gilson says that pipetting should be done as vertically as possible, and that
					the pipettor should be held vertically as possible while there is solution
					in it. It is not necessary to be hyper about being vertical, but a general
					rule is the pipettor should not be held beyond a 45° angle from the
					vertical. Be sensible: holding it horizontal (90° from the vertical)
					is absolutely likely to cause solution to be delivered into the air
					hole on the pipet body. Don't do that.

				</li>
				<li><b>Proper seals and no dripping</b>.
					When the pipet tip is lifted out of the solution, there should be no
					dripping or loss of volume whatsoever from the pipet tip. That is,
					within reason: one could hold the pipet there for 10 minutes hoping to
					see a drop fall out (and it will), but that is beyond the performance
					criteria for a liquid handling device. If dripping is observed
					(call it dripping resulting in a &gt;10% loss of volume within seconds),
					it usually means an improper seal between tip and body. Just firm up
					the seal by hand. If the dripping still continues, try using another
					tip to see if it disappears; if it does, it means the other tip has
					been deformed (or is the one bad apple in the lot). If dripping still
					continues, it could be that the seal between the plunger and body within
					the pipettor is worn and needs replacing, or has not been fit properly
					(particularly if it has just been replaced). Open the tip-holding body
					and check the seal and plunger (make sure they are clean). Use of
					inexpensive tips could also mean low-quality tips, with higher chance
					of finding more deformed tips that leak. Also make sure that the correct
					tip is being used for the correct pipettor.

				</li>
				<li><b>Caustic reagents</b>. It is better to avoid pipetting caustic
					agents with these pipettors (try using glass pipets with bulbs, or
					prefer the use of graduate cylinders of small size when possible).
					The plunger within many models (all?) of the Pipetman is made of
					stainless steel which can nonetheless corrode. Corrosion can cause
					loss of contact with the seal and eventual leaking. Replacement of the
					plunger will probably cost as much as just buying a new Pipetman.
					So after pipetting caustic materials—particularly mineral
					acids—

				</li>
				<li><b>Quick check of calibration</b>. If the pipettor is suspected of
					not dispensing the proper volume (being out of calibration), a quick check
					involves taking room temperature ultrapure water and pipetting it several
					times on an analytical balance (one that measures to 10 mg level accurately).
					Check the volume not just at the 100% capacity, but also 25, 50, and 75%,
					and do each 5-10 times to get an average and CV. The CV should be within
					2% (or whatever the manufacturer states/claims). Thus if checking the
					calibration of P1000, check the pipetting at 250, 500, 750, and 1000
					microliters.

				</li>
				<li><b>Correct tips</b>. The smaller pipettors (P2) require different
					tips from the P20 and above. Pipetting in the 0.5-2 µl range can
					be very inaccurate if not using a tip actually designed to pipet these
					volumes.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2><q>Reverse Pipetting</q></h2>
			<p>
				There are basically two ways to pipetting with the Gilson Pipetman and
				pretty much all pipettors. The usual or standard or <q>normal</q>
				way is perhaps called <q>forward</q> pipetting, if only because the
				other way is called <q>reverse</q> pipetting.
			</p>
			<p>
				In <q>forward</q> pipetting, the following steps are taken:

			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the pipet barrel is brought to the first stop
				</li>
				<li>the tip is immersed in the solution from which liquid will be taken
				</li>
				<li>the barrel is brought back to its full length while taking the accurate
					volume into the tip
				</li>
				<li>the tip is transferred to the container to receive the solution in the tip
				</li>
				<li>the barrel is pressed to the first stop, and then past it to ensure
					expulsion of the volume
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				With reverse pipetting, the steps are as follows;
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the pipet barrel is brought to the first stop and pushed beyond it
				</li>
				<li>the tip is immersed in the solution from which liquid will be taken
				</li>
				<li>the barrel is brought back to its full length (note this does not
					represent the accurate volume)
				</li>
				<li>the tip is transferred to the container to receive the solution in the tip
				</li>
				<li>the barrel is pressed to the first stop and first stop only (!), with
					solution remaining in the tip; the accurate volume should have been dispensed
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Some people say that more accurated repeated pipetting of especially small
				volumes is achieved by using reverse pipetting. The biochemist should know
				both methods, and determine for himself what technique gives him the best
				precision and possibly greater accuracy.
