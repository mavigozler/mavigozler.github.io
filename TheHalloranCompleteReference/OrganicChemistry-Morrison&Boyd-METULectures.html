<h1>Part I: The Fundamentals</h1>

<h2>Chap. 1 Structure and Properties</h2>

<h3>1.1 Organic chemistry</h3>

<p>Organic is misleading term, coming from the days when chemical compounds
studied in organic matter; inorganic came from the study of minerals.  Organic
compounds have one thing in common:  they all have the
element carbon.  Simple organic compounds come from <b>petroleum</b> and <b>coal</b>.

<p>
Organic chemistry is the study of the chemistry of the carbon atom.  So many
technologies depend upon org. chem:  dyes, drugs, paper,
ink, paints and plastics, gasoline and rubber tires.

<h3>1.3 The chemical bond before 1926</h3>

<p>1926 is an important year as it introduces new ideas about chemistry with the
use of quantum mechanics.  In 1916 Walther Kossel (in Germany) described the
<i>ionic bond</i> while G. N. Lewis (at Univ. Calif.) brought
forth the notion of the <i>covalent bond</i>.

<p>In typical salts, bonding is ionic, resulting from a <b>transfer</b>
of valence shell electrons from one element to another, the transfer resulting
in a stabilization (overall) lower energy for the both elements.  Because of
the difference in charges, an electrostatic interaction exists between the
atoms of such a bond.

<p>The covalent bond is rather a <b>sharing</b> of electrons,
indicating that neither atom has the ability to dominate the use of the
electron.  Diatomic molecules are typically good examples of bonds which are
covalent;  HF, H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and CF<sub>4</sub>
are others.  Most bonding done with carbon is of the covalent type.

<h3>1.4 Quantum mechanics</h3>
<p>
Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger introduced wave mechanics in 1926, using functions to 
describe electrons as waves with a series of solutions corresponding to their 
energies.

<h3>1.5 Atomic orbitals</h3>
<p>
Wave equations can make no predictions about position or momentum, in 
fulfillment of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. They only describe the 
probability of finding an electron. The region in space describing that 
probability is called an <b>orbital</b>. Orbital probability distributions are a 
function of the electron&#8217;s energy. Geometric figure illustrations of 
orbitals do indicate the probability but also indicate electron <b>density</b>, 
with the higher probability reflective of the greater density. <i>s</i> orbitals 
tend to be spherical; <i>p</i> orbitals are dumbbell shaped, and with three of 
them they are oriented along the three dimensional axes.</p>

<h3>1.6 Electronic configuration:  Pauli exclusion principle</h3>
<p>
The Pauli exclusion principle was formulated by W. Pauli in 1925: only two
electrons in each AO and both must have opposite spin (because of the magnetic 
repulsion of electrons with like spin). For degenerate AOs, electrons will not 
pair but fill with single electrons since this represents a lower energy level.</p>

<h3>1.7 Molecular orbitals</h3>
<p>
MOs are form probability distributions like AOs, usu. centered about the nuclei 
of the molecule. Here the AOs mix to form <i>bond orbitals.</i> The density of 
electron pairs is most likely greatest between the atomic nuclei of each bond 
pair.</p>

<h3>1.8 The covalent bond</h3>
<p>
To form covalent bonds requires at least two atoms with two AOs each having a 
single electron. The orbital probability distribution must <i>overlap</i>; the 
greater the ability for AOs to overlap, the stronger the resultant MO (in terms 
of energy required to disrupt the bond, called <b>bond dissociation energy</b>
[D]). In the covalent bond, the electron has the entire MO and does not belong 
to one atom or the other. The strength of the covalent bond results from the 
<i>increased electrostatic attraction</i>: in isolated atoms, each electron 
attracts and is attracted by one positively charged nucleus, while in an MO, 
each electron is attracted by two positively charged nuclei.</p>
<p>
The principle of <i>maximum overlap</i> relating to bond strength was stated 
first by Linus Pauling (1931). To illustrate, the H<sub>2</sub> molecule has an 
MO distribution much smaller in size than the 1<i>s</i> orbital sphere of the H 
atom itself, the reason being that electrons within the MO are held closer 
because they are in between nuclei. Its bond length is 0.74 with an energy 
(&#8220;bond strength&#8221;) of 104 kcal/mol. The F atom has a filled 1<i>s</i>,
 2<i>s</i> orbital and two of its three 2<i>p</i> orbitals filled with a single 
electron in the third 2<i>p</i>. It can combine with another F molecule to form 
overlapping AOs (leading to a moderately strong MO). Although the AOs have 
different probability distribution (being <i>p</i> orbitals used, the resultant 
MO in F<sub>2</sub> is similar to H<sub>2</sub> and is also sigma (&sigma;). The 
F<sub>2</sub> molecule has bond length of 1.42 &Aring; and D of 38 kcal/mol.</p>

<h3>1.9 The hybrid orbital <i>sp</i></h3>

<p>
Consider the molecule BeCl<sub>2</sub>. Be has a configuration of
1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup> 2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>, which means that it has no unpaired electrons in
AOs for use in forming bonds. So how can it combine with two Cl atoms? It is
necessary to promote one of the electrons from a 2<i>s</i> orbital to a 2<i>
p</i> orbital; this requires energy. Moreover, it is expected that the bond
energies and lengths of Be to one Cl will be different with the bond energy and
length of another Cl, since one <i>p</i> orbital is used and the <i>s</i>
orbital is used. However, since the analytical data indicates that both Be-Cl
bonds are identical, an assumption that orbital <b>hybridization</b> is
occurring must be made. Mathematical formulas can be deduced which combine <i>
s</i> and <i>p</i> orbitals to provide overlap with the AO of the other atom.
For <i>sp</i> hybridization (mixing of one <i>s</i> and one <i>p</i>), the way
they mix favors a resulting <i>bond angle</i> is <b>180 </b>, which is what is
observed. The MOs are sigma type. Note that the shape of the <i>sp</i> hybrid
orbital results from understanding that while the <i>s</i> orbital is uniformly
spherical and the <i>p</i> orbital is bi-lobed, the lobes of the <i>p</i>
orbital have opposite <i>phase</i>, hence the reduced <i>sp</i> lobe results
from subtraction of the <i>s</i> from one <i>p</i> lobe and the enlarged <i>
sp</i> lobe results from addition.</p>

<h3>1.10 The hybrid <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup></h3>
<p>
BF<sub>3</sub> is a good model here.  Boron atom has ground state configuration
of 1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>1</sup>.  With promotion of an electron
to a different vacant <i>p</i> orbital (1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>1</sup> 
2p<sup>1</sup> 2p<sup>1</sup>), the <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrid can be
similarly formed.  Geometric arrangement is trigonal (120&deg; apart) in one
plane to satisfy the EPR (electron pair repulsion) in bonded pairs.  The
empirical data confirms the theoretical.</p>

<h3>1.11 The hybrid <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup></h3>
<p>
Looking at the simplest organic molecule, CH<sub>4</sub>, provides our next
example.  Looking at the ground state configuration of carbon (1s<sup>2</sup> 
2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>1</sup> 2p<sup>1</sup>), one might predict forming
CH<sub>2</sub> should be possible, but CH<sub>2</sub> is highly reactive. 
Again, electrons are promoted to fill the orbitals with unpaired electrons and a
new type of hybrid is mixed to form directional bonds providing the maximal
overlap.  The <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized C atom will form tetrahedral
geometry with equal bond angles of 109.5&deg;.  Each C-H bond has length of 1.10
&Aring; and &Delta; 104 kcal/mol.</p>

<h3>Nonbonding electron pairs</h3>
<p>
NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O illustrate what happens to molecular geometry 
when nonbonding pairs are part of the molecule. The N atom configuration, 
despite paired electrons in the 2s orbital, still permit <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> 
hybridization. Of the four hybrid orbitals formed, one just has a nonbonding 
electron pair. Experimental evidence indicates the H-N-H bond angle is 107&deg; 
rather than the 109.5&deg; for a tetrahedron, with N-H bond length of 1.01 
&Aring; and D of 103 kcal/mol. The smaller H-N-H bond angle is presumably due to 
the nonbonding pair which have greater repulsive force over other bonding pairs 
since they are not <q>shielded</q> by another atomic nucleus that would exist in 
a bond.</p>
<p>
Two other MO formation possibilities for NH<sub>3</sub> might occur:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridization might be theorized since N is bonded 
to three atoms (as in BF<sub>3</sub>), but data shows that NH<sub>3</sub> has 
no flat geometry
<li>no hybridization is necessary since the three <i>p</i> orbitals
contain the necessary single electron; but if so, bond angles would be 90&deg;
(instead of 107&deg;) and the unshared pair in the 2<i>s</i> would be 
<q>buried</q> or a better description, equally distributed, and the
existence of a dipole moment contradicts that theory
</ol>
<p>
A unique thing about NH<sub>3</sub> is its ability to undergo pyramidal 
<i>inversion</i> (<q>turning inside-out</q>). The energy barrier is 6 kcal/mol and 
is easily provided by the energies of molecular collisions occurring at room 
temperature.
<p>
An analysis of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) shows an even tighter H-O-H bond angle
(105&deg;) with O-H bond length 0.96 &Aring; and &Delta;=118 kcal/mol.</p>

<h3>1.14 Bond dissociation energy.  Homolysis and heterolysis</h3>
<p>
<i>Bond dissociation energy</i> (D) describes the energy consumed or
liberated when a <i>single</i> bond from a single type of molecule is formed or
broken, resp.  Note that type of molecule is important.  CH<sub>4</sub>  can
form CH<sub>3</sub> and a H atom with the input of 104 kcal/mol, but that does
not mean it takes 104 kcal to break 1 mol of CH<sub>3</sub> into 1 mol
CH<sub>2</sub> and 1 mol H atom.  This in fact requires 106 kcal.  Breaking
CH<sub>2</sub> into CH and an H atom also requires 106 kcal/mol.  And breaking
C-H to form one C and one H atom requires only 81 kcal/mol.  Thus it takes
&Delta;<i>H</i>=104+106+106+81=397 kcal/mol to break methane into its
constituent atoms.  If we average that over the 4 bonds, that is 99 kcal/mol,
which is called the <b>bond energy (E)</b>, but <i>not</i> bond dissociation
energy.  Bond dissociation energies are given
in the table below:</p>

<p>
In breaking a bond, it is possible to speak of <b>homolysis</b> wherein in each 
atom in the broken bond gets an electron (free radical formation) or 
<b>heterolysis</b>, in which one of the atoms gets both electrons and the other 
gets none (yielding ions if the molecule split was neutral). Because separation 
of ions requires a great deal of energy (100 kcal/mol more than of neutral 
molecules), bond dissociation in the gas phase tends to take the easier route 
(homolysis) while heterolysis can occur with ionizing solvents.</p>

<h3>1.15 Bond polarity</h3>
<p>
While covalent bonds by definition prescribe a sharing of electrons in the bond, 
the <q>equality</q> of sharing is another matter. True, equal sharing certainly 
occurs in homodiatomic molecules. But with heterodiatomic and multiatomic 
molecules, some polarity is evident. These <b>polar covalent</b> bonds result 
strictly from differences in <i>electronegativity </i>of the atoms in the bond. 
Relative electronegativity is listed below and can be used as a gauge in 
assessing polarity of bonds.</p>

<p class="center">
F &gt; O &gt; Cl, N &gt; Br &gt; C, H</p>

<p>
Note that C and H share their electrons very well.</p>

<h3>1.16 Molecular polarity</h3>
<p>
Inasmuch as their may be polarity in bonds, this is one but not the sole factor 
in contributing to molecular polarity. Molecular polarity virtually is assured 
in molecules with only one nonbonding electron pair, but if multiple pairs exist,
manifold symmetry is certainly going to negate any possible dipole. A 
<b>dipole</b> is the fact that the center of negative charge does not coincide with 
the center of positive charge. Using the equation:</p>

<p class="eqnserif">
<b>&mu;</b> = <i>e</i> &times; <b>d</b></p>

<p>
<b>&mu;</b> the dipole in Debye
units if <i>e</i> is the separated charge magnitude in esu and <b>d</b>, which
is a vector, is expressed in cm.  Note <b>&mu;</b> is a vector as well.</p>

<h3>1.17 Structure and physical properties</h3>
<p>
In working with organic compounds, the deductive relationship between structure, 
our knowledge of atomic chemistry, and the correlations with the physical 
properties (m.p., b.p., solvent solubility) allow one to make predictions about 
the properties of other molecules. Note also that the major factor which may 
influence physical properties are the types of bonds: ionic or covalent.</p>

<h3>1.18 Melting point; 1.19 Intermolecular forces</h3>
<p>
Melting simply is a phase change in which the highly ordered arrangement of 
particles in a crystalline lattice become disordered into a liquid phase. 
Lattices of ions have the incredible power of charge separation maintaining 
their crystalline state, but organic molecules have no such ionic charge 
separation and form very weakly held molecular crystals. The intermolecular 
forces holding them tend to be</p>
<ol>
<li><b>dipole-dipole interactions</b> &mdash; suppose we have a molecule like
H&mdash;F.  When several HF molecules arrange themselves together, they will
orient themselves such that the positive end of the polar covalent bond is
stacked against negative ends.  The <b>hydrogen bond</b> is a type of dipole-
dipole interaction, being the strongest of this class, with a strength of 5
kcal/mol (compared to covalent bond strength of 50-100 kcal/mol).  Hydrogen
bonding is observed only when the H atom is bonded to more strongly
electronegative elements, being F, O, and N.
<li><b>van der Waals forces</b> &mdash; even the most nonpolar molecules such as 
methane do solidify, so what forces are acting on them to make this possible? 
Although the <i>average</i> position of electrons within the nonpolar compound 
is symmetrical such that no dipole exists, the <i>instant</i> position of 
electrons is not such, since it is a discrete particle. Small dipoles do exist, 
although briefly. This momentary dipole serves to induce dipoles in other 
molecules, which thereby creates an attractive effect, and a domino-like effect 
of dipole induction creates the overall opportunity for solidification. All this 
depends upon molecules being closely quartered within a small volume to begin 
with, which necessitates that molecular translational energies be comparable to 
the energies of dipole induction exerting the attractive force.
</ol>

<h3>1.20 Boiling point</h3>
<p>
When ion crystal lattices boil, requiring high temperature to do so, they 
necessarily form <i>ion pairs</i> since the energy of charge separation is much 
higher than for volatilization. (Plasmas, achieved on the sun and under certain 
man-made conditions, are gas phase single ions.) Molecules with polar covalent 
bonds can exist in a liquid phase over a broader range than nonpolar molecules 
simply because of their partly ionic, partly covalent nature. Among organic 
compounds, boiling points for all compounds rarely exceed 350&deg; for the 
reason that decomposition begins to compete with volatilization: the covalent 
bond itself is subject to breaking at that temperature.</p>

<h3>1.21 Solubility</h3>
<p>
Solubilization is essentially defined as the breaking of solute-solute 
interactions (bonds) with a formation of new bonds with solvent molecules. While 
ions in a crystal do not melt easily, they dissolve quite well in polar solvents 
(solvents with high dielectric constants which shield electrostatic interactions)
. Water is unique in that it possesses both a high dielectric constant and is 
able to hydrogen-bond as part of its ability to dissolve compounds. 
H<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>3</sub>OH are protic solvents because they are able 
to hydrogen bond; any solvent with H bonded to N or O is a protic solvent and 
therefore potentially acidic. Aprotic solvents with very high dielectric 
constants shown in the figure below are also able to dissolve polar molecules. 
More importantly they can have great, sometimes unwanted, effects on the rate 
or kind of chemical reactions which can occur.</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/ch1-21.gif" alt="solvent structures">

<h3>1.22 Acids and Bases</h3>
<p>
A <b>Lowry-Bronsted acid</b> is any molecule which <i>releases a proton</i>
(H<sup>+</sup>) to another molecule upon mixing of the two.  This usually refers
to transfer of protons to solvent molecules serving as acceptors (like water). 
A <b>base</b> is a <i>proton acceptor.</i>  Relative acid and base strength of
well-known mineral acids and bases is given below:

<p>
<b>Acid strength</b>:   H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HCl &gt;
H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> &gt; NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> &gt;
H<sub>2</sub>O

<p>
<b>Base strength</b>:    HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>,
Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; H<sub>2</sub>O &lt; NH<sub>3</sub> &lt; OH<sup>&minus;</sup>

<p>
Oxygen atoms, having available nonbonding pairs, which are in organic compounds 
also accept protons, making them relative bases especially in the presence of 
the strong mineral acids.

<p class="eqnserif" style="text-align:center;">
EtOH + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> &harr; [EtOH<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> +
HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup><br>
EtOH + HCl &harr; [EtOH<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>

<p>
A <b>Lewis acid</b> is a substance which <i>takes up</i> an electron pair to 
form a covalent bond. A <b>Lewis base</b> therefore is a substance which 
offers/furnishes an electron pair for the formation of a bond. This is not 
inconsistent with the B-L acid/base principle, since H<sup>+</sup> itself is 
still an acid as is the molecule releasing it. However, the Lewis definition 
extends the concept of acidity/basicity to include other molecules, making 
BF<sub>3</sub>, AlCl<sub>3</sub>, and SnCl<sub>4</sub> acids by definition.
<p>
The extent to how strong or weak an acid, or in the case of protic acids, 
depends upon (1) not merely on the electronegativity of the atom holding the 
proton, but also the <q>group-effect electronegativity</q> on the atom providing 
the electron pair for the proton; and (2) the size of the atom (atomic radius) 
bonded to the proton. In the case of a group-effect electronegativity, the 
greater the pull used to take away the electron pair for bonding to H, the more 
acidic the compound is. In the case of size, a larger atomic radius of the atom 
bonded to H has less hold on the proton. Acid strength is shown as follows:

<p>

<h3>1.23 Electronic and steric effects</h3>

<p>Substituents of molecules affect their reactivity in two
ways

<ol>
<li>the <i>electronic effect</i>, meaning the availability
of electrons at the reaction center;</li>
<li> the <i>steric effect</i>, meaning the effect of crowding
which occurs in a molecule.</li>
</ol>

<p>A standard of reference is the C-H bond.  When H is replaced by G to make C-
G, comparisons are made relative to the C-H structure.  Occurring at some stage
of most, if not all, chemical reactions is the development of positive or
negative charges.  The ability of a molecule to accommodate (stabilize) such
occurrences of charge depend upon the nature of it:  substituent G may affect
the electron bonds of carbon or other atoms toward other substituents by pulling
or creating a <q>fullness</q> of electrons in the bond or in stabilizing a
charged intermediate (the <b>electronic effect</b>).  The way the electronic
effect may work may be further subdivided into an <i>inductive effect</i>, in
which the electronegativity of the substituent acts through space or through the
molecular chain to alter electron pair distribution in the bond.  The other is
the <i>resonance effect</i> (which tends to stabilize by delocalization of
charge centers) which usually requires
special bond orbitals &pi; electrons).

<p>The <b>steric effect</b> influences reactivity merely by a
nonreactive substituent blocking or influencing the progress of reaction by
limiting access of another molecule to a more reactive substituent on the same
molecule.

<h3>1.24 Isomerism</h3>

<p>Molecules showing the same elemental composition, i.e. same number of the
types of atoms, may still be distinct in many aspects of their structure. 
Ethanol and methyl ether both show the same proportions of atoms:  2 C : 6 H : 1
O (MW 46 as verified by mass spectrum).  But ethanol boils at 78&deg;, and
reacts with sodium metal to form H<sub>2</sub> and with HI to form water and
ethyl iodide, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>I.  Methyl ether boils at
&mdash;24&deg; and does not react with Na.  It does react with HI, but to form a
different product (CH<sub>3</sub>I).  Hence they are <b>structural isomers</b>
(<i>isos</i> means <q>equal</q>; <i>meros</i> means <q>part</q>).

hydrogen and carbon</i> (the <b>hydrocarbons</b>) are classified.  The simplest

<h3>2.2 Methane structure</h3>

<p>The methane structure has already been discussed in the introduction of
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybridization.  The tetrahedral structure has been
confirmed using electron diffraction studies, but other evidence comes before
quantum mechanics and use of electron diffraction was done (to be discussed). 
Representations of methane structure may show C connected to four H atoms by
dashes to indicate the bond, by pair of dots to highlight electron pairs in the
bond, or by artistic renderings to indicate three-dimensional structure.

<h3>2.3 Physical properties</h3>

<p>m.p. &mdash;183&deg;; b.p. &mdash;161&deg;.  Gas at RT.  In liquid
phase, its density less than water's (sp. gr. 0.4).  It is only slightly
soluble in water, but quite soluble in gasoline, ether, and alcohol.

<h3>2.4 Source</h3>

<p>Methane is an end product of anaerobic decay of plants.  As
such, it is the major constituent of <b>natural gas</b> (up to 97%).  It is the
dangerous <i>firedamp</i> of coal mines, the <i>marsh gas</i> of swamps. 
Fractional distillation of natural gases can be used to purify methane.

<h3>2.5 Reactions</h3>

<p>The table below indicates the reactions of methane. 
Typically the conditions are <q>vigorous</q> or <q>extreme.</q>

<h3>2.6 Oxidation</h3>

<p>Combustion is characteristic and, under special conditions,
used to determine the C and H content of hydrocarbons.  In addition to the
common combustion used to obtain heat energy, controlled (partial) oxidation
and high-temperature catalytically-controlled reaction with water yields
industrial sources of hydrogen and of acetylene.  Carbon monoxide and hydrogen
can be used in methanol and in ammonia production.

<h3>2.7 Chlorination:  a substitution reaction</h3>

<p>UV light <i>or</i> temperatures of 250-400&deg; may be used to start a
reaction between the gas mixture methane and chlorine.  The products are
vigorously formed as HCl and CH<sub>3</sub>Cl (<i>chloromethane</i> or <i>methyl
chloride</i>).  The mechanism is by <b>substitution</b>, since one atom has been
substituted for another.  Additional reaction products,
CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>  (<i>dichloromethane</i> or <i>methylene
chloride</i>), CHCl<sub>3</sub> and CCl<sub>4</sub>, may form.

<h3>2.8 Control of chlorination</h3>

<p>It is na ve to assume that mixing 1 mol methane and 1 mol
chlorine under standard laboratory conditions will yield products of only one
type:  nearly 1 mol CHCl<sub>3</sub> and 1 mol HCl.  During the reaction,
the amount of CHCl<sub>3</sub> will certainly
increase and become comparable to and compete with the starting reactant,
CH<sub>4</sub> for the chlorine
molecule.  As the proportion of product exceeds the reactant, it will react to
form CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, and this product
in turn increases its proportion in the reaction chamber.  It is reasonable to
expect that all products of chlorination will be found and so is unreacted
methane.  If a large excess of methane is used however, the reaction product
can be limited to methyl chloride formation.  Purification of the product is
easily done by distillation (methane b.p. &mdash;161.5&deg;; methyl chloride b.p.
&mdash;24&deg;).  This principle of using a large excess of one reactant is a
device used by chemists to limit reactions to certain reactive sites so that
the desired product is obtained.

<h3>2.9 Reactions with other halogens</h3>

<p>Bromination of methane happens to the extent it occurs with
chlorination, with multiple substitutions possible.  Bromination takes place
less readily however.  With iodine, methane can not react at all.

<p>However, with fluorine, it reacts even in the dark at room
temperature;  to control the reaction therefore, reactants are diluted with
inert gas and then mixed at a low pressure.  The order of reactivity of
halogens for methane (shown above) applies also to the other alkanes.

<h3>2.10 Relative reactivity</h3>

<p>Understanding of reactions in organic chemistry are more
meaningful (understood easily) when in understanding the reaction of an organic
compound to a reagent, the reaction is compared relative to the reaction of the
organic compound with several reagents or of the reagent with several organic
compounds.

<h3>2.11 Reaction mechanism</h3>

<p>This is not the <i>what</i> but the <i>how</i> of the reaction, knowing not
just the <i>facts</i> but the <i>theory.</i>  We therefore provide a
<b>mechanism</b>, which is accurately defined as <i>the detailed, step-by-step
description of a chemical reaction.</i>  Usually it starts as a hypothesis to
account for the facts, with experimental work being done to confirm the
mechanism.  The entirety of a mechanism is rarely <i>proved</i>, but instead
<i>well established.</i>  As data is collected which does not
contradict the details of the mechanism, it may hold.

<h3>2.12 Mechanism of chlorination.  Free radicals</h3>

<p>An understanding of the experimental facts of the reaction
helps to elucidate a mechanism:

<ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>the reaction does not occur in the dark at room temperature
<li>the reaction can occur in the dark at high temperature (at least 250&deg;)
<li>the reaction can proceed at room temperature with UV light
<li>a single photon of light is sufficient to produce several
thousand product molecules
<li>the presence of O<sub>2</sub> slows down the reaction for a period,
after which the reaction proceeds normally (the period duration depends upon
how much O<sub>2</sub> is present.
</ul>

<p>The mechanism accounting for these facts is as follows:

<p>(1) Cl<sub>2</sub> + <i>h&nu;</i> &rarr; 2 Cl&bull;

<p>(2) Cl&bull; + CH<sub>4</sub> &rarr; HCl + CH<sub>3</sub>&bull;

<p>(3) Cl<sub>2</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub>&bull; &rarr;  CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + Cl&bull;

<p>The first step is a homolysis of chlorine and requires a
bond dissociation energy of 58 kcal/mol, supplied by the light or heat.  An
orbital of the product atoms has only one electron, and any atom or group of
atoms with an unpaired electron in an orbital is a <b>free radical</b>.  They
are quite reactive in accordance with the desire to complete a valence shell
octet.

<p>The free radical can then subsequently collide with another substance, and
three possibilities exist in the reaction chamber:  (i) with another chlorine
free radical, unlikely because of the paucity of free radicals in relation to
other collidable substances and unproductive in that it stops the reaction; (ii)
with a Cl<sub>2</sub> molecule, which is probable but unproductive in that the
reactants and products are qualitatively identical; (iii) with a CH<sub>4</sub> 
molecule, both probable and productive.

<p>In colliding with methane, the Cl free radical collides with one of the H atoms,
making it bond with Cl instead of the C atom.  The C atom is left with the
single electron (a methyl radical).  This is step 2.

<p>The methyl radical has one of 5 possibilities early in the reactions:  (i) it
can collide with another one of itself, which is both improbable because there
are very few of itself and unproductive in that another type of product (ethane)
is formed; (ii) it can collide with HCl, also improbable because of the small
number and unproductive since it forms what was present before the reaction;
(iii) it can collide with Cl atom, which while productive is improbable, again
because of the low number of Cl, and it stops the reaction; (iv) in can collide
with methane, which is probable but not productive, since the reactants and
products are identical; (v) it can collide
with Cl<sub>2</sub>, both probable and productive since it propagates the reaction.

<h3>2.13 Chain reactions</h3>

<p>In the mechanism outlined for chlorination, an example of a <b>chain
reaction</b> is illustrated, in which the products of a reaction are themselves
reactive to bring about another chemical reaction, which is circular in this
case.  In the chain, we have a <b>chain-initiating step</b>, and <b>chain-
propagating step</b>, and then <b>chain-terminating step</b>s must be defined as
well.  The chain-terminating steps for chlorination of methane would necessitate
consumption of the reactive particles (combining two chlorine radicals,
combining two methyl radicals, or combining a methyl and chlorine radical). 
Experimentally, 10,000 CH<sub>3</sub>Cl molecules can be generated per photon
used, and on the
average 5000 repetitions of the chain propagating cycle occur before stopping.

<h3>2.14 Inhibitors</h3>

<p>How does O<sub>2</sub> affect the mechanism?  Clearly as an inhibitor.  It is
thought to combine with the CH<sub>3</sub> radical to form the much less
reactive CH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;O&mdash;O which does little to continue the
chain.  Once all the inhibitor is consumed (its inhibition is clearly not
<q>catalytic</q>), the reaction continues with formation of CH<sub>3</sub>
radicals not scavenged by O<sub>2</sub>.

<h3>2.15 Heat of reaction</h3>
<p>
The net enthalpy of reaction (&Delta;H) is simply the amount of heat used in 
bond breaking subtracted from the amount heat liberated in bond formation. A 
CH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;H and a Cl&mdash;Cl bond are broken and require 104 and 58 
kcal/mol, resp. A CH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;Cl and H&mdash;Cl bond are formed and 
release 84 and 103 kcal, resp. Hence 162 &minus; 187 = &minus;25 kcal/mol as the 
net change in enthalpy. Heat is clearly released in the reaction. If one breaks 
it down to the 3 steps of the mechanism, the net change in &Delta;<i>H</i> for 
the three steps is (1) +58, (2) +1 [104-103], and (3) &minus;26 [58-84]. (Note 
that these are not added to give the overall enthalpy, since other steps are 
omitted.) The major energy-requiring step is the first step.

<h3>2.16 Energy of activation</h3>
<p>
Notwithstanding a reaction being favorable in the sense of a large negative net 
enthalpy, all reactions require a <q>push</q> to get started. This <q>push</q> 
is the <b>energy of activation.</b> Collisions must be accompanied by a certain 
amount of kinetic energy not simply measured in the enthalpy quantity. If the 
chlorination of methane is at 275&deg;, only 1 in 40 collisions are sufficiently 
energetic for a reaction to proceed. Moreover, <b>molecular orientation</b> is a 
factor, since the direction of Cl radical collision must be aligned with the C-H 
axis to get maximal effect (1 in 8 collisions in this example).

<h3>2.17 Progress of reaction</h3>
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/image006.png"
alt="Potential Energy v. Progress of Reaction Plot">
<p>
A diagrammatic representation of the energy changes ensuing during a chemical 
reaction is usually helpful in visualizing the energy changes. Note that 
endothermic reactions manifest themselves with drops in temperature as energy is 
taken up. Energy diagrams also give a picture of the reverse reaction, with its 
<i>E</i><sub>act</sub> and &Delta;<i>H</i> interpretable. In constructing the 
energy diagram for homolysis of Cl<sub>2</sub> (Cl<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2 Cl), 
there is no product slope to descend, meaning that <i>E</i><sub>act</sub>in the 
forward direction is equal to the &Delta;<i>H</i> of the reaction, while <i>E</i>
<sub>act</sub> of the reverse direction is 0 (this is considered to be the case 
for all reactions in which molecules dissociate into free radicals).

<h3>2.18 Reaction rate</h3>
<p>
Reaction rate depends upon three factors:
<p>
# effective collisions per time per volume = # total
collisions per time per volume * fraction having enough energy * fraction that
have proper orientation.

<p>
This is stated another way:

<p>
rate = collision frequency * energy factor * probability (orientation) factor
<p>
<b>Collision frequency </b>is a function of (a) molecular crowding (indicated by 
concentration or pressure; (b) particle size/volume; (c) particle velocity/speed 
(which depends upon temperature and particle mass). Concentration and pressure 
are easily manipulated to adjust reaction rate; particle size/volume and mass 
cannot be. While heavy particles move more slowly, their larger size tends to 
cancel out the slower speed effect, i.e. factor (b) compensates for factor (c).
<p>
<b>Probability factors</b> depend upon internal molecular vibrations to a great 
extent, but little can be done to effect the proper molecular orientation short 
of immobilizing the molecule, which is not typically in basic organic chemistry.
<p>
The <b>energy factor</b> is the most controllable factor in affecting rate, 
since it merely means increasing temperature or adding energy to the system. A 
frequency (Boltzmann) distribution of particle kinetic energies applies here. At 
a certain energy level, <i>E</i><sub>act</sub>, the reaction occurs. The 
fraction of collisions which are greater than <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> are 
calculated by using exp(&minus;<i>E</i><sub>act</sub>/<i>RT</i>). The entire 
reaction rate is therefore:

<p class="center">
rate = <i>P Z</i>
exp(&minus;<i>E</i><sub>act</sub>/<i>RT</i>)
<p>
where <i>P</i> is the probability factor and <i>Z</i> is the collision frequency.
 From this equation, we can know that only 1% of all particle collisions at 
275&deg; will result in effective reactions assuming <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> = 5 
kcal, only 0.01% if <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> = 10 kcal, and only 0.0001% (1 in 1 
million) for <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> = 15 kcal. Hence from an <i>E</i><sub>
act</sub> = 5 kcal to 10 kcal increases the rate 100 times.

<p>Changing temperature has similar effect.  A 10% (from 250 to 300&deg;)
increase in <i>T</i> can increase rates 50% if <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> = 5 kcal,
100% (double) if <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> =
10 kcal, and 200% (triple) if <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> = 15 kcal.

<h3>2.19 Relative rates of reaction</h3>

<p>When comparing a reaction of bromine versus chlorine molecules with methane,
analysis the differences accounted for in the rate should be step by step.  Why
does Br<sub>2</sub> react more slowly than Cl<sub>2</sub>?  Although Br is
heavier than Cl, its larger size makes possible the chance of a collision, so
collision frequency (Z) is not likely to be significantly different.  The
probability factor is not significantly different either, with 1 of 8 collisions
as effective in either case.  In fact the energy factor is very significantly
different with <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> = 4 kcal for Cl striking methane and
<i>E</i><sub>act</sub> = 18 kcal for Br striking methane.  This difference alone
makes Cl 250,000 times more reactive than Br (at 275&deg;).  Most rate
differences between different reactions are due to differences in
<i>E</i><sub>act</sub>, but it is absolutely necessary to discount any
differences in factors <i>P</i> and <i>Z</i> before concluding this.

<h3>2.20 Relative reactivities of halogens toward CH<sub>4</sub></h3>

<p>Let us compare <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> and &Delta;H
of all halogens in the substitution reaction at each step of the mechanism. 
The table below is used for our purposes:

<table style="margin:2em auto;">
<tr>
 <th>
 <th colspan="4">&Delta;<i>H</i> (kcal/mol)
<tr><td style='text-align:right;'>X =
 <td>F
 <td>Cl
 <td>Br
 <td>I
<tr> <td>(1) X<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2 X&bull;
 <td>+38
 <td>+58
 <td>+46
 <td>+36
<tr><td>(2) X + CH<sub>4</sub> &rarr; HX + CH<sub>3</sub>
 <td>&minus;32
 <td>+1
 <td>+16
 <td>+33
<tr><td>(3) CH<sub>3</sub> + X<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>X + X&bull;
 <td>&minus;70
 <td>&minus;26
 <td>&minus;24
 <td>&minus;20
</table>

<p>One might expect the rate of Cl to be slowest and I to be the fastest based
merely on the energy needs for the initial reaction.  But experimental evidence
shows F reacts the most vigorously.  The formation of the product in step (3)
would tend to explain how F might react vigorously, and exothermic reactions in
all 4 cases indicate a low <i>E</i><sub>act</sub>  in any case:  indeed iodine
does react readily with methyl radicals and is actually used as a scavenger or
trap in the study of reaction mechanisms.  But iodine does not form
CH<sub>3</sub>I to any large extent.  Therefore step (2) must be the <i>rate-
determining step.</i>  The differences in &Delta;H most surely give an idea of
E<sub>act</sub> and it is possible to predict how many collisions are in fact
productive.  Iodine virtually ability to engage in productive interaction with
methane, and is more likely to react with another iodine free radical when the
number of collisions
for productive formation is considered.

<h3>2.21 Structure of the methyl radical.  <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridization</h3>

<p>While carbon in methane promotes one of its <i>s</i> electrons to a <i>p</i>
orbital for <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybrid formation, the carbon in a methyl
radical hybridizes its 2s orbital with only two 2p orbitals to make the
necessary bonds with the three H atoms.  The odd electron remains with C in its
third <i>p</i> orbital.  The geometry is therefore trigonal.  While the odd
electron might be expected to exert electron charge repulsion in the bonded
orbitals, the spectroscopic evidence indicates that the radical is flat. 
However a mix of tetrahedral and trigonal character is likely.

<h3>2.22 Transition state</h3>

<p>Transition state is used with the notion of an <i>E</i><sub>act</sub>  to
indicate an intermediate structure corresponding to the course of the reaction. 
In the substitution reaction, the reaction can be shown to have a fleeting
intermediate (bracketed to show its fleeting nature).

<h3>2.23 Reactivity and the development of the transition state</h3>

<p>Transition state formation in terms of the progress of the reaction is
considered to be <i>late</i> when <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> of the reaction is
large; <i>early</i> if the <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> is small.  Moreover, the
transition state can be said to <i>resemble</i> either the product or the
reactant more depending on whether it is late or early in its development. 
Where the reactivity is low, the transition state actually resembles the
products; when high reactivity (early TS), the TS resembles the
reactants.

<h3>2.24-2.28 Molecular formula:  its fundamental importance.  Qualitative,
quantitative analysis; empirical formula and MW determination</h3>

<p>Experiments must be done to assess properties of organic
compounds before studies of their reactions are to be done.

<p>(1) <b>Qualitative elemental analysis.</b>  Presence of
either C or H will be easily determined by <i>combustion</i>, usually using a
train with a hot CuO catalyst.  Analysis to detect CO<sub>2</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>O as products follows.  Halogens,
nitrogen, and sulfur must be converted to inorganic ions, done in either two
ways:

<p>(i) Sodium fusion using hot molten sodium:  (C,H,X,N,S) + Na + heat &rarr;
Na<sup>+</sup>X<sup>&minus;</sup> + Na<sup>+</sup>CN<sup>&minus;</sup> +
Na<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>S<sup>2&minus;</sup>

<p>(ii) Sch niger oxidation:  (C,H,X,N,S) + O<sub>2</sub> + NaOH catalyst &rarr;
Na<sup>+</sup>X<sup>&minus;</sup> +
Na<sup>+</sup>NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> 
+ Na<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup><sup>&minus;</sup>

<p>Additional tests would show other elements except for
oxygen;  presence of oxygen is usu. revealed by quantitative analysis.

<p>(2) <b>Qualitative element analysis </b>of carbon, hydrogen, and halogens. 
For C and H, a combustion train using CuO heated to 600-800&deg; is set up, with
a Dehydrite or Mg(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in one part of the train to
capture H<sub>2</sub>O and a strong base (Ascarite, NaOH on asbestos) following
to capture CO<sub>2</sub>.  The increase in weight of the agents is used to
assess the product and compared to a weighed sample of starting agent.  Suppose
9.67 mg of methane produced 26.53 mg CO<sub>2</sub> and 21.56 mg
H<sub>2</sub>O.  The weight of C in methane is the fraction C in
CO<sub>2</sub> times the mass produced and the same for H.  Hence wt. C = 26.53
mg * (12.01 mg mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>  C / 44.01 mg) = 7.24 mg.  Hydrogen
calculates to wt. H = 2.41 mg.  The relative weight % of C is 7.24 mg/9.67 mg
*100% = 74.9%.  For % H = 2.41 / 9.67 *100% = 24.9%.  Note that the wt C + wt H
combination was 9.65 mg, effectively close to the starting sample and giving us
the clue that no oxygen is probably present.

<p>To quantitate halogen, choose either of two methods:  (i) heat the organic in
a bomb with Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; (ii) Carius method:  heat in a sealed
tube with HNO<sub>3</sub>.  The product halide ion is then mixed
with silver solution, the insoluble salt easily weighed.

<p>(3) <b>Empirical formula</b> is arrived at by determining
the number of gram-atoms (moles) of an element and then converting to the
smallest whole numbers by dividing by the lowest mole content determined.  In
the example, C is present as 74.9% (74.9 g/100 g) / 12.01 g/mol = 6.24 mol.  H
is present as 24.9% (24.9 g/100 g) / 1.008 g/mol = 24.7 mol.  Since C has
lowest absolute mol content, we get 1 C.  Dividing 24.7 by 6.24, the value 3.96
is obtained, approx. 4.  Hence for every 1 C there are 4 H.  However, we cannot
say that it is CH<sub>4</sub>, for it could be a multiple of that: 
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>12</sub>, etc.

<p>(4) <b>Molecular weight</b> analysis allows the
determination of the <b>molecular formula</b> (the actual number of atoms of
each kind in a molecule).  Mass spectrometry is used in that case to make the
determination.

<h2>Chap. 3  Alkanes.  Free-radical substitution</h2>

<h3>3.1 Classification by structure: the family</h3>

<h3>3.2 Ethane structure</h3>

<p>Ethane features are single bonds throughout with both C atoms
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized.  H-C-H and H-C-C bond angles are all
109.5&deg;, indicating a classic tetrahedron.  While C-H bond length is
uniformly 1.10 &Aring;, C-C bond length is 1.53 &Aring;.  All
structures verified by electron diffraction and spectroscopy.

<h3>3.3 Free rotation of carbon-carbon single bond.  Conformations. Torsional
strain</h3>

<p>Discusses two possible <b>conformations</b> of ethane: 
eclipsed and staggered (<q>skew</q> is the infinite number of
intermediate conformations between the main two).  The Newman projection is the
end-on view of one of the C atoms to show conformation.  C-C bond rotation has
3 kcal/mol energy barrier, with potential energy at a minimum for the staggered
conformation.  The nature of the energy barrier is hard to understand although
explained using quantum mechanics:  H atom crowding from both ends is not
predictable nor can it be van der Waals forces since the energy barrier has a
higher value than is typical of these energies;  most likely because of the
interaction of electron clouds in the C-H bond.  <i>Torsional strain</i> is a
term applied to the tendency of a molecule to resist an eclipsed conformation.

<h3>3.4 Propane and the butanes</h3>

<p>Propane is next member of alkane family.  All C-C bonds are
sigma type and rotatable.  Energy barrier is 3.3 kcal/mol for rotation;  view
propane on a Newman projection as methyl ethane and despite bulk of methyl group,
it is not extremely inhibitory when compared to ethane.

<p>Butane is first example of structural isomerism in alkane,
with 2 isomers:  <i>n</i>-butane and isobutane.  Physical properties of
butanes:

<table style="margin:2em auto;">
<tr>
 <th>
 <th><i>n</i>-butane
 <th>isobutane
<tr>
 <th>b.p.
 <td>0&deg;
 <td>&minus;12&deg;
<tr>
 <th>m.p.
 <td>&minus;138&deg;
 <td>&minus;159&deg;
<tr>
 <th>sp.gr. at &minus;20&deg;
 <td>0.622
 <td>0.604
<tr>
 <th>solub. in 100 ml alcohol
 <td>1813 ml
 <td>1320 ml
</table>

<p>The decision as to which butane had which physical properties could be
determined by using dihalogenation to come up with the number of dihalogenated
isomers:  the butane of b.p. 0&deg; produced <i>six</i>
C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> isomers and the butane of b.p.
&minus;12&deg; only <i>three.</i>  When you draw the number of
possible dihalogenated isomers of both butane isomers, its easy to see.

<h3>3.5 Conformation of <i>n-</i>butane.  Van der Waals repulsion.</h3>

<p>Newman projections of <i>n-</i>butane show it can hold 3 possible staggered-
type conformations among the other non-staggered.  With the two methyl groups
showing a dihedral angle of 180&deg;, this is the <i>anti</i> conformation.  The
other two conformations are identical with respect to the dihedral angle
(60&deg;) between methyl groups, are mirror images of each other, and are called
<i>gauche.</i>  The <i>anti</i> conformation is more stable than the
<i>gauche</i> by 0.8 kcal/mol.  While no torsional strain can be said to exist,
van der Waal repulsion (steric repulsion) between the CH<sub>3</sub> groups is
sufficient to account for the strain.  Rotation from anti to gauche (a 3.4 kcal
barrier through the eclipse) to other gauche (a considerable 4.4-6.1 kcal
estimated barrier as methyl groups align in the eclipsed conformation), despite
the energy barrier is possible with the energy factors at room temperature.

<h3>3.6 Higher alkanes.  The homologous series</h3>

<p>A homolog is the relationship of one compound with another resulting from the
addition of a constant chemical group.  Higher alkanes are formed by adding
CH<sub>2</sub>.  The formula for alkanes is
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>.

<h3>3.7 Nomenclature</h3>

<p>Names typically derived from Greek or Latin.  Prefixes like
iso-, neo-, <i>n-</i> were the result of the early days of chemistry, when most
structures were not that complex.

<h3>3.8 Alkyl groups</h3>

<p>Methyl, ethyl, propyl...name comes from dropping the -ane
suffix.  Formula is C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>. 
Other prefixes begin to occur when we talk about alkyl salts, like alkyl
halides.  These prefixes include <i>n-</i>, sec- (for secondary), iso-, and
tert- (tertiary).

<h3>3.9-3.10  Common names and IUPAC names</h3>

<p>Common names for the normal chain alkanes and isoalkanes up
to 6 carbons are retained and not confusing.  For more complex structures,
IUPAC system is used.  Rules are as follows:

<ol>
<li>Select longest continuous chain.  Substitute the alkyl
group name for the alkyl group substituting for the H atom which would be
normally present.
<li>Use carbon numbering to eliminate confusion pertaining to
certain isomers.  Start at the end of the chain producing the use of the lowest
numbers.
<li>For alkyl groups occurring more than once along the
chain, use standard prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.) to indicate how many
groups there are, preceding this with the carbon number at which it occurs,
e.g., 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (note punctuation).
<li>For different kinds of alkyl groups along the parent
chain, name them in order of increasing size or in alphabetical order: 
4-methyl-3,3-diethyl-5-isopropyloctane.
</ol>

<h3>3.11 Classes of C and H atoms</h3>
<p>The terms <i>primary</i>, <i>secondary</i>, and <i>tertiary</i>
apply to both carbon and hydrogen atoms based on how many C atoms are attached
to other C atoms.  The H atom attached to the C atom derives its classification
from that C atom as well.

<h3>3.12 Physical properties</h3>

point rises 20-30&deg; for each added carbon (see table).

<p>Note in all cases, a branched-chain isomer has a lower boiling point than a
straight chain; the more numerous the branches, the lower the boiling point. 
This is reasonable:  with increased branching, the molecule reduces its surface
area as it becomes spherical and there are less intermolecular forces.  Alkanes
are soluble in benzene, ether, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, but insoluble in water or
highly polar solvents.  The upper asymptote of density is 0.8, so all
alkanes are lighter than water.

<h3>3.13-.14 Industrial source.  Laboratory preparation</h3>

<p>Petroleum and its accompanying natural gas are chief source,
with a range of 1 carbon to 30- and 40-carbon alkanes.  Cycloalkanes (a/k/a
naphthenes in petroleum industry) are formed as well, and abundant in
California petroleum.  Coal is being sought as a source of alkanes (through
hydrogenation).  Natural gas usu. volatile alkanes:  sample from Pennsylvania
well was 12:2:1 methane:ethane:propane, with higher alkanes 3% of total. 
Constituents of petroleum are based on their distillation properties and number
of carbons (see table)

<p>
Kerosene is used in tractor and jet engines and, with gas oil, for heating as
furnace oil.  The lubricating oil fraction, esp. from <i>paraffin-based
petroleum</i>, usu. contains long-chain alkanes (C20-C34) with high melting
points; they create problems in the petroleum industry by crystallizing as waxes
at cold temperatures.  When filtered out, solid paraffin wax (m.p. 50-55&deg;)
or petroleum jelly is recovered and used.  <b>Catalytic isomerization</b>to
convert straight chains to branched chains and <b>cracking</b> to convert higher
alkanes to lower is often done in the industry.  In the lab, yield and purity
are of more importance
than low cost.

<h3>3.15 Preparation of Alkanes</h3>
<p>
Preparation of alkenes is as follows

<ol>

<li>Coupling of alkyl halides with organometallic compounds
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/dialkylLiCu-Coupling.png" 
alt="dialkyllithium copper coupling reaction">
</ol>
<p>
By far the most important of these is the hydrogenation of
alkenes as it is easy to do.

<h3>3.16 The Grignard reagent:  an organometallic compound</h3>
<p>
Place a solution of alkyl halide in dry ethyl ether with magnesium metal 
turnings, and a vigorous reaction occurs with the solution turning cloudy, 
boiling, and the metal dissolves. Victor Grignard discovered this reaction and 
received the 1912 Nobel for it. The product is known by the general name 
<b>alkylmagnesium halide.</b> The C-Mg bond is covalent but highly polar 
(negativity toward C), while the Mg-X bond is completely ionic. While not a true 
carbanion, it is highly carbanionic. It reacts with virtually any protic acid to 
yield the alkane; with water, it makes the alkane + Mg(OH)X. In addition to 
water, it can react with NH<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>OH to yield the alkane 
and Mg(NH<sub>2</sub>)X and Mg(OCH <sub>3</sub>)X, resp.

<h3>3.17 Coupling of alkyl halides with organometallic compounds</h3>
<p>
Taking advantage of organometallic chemistry, higher number alkanes can be 
constructed using the coupling method developed independently by E. J. Corey (of 
Harvard U) and Herbert House (of MIT). First RX is reacted with Li to form a 
Grignard-like organometallic, then subsequently with a copper halide to form a 
<i>lithium dialkylcopper</i> compound. This is reacted with another alkyl halide 
(R&prime;X) to form a higher alkane (R-R&prime;). R&prime;-X should be a 1&deg; 
halide for good yields whereas there is no restriction in the Li dialkylCu 
compound.
<p>
It is important to note that other organometallic compounds might be used, but 
with caution. Organosodium (RNaX) which form from RX are so reactive that they 
continue to react with the parent RX as they are formed. This is called the 
<b>Wurtz reaction</b> and is used to form symmetrical alkanes (R-R). Organocopper 
compounds (RCuX) are well known at aiding C-C bonding (which is why they are 
used) but are unstable; they are stabilized by direct reaction with RLi 
compounds, where they are thought to exist as 
R<sub>2</sub>Cu<sup>&minus;</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. It is believed that subsequent 
reaction with R&prime;X involves nucleophilic aliphatic substitution.

Alkanes are inert to HCl and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, but will react
with the strongest acids, like HF-SbF<sub>5</sub> and
FSO<sub>3</sub>H-SbF<sub>5</sub> (<q>magic acid</q>).  Alkanes are inert
to oxidation by agents like KMnO<sub>4</sub> or NaCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,
but do get oxidized by halogens.  However, all of these reactions require
high energies of activation or the strongest reagents known; alkane
chemistry usu. involves <b>free radical </b>reactions.

<h3>3.19 Halogenation</h3>
<p>
With UV light or high temperatures, Cl<sub>2</sub> or Br<sub>2</sub> react much 
as methane but would be expected to give a mixture of isomers with the higher 
alkanes. F<sub>2</sub> can react but with F<sub>2</sub> and the alkane suitably 
diluted in an inert gas in an apparatus which can dissipate the produced heat. 
Iodination cannot occur
<p>
Note in the table the halogenation products, their relative percentages, and

<p>Note with chlorination, no single isomer predominates.  But
with bromination, there is a high degree of <b>selectivity</b> because of
bromine's low <b>reactivity</b><i>.</i>  This relationship between <i>selectivity</i>
and <i>reactivity</i> is observed a great deal.

<h3>3.20 Mechanism of halogenation</h3>

<p>The mechanism is the same as outlined in Sec. 2.13, wherein
a free-radical intermediate results.  The rate-limiting step is formation of
the alkyl radical which has its H atom abstracted by halogen radical.

<h3>3.21 Orientation of halogenation</h3>

<p><b>Orientation</b> is very important concept in understand
the ratio of isomer formation and is <i>determined by the relative rates of
competing reactions.</i>  Recall that rate depends upon collision freq., a
probability factor, and energy factors.  For propane reacting with chlorine,
coll. freq. is 1 molecule propane and 1 atom chlorine.  The prob. factor is
simply the chance of Cl atom striking a particular H atom:  for propane there
is six 1&deg; H atoms and two 2&deg; H atoms, so one might expect a 3:1 yield of
n-chloro to isochloropropane.  But since the yield is 1:1, then the energy
factor must be different.  Indeed, the relative rates of reactivity have been
determined for abstraction of an alkane H by Cl atom as 5.0:3.8:1.0 for
3&deg;:2&deg;:1&deg;.  For bromination, the ratio is 1600:82:1.  This means its 5 times
easier for Cl to react with a tertiary H than a primary H.  Looking at
monochlorination of n-butane, there are six 1&deg; H atoms and four 2&deg; H atoms.  If
we consider the product of (6/4)*(1.0/3.8), the ratio is 6/15.2, which is
28%/72%, the precise ratio of yields of n-butyl chloride to sec-butyl chloride.

<h3>3.22 Relative reactivities of alkanes toward halogenation</h3>

<p>If two different alkanes are combined <i>in equimolar amounts</i> in a
reaction chamber, the relative reactivities of the alkanes toward halogenation
can be assessed.  Small amounts of halogen are added so that not every molecule
reacts.  An example is methane and ethane with a small amount of
Cl<sub>2</sub>:  400 molecules of ethyl chloride are produced for every 1
molecule of methyl chloride.  Allowing for the differences in the number of
hydrogens in ethane, one can see that ethane hydrogens are 270 times as reactive
as methane hydrogens.  Note that H atom reactivity generally depends not upon
the alkane, but its class as a primary, secondary, etc., for a primary H on
butane is just as reactive as on propane.

<h3>3.23 Ease of abstraction of H atoms.  <i>E</i><sub>act</sub></h3>

<p>Halogenation was done at various temperatures in order to
assess the energy of activation for abstraction of H atom by a halogen.  The
results show that the theory of relative reactivity was correct:  in reacting
with Cl atom, the E<sub>act</sub> (in kcal/mol) were evaluated as follows: 
methane H, 4; primary, 1; secondary, 0.5; tertiary, 0.1.  For reaction with
Br atom, E<sub>act</sub> were:  methyl
H, 18; primary, 13; secondary, 10; tertiary, 7.5.  It would be expected that as
the reaction temperature is raised, the increase in reactivity for primary H
atoms should be much greater than for tertiary H atoms.  In general selectivity
decreases as the temperature is raised, and increases as it is lowered.

<h3>3.24 Stability of free radicals</h3>

<p>The stability of free radicals is directly correlated to the
energy necessary to abstract the H atom.  If <i>less energy</i> is needed to
form a radical compared to another, it's because the radical contains
less energy the other.  Relative stability of free radicals: 
3&deg; &gt; 2&deg; &gt; 1&deg; &gt; methyl radical

<h3>3.25 Ease of formation of free radicals</h3>

<p>The more stable a free radical is, the more easily it is
formed.  Hence the relative ease of formation is the same order as relative
stability.

<h3>3.26 Transition state for halogenation</h3>

<p><i>E</i><sub>act</sub> is relationship between reactants and transition state. 
In forming the free-radical intermediate, the more stable the free radical
intermediate, then <i>the more stable the incipient free radical in the
transition state</i>.  In tertiary and secondary radicals, the stability comes
in part from delocalization of the odd electron.  Draw a reaction diagram
(potential energy vs. progress of reaction) comparing the formation of isobutyl
bromide and tert-butyl bromide.  More stable radicals are formed faster.

<h3>3.27 Orientation and reactivity</h3>

<p>Most reactions in organic chemistry will need to be considered in terms of
<b>orientation</b>, reactions at different sites in a compound, and
<b>reactivity</b>, reactions with different compounds.  The abiding theme is
that reactions with lower E<sub>act</sub> and more energetically stable
transition states will be faster than others.

<h3>3.28 Reactivity and selectivity</h3>

<p>Comparing chlorination with bromination of alkanes,
bromination is said to be <i>less reactive</i> and <i>more selective</i>.  This
is because the transition state is <i>reached late</i> (look at E<sub>act</sub>)
and therefore would have <i>much radical character</i>.  With chlorination,
the E<sub>act</sub> is lower, the TS <i>reached early</i>, and therefore
TS has <i>little radical character</i>.

<h3>3.29 Non-rearrangement of free radicals.  Isotope tracers</h3>

<p>We assume that because the product isobutyl chloride forms twice the amount
of its isomer tert-butyl chloride, that the formation of isobutyl free-radicals
is twice as fast as tert-butyl radicals.  But what if there is a rearrangement? 
H. C. Brown (Purdue U.) and Glen Russell (Iowa State U.) prepared deuterium-
labeled isobutane [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CD], with the isotope acting as
the 3&deg; hydrogen.  After photochemically-induced chlorination, the DCl:HCl
ratio was assessed with mass spectrometer and shown to be equal!  This meant
every abstraction of 3&deg; H gave 1 molecule of tert-butyl chloride and every
abstraction of 1&deg; H gave 1 molecule of isobutyl chloride, showing that
<i>rearrangement of the intermediate free radicals does <b>not</b> occur.</i> 
Although there are exceptions, rearrangements in free-radical intermediates does
not occur, and clearly does not involve alkyl radicals.

<p>The Brown-Russell work demonstrates importance of isotopes
used as tracers.  Other isotopes which are useful:  <sup>14</sup>C (radioactive);
<sup>18</sup>O, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>36</sup>Cl, and <sup>131</sup>I.

<h3>3.30 Combustion</h3>

<p>Heat is the important product of this process usually.  Mechanism not yet
fully understood:  may involve free-radical chain reaction which is necessarily
induced by high temperature or flame (E<sub>act</sub> is clearly high).

<p>Modern gasoline engines take advantage of a higher compression ratio of the
fuel and air, but the occurrence of <b>knocking</b> reduces engine power. 
Knocking is reduced by (a) selecting the proper hydrocarbons for fuels and (b)
adding Pb(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> )<sub>4</sub>.  Antiknocking ability in
fuels is rated according to <b>octane number</b>, and arbitrary scale in which
n-heptane (which knocks badly) has a zero value and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane
(<q>iso-octane</q>) is 100.  In general branched-chain alkanes and alkenes, and
aromatic hydrocarbons have excellent antiknock properties.  T. C. Midgley and T.
A. Boyd (at GM Research Laboratory) in 1922 found that
Pb(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> )<sub>4</sub> improved the octane number of
fuel.  After 50 years of research, it is believed that tiny particles of
PbO<sub>2</sub> deposited in the engine act as surface catalysts to break
chains.

<p>Pollution has increased to the point where catalytic converters containing Pt
are used to complete reactions.  But Pt is poisoned by Pb.  So in using unleaded
gasolines, knock is compensated by reducing the compression ratio of the engines
of automobiles and by increasing octane number by addition of aromatics and
reactive isomers.

<h3>3.31 Pyrolysis:  cracking</h3>

<p><i>Pyrolysis</i> (cleavage by heat) defined as decomposition by application
of heat alone.  In petroleum industry, known as <b>cracking</b>.  <i>Thermal
cracking</i> is when heat is applied to large alkanes which results in smaller
alkanes, alkenes, and hydrogen, with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>  predominating. 
<i>Steam cracking</i> is when HC is diluted with steam and then heated for a
fraction of second at 700-900&deg;, followed by rapid cooling:  used to produced
ethylene, propylene, butadiene, isoprene, and cyclopentadiene. 
<i>Hydrocracking</i> also produces smaller alkanes:  carried out in presence of
H<sub>2</sub> at high pressure and lower temp (250-450&deg;).

<p><i>Catalytic cracking</i> is the major process for fuel
production.  Higher boiling petroleum fractions (gas oil) are brought into
contact with finely divided silica-alumina at 450-550&deg; under slight pressure. 
It not only breaks large chains into small, but improves gasoline quality by
producing very desirable highly branched alkanes and alkenes.

<h3>3.32 Determination of structure</h3>

<p>For a compound whose nature is not known, its properties and chemistry may be
reported in the literature.  If its physical properties find no match, then a
detailed structural determination is necessary.  (1) First find its physical
properties: m.p., b.p., density, refractive index, solvent solubility.  Would
include spectral analysis using ir, uv, and nmr.  Mass spectra would find its
MW.  (2) Both qualitative and quantitative elemental analysis should be done. 
(3) If it belongs to a certain class or has been seems to have identical
properties with something reported, perform reactions on it to produce
<b>derivatives</b> and then analyze the derivatives.

<h3>3.33 Analysis of alkanes</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, unknowns which are alkanes are characterized on the basis of
negative findings during analyses.  With qualitative elemental analysis,
negative results for all elements but C and H are observed.  Quantitative
combustion should show the absence of O.  With MW determination, the
C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub> must apply.  Alkanes are insoluble in water,
dilute acids and bases, and conc. sulfuric acid.  Its IR spectra should show no
absorptions for characteristic functions (OH, C=O, C=C).  Additional proof of
the structure of a new alkane can be obtained by its synthesis using proven
reactions.

<h2>Chap. 4 Stereochemistry.  Stereoisomers.</h2>

<h3>4.1 Stereoisomerism</h3>

<p>Stereochemistry is <q>3-D chemistry</q> (Gr. <i>stereos</i>,
solid).  Isomers are variations in compounds having identical molecular
formulas.  Stereoisomers are variations dealing with the arrangement of the
atoms in space.

<h3>4.2 Isomer number and tetrahedral carbon</h3>

<p>J. H. van't Hoff (while a student at U. of Utrecht) in 1874 proposed
that the tetrahedral structure of carbon could be known by <i>isomer number</i>
(years before x-ray diffraction data proved him correct).  Taking methane, for
any atom Y, there is only one atom CH<sub>3</sub>Y, whether Y=Cl, Br, F, I, OH,
COOH, or SO<sub>3</sub>H.  It says that every H atom in CH<sub>4</sub> is
equivalent to the other; otherwise different products would form during
reactions.  Hence if the 4 H atoms are <i>chemically</i> equivalent, they must
be <i>spatially</i> equivalent.  In 3-D reality only a tetrahedron produces that
equivalence (not square planar or pyramidal or any other geometry.  If you
create the other structures, there is a lack of <b>superimposability</b> with
replacement of the H with either Y or Z or W.  Hence if we count the number of
isomers from a single change in methane, we see only one isomer product.

<h3>4.3-.5 Optical activity.  Plane-polarized light.  The polarimeter. Specific
rotation</h3>

<p>Light can be polarized by passing through the traditional Nicol prism made of
calcite (crystalline form of CaCO<sub>3</sub>) or by a lens made of Polaroid. 
Optically substances rotate planes of polarized light, a discovery of Jean-
Baptiste Biot in 1815 at the Coll ge de France.  The polarimeter measures this
rotation.  It consists of a light sources, two lenses (Polaroid or Nicol) and a
tube to hold the sample.  One lens serves as a <b>polarizer</b> and the other an
<b>analyzer</b>.  Machine is calibrated without sample to find the minimun and
maximum light intensities transmitted as analyzer angle is changed.  As the
analyzer is viewed with the sample behind it, rightward rotation of indicates
substance is optically active and <b>dextrorotatory </b>and the substance is
given a (+) designation.

<p><b>Specific rotation </b>is defined by the equation:

<table style="margin:1em auto;font-size:100%;" class="eqnserif">
<tr><td rowspan="2">[&alpha;] =
 <td style="border-bottom:1px solid black;">&alpha;
 <td rowspan="2"> = specific rotation =
 <td style="border-bottom:1px solid black;">observed rotation (degree)
<tr><td><i>l</i> &times; <i>d</i>
 <td>length (dm) &times; density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)
</table>


<p>and it is the amount of rotation caused by a substance present in solution at
1 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> in a 10 cm (1 dm) tube.  This says that the degree of
rotation is directly dependent upon how many molecules are encountered.  Note
that some designations as to temperature (typically 20 or 25&deg;) and the
wavelength (typically the D line of sodium, 5893 &Aring;), since these may
affect rotation parameters.

<h3>4.6-4.9 Enantiomerism.  Prediction of it.  Chirality</h3>

<p>In 1848 Pasteur while at the  cole normale in Paris was
repeating the work of another chemist studying salts of tartaric acid in order
to understand crystallography.  In the work he found that optically inactive
sodium ammonium tartrate existed as two different crystals.  He separated the
crystalline forms into two piles.  When each were dissolved separately, they
suddenly were optically active!  Moreover the specific rotations were equal but
of opposite sign.  Pasteur went on to propose that this was not a property of
the crystals (since they were now dissolved), but rather a property of the
molecules, which he said were mirror images of each other.

<p>As an exercise, imagine color atoms on the C of methane, using four different
colors.  They can not be found to be superimposable in manipulation of their
spatial arrangement, but are instead mirror images.  Mirror-image molecules are
called <b>enantiomers</b>.  Enantiomers differ with respect only to their
spatial arrangement are belong as a subclass to the general class
stereoisomers.  Enantiomers are also known as <i>optical isomers</i> because it
is the class of these stereoisomers which possesses the optical activity.

<p>What gives a substance optical activity, since not all
compounds have it?  As polarized light passes through a solution to encounter
molecules, its plane is generally rotated by tiny amount during interaction
with the molecules charged particles.  This depends upon the molecule's
orientation also.  With equal mixtures of two enantiomers, there is a
probability that in the random distribution of molecules, the emitted light
will encounter the mirror-image version and be rotated opposite to what it
was.  This is not the case with pure optically active enantiomers.

<p>Molecules that are said to <i>not be superimposable</i> are
called <b>chiral</b> (which means <q>handedness</q>).  Lord Kelvin
(1893):  <q>I call any geometric figure, or any group of points, <i>chiral</i>,
and say it has <i>chirality</i>, if its image in a plne mirror, ideally
realized, can be brought to coincide with itself.</q>

<h3>4.10 The chiral center</h3>

<p>By analyzing what it takes to make an organic compound
chiral, it can be seen that <i>four different groups</i> must be
attached to the main carbon in question to make it chiral, now called a <b>chiral
center</b>.  (Other elements like nitrogen and phosphorous can be chiral too). 
It is very important to remember that many <i>but not all</i> molecules with a
chiral center are themselves chiral;  and many <i>but not all</i> chiral
molecules contain a chiral center!  Once a chiral center is identified, the
next step should be to determine the chiral of the molecule.  When representing
chiral carbons and their 4 substituents, it is practically to use the <b>Fischer
projection</b>, which is a cross with the 4 groups at each point:  the vertical
line goes back away from the plane of the paper, the horizontal out toward the
viewer from the plane of the paper.

<h3>4.11 Enantiomers</h3>

<p>The physical properties of enantiomers are identical with
each other in every aspect (m.p., b.p., density, ref. index) but one:  they
bend plane-polarized light to the same degree but in opposite direction.  In
terms of their chemical properties (or reactivities) they are identical <i>except
when the reaction involves other optically active reagents.</i>  In biological
systems, enzymes are catalysts requiring 3-D specificity or else no reaction
can occur; drug interactions with the body are unlikely to occur if
stereochemistry is important.  Note that (+)-carvone gives oil of spearmint its
odor, but (-)-carvone is the essence of caraway.

<h3>4.12-.13 The racemic modification.  Optical activity:  a closer look</h3>

<p>Equimolar mixtures of enantiomers is called a <b>racemic</b> mixture.  Such
mixtures are optically inactive and designated (<b> </b>).  Because their
physical properties are the same, the enantiomers in a mixture cannot be
separated (purified) by any physical method:  fractional distillation,
crystallization, solvent solubilities, traditional (non-optically active)
chromatography.  (In the case of crystallization, Pasteur could separate
crystals but had to use a magnifier and twee.  Because their physical properties
are the same, the enantiomers in a mixture cannot be separated (purified) by any
physical method:  fractional distillation, crystallization, solvent
solubilities, traditional (non-optically active) chromatography.  (In the case
of crystallization, Pasteur could separate crystals but had to use a magnifier
and tweezers in a painstaking process.)  Resolving optically active isomers
requires a process described in Chap. 7.

<p>Note that not all molecules with chiral centers are optically active.  We
know that whenever we observe optical activity, we can find chirality, but the
reverse is not true.  Ethyl-n-propyl-n-butyl-n-hexylmethane has a chiral center,
and its specific rotation has been calculated to be an infinitesimal
0.00001&deg;, below the practical limits of detection for any polarimeter.  Both
of its enantiomers were prepared in 1965 and shown to be essentially optically
inactive.

<h3>4.14-4.16 Configuration.  Specification of R and S.  Sequence rules</h3>

<p><b>Configuration</b> is defined as the arrangment of atoms which
characterizes a particular stereoisomer.  There are two stereoisomers of sec-
butyl chloride, but how do we distinguish them (see diagram)?  Since the force
of distinction was indeed based on their light-rotating properties, the
traditional method was to call one (&mdash;)-sec-butyl chloride and the other
(+)-form.  But this says nothing about their actual spatial configuration!

<p><img alt="enantiomeric structures of sec-butyl chloride" src="imagesOChemHTML/image009.png">

<p>Until 1949, the question of configuration was not known in
any absolute sense until J. M. Bijvoet, fittingly Director of the van't
Hoff Laboratory at the U. of Utrecht reported from his anomalous x-ray
scattering studies that he had determined the spatial arrangement of
Pasteur's salt, (+)-tartaric acid.  Since the physicochemical
relationships between this organic compound and all other chiral compounds are
known from the past, the absolute configuration of the rest of the organic
substances became immediately known.  In the sec-butyl chloride example,
configuration I is the (&minus;)-isomer and II is the (+)-isomer.

<p>To help understand the designation more clearly, R.S. Cahn,
C. Ingold, and V. Prelog proposed a series of rules to unambiguously know a
chiral center's configuration:

<p>(A) Following a set of <b>sequence rules</b>, priority of
the four atoms or groups attached to the chiral center is assigned.  These
sequence rules are:

<p  >Sequence
Rule 1.  If the 4 atoms attached to the chiral center are <i>all different</i>,
priority is assigned according to atomic number;  highest atomic number gets
highest priority.  If two atoms are isotopes of the same element, the one with
higher mass number has higher priority.

<p  >Sequence
Rule 2.  If relative priority can not be easily decided by rule 1, then it
shall be determined by comparison of the next atom working outward from the
chiral center.  If any atom in the next group has higher atomic number that the
next group of the other, that previous atom attains higher priority.

<p  >Sequence
Rule 3.  (applies to geometric isomerism of the C=C bond).  Where there is a
double or triple bond, both atoms involved should be considered to be
duplicated or triplicated.  Thus, 

<p style='text-align:center;'>
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/image010.png" alt="R & S sequence rules">

<p  >Note particulary the structure of the phenyl group.

<p>(B) Once the priority is assigned based on the sequence
rules, visualize the molecule in an orientation with the group/atom having the
lowest priority away from you.  Now with looking at the groups with highest
priorirty, if movement from the group with highest to second to third highest
priority is clockwise, the configuration is <b>R</b> (from Latin <i>rectus</i>,
right); otherwise it is <b>S</b> (from Latin <i>sinister</i>, left).  It is
important not to confuse the RS-designation system with the physical property
of optical activity, with its (+) and (&mdash;) designation.

<h3>4.17 Diastereomers</h3>

<p>With compounds of more than 1 chiral center, consider
2,3-dichloropentane (see diagram).

<p class="center"><img
alt="diastereomeric structures of 2,3-dichloropentane"
src="imagesOChemHTML/image011.png">

<p>Consider structures I and its mirror image structure II. 
They are clearly enantiomers.  We can also draw structure III, which seems
unlike structure I and II, and its mirror image structure IV.  If we are able
to rearrange in space the structure III without breaking bonds and superimpose
it on structure I or II, then it is identical with one or the other.  But it is
in fact unique.  It is a stereoisomer of I and II, but not its mirror image. 
This is therefore a <b>diastereomer</b>.

<p>Whereas enantiomers have the same physical properties except for their
optical rotation, diastereomers have different m.p., b.p., solubilities in
solvents, densities, refractive indices, etc.  Also their specific rotation may
be different, either (+) or (&mdash;), or they may be optically inactive. 
Moreover, their chemical reactivites will be similar since they are members of a
family with the same functional groups, but they will not be identical, since
the reactants and their transition states are not mirror images of the other. 
Diastereomers are easily separated by fractional distillation or
crystallization, or by chromatography.  Note that the number of possible
stereoisomers is 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>, where n is the number of chiral centers. 
The total number of diastereomers is 2<sup><i>n</i>&minus;1</sup>, which amounts
to \ dividing by half the enantiomers of each diastereomer.)

<h3>4.18 <i>Meso</i> structures</h3>

<p>Suppose we have another molecule with 2 chiral centers,
2,3-dichlorobutane.


<p class="center"><img alt="meso stereoisomers of 2,3-dichlorobutane"
src="imagesOChemHTML/image012.png">

<p>The structure V and VI can be quickly rendered and
recognized as enantiomers.  Structure VII is drawn and distinct from V and VI
and is a diastereomer.  Its mirror image VIII though can be rearranged and
superimposed on VII;  therefore it can not qualify as an enantiomer, despite
having 2 chiral centers.  Structure VII and VIII are equivalent and therefore
nonchiral and not optically active.  Structure VII is called a <b>meso</b>
compound, which by definition is a structure whose mirror image of itself is
superimposable yet possesses chiral centers.  Rather than superimposing
molecules, <i>meso</i> structures are more easily recognized in that a plane of
symmetry can be shown within the molecule's structure.  In the case of
VII or VIII, it is through the C2-C3 bond.

<h3>4.19 Specification of configuration for more than 1 chiral center</h3>

<p >For each chiral center, its configuration of R or S is assigned according
the sequence rules and without regard to the presence of other chiral centers. 
Once assigned, the next chiral center may be similarly evaluated.  For 2,3-
dichloropentane, structure I is (2S,3S)-2,3-dichloropentane.  The other
structures would have the configurations--II: (2R,3R); III: (2S,3R); and IV:
(2R,3S).  In the case of the enantiomers shown in 2,3-dichlorobutane, structure
V and six would officially be designated (S,S)- and (R,R)-2,3-dichlorobutane. 
(Note the omission of the carbon number in the configuration designation in the
case of butane.)  The <i>meso</i> structure, VII, can be either (R,S)- or (S,R)-
2,3-dichlorobutane.  BE CAREFUL:  not all (R,S)-isomers are meso compounds, only
those with a 2-fold intramolecular symmetry!

<h3>4.20 Conformational isomers</h3>

<p>These were discussed with respect to the spatial positions of groups related
to their minimum energy of conformation.  If rotation about bonds was
sufficiently slow because the energy barrier of conformational change could not
be reached, conformers would likely have different physical properties.  The two
gauche conformers of <i>n</i>-butane are mirror images, and therefore
(conformational) enantiomers.  The anti to gauche comparison is not mirrored, so
they are (conformational) diastereomers.  However, these forms can interconvert
to one another without bond breaking and there become superimposable and one and
the same.  All stereoisomeric terms used do not find it necessary to distinguish
these conformational isomers, only configurational isomers.

<h2>Chap. 5 Alkenes.  Structure and Preparation.  Elimination</h2>

<h3>5.1 Unsaturated hydrocarbons</h3>

<p>Term <i>unsaturated hydrocarbons</i> comes from fact that
carbon does not have the maximum quantity of H atoms that can possibly bind to
it.

<h3>5.2 Ethylene structure.  Carbon-carbon double bond</h3>

<p>Simplest member is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.  Hybridization of both carbon
atoms is <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>, which form &sigma; bonding MOs with the
1<i>s</i> orbital electron of H atom and with each other.  Bonding is in one
plane, and H-C-C bond angle is 121&deg; (H-C-H bond angle 117.5&deg;).  The
remaining electron is each C atom is in the unhybridized <i>p</i> orbital.  Some
overlap with the <i>p</i> orbital is possible for bonding.  The resulting bond
is distinct for a &sigma; bonding MO, and is a &pi;bonding MO.  The C=C bond
energy is 163 kcal/mol (cf. C-C in ethane which has 88 kcal/mol).  The C-C
&sigma; bond of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is thought to be stronger (at 95
kcal/mol) because overlap is with <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> rather than
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>;  this means the <span style='font-family: Symbol'>p
</span>bond strength is about 68 kcal/mol.  Electron diffraction and
spectroscopy verify the bond angles and flatness of the molecule.  The carbon-
carbon bond distance is 1.34 &Aring; (cf. C-C distance of  1.53 &Aring; in
ethane), while the H-C bond distance is 1.103 &Aring; (cf. 1.112 &Aring; in
ethane).

<h3>5.3 Propylene</h3>

<p>The next member of the series is methylethylene, or propylene

<h3>5.4 Hybridization and orbital size</h3>

<p>In sec 5.2 there is a point to consider with the shorter bond distances and
corresponding higher bond energies in the ethylene and ethane molecules.  This
is true for the C-C and C-H bonds and their energies.  This is because of
differences in <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> and <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-formed orbitals. 
The <i>s</i> orbitals are spherical and electron distribution held closer to the
nucleus than the <i>p</i> orbital.  When we compare the <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-
<i>s</i> carbon-hydrogen bond in ethylene to  the <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-<i>s</i>
carbon-hydrogen bond in ethane, we see more <q><i>s</i> character</q> in the
<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>, which ought to make the electron distribution more
spherical and closer to the nucleus.  This rule holds true when comparing bond
distance in benzene (C-H distance is 1.084 &Aring;) or in triple <i>sp-s</i>
bonds in the C-H of acetylene (1.079 &Aring;).  The bond energies are
corresponding the same.

<h3>5.5 The butylenes</h3>

<p>In determining isomers of butylene, it is essential to
understand that cis-/trans-isomers are possible, otherwise one draws only 3
instead of 4 butylenes.

</table>

<p>Note they are arranged in order of b.p.  When 4 were shown, the bp -7&deg;
isomer could be hydrogenated to give isobutante; therefore it was branched. 
Hydrogenation of the other three gives <i>n</i>-butane.  What makes the 2-butene
isomers different is <b>hindered</b> rotation if the C=C bond.  Rotation of this
bond is not like conformational rotation about the C-C bond, but requires
breaking a pi bond (about 70 kcal/mol).  At room temperature, this kind of bond-
breaking is unlikely.

<h3>5.6 Geometric isomerism</h3>

<p>Since these 2-butenes differ from one another merely by arrangement in space,
they are stereoisomers.  Since they are not mirror images, they are not
enantiomers but diastereomers.  But these diastereomers belong to a special
class called <b>geometric isomers</b> since they owe their existence to hindered
rotation about a double bond.  The configuration about a double bond is either
<i>cis</i> or <i>trans.</i>  As diastereomers, these compounds show different
physical properties:  1,2-dichloroethylene:

<p>A problem with using the cis or trans designations occurs for example with 1-
bromo-1-chloropropene, 2-bromo-1-chloropropene, or 1-bromo-1,2-dichloroethene. 
The way around it is to use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rules and pick the
group on either side of the C=C bond with higher priority, then decide if they
are opposite or on the same side as each other; if the same side, use the
<b><i>Z-</i></b> designation; if opposite, use the <b><i>E-</i></b>
designation.

<h3>5.7-5.8 Higher alkenes.  Names</h3>

<p>Common names are seldom used except for the simple alkenes <i>ethylene</i>,
<i>propylene</i> and <i>isobutylene</i>.  IUPAC rules say (1) select as parent
the longest continuous chain containing  the C=C bond, naming replacements of
the H atom where alkyl groups may occur; (2) indicate by number the position of
the C=C bond, counting from the end in which the lowest number position may be
assigned.

<h3>5.9 Physical properties</h3>

<p>Alkenes much like alkanes being insoluble in water but very
soluble in nonpolar solvents (benzene, ether, chloroform, ligroin).  Boiling
point increases about 20-30&deg; for each carbon except in the small homologs. 
Branching lowers bp.

<p>Alkenes are only weakly polar, with dipole moments larger than for alkanes
because the &pi; electrons are more easily pushed and pulled.  They are still
small however compared to haloalkenes:  1-propylene (&mu;=0.35 D), 1-butene
(&mu;=0.37 D) compared to methyl chloride (&mu;=1.83 D).

<p>Note that <i>cis</i>-2-butene would be expected to have a
small dipole while <i>trans-</i>2-butene would have none, since its dipoles
cancel to give a zero net dipole (a minor difference in bp reflects this).  In
general the <i>cis</i> isomers are higher boiling than their <i>trans</i>
isomers because of a net dipole, but are lower melting since they fit into
crystalline lattices more poorly.

<p>As elements of greater electronegative than C are attached
to C=C, the differences in polarity begin to show themselves as differences in
melting and boiling points (see the table for the <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>
isomers of the 1,2-haloethenes above).

<h3>5.10 Industrial source</h3>

<p>Petroleum cracking is a chief source of alkenes.  1-Alkenes of even carbon
number are used in large quantities for manufacturing detergents, obtained by
controlled ionic polymerization of ethylene via the Ziegler-Natta method.

</ol>

<p>A problem with dehydrohalogenation
and alcohol dehydration is that both can eliminate from either side of the
carbon to produce isomeric alkenes.  The vicinal dihalide approach is
complicated in that the dihalide is formed from the alkene rather than the other
way around;  however, an alkene can be <q>protected</q> by forming the dihalide
prior to another reaction, then regenerating it later.

<h3>5.12-5.13 Dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides. Mechanism</h3>

<p>The alkyl halide is simply added to alcholic KOH and then
heated.  If RX is n-butyl chloride, only the 1-butene is obtained since no C-H
is on the other side.  <i>sec</i>-Butyl chloride yields either 1-butene (20%)
or 2-butene (80%).

<p>The function of OH<sup>&minus;</sup> is to abstract a H<sup>+</sup> ion away
from a C-H adjacent to the C-X group.  What supplies the energy for breaking the
C-H and C-X bonds?

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>Formation of a bond between H and a very strong base,
OH<sup>&minus;</sup>.
<li>Formation of the &pi; bond between the carbons (although weak,
it supplies 70 kcal/mol)
<li>Perhaps the most important:  the energy of solvation of
the X<sup>&minus;</sup> ion.  The alcohol polar solvent, like water,
surrounds the liberated halide to form <i>ion</i>-<i>dipole</i>
bonds, which are weak individually but supply much energy collectively. 
Hence the solvent pulls out the X<sup>&minus;</sup> ion just as
OH<sup>&minus;</sup> pulls out the H<sup>+</sup> ion.  Note that
gas-phase reactions are more suitably free-radical type, while
ionic reactions occur in solution.
</ol>

<h3>5.14 Orientation and reactivity of dehydrohalogenation</h3>

<p>The orientation of elimination can generally be anticipated
according to structure.  sec-Butyl bromide, like its chlorobutane cousin,
yields 1-butene (19%) in small quantities than 2-butene (81%), despite a 3:2
probability factor of the methyl hydrogens versus the methylene hydrogens on
the opposite side. 2-Bromopentane yields 2-pentene (71%) more than 1-pentene
(29%).  And the 3&deg;-halo 2-methyl-2-bromobutane yields the 2-methyl-2-pentene
(71%) in greater quantities than 2-methyl-1-pentene (29%).  Both the <b>ease of
formation of alkenes </b>and the <b>stability of alkenes</b> can be ordered as
follows:

<p class="center">
R<sub>2</sub>C=CR<sub>2</sub> &gt; R<sub>2</sub>C=CHR &gt;
R<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub>, RCH=CHR &gt;
RCH=CH<sub>2</sub> &gt;
CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>

<p>Note that the more substituted the incipient alkene, the
more easily it is formed.  Note also a correlation between stability and ease
of formation.  The transition state can be imagined as showing a coordination
between abstraction of H leading to double bond formation leading to halide ion
release.

<table style="margin:2em auto;">

</table>

<p>The reactivity of the alkyl halide toward elimination is also indicated in
the table above.  As the branching of the carbon carrying the -X substituent
increases, a greater number of H atoms are made available for basic attack,
giving a more favorable probability factor for elimination;  also a more stable
alkene will be the result, with a more stable transition state and a lower
<i>E</i><sub>act</sub>.

<h3>5.15-5.16 Carbonium ions.  Structure</h3>

<p>A <b>carbonium </b>ion is a group of atoms containing a carbon with only 6
electrons in its valence shell.  Carbonium ions are classified as methyl,
primary, secondary, and tertiary.  Although in a special case an unusually
stable carbonium ion was isolated as a salt, they are very reactive with a short
life.  The work of Hans Meerwein, Sir Christopher Ingold, and Frank Whitmore
largely supported the carbocation mechanism.  Geo. Olah (1963) reported directly
observing simple alkyl cations by dissolving alkyl fluorides (and later other
alkyl halides) in SbF<sub>5</sub>:  the reaction being RF +
SbF<sub>5</sub> &rarr; R<sup>+</sup> SbF<sub>6</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>.  The nmr
spectrum showed the presence of no F atom, but only an <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-
hybridized carbon with very low electron density.  For <i>tert</i>-butyl
fluoride (neat), the proton signal is split at &delta; 1.2 ppm
(J<sub>HF</sub><sub> </sub>splitting is 20 Hz), but when added to
SbF<sub>5</sub>, the proton signal is no longer split by any F atom and shifts
downfield to &delta; 4.6 ppm.

<p>The structure of the electron-deficient carbon is clearly
<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridization, 120&deg; bond angles, with sigma bonding to
3 elements trigonally arranged and lying flat in a plane, and an empty <i>p</i>
orbital straddling the plane.  Physical evidence using nmr and ir spectra
confirm flatness and <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridization.  Raman and ir spectra
of <i>tert</i>-butyl cation show similarities to the
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>B molecule, known to be flat.  Studies have been
done in which tert-butyl bromide, 1-bromobicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (I), and 1-
bromobicyclo-[2.2.1]heptane (II) are bombarded with electrons to remove the Br
atom:  the energy for removing Br from I is 5 kcal/mol greater than the tert-
butyl bromide, while for II it is 20 kcal/mol.  The structures of I and II are
such that they inhibit the formation of a <i>flat</i> carbonium, indicating its
need to be flat.  The need to be flat is related to stabilizing the carbonium as
there is a greater <i>accomodation of charge</i>.

<h3>5.17 Stability of carbonium ions.  Accommodation of charge</h3>

<p>Laws of electrostatics state that <b>the stability of a charged system is
increased by disperal of the charge</b>.  Hence any factor that tends to spread
out the + charge on a carbonium stabilizes it.  Substituents attached to the
carbon can also stabilize or destabilize.  Two effects, <i>resonance</i> and
<i>inductive</i> effects, affect stability.  <b>Inductive</b> effects are
related to differences in electronegativity.

<p><b>Resonance</b> involves overlap of the <q>empty</q>
<i>p</i> orbital with orbitals of nearby atoms, making the <i>p</i> orbital no
longer empty, and in effect dispersing the charge.  Maximum overlap depends
upon coplanarity, hence flatness of is an advantage.

<p>Other factors stabilizing carbonium ions are <i>anions</i>,
which may form ion pairs;  the <i>solvent</i>, if polar, will arrange itself
around the C<sup>+</sup>,
and there may be a <i>neighboring group effect</i>, wherein a group on a
neighboring carbon may form a covalent bond with the carbonium.  All this shows
a need to complete the Lewis octet.

<h3>5.18 Relative stability of alkyl cations</h3>

<p>The amount of energy necessary to remove 1 electron is
called the <i>ionization potential</i> (represented as &Delta;<i>H</i>). 
For a carbonium, ionizing a radical to form the respective carbonium:

<table style="margin:2em auto;font-family:'Bookman Old Style',serif">

<p>Note that the order of energy is that the methyl radical requires the most
and the 3&deg; carbon least.  This is the same order for free radical bond
dissociation energies.  The order of stability of carbonium ions is reflected as
3&deg; &gt; 2&deg; &gt; 1&deg; &gt; CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>.  Note that
energies scales are different:  whereas a tert-butyl free radical is 13 kcal
more stable than a methyl free radical, a tert-butyl cation is 71 kcal more
stable than a methyl cation.  Overall if one proceeds from methane to methyl
radical (104 kcal bond breaking energy) to methyl cation (229), the total is 333
kcal/mol from methane to methyl cation.  Similarly from ethane to ethyl radical
(98) to ethyl cation (202) is 300 kcal/mol.  From propane to isopropyl (2&deg;)
radical (95) to isopropyl cation (182) is 277 kcal/mol.  From isobutane to tert-
butyl (3&deg;) radical (91) to tert-butyl ion (171) is 262 kcal/mol.

<h3>5.19-5.20 Dehydration of alcohols.  Mechanism</h3>

<p>Removal of alcohol functions leading to an alkene is <b>dehydration</b>. 
Can be done in two ways:  (a) heating the ROH with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
or H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> to temps up to 200&deg;; (b) passing the ROH
vapor over alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) at 350-400&deg;

<p>Ease of dehydration order:  3&deg; &gt; 2&deg; &gt; 1&deg;

<p>The primary alcohols are less reactive and require more intense conditions,
whereas tertiary alcohols are so reactive that dehydration may occur from acid
fumes in the laboratory.  Examples:  ethanol in 95% sulfuric acid at 170&deg;
gives ethylene;  n-butyl alcohol in 75% sulfuric acid at 140&deg; gives 2-butene
as main product; sec-butyl alcohol in 60% sulfuric acid at 100&deg; gives 2-
butene as main product; tert-butyl alcohol in 20% sulfuric acid at 85-90&deg;
gives isobutylene.  Note that 2-butene formation from the primary alcohol is a
characteristic distinct from dehydrohalogenation.

<p>The <i>mechanism</i> of dehydration involves 3 steps:  (1) protonation of the
alcohol; (2) dissociation of the protonated OH as water to leave a carbonium
ion; (3) elimination of a proton leading to double bond formation.  The first
step is simply an acid-base equilibrium with the stronger acid
(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) combining with a stronger base (ROH).  Note in
step (3), the expulsion of H<sup>+</sup> is actually to an available ROH to form
ROH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, which continues the reaction.

<p>All three reactions are reversible, so that alkenes can form alcohols as well
(the <b>principle of microscopic reversibility</b> is illustrated here). 
However, sulfuric acid completely ionizes in alcohol, forcing equilibrium (1) to
the right.  Since carbonium ions are not very stable, equilibrium (2) is far to
the left.  Occasionally a few of the ions react to form the alkene, so
equilibrium (3) forces the steps to completion.  Note that ROH does not easily
separate to form R<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&minus;</sup>, whereas
ROH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> does easily form R<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O. 
H<sub>2</sub>O is a better <i>leaving group</i> in this instance than
OH<sup>&minus;</sup>.  (Notice that opposite charges are created in the ROH
reaction.)

<p>In all cases the mechanism is assisted by use of polar solvents stabilizing
the carbonium ion.  The elimination of a proton in the last step should be
considered as the attempt to provide an octet of electrons for the
carbocation.

<h3>5.21 Ease of formation of carbonium ions</h3>

<p>Note that the ease of formation of carbonium ions is related to their
stability.  Note the transition state in ROH <sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> forming
the carbonium and water involves the beginning of the breaking of the C-O bond
as charge from the oxygen is transferred to the carbon.  Any electron-releasing
substituents which would stabilize the incipient charge stabilize the transition
state, leading to a lower E<sub>act</sub> and a faster reaction.

<h3>5.22 Rearrangement of carbonium ions</h3>

<p>The example of 2-butene forming from n-butanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol forming
2-methyl-2-butene as the chief product illustrates a new mechanism.  We see that
the alkene formed from the carbonium ion is not the same carbonium ion initially
formed from the alcohol.  n-Butanol from the n-butyl cation, which in fact
rearranges via a <b>1,2-hydride shift</b> to form a more stable sec-butyl
cation.  The 2-methyl-1-butyl cation rearrangement to form 2-methyl-2-butyl
cation is another example.  The rearrangement of 3,3-dimethyl-2-butyl cation to
form 2,3-dimethyl-2-butyl cation is an example of a <b>1,2-alkyl shift</b>. 
Frank Whitmore elucidated such a mechanism, and it was such occurrences in
chemistry that developed the carbonium ion theory to begin with.

<p>Carbonium ions may then:

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>eliminate an H<sup>+</sup> ion to form an alkene;
<li>rearrange to form a more stable carbonium ion.
</ol>

<h3>5.23 Orientation and reactivity in dehydration</h3>

<p>Notice that after the carbonium ion is formed, which H<sup>+</sup> ion on
either side of the carbonium ion is eliminated?  In general, since the more
highly substituted alkene is the more stable alkene, then the
H<sup>+</sup> forming the more stable alkene will be released.

<p>Note that the definition of <b>functional group</b> is the
atom or group of atoms which define the structure of a particular family of

<h3>6.2 Reactions of carbon-carbon double bond.  Addition</h3>

<p>The double bond has a strong <i>s</i> bond and a weaker &pi;bond.  Because of
the relative weakness of the bond, we expect it to be more reactive.  Double
bonds typically undergo <b>addition</b> reactions, unlike <i>substitution</i>
reactions seen with the free radical reaction of methane.  Electron-seeking
reagents like Lewis acids will react via <b>electrophilic addition</b>. 
<b>Free-radical addition</b> is also possible.  The alkyl groups of alkenes

<h3>6.3-6.4 Hydrogenation.  Heat of hydrogenation.

<p>The uncatalyzed reaction occurs hardly at all, since there
is a large E<sub>act</sub>. 
The catalyst is finely divided metal producing a large surface:  the alkene
molecule is thought to adsorb in a way which breaks the &pi; bond and
brought in contact with a coordinated and activated H<sub>2</sub> molecule. 
Note that the reverse reaction occurs and is used to dehydrogenate alkanes
(a higher temperature is required).

<p>The heat of hydrogenation is used as an indicator of double
bond stability.  Note that the hydrogenation of isomeric 2-butenes differ by 1
kcal/mol (<i>cis</i> 28 kcal; <i>trans</i> 27.6 kcal), meaning the <i>trans</i>
isomer is more stable than the <i>cis</i> by 1 kcal.  Compare other <i>cis</i>
and <i>trans</i> isomers.  Note also that disubstituted <i>trans</i> isomers
are more stable than the <i>cis</i> forms, presumably because of less crowding
and van der Waals strain.  Note that overall stability of alkenes demonstrated
by hydrogenation is of the same order for dehydrohalogenation and dehydration
(   5.14, 5.23).

<h3>6.5 Addition of halogens (X<sub>2</sub>)</h3>

<p>Cl<sub>2</sub> and Br<sub>2</sub> readily add to C=C to form vicinal
dihalides.  I<sub>2</sub> is unreactive usually.  The reaction is carried out by
mixing the alkene and halogens in an inert solvent (CCl<sub>4</sub>).  Room
temperature or less than RT, without UV light, is all that is necessary.  Indeed
higher temps or undue exposure of light may promote substitution reactions as
the halogen is made into a free radical.  The Br<sub>2</sub> addition is
diagnostic for alkenes, since the loss of its red color is a clue that C=C is
present.

<h3>6.6 Addition of HX.  Markovnikov's rule</h3>

<p>HCl, HBr, and HI can add to C=C to form an alkyl halide (RX).  Usual
conditions are to pass the dry HX gas directly into the alkene.  A moderately
polar solvent (acetic acid) to dissolve both the polar HX and nonpolar alkene
may be present.  Aqueous HX solutions are not used since H<sub>2</sub>O is
added.

<p>Orientation of addition is according to <b>Markovnikov's rule</b>: 
<i>In the ionic addition of an acid to the carbon-carbon double bond of an
alkene, the hydrogen of the acid attaches itself to the carbon atom that already
holds the greater number of hydrogens.</i>  (Russian chemist Vladimir
Markovnikov, 1869)

<p>Example show that the X adduct attaches to the 2&deg; carbon and H to the
1&deg;, X to the 3&deg; and H to the 1&deg;, and X to the 3&deg; and H to the
1&deg;.  In 2-pentene, equal quantities the two haloalkane isomers are produced
since Markovnikov's rule favors either addition about the double bond. 
Note that reactions that give exclusively or nearly exclusively one of several
possible isomeric products are called <b>regiospecific</b>.

<h3>6.7 Addition of HBr.  Peroxide effect</h3>

<p>While addition of HCl and HI follow Markovnikov's rule, the chemistry
of HBr was complex, since addition sometimes obeyed and at other times did not
obey the rule.  MS Kharasch and FR Mayo (1933) determined that anti-Markovnikov
addition of HBr was due to <b>peroxides</b>, present as impurities resulting
from slow formation by the action of O<sub>2</sub>.  If peroxide inhibitors
(hydroquinone, diphenylamine) are present, addition always follows Markovnikov. 
The peroxide effect is seen only with HBr addition, not with HX or Hbase.

<h3>6.8 Addition of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></h3>

<p>Mixing cold conc. sulfuric acid with alkene yields compounds of
ROSO<sub>3</sub>H, <b>alkyl hydrogen sulfates</b>.  Addition is according to
Markovnikov's rule.  Note that it is a C-O bond and not C-S bond.  The
reaction is simply bubbling a gaseous alkene into the acid, or stirring/shaking
liquid alkenes with acid.  The insoluble liquid alkenes mix into one phase as
the product is soluble in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.  Isolation of the product
is difficult, since they are deliquescent solids.

<p>If water is added to dilute and heat applied, an alcohol is obtained with OH
replacing the bisulfate group (a hydrolysis reaction).  This reaction is
therefore used in alcohol synthesis from alkenes.  Note that because alkenes
react with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, alkanes and alkyl halides (which are
insoluble in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) are purified by bubbling through (for
gases) or mixing (for liq. RH or RX) with sulfuric acid to remove alkene
impurities.

<h3>6.9 Addition of H<sub>2</sub>O.  Hydration</h3>

<p>As explained in the previous section, water in the presence of an acid
catalyst adds according to Markovnikov's rule.  Hydration is used
industrially to make simple alcohols from alkenes which are produced according
to rule.

<h3>6.10 Electrophilic addition.  Mechanism</h3>

<p>Like dehydration to form the alkenes, the mechanism of addition is the
reverse, with a carbonium ion intermediate.  In the first step, the difficult
and rate-limiting step, an acidic reagent (HCl, HBr, HI,
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) brings a H<sup>+</sup> 
in an <i>electrophilic</i> attack of the C=C bond.  It can be either a L-B or
Lewis acid.  The second step has a carbonium ion find an anionic base to
complete the octet and neutralize charge if possible (X<sup>&minus;</sup>,
HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O).  Since the alkene reacts
with acids (electrophiles), it can be considered to have a basic nature;  this
basicity comes from the loosely held &pi; electrons.

<h3>6.11 Electrophilic addition.  Orientation and reactivity</h3>

<p>As examples of orientation, addition of HCl to propylene always yields
isopropyl chloride and never <i>n-</i>propyl chloride, to isobutylene to make
tert-butyl chloride and never isobutyl chloride, and to 2-methyl-2-butene to
make tert-pentyl chloride (2-chloro-2-methylbutane) and never 2-methyl-3-
chlorobutane.  We see that this is all due to the stability of the incipient
carbonium, in which M's rule can be restated as <i>electrophilic addition
to a C=C bond involves intermediate formation of the more stable carbonium
ion.</i>  Since electron-releasing groups attached to either carbon of the
double bond help disperse the partially developing positive charge in the
transition state, a lower E<sub>act</sub> permits a faster reaction.  A progress
of reaction diagram can be drawn to show that E<sub>act</sub> is higher for
formation of the primary cation vs. E<sub>act</sub> of the 2&deg; cation.  Note
the relative reactivity of alkenes toward acids:

<p class="center">
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub> &gt;
CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CHCH<sub>3</sub>,
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH=CH<sub>2</sub>,
CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CH<sub>2</sub> &gt;
CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> &gt; CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCl

<p>Isobutylene will form a 3&deg; cation and should react much faster than 2-
butene which forms a 2&deg; cation.  1-Butene, 2-butene, and propylene should be
equal in reactivity because they will all form 2&deg; cations.  Ethylene forms a
1&deg; cation only and should be less reactive.  Chloroethylene (vinyl chloride)
should be even less reactive since the Cl is electron-withdrawing.

<h3>6.12 Electrophilic addition.  Rearrangement</h3>

<p>Since electrophilic addition involves carbonium ions, rearrangements as shown
in dehydration reactions to form the more stable carbonium are consistent with
C<sup>+</sup> chemistry.  1,2-alkyl shifts as in HCl addition to 3,3-dimethyl-1-
butene produce the 2-chloro-3,3- and 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane

<h3>6.13 Mechanism of X<sub>2</sub> addition</h3>

<p>The generally accepted mechanism is a two-step reaction, with (1) the rate-
limiting attachment of X to form a resultant carbonium and followed by the other
X (which is anionic) to form the vicinal dihalide.  The X<sub>2</sub> is
nonpolar, but when brought next to the electron-dense C=C bond, it is partially
polarized as a result of charge repulsion effects.  The X atom developing the
partial (&delta;+) positive charge becomes reactive to the C=C bond.

<p>Indeed the negative ion in the second step does not have to be
X<sup>&minus;</sup>.  It can be any base which is attracted by a carbonium ion. 
To illustrate, ethylene mixed with aqueous solutions of Br<sub>2</sub> and NaCl
form the dibromo as well as a bromochloro and bromoalcohol product.  Note that
aqueous NaCl alone is inert:  the Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> ion and water react only
when the X<sup>+</sup> form has added.  In the same way, alkene plus
X<sub>2</sub> in solutions of NaNO<sub>3</sub> or NaI can form multiple products
where X<sup>&minus;</sup>, I<sup>&minus;</sup>, or
NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> can add as the second adduct.

<h3>6.14 Halohydrin addition (X<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O)</h3>

<p>As shown above, when water is present to dilute the X<sub>2</sub> reaction in
the alkene, a <b>halohydrin</b> can form.  Note that the mechanism is by
addition of X<sub>2</sub> first, then water, and does not result from addition
of a preformed hypohalous acid (HOX) which may be present.

<h3>6.15 Addition of alkenes.  Dimerization</h3>

<p>Isobutylene can be converted in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 
or H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (at 80&deg;) to a mixture of 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-
pentene and 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene.  (Subsequent hydrogenation produces
<q>iso-octane,</q> 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.)  The product has twice the number of
isobutylene carbons, and is a <b>dimer</b> of the reactant.  Like many alkenes,
the reactant is activated with acid to produce a carbonium ion, but uses the C=C
bond as a base rather than other anions.  (Remember that the C=C bond serves
itself as a base.)  The carbonium attack another isobutylene to form another
more stable carbonium.  The new carbonium might very well add to another (third)
isobutylene, but instead it eliminates a proton to form the alkene (stopping at
8 carbons).  The H<sup>+</sup> is lost from either side to produce the isomeric
mixture.

<h3>6.16 Addition of alkanes.  Alkylation</h3>

<p>The iso-octane just described above is not made by the alkene
addition/catalytic hydrogenation reaction but instead made by mixing isobutylene
with isobutane in the presence of conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or HF at 0-
10&deg;.  This is alkane addition to an alkene.  The mechanism is as
follows:

<ol class="paren-ol">
<li> isobutylene + H<sup>+</sup>  &rarr; tert-butyl cation
<li> isobutylene + tert-butyl cation  &rarr; iso-octyl cation
<li> iso-octyl cation + isobutane  &rarr; iso-octane + tert-butyl cation
</ol>

<p>From this point, steps (2) and (3) repeat.  Note that step (1)
and (2) are the same as the alkene addition reaction above, but a third step
wherein the carbonium ion abstracts a hydride is observed.  Although alkanes
are not exactly basic in this way, the 3&deg; cation is relatively stable and can
give up the electrons and proton.  The hydride rearrangement is really similar
to a 1,2-hydride shift, execpt the transfer is <i>inter</i>molecular rather
than <i>intra</i>molecular.

<h3>6.17 Free-radical addition.  Mechanism of the peroxide-initiated addition
of HBr</h3>

<p>As shown by Kharasch and Mayo, peroxides cause addition of
HBr in anti-Markovnikov fashion.  The mechanism proposed is such that HBr add
as atoms rather than ions.  Peroxides form free-radicals which react with HBr
to produce RadH and Br.  The Br free radical reacts with the double bond to
form a C-Br bond on one and to make a free radical of the other C.  Another HBr
now reacts with this carbon free radical to abstract an H atom, leaving a Br
radical to continue the process in a cycle at step (3):

<ol class="paren-ol">
<li>peroxides  &rarr; Rad&bull;
<li>Rad&bull; + H:Br &rarr; Rad:H + Br&bull;
<li>Br&bull; + C=C  &rarr; C(-Br)&mdash;C&bull;
<li>C(-Br)&mdash;C&bull; + H:Br &rarr;  -C(-Br)&mdash;CH + Br&bull;
</ol>

<p>Chain-termination can result from two reactive particles
meeting or by capture in the wall of the vessel.  Since little peroxide is
necessary to alter the normal addition, the chain-reaction mechanism is
strongly supported.  Moreover, when little inhibitor is added, the addition
orientation is altered.  In addition to use of peroxides, UV light may be
substituted or any force which radicalizes H:Br.  Esr spectroscopy verifies the
existence of free radicals in this mechanism.

<p>Is it reasonable that free radical addition leads to
anti-Markovnikov addition while ionic addition does not?  Write the reaction of
propylene reacting with HBr in which radicals are induced and where addition is
ionic, drawing structures for the stable intermediates that could be formed and
determine those intermediates that would be formed.  Note the formation of the
more stable free radical or carbonium ion intermediates.

<h3>6.18 Other free-radical additions</h3>

<p>In addition to HBr, dozens of other reagents are known to
add to alkenes in the presence of peroxides or light. 
RCH=CH<sub>2</sub> + CCl<sub>4</sub> &rarr;
 RCHCl-CH<sub>2</sub>-CCl<sub>3</sub> in the presence
of peroxides is known, with its mechanism:

<ol class="paren-ol">
<li>peroxides  &rarr; Rad&bull;
<li>Rad&bull; + Cl:CCl<sub>3</sub> &rarr; Rad:Cl + &bull;CCl<sub>3</sub>
<li>&bull;CCl<sub>3</sub> + RCH=CH<sub>2</sub> &rarr;
RC&bull;H&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>-CCl<sub>3</sub>
<li>RC&bull;H&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>-CCl<sub>3</sub> &rarr;
RCHCl&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>-CCl<sub>3</sub> + &bull;CCl<sub>3</sub>
</ol>

<p>Then (3), (4), etc.

<p>Recent evidence shows that free radical mechanism are
commoner than has been suspected.  Light or decomposition of unstable compounds
like peroxides are not required for initiation; sometimes a change from a polar
solvent stabilizing ionic reactions to a nonpolar solvent can support concerted
homolytic reactions of the initiator.

<h3>6.19 Free-radical polymerization of alkenes</h3>

<p>Ethylene heated under pressure in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> can yield a
product of high MW (~20,000) which is a long alkane:  <i>polyethylene</i>.  The
reaction is an example of <b>polymerization</b>.

<p>It is more typical to see polymerization of substituted
ethylene compounds:  vinyl chloride is polymerized in the presence of peroxides
to make polyvinyl chloride plastic.  When plasticized with high-boiling esters,
the polymer is used in phonograph records, plastic pipe, raincoats, shower
curtains, etc.  Other substitutes (-COOCH<sub>3</sub>, -CN,
-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) to the double bond yield plastics with different
physical properties.  The chain-initiating and -propagating steps can be
outlined in three steps:  the first step is the initiating where a radical is
formed as usual.  The second step is one in which the radical combines with substituted
ethylene to form Rad-CH<sub>2</sub>-C&bull;HR. 
In the third step, this new ethylene radical combines
with another substituted oriented toward the primary carbon: 
Rad-CH<sub>2</sub>-C&bull;HR + CH<sub>2</sub>=CHR &rarr;
RadCH<sub>2</sub>-CHR-CH<sub>2</sub>-C&bull;HR,
and the process repeats at the second step.

<h3>6.20 Hydroxylation.  Glycol formation</h3>

<p>The C=C bond is subject to oxidizing influences which form
dihydroxy alcohols, or <b>glycols</b>.  There are numerous agents, but the two
most common are (a) cold alkaline KMnO <sub>4</sub> and (b) per(oxy)formic
acid, HCO<sub>2</sub>OH.

<p>Hydroxylation with KMnO<sub>4</sub> is done by stirring at room temperature
the aqueous permanganate at either neutral or, better, slightly alkaline
conditions with the alkene.  The reaction produces OH<sup>&minus;</sup>  to make
it alkaline anyway.  Heat and acid addition are avoided, otherwise oxidation of
the glycol continues with breaking the C=C bond.  Note hydroxylation with
KMnO<sub>4</sub>  is the basis of the Baeyer test for the analysis of
alkenes.

<p>Using the performic acid system, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and HCOOH are
mixed together for a few hours with the alkene, then the mixture is heated with
water to hydrolyze intermediates, and the glycol is formed.

<p>For the mechanism and stereochemistry of glycol formation,
see sec. 17.12

<h3>6.21 Substitution by halogen.  Allylic hydrogen</h3>

<p>Note that halogens (X<sub>2</sub>) can attack the higher alkenes in two
different ways:  at the double bond and at the alkyl substituent.  Conditions
are adjusted carefully to orient attack to one place or the other.  Since
substitution at the alkyl group is promoted by free radical mechanisms,
heat or light is added.  Addition reactions to the double bond are promoted
by low temps and the absence of light.

<p>Shell Develop. Co. chemists mixed propylene gas and chlorine
at 500-600&deg; and showed the formation of 3-chloro-1-propene
(allyl chloride; <b>allyl</b>
is CH<sub>2</sub>=CH&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>&mdash;).  Br<sub>2</sub> reacted
similarly.  At low temp. in a CCl<sub>4</sub> solution, the Cl<sub>2</sub> 
added to form propylene chloride.

<p>In previous sections, we also saw free radical<i> addition</i>
occur:  so why does not the free radical mechanism produced the addition
product?  HC Brown says that Cl radical <i>does</i> add to the double bond of
propylene (at the primary carbon) to form the free radical intermediate, but at
the higher temperatures, the X is expelled before it can react with an
X<sub>2</sub> to form the dihalide.  Consistent with this finding is that
use of a low halogen concentration makes X<sub>2</sub> unavailable for
addition reactions and favors formation of an allyl halide.  The allyl
radical has little option except to wait for another X<sub>2</sub> to
continue the reaction.  Notice too that the probability factor favors
the allyl radical.

<p><i>N-</i>bromosuccinimide (NBS) is used to promoting the
reaction of allylic bromides in free-radical mechanisms.  As a molecule of HBr
is formed during halogenation, it reacts with NBS to produce a molecule of
Br<sub>2</sub>.  In this way, Br<sub>2</sub> is kept in very
low concentrations to avoid possible additon reactions.

<h3>6.22 Orientation and reactivity in substitution</h3>

<p>When looking at substitution reactions, it can be noticed
that the H atoms attached to C=C bonds (vinylic hydrogen) are very hard to
abstract by free radicals.  At the same time the H atoms attached to alkyl
carbons <i>and adjacent to</i> C=C bonds (allylic hydrogens) are quite stable
to abstraction, more stable H atoms attached to 3&deg; carbons.  The
reactivity of these hydrogens can be listed now:

<p>Ease of abstraction of H atoms:   allylic &gt; 3&deg; &gt; 2&deg;
&gt; 1&deg; &gt; CH<sub>4</sub>, vinylic

<p>It is not impossible to react ethylene with Cl<sub>2</sub> under free
radical-promoting conditions to form vinyl chloride, but the reaction must be
under vigorous conditions.  The stability and ease of formation of the free
radical intermediate correlates with the ease of abstraction list above.  The
vinyl radical is as difficult to form as the methyl radical, and more difficult
to form than the 1&deg;, 2&deg;, 3&deg;, and allyl radical, in that order.

<h3>6.23 Resonance theory</h3>

<p>The reason that the allyl radical is more stable than even the 3&deg; radical
is <b>resonance</b>.  (a) <i>Whenever a molecule can be represented by two or
more structures that differ only in the arrangement of electrons&mdash;that is,
by structures that have the same arrangement of atomic nuclei&mdash;there is
<b>resonance</b></i>.  The actual molecule is a <b>hybrid</b> which cannot be
represented satisfactorily by another of the structures, but each structure may
be said to <b>contribute</b> to the hybrid.  (b) <i>When these contributing
structures are of about the same stability, that is, have about the same energy
content, then <b>resonance is important</b>. </i> (c) <i>The resonance hybrid is
more stable than any of the contributing structures.</i>  The increase in
stability is called the <b>resonance energy.</b>

<h3>6.24 Resonance structure of the allyl radical</h3>

<p>Hence the allyl radical is a resonance hybrid of the two
structures:  CH<sub>2</sub>=CH&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>&bull; and
&bull;CH<sub>2</sub>&mdash;CH=CH<sub>2</sub>.  Many analogies
are made about the hybrid.  The mule is neither a donkey part time nor a horse
part time, but a true hybrid, related to both animals.  Drawing the two
structures above does not imply that either has any existence; it is done
because of the limitation imposed upon drawing structures.  The odd electron is
<i>delocalized</i> among the three carbons involved in the allyl radical.

<h3>6.25 Stability of the allyl radical</h3>

<p>Note that the allyl radical is more stable than either of the 2 structures
used to represent it.  This extra stability is resonance energy.  The energy has
been determined to be the difference between the energy needed to form an <i>n-
</i>propyl radical
(CH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>&mdash;CH<sub>3</sub> &rarr;
CH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>&bull; + H&bull;,
&Delta;<i>H</i> = +98 kcal) and the allyl radical
(CH<sub>2</sub>=CH&mdash;CH<sub>3</sub>  &rarr;
CH<sub>2</sub>=CH&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>&bull; + H&bull;, &Delta;<i>H</i> = +88
kcal), which is a difference of 10 kcal/mol.

<h3>6.26 Orbital picture of the allyl radical</h3>

<p>Looking at the structure of the allyl radical more closely, it is apparent
that all carbons are bonded to three atoms, and all use
<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> orbitals.  All atoms are ideally arranged in a plane with
120&deg; bond angles.  Because of the <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridization, each
C must have a <i>p</i> orbital with lobes lying above and below the plane.  The
three &pi; bonding electrons are distributed in these three <i>p</i> orbitals,
so each <i>p</i> orbital may be said to hold a single electron in the hybrid. 
The resultant hybrid may be represented as a continuous &pi; bonding cloud over
all 3 carbons.  It is an inherent ability of the one pi bond to delocalize in a
way to distribute the energy of the radical.  Note that the methyl radical
(CH<sub>3</sub>&bull;) is not quite flat, somewhere between
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> and <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybrdization, as the odd
electron creates some slight repulsion of other bonding electrons;  in the allyl
radical, stability demands flatness to permit <i>p</i> orbital overlap.

<h3>6.27 Using the resonance theory</h3>
<p>
In determining stability of structures, there is a certain <b>reasonableness</b>
 that must be intuitive about the structure which seems to contribute to the 
greatest stability. Criteria that affect estimations of relative stability 
include (a) <i>electronegativity</i> and <i>location of charge</i>, in which we 
describe ionicity or bond polarity by drawing structures showing which atoms 
acquire which charge, and at the same time representing covalent bonds with no 
structures showing bond polarity. Other criteria seen in other sections: (b) <i>
number of bonds</i> (&sect;8.17); (c) <i>dispersal of charge</i> (&sect;11.19); 
(d) <i>complete vs. incomplete octet</i> (&sect;11.20); (e) <i>se</i>para<i>
tion of charge</i> (&sect;18.12).

<h3>6.28 Resonance stabilization of alkyl radicals.  Hyperconjugation</h3>

<p>In a small way, alkyl radicals (not allyl radicals)
stabilize radicals in general.  Delocalization occurs by an overlap between the
<i>p</i> orbital containing the odd electron and a &sigma; bond orbital in
the alkyl group (see diag.)

<p class="center">
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/image030.png"
alt="delocalization of single electron in free radical by hyperconjugation">

<p>
This kind of delocation involving the s bond orbital is called <b>
hyperconjugation.</b> In describing the resonance structures of the ethyl
radical, there are 3 structures in which the C-H bond in the s bond orbital is
something less than a single bond, and the C-C bond has some double bond
character. Since it takes 98 kcal to generate the ethyl radical vs. 104 kcal to
generate methyl radicals, which can not possibly show this resonance, the
stabilization resulting from hyperconjugation is thought to be 6 kcal/mol. With
the propyl radical, 6 hyperconjugation structures instead of 3 in the ethyl may
be drawn, and since forming the radical requires 95 kcal, it is 9 kcal more
stable than the methyl radical (giving some evidence of hyperconjugation). And
with the tert-butyl radical, 9 hyperconjugation structures are possible,
correlating with its 91 kcal energy of formation, a 13 kcal resonance
stabilization.

<h3>6.29 Ozonolysis.  Determination of structure by degradation</h3>
<p>

The first example of a <b>cleavage</b> reaction, in which the C=C bond is
completely broken and the carbon skeleton separated into two smaller molecules.
Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is the classical reagent. It is a two-stage reaction,
with addition of ozone to form the <i>ozonide</i>, then a hydrolytic reaction.
The ozone gas is passed into a solution of the alkene (using an inert solvent
like CCl<sub>4</sub>). The solvent is evaporated, with a viscous oil residue
being the ozonide. The product is unstable and explosive, and water is added
directly to form the final products, aldehydes and ketones. Usually a reducing
agent (zinc dust) is added to prevent formation of hydrogen peroxide, which
reacts with the final products. An aldehyde forms if one of the double-bonded
carbons has RHC= or H<sub>2</sub>C= structure (formaldehyde, in the latter case)
, and a ketone for a doubly substituted structure, R<sub>2</sub>C=.

<p>Ozonolysis is a degradative method used in analyzing for the presence and
structure of alkenes.  Recall that KMnO<sub>4</sub> modifies the C=C bond to
form glycols, but oxidation may continue with cleaving of the C-C bond to
produce carboxylic acids rather than aldehydes;  the ketone is formed from the
disubstituted double-bonded carbon.

<h3>6.30 Analysis of alkenes</h3>

<p>In analyzing any unknown compound, a test should be selected
that is easy and gives useful information rapidly.  For determination of
alkenes, of the many reactions it undergoes, it is rather useless to use HX
addition or catalytic hydrogenation:  in the former, a colorless HX gas
produces colorless products, and while hydrogenation might be determined by a
change in the pressure of H<sub>2</sub>, preparation of the catalyst and
apparatus is rather elaborate.  In general the kind of test to select is
one that is convenient, rapid, and produces an easily observed change: 
done in minutes using a few test tubes, in which a color may appear or
disappear, or gas bubbles are evolved, or a precipitate forms or dissolves.

<p>For alkenes, reaction with red-colored Br<sub>2</sub> in CCl<sub>4</sub> 
is quite reliable, as the color disappears as the alkyl dibromide is formed. 
However, Br<sub>2</sub> may react with other types of organic compounds,
e.g., alkynes.  (If the Br<sub>2</sub> was undergoing
substitution rather than addition, blowing over the tube should cause a cloud
to form, indicating the presence of expected HBr.)

<p>The <b>Baeyer test</b>, in which cold, dilute, neutral purple-colored
KMnO<sub>4</sub> reacts to form a brown ppt. of MnO<sub>2</sub>.  It should be
kept in mind, however, that alkynes, aldehydes, and other easily oxidizable
compounds will also react.  If reaction does occur with both tests, at least
alkanes, RX, and ROH compounds can be ruled out.  Another useful test is an
alkenes solubility in cold concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> as it forms
the hydrogen sulfate.

<h2>Chap. 7 Stereochemistry.  Preparation and reactions of stereoisomers</h2>

<h3>7.1 Stereoisomerism</h3>

<p>The classes of stereoisomers are (a) <i>configurational
isomers</i>, interconverted by inversion about the chiral center; (b) <i>geometric
isomers</i>, interconverted, in principle, by rotation about a double bond; (c)
<i>conformational isomers</i>, interconverted by rotation about single bonds. 
The latter class does not require any bond breaking or significantly high
energy.

<h3>7.2 Reactions involving stereoisomers</h3>

<p>Reactions can both <i>form</i> and <i>consume</i>
stereoisomers, or just <i>involve</i> them.  An achiral molecule can form into
a chiral one with generation of a chiral center.  Chiral molecules can be
involved in reactions which take part away from the/a chiral center (none of
its bonds are broken); this can be used to relate compounds to each other. 
Reactions of chiral molecules with non-reacting chiral centers can generate
a second chiral center.  Chiral compounds can react with optically active
agents.  In
the next sections, reactions of chiral compounds in which a bond to the chiral
center is broken are seen; and so are reactions of an achiral compound in which
two chiral centers are generated at the same time.

<h3>7.3 Generation of a chiral center.  Synthesis and optical activity</h3>

<p>Chlorination of <i>n</i>-butane (an achiral molecule) can
produce <i>sec</i>-butyl chloride (chiral) and <i>n</i>-butyl chloride
(achiral) (see  4.16 on the configuration and optical activity of sec-butyl
bromide).  Although chiral products are formed, the product solution does not
rotate polarized light, since it is racemic.  The mechanism shows that the
<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized free-radical intermediate can be attacked
from either side by Cl<sub>2</sub> molecule, so half the product is one
configuration and half is the other.  Note the rule:  <b>synthesis
of chiral compounds from achiral reactants always yields the racemic
modification</b>.

<h3>7.4-7.5 Reactions of chiral molecules.  Bond breaking.  Relating
configurations</h3>

<p>If sec-butyl chloride undergoes further free radical
chlorination, it can yield a number of dichlorobutane isomers, among them
1,2-dichlorobutane.  In 1,2-dichlorobutane, no bond on the chiral carbon was
broken, and drawing a stereochemically set of structures showing the
free-radical chlorination, we see that the absolute configuration has been
retained.  Although the designation of the product is now (R)-1,2-dichlorobutane
from (S)-sec-butyl chloride, this new designation is only a naming rule and has
nothing to say about whether chirality is altered until both structures are
drawn.

<p>When Bijvoet had used x-ray diffraction to report the
absolute configuration of (+)-tartaric acid in 1949, the configurations about
the chiral centers of all other compounds which could be chemically related to
(+)-tartartic acid became immediately known so long as the chemistry did not
involve breaking of chiral carbon bonds.  It was therefore not necessary to do
diffraction studies on all organic compounds.  (&mdash;)-2-methyl-1-butanol is
an enantiomer in fusel oil with the stereochemical structure in the diagram,
and its configuration is S.  The alcohol is treated with HCl to obtain
1-chloro-2-methylbutane.  The product rotates light in the other direction.

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image031.png"
alt="changes in optical rotation in reactions does not always mean that chirality is lost
   reactions of 2-methyl-1-butanol with HCl and potassium permanganate">

<p>If the butanol compound is oxidized with permanganate, an
acid forms which rotates light to the right; no chiral bonds are broken, so
configuration is retained.

<p>Not all reactions which are well established for many
compounds perform as expected.  If a reaction is thought not to affect a chiral
center, it is better to be careful and include a reaction in which the chiral
center is most certainly going to be broken, and to analyze the results.  We
know the configuration of (&mdash;)-2-methyl-1-butanol because it came from
(+)-tartartic acid.  Note that all the products have the S-designation of
configuration is coincidental.

<h3>7.6 Optical purity</h3>

<p>One interesting feature of working with strictly chiral
molecules is that only one enantiomer is present (true of compounds from
biological sources); the compound is said to be <b>optically pure</b> and the
specific rotation value can be obtained.  For 2-methyl-1-butanol, [&alpha;] =
&mdash;5.756&deg;, while for 1-chloro-2-methylbutane, [&alpha;] = +1.64&deg;,
which are the <i>maximum rotations</i> of these optically pure
compounds.  If a sample of the chloride shows a rotation of +0.82&deg;,
which is 50% of the maximum, the reagent is said to be 50% optically pure.

<h3>7.7 Reactions of chiral molecules.  Generation of 2nd chiral center</h3>

<p>Considering another product of chlorination of sec-butyl chloride, 2,3-
dichlorobutane is one.  The compound itself can exist as 3 possible
stereoisomers, two of which are enantiomers and one <i>meso</i> structure.  But
if sec-butyl chloride is reacted with chlorine with attack at carbon-3, either
one of two products will result as Cl<sub>2</sub> attacks either side of C-3,
although both generate a new chiral center.  The (S,S) and the <i>meso</i> (R,S)
isomer will form as diastereomers.  <i>But they will not be formed in equal
amounts</i>, as might be expected.  An optically active reactant yields an
optically active product containing unequal amounts of diastereomes.

<p>The actual product ratio of the diastereomers is 29:71
(S,S):<i>meso</i>.  If the (R)-sec-butyl chloride had been chlorinated, the
products would be (R,R-) and <i>meso</i> and would also have a 29:71
(R,R):<i>meso</i> ratio.  Whatever favors meso over (S,S) favor meso also
over (R,R) to the same
degree.  And if racemic (R)- and (S)-<i>sec</i>-butyl chloride is chlorinated,
the <i>meso</i> quantity over the sum of (R,R) and (S,S), which are obtained in
equal amounts, is 71:29;  optically inactive reactants always yield optically
inactive products.

<p>The reason for unequal amounts of stereoisomers is because the reactant
itself is <q>unequal</q> in its aspect of attack by Cl<sub>2</sub>, with a
chiral carbon.  [<i>This part added by me</i>:  If the free radical intermediate
is arranged as the most stable conformer, with an eclipsed or slightly staggered
conformation in which the methyl group on C-2 aligns with the H atom on C-3 and
to some degree opposite the methyl and bulky chlorine atom on C-3, 
Cl<sub>2</sub> attack on the <i>b </i>face is more likely since there may be a
slight steric effect of the Cl atom as opposed to the methyl group.  But this is
not absolutely known.]

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image032.png"
alt="generation of a second chiral center in a free radical reaction">

<h3>7.8 Formation of enantiomers and diastereomers:  a closer look</h3>

<p>In the previous section, the formation of unequal amounts of
the diastereomers was shown.  If one considers merely the chlorination of
sec-butyl radical (which is achiral), conformations that can be assumed are of
equal stability or energy, and are therefore equally abundant (see Newman
projections).

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image033.png"
alt="formation of chiral and achiral molecules:  enantiomers and diastereomers">

<p>Since equal conformers are likely, the chlorine molecule attack ought to be
equal.  With the 3-chloro-2-butyl radical, however, one conformer ought to be
favored over the other (the structure on the left being a more stable conformer
energetically), hence the diastereomers are formed in unequal amounts.  Note
that attack from the bottom by Cl<sub>2</sub> for the structure on the left is
more reasonable as Cl<sub>2</sub> tries to steer clear of the Cl atom in
formation of the transition state.  The attack by Cl<sub>2</sub> is clearly a
more difficult (and slower) step than the ability of the radical to assume a new
conformation by bond rotation;  the radical has an opportunity to assume
relative populations of conformers prior to attack.

<h3>7.9 Reactions of chiral molecules with optically active reagents. 
Resolution</h3>

<p>Optically inactive reactants which form chiral compounds
must form a racemic mixture of them.  Except for the rotation of polarized
light, the enantiomeric products have identical physical properties.  Optically
active compounds can be easily obtained in nature.  From these other such
compounds can be made.  <b>Resolution</b>, or separation of the enantiomers,
into optically pure compounds can be done, usually by reactions with optically
pure substances.  A racemic acid (&plusmn;)-HA can be reacted with an optically
pure plant alkaloid (basic substance), say a levorotatory one (&mdash;)-B, to
produce two kinds of salts:  [(&mdash;)-BH<sup>+</sup> (+)-A<sup>&minus;</sup>]
and [(&mdash;)-BH<sup>+</sup> (&mdash;)-A<sup>&minus;</sup>].  These
new salt products are themselves not superimposable and are not mirror images,
so they must be diastereomers.  Diastereomers have different physical
properties, and it is true of the salts; their different solubilities in
solvents can be used to separate them.  Once separated, strong mineral acid can
be used to recover HA.  Several crystallization steps may be necessary to
recover optically pure HA.  The alkaloids typically used in this process
include (&mdash;)-brucine, (&mdash;)-quinine, (&mdash;)-strychnine,
and (+)-cinchonine.

<p>Resolution of organic bases is done using optically active
acids, e.g., (&mdash;)-malic acid.  With alcohols, neither appreciably
acidic or basic, one attaches an acidic <q>handle,</q> which allows the
formation of a salt which can then be resolved.  Hence <b>a racemic
modification is converted by an optically active reagent into a mixture of
diastereomers which can then be separated.</b>

<h3>7.10 Reactions of chiral molecules.  Mechanism of free-radical chlorination</h3>

<p>What about reactions in which a bond of the chiral carbon <i>is</i>
broken?  Consider halogenation of alkanes.  Until 1940 either of two mechanisms
were considered possible for the chain-propagating second and third steps:

<div style="margin-left:2em;">
(2a) X  + RH  &rarr; HX + R <br>
(3a) R  + X<sub>2</sub>  &rarr;  RX + X 

<p>or

<p>
(2b) X  + RH  &rarr; RX + H <br>
(3b) H  + X<sub>2</sub> &rarr; HX + X 
</div>

<p>The work of H.C. Brown, M.S. Kharasch, and T.H. Chao then
halogenated photochemically the optically active
(<i>S</i>)-(+)-1-chloro-2-methylbutane
and, among the possible products, isolated the isomer in which the chiral C-2
carbon was chlorinated, 1,2-dichloro-2-methylbutane.  Since the two mechanisms
above differed in the fact that an alkyl radical was intermediate rather than
an H atom, if the alkyl radical were intermediate, it would assume a flat
structure as a radical and would lose its chirality in the sense that
racemization of the product would occur (lose optical activity).  By mechanism
2b and 3b, back-side substitution would be likely, with no loss of optical
activity.  The result showed that the 1,2-dichloro-2-methylbutane isomer was
optically inactive, and the racemic modification was inferred.  This
substantiated the mechanism of 2a and 3a.

<h3>7.11 Stereoselective and stereospecific reactions. 
<i>syn</i>- and <i>anti</i>-addition</h3>

<p>Looking at addition of Br<sub>2</sub> to 2-butene to form 2,3-dibromobutane,
two chiral centers are formed, and from this knowledge, three isomers: 
a <i>meso</i> compound and a pair of enantiomers are possible.  The reactant
can exist as a geometric isomer, either <i>cis</i>- or <i>trans</i>-2-butene. 
In fact, when <i>cis</i>-2-butene
is the reactant, <i>only</i> racemic 2,3-dibromobutane is obtained and
<b>none</b> of the <i>meso</i> compound.  <i>A reaction that yields
predominantly one stereoisomer (or one pair of enantiomers) of several
diastereomeric possibilities is called a</i> <b>stereoselective
reaction.</b>

<p>When <i>trans</i>-2-butene is the reactant, only the
<i>meso</i>-2,3-dibromobutane is obtained.  <i>A reaction in which
stereochemically different reactants give stereochemically different
products is called a</i> <b>stereospecific reaction.</b>

<p>The addition of Br<sub>2</sub> is both stereoselective and stereospecific: 
it is <i>completely</i> stereoselective because only one diastereomer
(or pair of enantiomers) is obtained from one alkene, and it is
stereospecific because the stereoisomeric product depends upon
which stereoisomeric reactant is used.  <i>Stereochemically
different</i> really means <i>diastereomerically different</i>, and the
term <i>stereospecific</i> does not apply to reactions of enantiomers
to produce enantiomeric products (as in   7.4 and 7.5).  While all
stereospecific reactions are stereoselective,
not all stereoselective reactions are stereospecific.  In some cases a
particular stereoisomer is the predominant product <i>regardless</i> of the
stereochemistry of the reactant; and reactions of reactants which are not
stereoisomers can form predominantly a stereoisomeric product.  Such reactions
are stereoselective but not stereospecific.

<p>The stereospecificity of addition reactions to alkenes can be described as
either <i>syn</i>- or <i>anti</i>-addition.  These are not mechanisms, but names
for a stereochemically reactive process  in which reagents add to the same or
opposite face.  All bromine additions are in fact <i>anti</i>-addition.  Draw
the structure of cis- and trans-2-butene and show how the anti-addition yields
racemic enantiomers for the <i>cis</i>- reactant, and the <i>meso</i> product
for the <i>trans</i>-reactant.  The <i>anti</i>-addition process is the general

<h3>7.12 Mechanism of halogen addition</h3>

<p>The mechanism of how anti-addition might occur is illustrated

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image034.png"
alt="mechanism of single carbonium intermediate in
dibromination of cis-2-butene to make 2S,3S-dibromobutane">

<p>Note that an intermediate carbonium ion is formed, which has a flat geometry
consistent with an <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridization.  The appearance of the
trigonal complex upon immediate ion formation is consistent with the cis-
structure.  The bromonium adds from the top, while the bromide ion will add to
the opposite side.  A problem with this mechanism is that rotation about the
carbon-carbon bond in the cation is possible, and this would allow formation of
isomeric products, inconsistent with what is known.  It would be necessary to
assume that bromide ion (a) attacks before bond rotation can occur and (b) from
the bottom face from halogen already in the in the cation.

<p>I Roberts and G.E. Kimball (1937) proposed a different
mechanism.  They suggested the formation of a cyclic bromonium complex which
would hinder bond rotation in the intermediate cation, and permit attack by
bromide on either carbon to yield the actual isomeric products.

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image035.png"
alt="mechanism of more delocalized carbonium intermediate in
dibromination of cis-2-butene to make 2S,3S-dibromobutane">

<p>The illustration shows this cyclic bromonium ion, which takes upon itself the
positive charge, but the charge is dispersed by electron releasing groups to
stabilize the transition state.  If the proposed mechanism is followed with the
trans-2-butene reactant, only the meso compound can be formed upon attack by
bromide from the <i>anti</i>- side.

<p>Evidence of such a mechanism has been shown by Olah (1967)
where cationic salts were prepared in which a cyclic halonium ion would be
stabilized:  2-methyl-2-fluoro-3-bromobutane
[(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CF-CHBr-CH<sub>3</sub>] was treated with SbF<sub>5</sub> in liq. SO<sub>2</sub> to form the stabilized cyclic bromonium
as SbF<sub>5</sub> abstracted
the F atom: <img src="imagesOChemHTML/image036.png"
alt="stabilizing cyclic brominium with antimonious hexafluoride ion">.  In
view of the high electronegativity of the halogens, there appears to be a
greater need of the carbon to complete its octet.  In the mechanism above, at
least every atom has an octet.

<p>There are exceptions to cyclic halonium ions.  If the alkene
has substituents which can strongly stabilize an open carbonium ion, as for the
benzyl cation ( 12.19), addition can occur with little or no
stereospecificity.  Carbon gets its electrons, but in a different way.

<h2>Chap. 8 Alkynes and dienes</h2>

<h3>8.1-8.2 Intro and acetylene structure.  Carbon-carbon triple bond</h3>

<p>Both alkynes and dienes have the general structure
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>-2</sub>.  The simplest alkyne is
<b>acetylene</b>.  The hybrid orbitals are <i>sp</i>, forming &sigma; bonds of
all atoms with each other.  The bond angle is 180&deg;, permitting the orbitals
to be as far apart as possible.  The other two <i>p</i> orbitals of each C atom
take one electron, and form a &pi; bonding pair with the electrons of the other
C.  The lobes of the two <i>p</i> orbitals are oriented perpendicularly to form
a pi electron cloud torus, which joins with the torical cloud of the other
carbon to form a cylindrical pi electron sheath around the sigma bonding linear
arrangement.  The carbon-carbon triple bond is one strong &sigma; bond with two
weaker &pi;bonds to give a total 198 kcal strength (Cf. the double bond of
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> at 163 kcal and single bond of
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> at 88 kcal.)

<p>This quantum mechanical prediction is verified physically by electron
diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and spectroscopy.  The C&equiv;C bond is 1.21
&Aring; long compared to 1.34 &Aring; for ethylene and 1.53 &Aring;  for
ethane.  Evidence of isomer number also shows that no geometric isomerism should
be possible, and no such isomers have ever been found.  The C-H bond distance is
1.08 &Aring; compared to 1.103 &Aring; in ethylene.  Again, the more s character
gives a smaller radial geometry to <i>sp</i> orbitals, hence the bonds are
shorter.  The C-H bond energy is unknown, but expected to be stronger than the
C-H bond in ethylene.  Free radical (homolytic) dissociations are quite
difficult in acetylene, whereas ionic (heterolytic) dissociation is easy
( 8.10).

<h3>8.4-8.5 Physical properties. Industrial sources</h3>

<p>The nomenclature of alkynes follows the same rules for the
alkenes insofar as assigning the number of the longest continuous carbon
skeleton based upon location of the multiple bond.

<p>Alkynes are of generally low polarity like alkanes and alkenes;  insoluble in
water;  very soluble in ligroin, ether, benzene, and CCl<sub>4</sub>.  B.p.
values increase systematically with carbon number, decreasing with branching;
the values are very nearly the same as b.p. values of alkanes and alkenes with
the same C skeleton.

<p>Acetylene is prepared commercially by combining water with calcium carbide,
CaC<sub>2</sub>, which itself is obtained by reaction of CaO (limestone) with
coke (from coal) at very high temperatures (2000&deg;) in an electric furnace. 
Hence from water, limestone, and coal we can get acetylene.  An alternative is
the mild oxidation of methane from petroleum:  6 CH<sub>4</sub> +
O<sub>2</sub> (@ 1500&deg;)  2 HCCH + 2 CO + 10 H<sub>2</sub>.  (This process is
cost-effective since the side products can be used to produce alcohols, and the
H<sub>2</sub> itself can be used to maintain the oxidizing temperature.) 
Liquefied under pressure in acetone into tanks, it is used in oxyacetylene torch
welding.

</ol>

<p>Dehydrohalogenation of alkyl dihalides really amounts to
synthesis of an alkyne from the corresponding alkene.  The <b>vinyl halides</b>
obtained after the first dehydrohalogenation are quite unreactive even to the
strong base of alcoholic KOH, hence it is necessary to use a much stronger base
(NaNH<sub>2</sub>).

<p>In order to make larger alkynes, reaction of sodium acetylides with primary
alkyl halides is usual.  2&deg; and 3&deg; RX reagents undergo side reactions
such as elimination (see  8.12).

<p>Dehalogenation of tetrahalides is severely limiting because
these products are usually synthesized from alkynes.  As with the halogenation
of double bonds to protect them from reaction during synthesis, triple bonds
are similarly protected by halogenation.

<h3>8.8 Addition reactions of alkynes</h3>

<p>Addition reactions for alkynes are similar for alkenes,
except double addition can occur as a result of the reaction going to
completion.  Addition can be limited to first stage addition, helped by the
fact that the vinyl dihalide is less reactive than the normal alkene.

<h3>8.9 Reduction to alkenes</h3>

<p>Reduction to the alkene product is possible, with the <i>trans</i>-alkene
typically formed by reaction with Na or Li in liquid ammonia.  As much as 98% of
the <i>cis</i>-alkene can be obtained by reaction with H<sub>2</sub> gas using
<i>Lindlar's catalyst</i>, which is specially prepared palladium; or with
nickel-boride, called <i>P-2 catalyst</i> (by H.C. Brown and son C. A Brown). 
Each reaction is highly stereoselective:  while the <i>cis</i>-type reduction is
presumed to occur by surface interactions on the catalyst, the mechanism of the
<i>trans</i>-style reduction is not known.

<h3>8.10 Acidity of alkynes.  Very weak acids</h3>

<p>In the Lowry-Bronsted sense, an acid is one with a tendency to lose a
H<sup>+</sup> ion.  Appreciable acidity is shown in substances in which H atoms
are bonded to a very electronegative atom (N, O, S, X).  The bond is covalent,
but quite polar.  Since the series of electronegativity is F &gt; O &gt; N &gt;
C, this correlates with the observation that HF is a strong acid, H<sub>2</sub>O
comparatively weak, NH<sub>3</sub> still weaker, and CH<sub>4</sub> is not even
acidic.

<p>Alkynyl carbons behave quite unusually, as if more electronegative than a
carbon with only double or single bonds.  The acetylide hydrogen is therefore
quite acidic:  Na metal reacts to form a salt of Na acetylide and
H<sub>2</sub> gas.  NH<sub>3</sub> also reacts with Na to produce sodamide
(NaNH<sub>2</sub>).  When NaNH<sub>2</sub> (a stronger base than acetylene) is
now reacted with acetylene (a stronger acid than sodamide), is produced Na
acetylide and ammonia.  Quite the contrary, Na acetylide is a stronger base than
water, so acetylene is regenerated in H<sub>2</sub>O with NaOH as the other
product.

<p>Acidity:  H<sub>2</sub>O &gt; HCCH &gt; NH<sub>3</sub>

<p>Basicity: NaNH<sub>3</sub> &gt; HCC:<sup>&minus;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> &gt;
NaOH

<p>Compare ethane and acetylene as acids.  For this, consider them as anionic
bases.  The ethide ion (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>) has the
nonbonding pair in an <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> orbital, while acetylide supports
them in an <i>sp</i>-hybrid state.  The availability of an electron pair for
bonding to H<sup>+</sup> may depend upon how <q>tightly</q> the electrons are
held.  The <i>p</i> orbital geometry is lobular and extended from the nucleus,
while the <i>s</i> orbital is spherical and held closely to the nucleus.  Since
acetylide has greater <i>s</i> character, is might be assumed that it holds the
electrons away from the H<sup>+</sup> ion, making it therefore more acidic.

<h3>8.11 Formation of heavy metal acetylides</h3>

<p><i>Terminal alkynes</i>, i.e., alkynes with at least one H
atom bonded to one of the triple-bonded carbons (therefore acidic alkynes),
react with particular heavy metal ions, chiefly Ag<sup>+</sup> and
Cu<sup>+</sup>, to form insoluble acetylides.  If terminal alkynes are
added to AgNO<sub>3</sub> in alcohol, a precipitate forms.  Non-terminal
alkynes, i.e., disubstituted acetylenes, do not react.  If allowed to dry,
these heavy metal acetylides can explode, so it is important to regenerate
the terminal alkyne by warming it with strong mineral acid
(HNO<sub>3</sub>).

<h3>8.12 Reaction of Na acetylides with RX.  Substitution vs. elimination</h3>

<p>Sodium acetylides react with primary alkyl halides to produce a higher number
alkyne (and the sodium halide).  The reaction is a back-side
<i>substitution</i>, as the strongly basic acetylide (RCC:<sup>&minus;</sup>)
displaces the halide.  It is important to use a 1&deg; RX compound in the
reaction, since this favors substitution.  An unwanted side reaction can be
<i>elimination</i> of the RX to form an alkene typical of dehydrohalogenation by
alcoholic KOH; since the acetylide is an even stronger base than hydroxide, the
side reaction is likely as carbonium ion stability increases.  On the other
hand, with 1&deg; RX, there is a greater competition for substitution rather
than elimination.

<h3>8.13 Hydration of alkynes.  Tautomerism</h3>

<p>Acid-catalyzed addition of H<sub>2</sub>O to acetylene is an important
commercial synthesis for acetaldehyde.  The resulting vinyl alcohol is
only an
intermediate, an <b>enol</b>, which rearranges its bonds to form the more
stable carbonyl structure.  This is an example of <b>keto-enol tautomerism</b>. 
The equilibrium favors the keto structure.  A <b>tautomer</b> is a structure
which exists in equilibrium with other structures which all differ in the arrangement
of their atoms.  In all forms of tautomerism, the equilibrium favors the weaker
acid, namely H bonded to carbon rather than the more electronegative atom
oxygen.

<h3>8.14 Structure and nomenclature of dienes</h3>

<p>Dienes are simply alkenes with two C=C bonds.  Their chemical properties
differ from alkenes with one C=C bond if they are <b>conjugated</b>, in which
the double bonds alternate with a single bond (C=C&mdash;C=C), or whether they
are <b>isolated</b>, in which the double bonds are separated by more than a
single bond (C=C-...-C=C).  A logical third class are the cumulated double bonds
(C=C=C), or <b>allenes</b>.

<h3>8.15 Preparation and properties of dienes</h3>

<p>The simplest <i>conjugated</i> diene is <b>1,3-butadiene</b>, used to make
synthetic rubber and obtained industrially by cracking (of <i>n</i>-butane,
which forms the isomeric butenes, then 1,3-butadiene) and in Germany by the
warmed, acid-catalyzed dehydration of 1,4-butanediol.  The C=C bonds in isolated
dienes act as if they were the only C=C bond in the molecule and exert little
effect on each other.  Conjugated dienes like 1,3-butadiene differ from simple
alkenes in that (a) they are more stable, (b) they undergo <i>1,4-addition</i>,
and (c) they are more reactive toward free radical substitution.

<h3>8.16 Stability of conjugated dienes</h3>

<p>Recall that hydrogenation of monosubstituted alkenes (RCH=CH<sub>2</sub>) is
~30 kcal/mol; for disubstituted (R<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub> or RCH=CHR), 28
kcal/mol; and for trisubstituted (R<sub>2</sub>C=CHR), 27 kcal/mol.  With
compounds of &gt;1 double bond, an expectation of the sum of energies for
individual double bonds is verified:  the non-conjugated 1,4-pentadiene and 1,5-
hexadiene are very close to 2 &times; 30 kcal, or 60 kcal.  However, with
conjugated dienes, whereas the 1,3-butadiene is expected to be 30 + 30 = 60
kcal, the observed value is 57 kcal;  for 1,3-pentadiene, it is expected to be
28 + 30 = 58, but the observed is 54 kcal (note the C3-C4 double bond qualifies
as disubstituted); and for 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, the expected is 28 +28 =
56, with an observed 54 kcal.

<p>Looking at it more closely, the
1,3- and 1,4-pentadienes will produce the same product, <i>n-</i>pentane, when
fully saturated, but the 1,3-pentadiene evolves less energy:  this can only
mean that it contains less potential energy, i.e., the conjugated diene must be
more stable.

<h3>8.17 Resonance in conjugated dienes</h3>

<p>There are four key carbon atoms in the conjugated diene system:  C1 and C2
are double-bonded, as are C3 and C4.  The C2-C3 bond is single.  As observed for
stabilization of the allyl radical, the geometric positioning of the atoms in
the structure is such that all atoms of within the conjugated diene system lie
flat in a plane to each other, with the <i>p</i> orbitals of each carbon
involved in &pi; bonding overlapping each other certainly between C1 and C2, and
C3 and C4, but also to some extent between C2 and C3.  This is in effect a
delocalization of charge effect, with each pair of electrons attracting and
attracted by not just two, but four carbon nuclei.  The bonds between C1 and C2,
and C3 and C4 have less than double-bond character, and the C2-C3 bond has more
than single bond character.

<p>Consistent with hypothesis, the more stabilized C2-C3 bond
in 1,3-butadiene is 1.48 &Aring; long cf. to 1.53 &Aring; for a single bond. 
Note the stabilization is only 2-3 kcal/mol, whereas the allyl radical is
near 10 kcal/mol.

<h3>8.18 Resonance in alkenes.  Hyperconjugation</h3>

<p>The phenomenon of <i>hyperconjugation</i> discussed previously ( 6.28) which
accounts for an increased stabilization (lower potential energy) of alkyl
substituted vs. non-substituted alkenes.  Propylene has a heat of hydrogenation
2.7 kcal/mol less than ethylene, so it is said to be stabilized by 2.7 kcal. 
The theory is that pi electrons in <i>p</i> orbitals can overlap with the sigma
(<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybrid) orbitals of the attached alkyl group, and thereby
become delocalized.  A sort of resonance structure in which no bond joins one C-
H functions can be represented to show such effect.

<h3>8.19 Stability of dienes and alkenes:  an alternative interpretation</h3>

<p>M.J.S. Dewar has argued for another explanation of diene and
alkene stability.  He maintains that there is a progressive decrease in bond
lengths for both C-H and C-C bonds.  It is generally observed that just
shortening the bond length results in greater bond energies.  In this sense, it
is not hyperconjugation but rather sigma bond length shortening that is at
work.

<p>This does not dismiss &pi; bond delocalization occurrences that may result
from hyperconjugation, but it is one factor contributing to greater
stabilizaiton.

<h3>8.20 Electrophilic addition to conjugated dienes.  1,4-Addition</h3>

<p>When 1,4-pentadiene is brominated under conditions favoring the dihalide, the
product 4,5-dibromo-1-pentene is formed as expected.  Further bromination
produces the tetrabromopentane.  Isolated dienes generally behave as simple
alkenes.

<p>Bromination of 1,3-butadiene, however produces not only the expected
3,4-dibromo-1-butene, but 1,4-dibromo-<i>2</i>-butene.  When treated with HCl not
only 3-chloro-1-butene, but 1-chloro-2-butene results.  And catalytic
hydrogenation yields not only 1-butene but also 2-butene.  Hence the expected
<b>1,2-addition</b> is not only occurring, but also <b>1,4-addition.</b>  The
major product is usu. the 1,4-addition product.

<h3>8.21 Allyl cations.  Delocalization in carbonium ions</h3>

<p>From   6.10 and 6.11, electrophilic addition was observed as a 2-step
process, with the first and most difficult step the formation of the most stable
carbonium ion intermediate.  If HCl is added to 2,4-hexadiene, both the
4-chloro-2-hexene and a 2-chloro-3-hexene product are formed.  In the first case,
the H<sup>+</sup> adds carbon #2 to form a carbonium at carbon #3.  Although
addition of H<sup>+</sup> to carbon #3 with formation of carbocation at carbon
#2 could occur (both are secondary cations), formation of the ion at C3 is not
just a 2&deg; cation, but an <i>allyl</i> cation!  Recall the stability of the
allyl free radical, with the use of resonance structures to disperse the high
energy of maintaining an odd electron.  The same is true of the positive
charge.

<p>Since the 3 carbons disperse the charge and are equivalent,
anionic attack occurs at either end of the resonance hybrid to yield a 1,2 or
1,4 product.  The ionization potential of the allyl free radical (188 kcal)
shows that the allyl cation is relatively stable, about 24 kcal more stable
than an ethyl cation, and just about as stable as an isopropyl cation.

<p><b>Stability of carbonium ions:</b>  3&deg; &gt; allyl, 2&deg; &gt;
1&deg; &gt; CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>

<h3>8.22 1,2- vs. 1,4-Addition.  Rate vs. equilibrium</h3>

<p>The proportion of either 1,2- or 1,4-addition products largely depends upon 
reaction conditions.  At low temp (&mdash;80&deg;),  20% of the product is 1,4-
addition and 80% is the 1,2-addition.  At higher temp (40&deg;), the mixture is 
opposite:  80% is the 1,4-product and 20% is the 1,2-product.  If the products 
made at low temperature are heated, the larger amount of 1,4-product is seen.  
This shows that the products are in equilibrium with each other, and since 
equilibrium favors the 1,4-product, it must be more stable.

<p>Since 1,2-product is obtained in greater amounts at low temperature, it can 
be said to be formed <i>faster</i> than 1,4-product.  Hence the low temperature 
reactions indicate differences in the <b>rates</b> of addition, while the higher 
temperature addition is based upon an <b>equilibrium</b> of the two.

<p>Drawing a reaction progress diagram of the addition of HBr to 1,3-butadiene,
we can say that the 1,4-addition has a higher E<sub>act</sub>, overcome with use
of higher temperature conditions, and that the bottom of the product hill is
lower for 1,4-product than 1,2-product.


<p class="center"><img  src="imagesOChemHTML/image042.png"
alt="Energy vs reaction progress for two reactions:  a 1,2 and 1,4 addition">

<p>We really don't know <i>why</i> the 1,2-product forms faster, and 
<i>why</i> the 1,4-product is more stable; only that there is a mechanism which 
explains their formation.  In general we have assumed that the faster a reaction 
occurs, the more stable it is.  Here we have an exception.

<h3>8.23 Free-radical addition to conjugated dienes:  orientation</h3>

<p>Like all alkenes, dienes undergo <i>free-radical</i> as well
as <i>ionic</i> addition.  But unlike ordinary alkenes, they undergo
1,4-addition and are more reactive.  The difference in both <i>orientation</i>
and <i>reactivity</i> is accounted for.

<p>Recalling that peroxide can break down to form a radical (step 1), then react 
with BrCCl<sub>3</sub> to form Rad-Br + CCl<sub>3</sub> radical (step 2), the 
CCl<sub>3</sub> radical will then add to the butadiene (step 3).  Addition is to 
the end as is true for the ionic addition, since a resonance-stabilized allyl 
free radical will be the result.  In step 4, the butadienyl radical reacts with 
BrCCl<sub>3</sub> in a chain-propagating step.

<h3>8.24 Free-radical addition to conjugated dienes:  reactivity</h3>

<p>If BrCCl<sub>3</sub> is added to a 50:50 mixture of 1-octene and 
1,3-butadiene, addition occurs virtually exclusively to the diene.  This suggests 
that CCl<sub>3</sub> radical reacts more quickly with the butadiene.  Looking at 
the progress reaction diagram, we see that <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> is higher for 
formation of the alkyl radical in the simple alkene than for the diene, 
accounting for a greater stabilization of the transition state.  However, the 
allyl free radical is much more stable, and we might expect a slower addition.  
But in general rates are governed by the stabilization of the transition state, 
namely <i>E</i><sub>act</sub>, and not on the stability of the reactant or its 
intermediate necessarily.

<h3>8.25 Free-radical polymerization of dienes.  Rubber and rubber substitutes</h3>

<p>Conjugated dienes undergo polymerization just like ethylene
and its substituted forms.  A radical adds to 1,3-butadiene, and its C4 reacts
with another butadiene and on down the line.  What is different is that each
added monomer leaves a C=C bond.  Natural rubber (<i>cis</i>-polyisoprene) is a
polymer similar to synthetic polydienes.  It is a polymer of
2-methyl-1,3-butadiene.  The C=C bond in rubber gives it reactive allylic
hydrogens, and such rubber can undergo <b>vulcanization</b> when sulfur is
heated or reacted with catalysts to form bridges in the rubber.  Such
cross-linking makes the rubber harder and stronger.

<p>2-chloro-1,3-butadiene (chloroprene) can be polymerized to
form polychloroprene  (Neoprene, Duprene), a rubber substitute.  It is inferior
to rubber in some properties, but superior in its resistance to oil, gas, and
other organic solvents.  Polyisoprene has been made by the free radical
polymerization, but it is not the same as natural rubber, since its double
bonds are <i>trans</i> in geometry instead of <i>cis.</i>

<h3>8.26 Isoprene and isoprene rule</h3>

<p>Nature makes extensive use of isoprene to form <i>terpenes</i>, usu. found as
plant oils.  Vitamin A, citronellol (in oil of geranium), and &gamma;-terpinene
(in coriander oil) are all formed from isopentenyl pyrophosphate, with the
elimination of the pyrophosphate providing the energy to form the dienes.

<h3>8.27 Analysis of alkynes and dienes</h3>

<p>Alkynes and dienes react similarly with alkenes.  Br<sub>2</sub> is
decolorized (without HBr evolution);  cold, neutral, dilute permanganate loses
color.  CrO<sub>3</sub> fails to oxidize.  Since they are more unsaturated,
detection can be established by molecular formula determination and by
quantitative hydrogenation.  With alkynes, ozonolysis yields RCOOH however,
while alkenes yield aldehydes and ketones.  Ozonolysis of dienes can produce
bifunctional carbonyl compounds.  Terminal alkynes react with heavy metals to
produce insolube metal acetylides

<p>The naming for substitutions on
the ring and multiple bonds are done so that the lowest combination of numbers
are used.  Aliphatic rings are generally represented by geometric figures:  the
degree of saturation is understood where multiple bonds are placed.

<p><i>Polycyclic</i> structures are named in a special way.  <i>Norbonane</i>
is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane:  (a) <i>heptane</i>, because it has 7 carbon atoms;
(b) <i>bicyclo</i>, because it has two rings, i.e., the breaking of 2 C-C bonds
converts it to an open chain; (c) [2.2.1], because that is the number of
carbons between bridgeheads (two: C2 and C3; two: C5 and C6; one: C7).

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image043.png"
alt="structures of several interesting polycyclic alkanes">

<p>Note the ultimate aliphatic polycyclic is <i>diamond</i>, one of the
allotropic forms of elemental carbon (not a hydrocarbon).  Each C atom in
diamond is attached to four others by tetrahedron with usual single bond length,
1.54 A.

<h3>9.3 Industrial source</h3>

<p>Previously mentioned in  3.13 was that California petroleum is rich in
napthenes, or cycloalkanes, inc. cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane,
methylcyclopentane, and 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane.  Methylcyclohexane can be
dehydrogenated to toluene at high pressures and temps (300 psi, 560&deg;) in
presence of a Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst. 
Aromatic compounds can likewise be hydrogenated to cycloalkanes:  benzene with
Ni catalyst between 150-250&deg; at 25 atm is converted to cyclohexane, and
phenol to cyclohexanol.

<h3>9.4 Preparation</h3>

<p>Cycloalkane preparation occurs in two steps:  (1) conversion of an open-chain
into one which has a ring (<i>cyclization</i>); (2) conversion of the cyclic
compound into one that we want, such as conversion of a cyclic alcohol to a
cyclic alkene, or an cyc alkene to a cyc alkane.

<p>Recall that larger alkanes can be made from two RX compounds using the
lithium dialkylcopper reaction.  In the same fashion, a dihalide (XR&mdash;RX)
is brought together to form the cyclic compound.  For 1,3-dichloropropane, Zn +
NaI does the job of forming the cyclopropane.

<h3>9.5 Reactions</h3>

<p>Like alkanes, cycloalkanes under free radical substitution with
Cl<sub>2</sub> and Br<sub>2</sub> (heat- or light-assisted.  Like alkenes,
cycloalkenes addition reactions, both electrophilic and free radical type.  They
are also sensitive to cleavage (O<sub>3</sub>), forming dicarbonyls, and allylic
substitution reactions.

<h3>9.6 Reactions of small-ring compounds.  Cyclopropane and cyclobutane</h3>

<p>Cyclopropane and cyclobutane are somewhat special alkanes in
that they undergo addition reactions as do alkenes.  The addition products
destroy the ring structure, being the open chain products.

<table style="margin:2em auto;" class="no-background">

</table>

<p>Note that in each reaction, the C-C bond is broken and addition is such that
the atoms appear on the ends of the chain.  Cyclopropane is actually less
reactive to addition than propylene:  for example, chlorination requires a Lewis
acid catalyst.  The reaction with sulfuric acid and other aqueous protic acids
is faster for cyclopropane than propylene however.  Stranger still is that
Br<sub>2</sub> + FeBr<sub>3</sub> produces a grand mixture of bromopropanes. 
Cyclobutane is much less reactive to addition than cyclopropane, requiring
vigorous conditions for hydrogenation as an example.

<h3>9.7 Baeyer strain theory</h3>

<p>Adolf von Baeyer (1885) proposed a theory explaining the small-ring
cycloalkane reaction.  Carbon bonding to 4 atoms has a tetrahedral geometry with
109.5&deg; bond angles.  With cyclopropane, the C-C bond is forced to be
60&deg;, with cyclobutane 90&deg;.  These deviations from normal tetrahedral
bond angle cause a <q>strain,</q> making the bonds unstable.  Ring-opening is a
stabilizing reaction, with the greater strain making the molecule more
unstable.  Cyclopropane opens its ring more readily than cyclobutane, for that
reason.

<p>A regular pentagon has angles of 108&deg; and being close to the tetrahedral
angle, cyclopentane should be free of angle strain.  A regular hexagon has
120&deg; angle, so Baeyer thought cyclohexane should have somewhat of a strain. 
As the carbon number of the ring increased, so should the bond angles, and so
should the angle strain.  Hence, rings smaller or larger than cyclopentane or
cyclohexane would be considerably unstable because of this strain, according to
Baeyer.

<h3>9.8 Heats of combustion and relative stabilities of cycloalkanes</h3>

<p>Heats of combustion furnish information about the relative stabilities of
compounds.  The table below shows the heat of combustion relative to each
methylene group.  For open-chain alkanes, each -CH<sub>2</sub>- contributes
about 157.4 kcal/mol.  For cyclopropane, it is nearly 9 kcal higher than for the
open-chain value; for cyclobutane, 7 kcal.  If cyclopropane and cyclobutane
<i>evolve</i> more energy, that must mean they <i>contain</i> more energy. 
Baeyer's theory is supported in this instance.

<table style="margin:2em auto;">

<p>With an increase in ring size, the same higher energy should be observed
according to Baeyer.  However, this is not observed.  One of the biggest
deviations is in fact observed for cyclopentane, Baeyer's <q>most
stable</q> compound.  The problem with Baeyer's theory is that he assumed
the molecules were <i>flat</i>.  Cyclohexane and higher rings are, in fact,
puckered so that carbon can assume its normal tetrahedral bond angle.

<p>Three-membered rings must be flat, since 3 points defines a plane.  A four-
membered ring need not be planar, but puckering would increase the angle
strain.  A five-membered ring does not need to be planar, but planarity allows
it to assume the 109.5&deg; angle.

<p>One of the reasons that led Baeyer to propose larger rings are unstable is
that they are harder to synthesize.  But the assumption failed to consider that
the larger the ring to be synthesized, the longer must be the chain for which
the two ends are to react.  This reduces the likelihood of bringing them
together easily (intramolecular reaction) and makes more likely the encounter
with a different chain (intermolecular reaction).  (For this reason, formation
of large rings is done with highly dilute conditions to favor the intramolecular
process.)

<h3>9.9 Orbital picture of angle strain</h3>

<p>In alkanes, <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybridization favors the tetrahedral
bond angle.  Bond strength is reflected in the orbital overlap that occurs
between bonding atoms.  The C-C-C bond angle is ideally 109.5&deg; for the maximal
overlap.  When the C-C-C bond is forced to be 60&deg;, there is less bond overlap,
and the C-C bond should be weaker.

<p>Coulson and Moffit have used quantum mechanics to propose <i>bent bonds</i>,
an idea supported by electron density studies from x-ray diffraction data.  In
this, carbon uses <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> orbitals for C-H bonding (being short
and strong), and orbitals with enhanced <i>p</i> character (viz.,
<i>sp</i><sup>4</sup> to <i>sp</i><sup>5</sup>) for the C-C bonds.  This unusual
chemistry may explain why C-C bond orbitals can overlap orbitals on adjacent
atoms, or how they provide a site for the attack by acids in ring opening.

<h3>9.10 Factors affecting stability of conformations</h3>

<p>Any bond angle that deviates from the109.5&deg; tetrahedral angle in
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized AOs is subject to <b>angle strain</b>.  The
bonds to atoms of the two C atoms tend to be in staggered conformations to
prevent <b>torsional strain</b>.  Moreover, atoms not bonded to one another can
affect one another by either their size or polarity, either with repulsion or
attraction, depending upon how closely they are brought next to each other. 
When nonbonded atoms (or groups) just teach each other, they attract each other;
if brought closer repulsion occurs, such crowding representing <b>van der
Waals</b> or <b>steric</b> strain.  Nonbonded atoms or groups take positions
favorable to their <b>dipole-dipole interaction</b>, minimizing repulsions and
maximizing attractions; a hydrogen bond represents one such interaction.

<h3>9.11 Conformation of cycloalkanes</h3>

<p>Looking at the conformations of cycloalkanes, a model free of angle strain,
such as cyclohexane, is the best model.  The <b>chair</b> form shows perfectly
staggered bonds.  It is free of both angle and torsional strain, and is the most
stable conformer, with an energy minimum.  If all of the bonds in cyclohexane
are now eclipsed to show the <b>boat</b> conformer, the torsional strain is now
significant.  The <q>flagpole</q> hydrogens are now only 1.83 &Aring; apart,
closer than the sum of their van der Waal radii (2.5 &Aring;).  The boat
conformer is calculated to be 7.1 kcal/mol less stable than the chair.  It
represents an energy maximum, and is thus considered to be a transition state
between two conformers.  The two conformers that that lie on either side of the
boat are said to <q>twist</q> so that C3 and C6 go down and C2 and C5 come up. 
Hydrogens attached to C1 and C4 move apart diagonally, while hydrogens on C3 and
C6 move together.  This removes some torsional strain and constructs new
flagpole hydrogens which represent an energy minimum.  This is the <b>twist-
boat</b> and lies at an energy minimum 5.5 kcal above the chair conformer.  The
equilibrium between the chair and twist-boat form is 10,000:1 chair:twist-
boat.

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image044.png"
alt="various conformational structures of cyclohexane and
the potential energy diagram of these conformations">

<p>If cyclohexane is a perfect model of conformational stability, cyclopentane
must be the poorest, for in the flat cyclopentane, every bond is eclipsed. 
Because of the torsional strain, there is in fact a slight puckering, even with
increased angle strain.  Because of the torsional strain, cyclobutane may also
be puckered at the cost of some angle strain.  Rings with 7-12 carbons also
undergo some torsional strain, mostly because of serious crowding of hydrogen;
they are less stable than cyclohexane.  As rings become larger, they become as
stable as cyclohexane.

<h3>9.12 Equatorial and axial bonds in cyclohexane</h3>

<p>The C-H bonds can be described as <b>axial</b> or <b>equatorial</b>. 
Cyclohexane is free of angle, torsional, and van der Waal strain.  The H atoms
on adjacent carbons are the same distance apart (2.3 &Aring;) as in staggered
ethane.  If a hydrogen is replaced by a large atom or group, crowding occurs
among the atoms held by the three axial bonds on the same side of the molecule;
the effect is called <b>1,3-diaxial interaction.</b>  Except for H atoms, any
atom or group has more room in an equatorial position than an axial position. 
When considering methylcyclohexane, first consider the methyl group rather than
the H atoms, since it is subject to crowding.  Decide if an axial or equatorial
position is better;  the equatorial is stable by about 1.8 kcal, since the
methyl group points away from the hydrogens more than in an axial position. 
This means the 1,3-diaxial interaction between one methyl and one hydrogen is
about 0.9 kcal, which is the energy of the <i>gauche</i> interaction in n-
butane; it also accounts for energy differences in cyclohexanes containing more
than 1 methyl group.  The Newman projection for gauche conformer of <i>n-
</i>butane looks very much like the Newman projection for the chair conformation
of cyclohexane as well.  If the methyl group of cyclohexane is in the equatorial
position, it looks very much like it is in the <i>anti</i>-conformation of
<i>n</i>-butane.

<h3>9.13 Stereoisomerism of cyclic compounds.  <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-isomers</h3>

<p>Cyclopentanediol can exist as a <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-1,2-
cyclopentanediol.  Neither can be superimposed upon one another, so both are
isomers, in fact, stereoisomers since they differ only in the way the atoms are
arranged in space.  (No amount of bond rotation can make them the same, so they
are <i>not</i> conformational isomers.)  They are in fact diastereomers, since
they are not mirror images of each other.  If we put other functional groups
just the same, the rule of this isomerism would not change.

<p>Looking more closely, both the <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-glycols
(diols) have two chiral centers.  For the <i>trans</i>-glycol, there are in
fact two possible isomers which are not superimposable but are mirror images: 
they are enantiomers; the <i>trans</i>-glycol is a chiral structure, with resolvable
structures with optical activity.  For the <i>cis</i>-glycol, its mirror image
is superimposable, and thus it qualifies as a <i>meso</i> structure.

<h3>9.14 Stereoisomerism of cyclic compounds.  Conformational analysis</h3>

<p>The 1,2-dimethylcyclohexanes also have <i>trans</i>- and <i>cis</i>-1,2
structures.  If the <i>trans</i>-1,2 structure staggers the bonds on every
other carbon in the ring (the chair conformation), two conformers show that the
methyl groups can be diaxial or diequatorial.  Although the methyl groups are
on opposite sides of one another in the diaxial position, it is the
diequatorial position which is the more stable, because 1,3-diaxial interaction
is significant with large groups in the axial position.

<p>With <i>cis</i>-1,2-dimethycyclohexane, a methyl group must always be axially
located if the chair conformation is to be assumed.  Because of this, the
<i>trans</i>-1,2 structure (in the chair, with both methyl groups equatorial) is
more stable than the <i>cis</i>-structure.  Note the methyl groups in equatorial
position of the <i>trans</i>-structure are the same distance apart as the axial-
equatorial methyl groups in the <i>cis</i>-structure:  this shows that there is
no repulsion specific between the -CH<sub>3</sub> groups, but 1,3-diaxial
interaction is the cause.

<p>How much more stable is the <i>trans</i>-isomer?  In the <i>cis</i>-1,2
structure, one axial methyl means two 1,3-diaxial interactions; moreover, there
is a butane-<i>gauche</i> interaction between methyl groups.  If there is 0.9
kcal for each 1,3-diaxial and the butane-gauche interaction, the total is 2.7
kcal higher than cyclohexane.  For the <i>trans</i>-isomer, there are no
1,3-diaxial interactions, but there is a butane-gauche interaction.  Hence, the
<i>trans</i>-isomer should by about 1.8 kcal/mol more stable.  The measure value
is 1.87 kcal.

<p>In general, the largest substituent in the ring system will
call the shots, occupying a more favorable equatorial position, and causing
other substituents to order themselves in reference to it.

<p>Looking at the chirality of the <i>trans</i>-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane
isomer, the mirror image of one stereoisomer is not superimposable, nor a
rotational isomer, so they are enantiomers.  With the <i>cis</i>-1,2 structure,
they are not superimposable, but they are rotational isomers; they would not
resolve, except possibly at low temperatures (when rotation would be precluded).

<h3>9.15 Carbenes.  Methylene</h3>

<p>CH<sub>2</sub> is more than just a building block for increasing the
homologous series of alkanes, it is an actual molecule.  Its chemistry is the
chemistry of <b>carbenes</b>.  It is produced by photolysis of
<i>diazomethane</i> (CH<sub>2</sub>=N=N) or <i>ketene</i> (CH<sub>2</sub>=C=O)
with UV light, the products being CH<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> and
CH<sub>2</sub> + CO, resp.  (The reactants as well as CO and N<sub>2</sub> are
isoelectronic).  Spectroscopy in 1959 confirmed the existence of methylene, in
two different states.  There is a <b>singlet</b> state, in which the carbon atom
has four electrons, one each forming a bond with the two H atoms, and a
<i>paired</i> set of nonbonding electrons;  its H-C-H bond angle is 103&deg;
with C-H bond length of 1.12 &Aring;.  There is also a <b>triplet</b> state, in
which the two of carbons electrons pair with the H atom electrons to form a
bond, and the other two occupy nonbonding orbitals as <i>unpaired</i>
electrons;  this is a essentially a diradical, and the H-C-H bond is 180&deg;,
with C-H bond length of 1.03 &Aring;.

<p>The singlet state is the least stable, but is the first form generated by
photolysis.  Its longevity depends upon experimental conditions.  In a liquid
phase, singlet methylene will react rapidly with solvent molecules before losing
energy.  In a gas phase, esp. in the presence of inert gas like N<sub>2</sub> or
Ar, singlet CH<sub>2</sub> loses energy by collisions and is converted to
triplet CH<sub>2</sub>, which eventually reacts.

<p>If CH<sub>2</sub> generated in presence of alkenes, it reacts with the C=C
bond to form cyclopropanes.  This addition reaction is the most important
reaction of CH<sub>2</sub>.  Photolysis of diazomethane in liquid cis-2-butene
produces only <i>cis</i>-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane; with trans-2-butene, only the
trans product.  Addition is therefore stereospecific and <i>syn</i>.  If
photolysis is done in gaseous 2-butene&mdash;either cis or trans&mdash;the
products are both cis and trans isomers; in this case addition is non-
stereospecific.  The interpretation is that singlet CH<sub>2</sub> is electron-
deficient in one orbital entirely and reacts simultaneously with both carbons,
although the symmetry of reaction is not expected to be perfect (but faster than
C-C bond rotation).  With triplet methylene, it is much like a free radical
addition, with an intermediate diradical lasting long enough to permit bond
rotation.

<p>Another reaction unique to methylene and no other can be classified
as <b>insertion</b>, in which the CH<sub>2</sub> molecule literally
inserts itself between a C-H bond.  Insertion is usually an annoying
side reaction where addition is desired.

<h3>9.16 Substituted carbenes.  &alpha;-Elimination</h3>

<p>If 2-butene is treated with chloroform in the presence of
potassium tert-butoxide, the products are
3,3-dichloro-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane, tert-butanol, and KCl.  The
dichlorocyclopropanes obtained can be reduced to hydrocarbons, or hydrolyzed to
ketones.

<p>The mechanism proceeds via a carbene intermediate.

<ol class="paren-ol">
<li> <i>tert</i>-BuO:<sup>&minus;</sup> + H:CCl<sub>3</sub>
&hArr; :CCl<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> + <i>tert</i>-BuOH
<li> :CCl<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>  &rarr; :CCl<sub>2</sub> +
 Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>
<li> CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CHCH<sub>3</sub> + :CCl<sub>2</sub> 
 &rarr; 3,3-dichloro-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane
</ol>

<p>In step (2), <i>dichlorocarbene</i> is formed as a result of the strong base
removing a proton from chloroform.  The halogen presence apparently stabilizes a
singlet state carbon (so stable, that insertion is not evident), and addition to
the C=C bond is <i>syn</i> and stereospecific for this reason.  Recall that a
strong base abstracts a proton from the carbon adjacent to a C-X group,
resulting in a dehydrohalogenation when the X group leads; this is an example of
b-elimination.  If the proton is removed from the carbon to which the X group is
bonded, and the X group leaves, this amounts to &alpha;-elimination.  Steps (1)
and (2) demonstrate &alpha;-elimination.

<p>The Simmons-Smith reaction is a carbenoid type reaction:  a modified
methylene function is reacted with alkene to produce a cyclopropane.  But the
modified methylene is not CH<sub>2</sub> itself.  CH<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> is
reacted with Zn(Cu) amalgam to form the organozinc, ICH<sub>2</sub>ZnI, which is
then added to the alkene sterespecifically.

<h3>9.17 Analysis of alicyclic hydrocarbons</h3>

<p>Cyclopropane dissolves well in concentrated sulfuric acid, and resembles
alkenes and alkynes.  It can be distinguished in that it does not react with
cold, dilute, neutral permanganate.  Other cycloalkanes are like their open-
chain counterparts insofar as inertness;  unsaturated cyclo compounds ought
react with Br<sub>2</sub> in CCl<sub>4</sub> or KMnO<sub>4</sub>.  Molecular
formula determination and degradation products ought to show it is a cyclic
compound.  Ozonolysis or hot permanganate ought to produce single products of
cleavage with <i>two</i> functional groups.

<h2>Chap. 10 Benzene.  Aromatic character</h2>

<h3>10.1 Aliphatic and aromatic compounds</h3>

<p>Up to this point, aliphatic (<q>fatty</q>) compounds
have been studied.  Now the aromatic (<q>fragant</q>) compounds are
considered.  Aliphatics usu. undergo addition or free radical substitution. 
The aromatics on the other hand, will be seen to undergo ionic substitution.

<h3>10.2-.3 Benzene structure.  Molecular formula.  Isomer number.  Kekul 
structure</h3>

<p>Benzene was first known in 1825;  its chemical and physical properties are
better known than any single organic compound.  Its structure was not
satisfactorily known until 1931, and then not generally used until much
later.

<p>Benzene has the molecular formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.  Elemental
composition and MW studies easily verified this.  In 1858, August Kekule
proposed the ring structure now known to be the true structure (I).  Other
structures were proposed however.


<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image045.png"
alt="various structures hypothesized for benzene">

<p>One of the reasons Kekule's structure was largely accepted is because
of the number of isomers of products (isomer number).  Benzene produces only one
monosubstitution product of any substituent.  There is only one
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Br,  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl, etc.  This alone
places a severe limitation on benzene's structure:  all hydrogens must be
equivalent in order that substitution give a single product.  Structure V is now
rejected, since it would yield two monobromo isomeric products.  Similar
reasoning rejects structures II and III.

<p>With disubstitution products, there are only <i>three</i> possible isomers. 
Three and only three dibromobenzene isomers have ever been made.  This now
eliminates structure IV because it can make at least 12 dibromo derivatives and
maybe more.

<p>In drawing the 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-dibromobenzene structure
using structure I, it seems possible that there could possibly exist more than
3 dibromo derivatives, because the double bonds in the ring would have make
more than three such isomers possible.  Kekule accounted for this fact by
saying that the double bonds could rearrange into an alternating structure,
which was in equilibrium with the other.  This <q>alternation</q> of
bonds was later thought to be tautomerism.

<h3>10.4 Stability of benzene ring.  Reactions of benzene</h3>

<p>In seeing Kekule's structure as cyclohexatriene instead of benzene, it
ought to react like any other alkene, except that it is a <i>tri</i>ene. 
However, whereas cyclohexene reacts by rapidly oxidizing in cold, dilute,
aqueous KMnO<sub>4</sub>, benzene does not react.  Whereas
Br<sub>2</sub>/CCl<sub>4</sub> in the dark, and HI produce the expected addition
reactions with cyclohexene, benzene does not react.  Whereas H<sub>2</sub> and
Ni cause rapid hydrogenation at room temp. and low press., there is only slow
hydrogenation of benzene which requires high temperature and pressure (100-
200&deg;, 1500 psi).

<p>The reactions of benzene are all <b>substitution</b>
reactions.

<p>(1) Nitration.  Benzene + HNO<sub>3</sub> (+H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
&rarr; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

<p>(2) Sulfonation.  Benzene + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (+SO<sub>3</sub>)
&rarr; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H + H<sub>2</sub>O

<p>(3) Halogenation.  Benzene + X<sub>2</sub> (+Fe) &rarr;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>X + HX  (X<sub>2</sub>=Cl<sub>2</sub>,
Br<sub>2</sub>)

<p>(4) Friedel-Crafts alkylation.   Benzene + RCl (+AlCl<sub>3</sub>) &rarr;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>R + HCl

<p>(5) Friedel-Crafts acylation.   Benzene + RCOCl (+AlCl<sub>3</sub>)
&rarr; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COR + HCl

<h3>10.5 Stability of benzene ring.  Heats of hydrogenation and combustion</h3>

<p>Since addition would destroy the ring structure of conjugated double bonds,
substitution is the expression of a resistance against this attempt to alter the
ring.  Looking at both the heats of hydrogenation and of combustion for benzene,
the values are lower than would be expected.  A consistent 28-30 kcal/mol was
found for the heat of hydrogenation of double bonds:  cyclohexene has a 28.6
kcal heat of hydrogenation, while cyclohexadiene has about twice that at 55.4
kcal.  Predictions would indicate that cyclohexatriene would have a 85.8 kcal,
but the value is actually 49.8 kcal (36 kcal less).  The lower energy must mean
it is stable by that amount, even more stable than cyclohexadiene.  The heat of
combustion produces the same value.

<h3>10.6 Carbon-carbon bond lengths in benzene</h3>

<p>Another fact is that the C-C bonds are all equal in length, with a length
intermediate between single and double bonds.  C=C double bonds in many
compounds have an average 1.34 &Aring; length, while C-C single bonds are
typically longer:  1.53 &Aring; in ethane, 1.50 &Aring; in propylene, 1.48
&Aring; in 1,3-butadiene.  If benzene had only 3 single and 3 double bonds as in
Kekule's structure, it would be expected that there would be 3 short bonds
corresponding to double bonds, and 3 longer bonds.  X-ray diffraction shows them
all to be equivalent, with a 1.39 &Aring; bond length.

<h3>10.7-.9 Benzene resonance structures.  Orbital picture of benzene. 
Representation of ring</h3>

<p>Kekule's structures meet the conditions of resonance: 
structures that differ only in the arrangement of electrons.  Because they show
resonance, they should also have an added stability, which they do (by 36
kcal).  With six identical bond lengths, all of them between a single and
double bond in length, the properties of benzene are now in order.  Addition
reactions would actually convert benzene into a less stable structure;  the
first stage of hydrogenation actually requires 5.6 kcal to change to the less
stable cyclohexadiene.

<p>The quantum mechanical picture show that with carbon in benzene bound to
three atoms, an <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrid structure is presumed.  Because it
applies to all carbons, and <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridization dictates flat
structures with 120&deg; bond angles, the entire benzene molecule must be flat,
with all C and H atoms in one plane.  All backbone bonds are of the &sigma;
type.  Six electrons do not participate in &sigma; bonding however; they
distribute themselves in <i>p</i> orbitals which lie above and below the plane. 
Overlap of the <i>p</i> orbital lobes between carbon nuclei permits &pi;
bonding.  In fact all electrons are delocalized in a circular way throughout the
ring.  It is the <i>p</i> electrons which give benzene and aromatic compounds
their reactivity toward electrophilic (acidic) agents, but which preserves its
ring structure by allowing substitution instead of addition.  X-ray and electron
diffraction show benzene to be flat with the expected bond angles, and with a C-
C bond length of 1.39 &Aring; and a C-H bond length of 1.10 &Aring;.  

<h3>10.10 Aromatic character.  The H ckel 4<i>n</i>+2 rule</h3>

<p>Aromatic compounds are those that resemble benzene.  But
there is actually a better definition.  A certain degree of unsaturation is
expected, but the unsaturated compound should be ready for substitution rather
than addition reactions.  Low heats of hydrogenation and combustion should be
found relative to a less unsaturated compound.  Like benzene, an aromatic
should have a cyclic cloud of delocalized pi electrons above and below the
plane of the molecule.  In addition, there should be a total of 4<i>n</i>+2
electrons.

<p> As proof, benzene has 6 &pi; electrons; (<i>n</i>=1 in Huckel's
rule).  Cyclopentadienyl cation has 4 &pi;electrons, cyclopentadienyl radical
has 5, and cyclopentadienyl anion has 6.  The last one is aromatic.  For
cycloheptatriene, its cation has 6 pi electrons and is aromatic (it is also
called <i>tropylium</i>), while the radical and anion have 7 and 8 pi electrons,
resp., and are not aromatic.  For these molecules, five or seven equivalent
structures (as hybrids) can be drawn, with the charge or odd electron on each
carbon.

<p>Cyclopentadiene is a very strong acid for a hydrocarbon
(<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> = 10<sup>&minus;15</sup>; compare cycloheptatriene with
K<sub>a</sub> = 10<sup>&minus;45</sup>).  <i>Ferrocene</i> has the structure
[(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sup>&minus;</sup>]<sub>2</sub>Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and
is a <q>sandwich</q> of two flat rings coordinated with the rings concentrically
to an iron atom.  The C-C bonds are all 1.4 A, and the rings undergo aromatic
substitution such as sulfonation and the F-C reactions.

<p>Of all the cycloheptatriene derivatives, the cation is the
most unusual.  Tropylium bromide (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>7</sub>Br)
melts above 200&deg;, is soluble in water but not at all in nonpolar solvents,
and there is a precipitate (AgBr) when AgNO<sub>3</sub> is added. 
The last reaction suggests
that it is not a typical organic bromide, RX, but a salt,
R<sup>+</sup>Br<sup>&minus;</sup>, with an
apparently stable carbonium.

<p>Looking at the electronic configuration of cyclopentadienyl anion, four
carbons have 1 pi electron each, while one of the carbons holds 2 pi electrons
in its <i>p</i> orbital (as a result of the proton leaving).  Hybridization is
<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup><sub> </sub>and 120&deg; bond angles are expected, but a
<i>flat</i>, regular pentagon has angles of 108&deg;, the apparent bond angle
(any instability is likely to be because of angle strain).  However, formation
of the aromatic structure more than compensates for angle strain.

<p>With tropylium ion, the angles of a <i>flat</i>, regular heptagon would be
128.5&deg;; angle strain may also be significant here.  Six carbons hold 1
electron each in their <i>p</i> orbitals, and the seventh contributes nothing. 
An aromatic 6 pi electrons.  Actually 6 pi electrons are typically the H ckel
number encountered:  aromaticity requires flatness for overlap of the <i>p</i>
orbitals to create the &pi; system, and a rings with member others than 5, 6, or
7, would have bond angle strain far from the favored <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-
hybridized 120&deg; with energies of angle strain higher than that gained by
aromaticity.

<p>Evidence of the other H ckel <q>magic numbers</q> (2, 10, 14, etc) is found
by finding the right compound that matches the features of benzene:  a flat,
ring system with <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbons, the appropriate
number of electrons in <i>p</i> orbitals or in the &pi; system.

<h3>10.11 Nomenclature of benzene derivatives</h3>

<p>For benzene in particular, substituent names are added as prefixes to the
word -<i>benzene</i>, e.g., <i>chlorobenzene</i>, <i>nitrobenzene</i>, etc. 
Other names are special:  methylbenzene is <i>toluene</i>, aminobenzene is
<i>aniline</i>, hydroxybenzene is <i>phenol</i>, carboxybenzene is <i>benzoic
acid</i>, and sulfoxybenzene is <i>benzenesulfonic acid</i>.  The three possible
disubstituted isomers are named relative to each other:  1,2- is
<b><i>ortho</i></b>, 1,3- is <b><i>meta</i></b> and 1,4 is <b><i>para</i></b>. 
In naming multiple substituents, the carbon which number one is assigned based
on the root name, with the balance of numbers assigned usu. in a clockwise
direction.  The lowest combination of numbers should be used in naming
compounds.

<h3>10.12 Quantitative elemental analysis:  nitrogen and sulfur</h3>

<p>In chapter 2, molecular formula and relative composition particular to C, H,
and X atoms was discussed.  Nitrogen can be quantitatively determined by either
of two methods.

<p>(a) the Kjeldahl method (cannot be used for all cmpds like the Dumas method,
but is more convenient):  the organic compound is placed in concentrated
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to convert N into
(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, is subsequently made alkaline to
liberate NH<sub>3</sub> which is distilled and then titrated with a standardized
acid.  For example, a 3.51 mg aniline sample neutralized 3.69 ml of 0.0103 N
acid.  For every millieq. of acid there is one millieq. NH<sub>3</sub> = 3.69
&times; 0.0103 = 0.0380 mmol (note significance).  The weight percentage of N is
100% &times; (0.0380 mmol  &times; 14.01 mg/mmol) &divide; 3.51 mg = 15.1%.

<p>(b) the Dumas method:  the cmpd is passed first through a hot copper oxide
tube, then to hot Cu metal gauze.  The copper oxide oxidizes the compound (as
for C-H combustion in chap. 2) to convert N into N<sub>2</sub>.  The Cu gauze
reduces any nitrogen oxides which may have been formed to N<sub>2</sub>.  The
gas is collected and its volume measured.  As an example, 8.32 mg of aniline
produces 1.11 cm<sup>3</sup> N<sub>2</sub> at 21&deg; and 743 mm (corrected for
vapor pressure of water).  The volume of N<sub>2</sub>  is calculated at
standard T and P:  N<sub>2</sub> at STP = 1.11 &times; 273 / (273 + 21) &times;
743 / 760 = 1.01 cm<sup>3</sup>.  From it, the weight of nitrogen is assessed: 
1.01 / 22400 &times; (2 &times; 14.01) = 1.26 mg.  The weight percentage is 100%
&times; 1.26 / 8.32  = 15.2%.

<p>Sulfur in organic compounds is converted to sulfate ion by methods used to
determine X (see Chap.2):  treatment with Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or
HNO<sub>3</sub> (Carius method).  This is then converted to BaSO<sub>4</sub>,
then weighed.

<h2>Chap. 11 Electrophilic aromatic substitution</h2>

<h3>11.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>The benzene ring undergoes substitution reactions rather than addition to
protect the stable structure of the ring; the &pi; electron cloud above and
below the plane of atoms contributes to this stability, although they are as
loosely held as the pi electrons in a single C=C bond.  But the reactivity of
the benzene comes from the &pi; electron cloud as well, serving as a base to any
electrophilic group.  The substitution reactions are as follows

<h3>11.2 Effect of substituent groups</h3>

<p>Toluene reacts with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub> (35&deg;)
to produce the disubstituted toluenesulfonic acid.  Althought three isomers are
possible, only two are produced in appreciable amounts: 
<i>ortho</i>:<i>meta</i>:<i>para</i> 32:6:62.  The reaction can easily be
gauged, since benzene and toluene are insoluble in sulfuric acid and the
sulfonic acid is soluble, the hydrocarbon layer disappears.  Indeed with fuming
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, benzene takes 20-30 min to react, while toluene
reacts within in a minute or two.  If the reaction were nitration, halogenation,
or F-C alkylation of toluene, the methyl group makes benzene more reactive and
directs the attack toward the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions.

<p>With nitrobenzene, substitution occurs altogether more slowly, and the yield
is chiefly with the meta isomer.  Hence, a group attached to the benzene ring
affects both the <b>reactivity</b> of the ring and the <b>orientation</b> of
substitution.  Groups which make the ring more reactive are called <b>activating
groups</b>, while groups making it less reactive are <b>deactivating
groups.</b>  Groups causing attack at chiefly the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i>
positions are called <b><i>ortho</i>,<i>para</i> directors</b>, while groups
causing attack at the position meta to it are <b><i>meta</i> directors</b>.

<h3>11.3-.4 Determination of orientation and relative reactivity</h3>



<p>Every group/substituent attached to the benzene ring can fall into either two
classes:  either as <i>ortho</i>,<i>para</i> directors or <i>meta</i>
directors.  Consider that with two <i>ortho</i>, two <i>meta</i>, and one
<i>para</i> position, if no selectivity were to occur in the substitution
reaction, 60% of the product would be <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> isomers, and
40% would be <i>meta</i>.  The table below summarizes the results of nitration
of the substituted benzenes listed.  Note that 7 of the groups direct 96-100% of
nitration to the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions;  the other 6 direct 72-
94% to the <i>meta</i> position.

<p>
In determining reactivity, the
typical technique is to determine the relative reactivity, with the reference
being benzene.  The criteria for establishing reactivity should take into
account&minus;

<p>(1) the <b>time required</b>:  toluene reacts with fuming
sulfuric acid in 5-10% of the time it takes benzene to react

<p>(2) the <b>severity of conditions</b>:  Benzene is nitrated in &lt; 1 hour at
60&deg; by a mixture of concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>;  but for nitrobenzene to react to nitration in the
same time, treatment should be at 90&deg; and with fuming HNO<sub>3</sub> and
concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.  Nitrobenzene is apparently less
reactive (-NO<sub>2</sub> is deactivating).

<p>(3) the use of <b>competitive reactions</b>:  if equal amounts of two
reactants are allowed to compete for limited amounts of reagent, one can assume
which of the two is more reactive;  this is ideal since the compounds are
exposed identical reaction conditions.  When limiting amounts of
HNO<sub>3</sub> are added to toluene and benzene, about 25 times more
nitrotoluene (all possible isomers) is made relative to nitrobenzene.  When
HNO<sub>3</sub> is added to a mixture of benzene and chlorobenzene, about 30
times more nitrobenzene than is chloronitrobenzene (all isomers).  Hence, a
methyl group is 25 times more activating, while a chloro- group is 30 times less
activating.  Some groups are quite powerful in activating or deactivating: 
aniline is about one million times more reactive than benzene, while
nitrobenzene is one-millionth as reactive as benzene.

<h3>11.6 Orientation of disubstituted benzenes</h3>

<p>With substitution reactions using disubstituted benzenes, there can be a
problem with predicting the orientation of products, let alone the reactivity. 
If the disubstituents are located in positions which tend to <i>reinforce</i>
the way in which they orient, the products are easy to predict.  <i>p</i>-
Nitrotoluene clearly directs to the positions <i>ortho</i> to the methyl group,
or meta to the nitro group, consistent with there directing properties.  With m-
nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, only one substitution target is likely, the position
meta to both groups.  And with <i>o</i>-cyanoacetanilide, the single position
<i>ortho</i> to the acetylaniline and the <i>para</i> position (both are meta to
the -CN group) are the reinforced targets.

<p>When the effects of one group <i>oppose</i> those of the other, however, then
relative reactivity takes over:

<p>(a) <i>Strongly activating groups generally take over the role of directing
orientation over deactivating or weakly activating groups.</i>  The differences
in directive power are obtained from the list above:

<p>
&mdash;NH<sub>2</sub>, &mdash;OH &gt;
&mdash;OCH<sub>3</sub>,
&mdash;NHCOCH<sub>3</sub> &gt;
&mdash;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, &mdash;CH<sub>3</sub> &gt; <i>meta</i>
directors

<p>For example, <i>p</i>-hydroxytolene undergoes nitration only at the position
<i>ortho</i> to the OH group, <i>meta</i> to CH<sub>3</sub>.  <i>p</i>-
Acetanilyltoluene undergoes bromination chiefly at the position <i>ortho</i> to
-NHCOCH<sub>3</sub>, <i>meta</i> to CH<sub>3</sub>.  And the chief product of
bromination of <i>m</i>-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the Br atom is added to one
position: <i>ortho</i> to CHO, and <i>para</i> to the OH group.  If there is not
a large difference in activating properties, a mixture is inevitable:  nitration
of <i>p</i>-chlorotoluene yields 58% 2-nitro-4-chlorotoluene, and 42% 3-nitro-4-
chlorotoluene.

<p>(b) <i>There is often little substitution between two groups
that are meta to each other</i>.  This probably has little to do with the
directing effect or the reactivity at the position between the atoms, and
everything to do with the size of the groups which the substituting agent is
supposed to go between.

<p>Nitration of <i>m</i>-bromochlorobenzene yields 62% nitrobromochlorobenzene
isomer with &mdash;NO<sub>2</sub> <i>ortho</i> to Br/<i>para</i> to Cl, 37%
isomer with &mdash;NO<sub>2</sub> <i>para</i> to Br/<i>ortho</i> to Cl; and 1%
isomer with &mdash;NO<sub>2</sub> between Br and Cl.  With nitration of
<i>m</i>-chlorotoluene:  32% has &mdash;NO<sub>2</sub> <i>ortho</i> to
Cl/<i>para</i> to CH<sub>3</sub>; 59% has &mdash;NO<sub>2</sub> <i>ortho</i> to
CH<sub>3</sub>/<i>para</i> to Cl; and 9% is between the two.

<h3>11.7 Orientation and synthesis</h3>

<p>In planning a synthesis, the steps to be taken should be devised to minimize
product mixtures, since product yield is low and purification is problematic. 
For preparing bromonitrobenzenes, it will make a difference if bromination is
done prior to nitration, and vice-versa, since nitration prior to bromination is
likely to yield meta isomers, while the reverse will give <i>ortho</i> (38%) and
<i>para</i> (62%) isomers.

<p>Once a group is substituted and is to be converted, the point at which
conversion occurs must also be considered:  oxidation of a methyl group to the
carboxylic acid relative to a nitration step must be considered relative to
whether <i>ortho</i>,<i>para</i> or meta isomers are desired.  For example, if
toluene is treated with KMnO<sub>4</sub> to produce ArCOOH, then treated with
HNO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the product is chiefly
<i>m</i>-nitrobenzoic acid.  If toluene is first treated with
HNO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, an <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i>
mixture of nitrotoluene is formed.  The mixture can then be treated with
K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> to produce <i>o</i>- and
<i>p</i>-nitrobenzoic acids.

<p>Although there is little apparent control over pre<i>para</i>tions
leading to <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> mixtures, the <i>para</i> isomer can be
purified by fractional crystallization.  Since it is the most symmetrical, it
is less soluble than its <i>ortho</i> isomer.  In the very particular case of
nitro compounds, the boiling point differences between <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i>
isomers permits se<i>para</i>tion by fractional distillation.

<p>Control of orientation in EAS is the principle work in many labs today.  E.C.
Taylor and A. McKillop are using <b>thallium</b> compounds to control the
targeting of substitution:  thallium as the cation in organic salts, thallium
salts as Lewis acids, and arylthallium compounds as reactive organometallic
intermediates.

<h3>11.8 Mechanism of nitration</h3>

<p>The mechanism of nitration has been elucidated:

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image046.png"
 alt="nitration reaction scheme">

<p>Sulfuric acid activates the nitronium group which will become the
electrophile, as sulfuric acid is a much stronger acid than the relatively basic
nitric acid.  Nitronium ions are well-known, e.g. nitronium perchlorate
(NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>) or nitronium
fluoborate (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>BF<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>);  in
fact, these stable nitronium salts in solvents like nitromethane or acetic acid
will nitrate aromatics smoothly and in high yield at room temperature.

<p>The structure of the resultant benzenonium ion is actually a
mixed hybrid resonance structure, with the positive charge distributed all over
the molecule, but particularly strong at the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i>
positions to the carbon holding the -NO<sub>2</sub> group.

<p>In step (3), attachment of the base HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> would
amount to an addition reaction which would destroy the aromatic ring structure,
forming a compound less energetically stable.  Rather, a proton is removed by
the base (in effect, regenerate the catalyst).

<h3>11.9 Mechanism of sulfation</h3>

<p>The sulfonation mechanism is also known:

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image048.png"
alt="aromatic sulfation">

<p>The first step is an acid-base equilibrium, generating the electrophilic
SO<sub>3</sub>.  It is typical to use an excess of SO<sub>3</sub> gas
nonetheless with the sulfuric acid;  however, SO<sub>3</sub> will be formed just
the same.  In step (2), the uncharged SO<sub>3</sub> attaches to benzene, but is
still a Lewis acid.  After the proton is taken to form the sulfonic acid, a very
strong acid, there is an acid-base equilibrium with water.

<h3>11.10 Mechanism of Friedel-Crafts alkylation</h3>

<p>The mechanism of alkylation is illustrated:

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image049.png"
alt="Friedel-Crafts alkylation mechanism">

<p>In the first step, a carbonium ion is produced, which will become the
electrophile.  The acid-base equilibrium is of the Lewis type.  In some cases no
carbonium is formed, but the AlCl<sub>3</sub> catalyst polarizes the alkyl
halide (R-Cl) bond; the electrophile is either R<sup>+</sup> or a molecule
capable of transferring R<sup>+</sup> to the ring.  In the acid-base sense, in
forming R<sup>+</sup>, the AlCl<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> ion is a much
better leaving group than is Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>.

<h3>11.11 Mechanism of halogenation</h3>

<p>The mechanism of halogenation is illustrated.

<p class="center"><img  src="imagesOChemHTML/image050.png"
alt="halogenation by aromatic substitution">

<p>The step must involve attachment of a postive chlorine (chloronium) ion to
the ring, but Cl<sup>+</sup> would be highly reactive.  Rather ferric chloride
forms a complex to polarize the Cl<sub>2</sub>  molecule, and this chlorine is
attached to the ring.  A similar polarization of the X<sub>2</sub> molecule was
seen in addition reactions to alkenes.  The Lewis acid FeCl<sub>3</sub> is there
to make sure that FeCl<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> is a better leaving group
than Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>.  However, very highly reactive benzene molecule will
react with X<sub>2</sub> in the absence of a Lewis acid catalyst.

<h3>11.12 Desulfonation.  Mechanism of protonation</h3>

<p>If an aryl- or benzenesulfonic acid is heated to 100-175&deg; in aqueous
acid, the aromatic hydrocarbon and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are products. 
The reason this occurs is that there is an equilibrium between forming the
aromatic hydrocarbon and sulfuric acid, and forming the arylsulfonic acid and
water.


<p>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>  + 
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>  &rarr;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H  + H<sub>2</sub>O

<p> In an acid-catalyzed medium, the rate of the equilibrium is enhanced.  In a
more dilute solution, the principles of mass action drive the reaction toward
formation of the aromatic hydrocarbon and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.  During
sulfonation, an excess of SO<sub>3</sub> in concentrated or fuming
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>  is used with little water present.  In the
<i>desulfonation</i> process, superheated steam is passed over the dilute
sulfonic acid;  this puts a great deal of water and distills the volatile
hydrocarbon away, further shifting equilibrium toward desulfonation.  The
mechanism of desulfonation must be the reverse of sulfonation (according to the
principle of microscopic reversibility).  Step (1):  H<sup>+</sup> adds to the
ring of the sulfonate;  step (2):  SO<sub>3</sub> is released as the aryl ring
rids itself of the + charge.

<p>
This process also features another kind of EAS:  <b>protonation</b>. 
Here the H<sup>+</sup> ion can act as the electrophile.

<h3>11.13 Thallation</h3>

<p> When aromatics are treated with thallium trifluoroacetate,
Tl(OOCCF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, dissolved in TFA, high yields of arylthallium
difluoroacetates are formed as stable crystalline compounds.  Thallium is a
Lewis acid and is thought to act as the electrophile rather than as a catalyst. 
(<i>Thallium reagents are quite poisonous</i>!)  Substituted benzenes, whether
activating or deactivating, affect the reactivity of thallium substitution in
the usual way, but orientation to such groups and -R, -Cl, and -
OCH<sub>3</sub> is almost exclusively <i>para</i>, probably because Tl(tFA) is
quite bulky and the <i>para</i> position is uncrowded.  On the other hand,
orientation of Tl(dFA) to groups like -COOH, -COOCH<sub>3</sub>, and -
CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub> is almost exclusively <i>ortho</i> (even though
some of these groups are <i>meta</i>-directing); this is believed due to
complexing of the thallium atom with one of the atoms on the substituent prior
to EAS (probably a nonbonding pair on an oxygen atom complexing with the Tl
atom).  This complex delivers the Tl compound to the <i>ortho</i> position
neatly.  In C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH, the O
atoms are too far from the ring, so Tl(dFA) is placed <i>para</i>.

<p>As seen in the 1,2- and 1,4-addition process to conjugated dienes, there is
an <i>equilibrium-</i> and <i>rate-controlled</i> differences between
orientation of substitution in Tl(dFA).  If Tl(tFA) is mixed with
isopropylbenzene (normally a <i>para</i>-director) reaction conditions are
25&deg;, substitution is 94% <i>para</i> (the rate-controlled process).  If the
temperature is raised to 73&deg;, substitution is 85% <i>meta</i> (the
equilibrium-controlled process).  If the <i>para</i>-arylthallium product itself
is raised to 73&deg;, it converts to the <i>meta</i> isomer.

<p>Arylthallium compounds are not desirable products in themselves, but as
intermediates in a synthesis.  Some atoms (e.g., iodine) cannot be reactive
enough to be bonded to the ring.  The Tl(dFA) group enables them by being
displaced by these relatively unreactive groups.  Phenols and aryliodides are
prepared via a thallium intermediate;  Iodide ion (as in KI) gives high yields
of the aryliodide.

<h3>11.14 Summary of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS)</h3>

<p>To review, EAS appears to proceed by two steps:  (1) attack by an
electrophilic reagent leading to a stabilized ring carbonium; (2) abstraction of
a H<sup>+</sup> from the ring carbonium by a base.  Evidence for electrophilic
attack comes from kinetic studies and observations like the nitrating power of
stable nitronium salts or the carbonium ion-like rearrangements occurring prior
to F-C alkylation.

<h3>11.15 Isotope effects</h3>

<p>Any difference in the rate (or position of equilibrium) of a reaction because
of a difference in an isotopic mass present in the system is called an
<b>isotope effect</b>.  <i>If a particular atom is less tightly bound in the
transition state of a reaction in the reactant</i>,<i> the reaction involving
the heavier isotope of that atom will go more slowly</i>.  Isotopes of H show
the greatest effect, since D is double the mass of H, and T, triple the mass. 
Bond breaking studies with D and H to determine reaction rates show
<i>k</i><sub>H</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>D</sub> is on the order of 5 to 8 (at room
temp.), meaning those reactions with H as isotope occur 5-8 times faster than
with the D isotope.  (Tritium isotope effects are about twice that of D.)

<p>Rate differences are assessed in competition experiments.  In
<i>intermolecular</i> competition, a mixture of labeled and unlabeled reactants
(-C-H and -C-D) are mixed with a limited amount of reagent (Z), and the relative
amounts of products are assessed (H-Z and D-Z).  With <i>intramolecular</i>
competition, a single reactant with several equivalent positions, some labeled
and some not, reacts with the reagent, and the relative amounts of H-Z or D-Z
can be assessed, or the D-containing and H-containing converted reactants can be
assessed.

<h3>11.16 Mechanism of EAS:  the two steps</h3>

<p>The first step of the addition of electrophile is shown as the <i>slow</i> 
step, but how is that known?  Lars Melander and other workers showed this by 
determining the rates using the reactions of nitration, bromination, and F-C 
alkylation to aromatic compounds labeled with D or T.  It was shown that D and T 
were replaced at the <i>same</i> rate as H:  <i>there was no significant isotope 
effect</i>.  Since it is known that the C-T bond breaks more slowly than C-D, 
and C-D bonds break more slowly than C-H, this means that EAS can not involve 
carbon-hydrogen bond breaking.  This is consistent with step (1) determining the 
rate, since no C-H bond is altered.

<p>If the step were a single step, i.e., electrophilic attack to form a 
transition state which depends upon C-H breaking, an isotope effect must 
necessarily be observed.  Hence, two steps are obvious.  If step (2) were rate-
limiting, an isotope effect should be evident.  The absence of isotope effects 
establishes: (i) EAS occurs in 2 steps, (ii) the first step is rate-
limiting.

<p>It's true that the C-H breaks in the 2nd step more slowly than C-D and 
C-T, but in the overall process, the rate differences here are not observed.  
The reaction diagram below show the differences in <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> which 
account for the slow and fast steps on substitution.  The intermediate carbonium 
is more likely to get rid of a H<sup>+</sup> or even D<sup>+</sup> than to go 
back the other way, since the reverse <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> would be 
higher.

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image051.png"
alt="reaction coordinate plots of aromatic nitration and sulfation">

<p>The process of sulfonation is a special case also illustrated.  Since its
reaction is truly reversible, this is reflected in the energy diagram.  It can
be seen that sulfonation is still a difficult step, but the reverse reaction
involving desulfonation is possible since the <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> values are
com<i>para</i>ble.  Because they are com<i>para</i>ble, use of deuterated
aromatics now does have a significant effect on sulfonation, making sulfonation
slower;  an isotope effect is seen in the special case of sulfonation.

<p>In fact, use of selected aromatics&mdash;highly hindered
ones&mdash;can demonstrate isotope effects during EAS, even for nitration.

<h3>11.17 Reactivity and orientation</h3>

<p>The CH<sub>3</sub> group is said to activate the ring and to direct either
<i>ortho</i> or <i>para</i>; i.e., the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions
react faster than the meta positions.  Recall that the intermediate ring
carbonium distributes the charge around the ring as much as possible, but some
carbons, namely the 2 positions <i>ortho</i> and the position <i>para</i> to the
carbon substituted, the charge is concentrated consistent with the resonance
structures forming the hybrid.  Any group already attached to the ring will
affect the stability of the resultant carbonium, either by its electron-
withdrawing or -releasing nature.

<h3>11.18 Theory of reactivity</h3>

<p>Comparing benzene, toluene, and nitrobenzene to an EAS
reaction to substiuent Y:

<p>The -CH<sub>3</sub> group attached to the ring should be more stabilizing to
the incipient positive charge in the ring, since alkyl groups are known to
stabilize carbonium ions in general by some electron-releasing abilities,
acquiring some of the charge itself.  This inductive effect in the same way
makes the reaction faster (and methyl and alkyl substituents appear as
activating).

<p>The -NO<sub>2</sub> is more electron-withdrawing, which tends to intensify
rather than delocalize the growing positive charge in the transition state,
making the reaction less likely (slower).  The list shown before has indicated
which atoms or groups are considerably activating or deactivating relative to
benzene.  For the deactivating groups in general, the electronegativities of
halogens account for their deactivating properties;  for atoms next to the ring
connected by multiple bonds to relatively more electronegative O and N
(-NO<sub>2</sub>, -CN, -COOH), these atoms become deficient in electrons as the O
and N withdraw electrons, and they pull on the ring &pi; electrons to stabilize
themselves.

<p>In case of activating toluene, as H is replaced with halogens, their
electron-withdrawing properties consequently are deactivating:  toluene is 25
times more reactive than benzene, but benzyl chloride on only one-third as
reactive as benzene.

<h3>11.19 Theory of orientation</h3>

<p>Note that activating groups attached to ring activate <i>all </i>positions: 
even the meta position is much more reactive than any carbon in benzene itself. 
Activating groups however activate the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions
much more than the meta position, explaining orientation of the reagents.

<p>A deactivating group deactivates all positions as well,
including the meta position.  Orientation to meta is simply because it is
relatively less deactivated than the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> positions.

<p>The rule here is that <b>the effect of any group&minus;whether activating or
deactivating&minus;is strongest at the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i>
positions</b>.  In deciding whether to substitute at the position <i>ortho</i>,
<i>para</i>, or meta to the group already attached, draw all resonance
structures and position the carbonium ion.  Activating groups (which are
electron-releasing or -contributing) will favor a position in which one of the
resonance structure includes the carbon to which they are attached being one of
the intermediate ions.  That resonance structure should be the most stable, and
therefore the transition state will be favored.  Deactivating groups (except for
the halogens) will destabilize any one resonance structure which places the +
charge on the carbon atom to which they are attached;  the only possibility of
avoiding such a resonance structure is to allow substitution of the meta
position, in which none of the 3 resonance structures is the least stable.

<h3>11.20 Electron release via resonance</h3>

<p>Reactivity and orientation in EAS has been considered on the basis of the
<q>pulling</q> or <q>releasing</q> of electrons.  These are <i>inductive</i>
properties related to the electronegativities, whether atomic or group-effect,
of the substituents involved.

<p>Certain groups (-NH<sub>2</sub> and -OH) are powerful activators even though
the atoms involved are electronegative and have electron-withdrawing inductive
effects.  Hence their activating effects must be compete successfully with the
inductive effect.  Although N and O are more electronegative than C, they have
nonbonding electron pair which they permit to participate in bonding processes,
and these atoms show a willingness to accept a positive charge.  Ammonium and
amine compounds combine with acids easily, as do water and alcohols.  In drawing
resonance structures for Y at positions <i>ortho</i>, <i>para</i>, and meta to
groups with hydroxyls or amines, or their substitutes, if Y is located at the
positions <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> to the activating group, the nonbonding
electron pair of the activating group can be used to form a double bond with the
carbon to which it is attached.  In that event, no carbonium ion exists, and the
positive charge moves out of the ring and is assumed by the O or N atom. 
<i>This arrangement is especially stable because every atom in the molecule has
the octet</i>.  Substitution at the meta position makes this not possible.

<h3>11.21 Effect of halogen on EAS</h3>

<p>Halogens represent a special case.  In their normal bonding,
they have three electron pairs in the valence shell which do not participate in
bonding.  Because of their electronegativity, they deactivate the ring
inductively since they intensify the + charge, but when the reaction must go,
they release an electron pair just the same via the resonance stabilization of
the carbonium ion, showing a willingness to assume the + charge since every
atom will at least have an octet (the halonium ion was shown in chap. 7).  This
favors direction to the positions <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> to the halogen. 
If no such resonance effect could obtain, the substitution would clearly be
largely at the meta position.

<p>The inductive effect is stronger than the resonance effect
here, since there is a deactivation at all positions relative to attack on
benzene.  However, the resonance effect dictates the overall orientation of
attack.  The carbon-halogen bond is really only likely to assume such partial
double bond character in the interest of allowing all atoms (except H) their
opportunity to complete the octet.

<h3>11.22 Relation to other carbonium ion reactions</h3>

<p>Both reactivity and orientation in EAS is determined by the rates of
formation of the intermediate carbonium ions, with rate of formation paralleling
what is known about the relative stabilities of the intermediates.  Factors
affecting stability include the electron-withdrawing and -releasing nature of
the substituents.  These forces oppose each other for -NH<sub>2</sub> and
&mdash;OH groups and their derivatives and for -X.  For the -NH<sub>2</sub> and
-OH groups, the resonance effects outweighs the inductive effects, while for -X,
they tend to be more even.

<h2>Chap. 12 Arenes</h2>

<h3>12.1 Aliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbons</h3>

<p>Hydrocarbons with both aliphatic and aromatic groups are called
<b>arenes</b>.  The ring should still be subject to EAS as is benzene, the side
chain ought to undergo free-radical substitutions since it is like an alkane. 
However, each group affect the other in the course of the reactions. 
Ethylbenzene treated with HNO<sub>3</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> undergoes nitration faster than for benzene, and at
the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> position.  It also reacts more readily than
ethane to Br<sub>2</sub> and light; the Br atom is found exclusively on the
carbon next to the ring.

<h3>12.2-.3 Structure. Nomenclature. Physical properties</h3>

<p>The simplest of the <i>alkylbenzenes</i> is <b>toluene</b><i>
</i>(methylbenzene).  Larger group give the structure their <i>alkyl</i> name
and then add -<i>benzene</i>.  Dimethylbenzenes are given the special name of
<b>xylenes</b>;  they are identified as <i>o</i>-, <i>m</i>-, or <i>p</i>-
xylenes.  If the side chain is quite complex, the side chain may be given
priority and the benzene ring considered part of it, a <i>phenylalkane</i>; an
example is 2-methyl-3-phenylpentane.  Compounds with &gt;1 benzene ring are
named as derivatives of the alkane nonetheless.  The simplest
<i>alkenylbenzene</i> is called <b>styrene</b> (may also be called
<i>vinylbenzene</i> or <i>phenylethylene</i>).  Alkynylbenzenes are usu. named
as substituted alkynes.

<p>The physical properties are typical of hydrocarbons:  low polarity,
insolubility in water, solubility in ether, CCl<sub>4</sub>, or ligroin; less
dense than water; b.p. values increase with MW at increments of 20-30&deg; for
each C added.  M.p. values depend not only on MW usually, but molecular shape
(or symmetry), so the relationship to structure is complicated;  among isomeric
disubstituted benzenes, the <i>para</i> isomer generally melts considerably
higher than the <i>meta</i> or <i>ortho</i> isomers.  Dissolution, like melting,
involves overcoming the forces which hold crystals together, so it is not
surprising that the <i>para</i> isomer is the least soluble in a given
solvent.

<p>The melting point value change is reflective of the need for symmetry.  A
good example is benzene, which is highly symmetrical and melts at 5&deg;: 
introduction of a methyl group to make toluene and the melting point falls to
&mdash;95&deg;.

<h3>12.4 Industrial source of alkylbenzenes</h3>

<p>Laboratory synthesis of benzene rings de novo to make aromatics from simpler
molecules is not done.  As much as the alkanes from petroleum serve as the
source of all aliphatics, benzene and alkylbenzenes are the source of all
aromatic reagents.  Both <b>coal</b> and <b>petroleum</b> can serve as sources
for aliphatics and aromatics.  Coal is often mined to for conversion to coke,
which is used for smelting iron to steel.  When coal is heated without air, the
residue is coke, but the volatile compounds driven away consist of <i>coal
gas</i> and a liquid <b>coal tar</b>.  The coal tar may be distilled to yield
the aromatics:  1 ton of soft coal can produce 120 lb coal tar, which can be
separated to benzene (2 lb), toluene (0.5 lb), xylenes (0.1 lb), phenol (0.5
lb), cresols (2 lb), and naphthalene (5 lb).

<p>Another source of aromatic HCs is through the <b>catalytic reforming</b> of
alkanes.  This results not only in <i>dehydrogenation</i> (methylcyclohexane to
toluene), but also <i>cyclization</i> and <i>isomerization</i>, as toluene is
formed from <i>n</i>-heptane or 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane.  Benzene is formed by
similar processes, including <i>hydrodealkylation</i> of toluene.

<p>Friedel-Crafts alkylation is useful in direct attachment of
an alkyl group to the aromatic ring, but a limitation of the reaction is that
the alkyl group attached is not always the same as the parent halide
(rearrangement).

<p>Side-chains containing oxidized functions can similarly be
converted to arenes using strong reducing conditions.  These reducing reactions
are important, since acid chlorides can be added without concern for
rearrangment, and subsequently be reduced to produce the desired alkane.

<h3>12.6-.8 Friedel-Crafts alkylation.  Mechanism.  Limitations</h3>

<p>Adding anhydrous AlCl<sub>3</sub> to benzene-methyl chloride mixtures causes
a vigorous reaction:  HCl gas is evolved and toluene is obtained.  This reaction
was shown by Charles Friedel and James Crafts in 1877.  However, the alkyl
halide is not limited to R=methyl and X=chlorine.  In fact, almost every
compound but ArX can be employed;  the halogen in an aryl bond is too
unreactive.  The aromatic can be benzene itself, certain substituted benzenes
(viz., alkylbenzenes and halobenzenes) or more complicated ring systems like
naphthalene and anthracene.  Any Lewis acid other than AlCl<sub>3</sub> can be
employed, namely, BF<sub>3</sub>, HF, and H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.  The
reagents are simply mixed, with an attempt to cool the reaction and trapping HX
being made.  It is important to limit attack to <i>mono</i>alkylation by using
an excess of hydrocarbon.  Usually, the RX compound is added slowly, while the
aromatic serves as solvent and reactant.

<p>If the alkane is polyhalogenated (RX<sub>2</sub>, RX<sub>3</sub>,
or CCl<sub>4</sub>), multiple aromatic rings may be found in the final
product:

<p>
2 C<sub>6</sub>H6 + CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> &rarr;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> +

(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CH + 3 HCl

<p>
3 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + CCl<sub>4</sub>  &rarr;
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CCl + 3 HCl

<p>AlCl<sub>3</sub> is the catalyst in all the above reactions.  Two mechanisms
for F-C alkylation were shown possible in  11.10.  The mechanisms show that
many Lewis acids can involve themselves in the reaction besides
AlCl<sub>3</sub>;  draw the Lewis structures of AlCl<sub>3</sub>,
BF<sub>3</sub>, FeCl<sub>3</sub> to see the need to complete the octet. 
In the special case of HF, it is sufficiently polar to react as well.

<p>Since they all generate a carbonium ion at some stage, it is
possible that anything generating a carbonium ion will react as EAS-type. 
Alcohols and alkenes also are electrophilic and susceptible to protic acid
attack, generating carbonium ions which in turn can participate in EAS.

<p>
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>COH &rarr;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&ndash;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>

<p>
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> +
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub>  &rarr;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&ndash;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>

<p> Both reactions are catalyzed by H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; both yield the
same product, <i>tert</i>-butylbenzene.  Since carbonium ions are intermediates,
formation of the most stable carbonium ion will decide the orientation of EAS; 
in addition, rearrangements caused by 1,2-hydride and -alkyl shifts are
dictated.  Consider the following reactions:


<table class="left">
<col><col style="width:10em;"><col>
<tr style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style';">

</table>

<p>Hence a carbonium ion can:

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>eliminate a H<sup>+</sup> to form an alkene
<li>rearrange to form a more stable carbonium ion
<li>combine with a negative ion or other basic molecule
<li>add to an alkene to form a larger carbonium ion
<li>abstract a H<sup>&minus;</sup> from an alkane
<li>alkylate an aromatic ring
</ol>

<p>The fact that some of the products formed represent <i>unrearranged</i>
carbonium ions does not mean that EAS does not occur by carbonium ion
intermediates.  The unrearranged carbonium, being the least stable, is
therefore likely to be the most reactive, providing the energy for EAS.  The
same low stability which makes primary carbonium ions prone to rearrangement
makes them highly reactive as well.

<p>There are 3 limitations to use of F-C alkylation: (i) the possibility of
polysubstitution, (ii) the possibility of alkyl group rearrangement, and (c)
aryl halides are not among the RX compounds capable of reaction.  Two more
limitations are now added: (iv) any aromatic ring less reactive than any
halobenzene does not under F-C reaction.  Apparently, the
R<sup>+</sup> carbonium ion is not as powerful an electrophile as
NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>. (v) aromatic rings containing amine or substituted
amines (-NH<sub>2</sub>, -NHR, or -NR<sub>2</sub>) do not react to F-C
alkylation, for the reason that the basic amines provide a nonbonding electron
pair for the Lewis acid catalysts which are need to ionize RX, and they tie up
the catalyst.

<h3>12.10 Oxidation of alkylbenzenes</h3>

<p>Benzene and alkanes resist the usual oxidizing agents (permanganate,
dichromate, etc.), but the benzene ring makes the aliphatic side chain quite
susceptible to oxidation.  In the course of oxidation, all carbons are removed
from the side chain except the carbon attached, leaving COOH to indicate the
position of the original side chain.  KMnO<sub>4</sub> is usually used as the
oxidizing reagent, although K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and
dil. HNO<sub>3</sub> can be used; because oxidation of the side chain is more
difficult than that of an alkene, prolonged treatment with hot
KMnO<sub>4</sub> is required.  <i>n</i>-Butylbenzene exposed to hot permanganate
is degraded completely to benzoic acid (the other carbons become
CO<sub>2</sub>).

<p>The oxidation of side chains is used for two purposes.  One is the
<b>synthesis of carboxylic acids</b>.  <i>p</i>-Xylene is converted to
terephthalic acid (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) with hot permanganate. 
<i>p</i>-Nitrotoluene is converted to <i>p</i>-nitrobenzoic acid with acidified
dichromate.

<p>The other purpose is for <b>identification of alkylbenzenes</b>.  For
example, a liquid compound with formula C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub> and boiling
point 137-139&deg; has been otherwise found to be an alkylbenzene.  From the
list of physical properties, it might be <i>o</i>-, <i>m</i>-, or <i>p</i>-
xylene, or ethylbenzene.  The compound can now be oxidized and the m.p.of the
product can be compared to the m.p. values of predictable oxidation products or
their derivatives of the above potential reactants. <i>o</i>-Xylene would
produce phthalic acid (m.p. 231&deg;; its <i>p</i>-nitrobenzyl ester, m.p.
155&deg;); <i>m</i>-xylene would produce isophthalic acid (m.p. 348&deg;; its
<i>p</i>-nitrobenzyl ester, m.p. 215&deg;); <i>p</i>-xylene would produce
terephthalic acid (m.p. 300&deg; subl.; its <i>p</i>-nitrobenzyl ester, m.p.
263&deg;); and ethylbenzene would produce benzoic acid (m.p. 122&deg;; its
<i>p</i>-nitrobenzyl ester, m.p. 89&deg;).

<h3>12.11 EAS in alkylbenzenes</h3>

<p>It has already been shown in chap. 11 that alkyl groups
attached to the benzene ring are activating and
<i>ortho</i>,<i>para</i>-directing.

<h3>12.12 Halogenation of alkylbenzenes:  ring vs. side chain</h3>

<p>Halogens can substitute in alkylbenzenes in two ways, and different reaction
conditions obtain for either way, allowing control of orientation.  For
halogenation of side chain, the same chemistry which applies to halogenation of
alkanes is in order:  the X<sub>2</sub> molecule is made into a free radical by
high temp. or by UV light.  For EAS, the X<sub>2</sub>  molecule must be ionized
or polarized by a Lewis acid catalyst (at low temperatures to guard against side
chain substitution).

<p>Ring halogenation is chiefly <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> to alkylbenzenes: 
toluene treated with Cl<sub>2</sub> and Fe or FeCl<sub>3</sub>  yields 58% o-
chlorotoluene and 42% <i>p</i>-chlorotoluene.  Side-chain halogenation, even
when attempts are made to limit to monohalogenation by use of excess
alkylbenzene, may still yield polyhalogenated products.  For toluene, the
products of chlorination are benzyl chloride, benzal chloride, and
benzotrichloride for the mono-, di-, and trisubstituted compounds.

<h3>12.13 Side-chain halogenation of alkylbenzenes</h3>

<p>For a side chain larger than a methyl group, the chief site of halogen free
radical substitution is the carbon alpha to the benzene ring.  Ethylbenzene
exposed to Br<sub>2</sub> plus heat or light produce no 2-bromo-1-phenylethane
(a 1&deg; RX) and exclusively 1-bromo-1-phenylethane (a 2&deg; RX).  Actually,
the hydrogen atoms bound to the carbon attached to the benzene ring are not just
2&deg; hydrogens, but <i>benzylic</i> H atoms, and are as easy as allylic
hydrogens to abstract in free radical reactions.  Competition reactions show
that at 40&deg; a benzylic H atom in toluene is 3.3 times more reactive to Br
atoms as a 3&deg; H atom of an alkane, and nearly 100 million times more than
the H atom of methane.

<p>The list for the ease of abstraction of H atoms, the ease of formation of
free radicals, and the stability of the free radical intermediate can be
expanded:

<p class="center">allyl, benzyl &gt; 3&deg;
&gt; 2&deg; &gt; 1&deg; &gt; CH<sub>3</sub> , vinyl

<p>Bond dissociation energies for formation of benzyl radicals from toluene show
an 85 kcal/mol requirement (see Chap. 1), compared to 91 kcal to form t-butyl
radicals and 88 kcal to form allyl radicals.

<p>Chlorination is less discriminating than bromination.  Free radical
chlorination of ethylbenzene shows both possible monosubstituted isomers being
produced:  91% the benzyl substitute 1-chloro-1-phenylethane, 9% the primary
carbon substitute.  Competition experiments show that conditions where the
relative reactivites are 5.0:3.8:1.0 for 3&deg;:2&deg;:1&deg; hydrogens, the
relative rate per benzylic H for toluene is only 1.3.  This is because the more
reactive Cl atom is less selective than the Br atom, less selective between H
atoms in a single molecule and less selective between H in different molecules. 
Since the transition state in Cl attack is reached early, the organic group has
acquired little free character before the C-H bond is broken.  The fact that Cl
atom is less reactive to benzylic H atoms is not well understood, although it
has been attributed to <i>polar factors</i> ( 32.4).

<h3>12.14 Resonance stabilization of the benzyl radical</h3>

<p>Stabilization of the free radical is considered to result from resonance of
the odd electron throughout the ring.  The methylene group in the intermediate
forms a double bond with the ring while the odd electron stabilizes itself in pi
ring system.  The amount of stabilization is considered the difference between
forming a methyl radical (+104 kcal/mol) and the benzyl radical (+85 kcal),
which is 19 kcal/mol.

<h3>12.15 Triphenylmethyl:  a stable free radical</h3>

<p>Although the benzyl radical is relatively more stable than a methyl radical,
all free radicals are reactive;  the benzyl and allyl radicals exist for only a
few milliseconds.  However, direct evidence for free radicals exists.  Moses
Gomberg published paper in <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> and <i>Berichte</i> in 1900
about his work with phenylated alkanes.  He had succeeded in preparing
tetraphenylmethane and was attempting to synthesize hexaphenylethane.  Using
triphenylchloromethane, he tried using metals (Na, but it does not work well;
then finely divided Ag, Hg, and best, Zn) for the synthesis.  The reactant stood
in benzene solution over the metal, and was filtered to remove the metal
halide.  After evaporating the benzene, a white crystalline solid with m.p.
185&deg; remained.

<p>Gomberg's analysis showed a 88% carbon and 6% hydrogen content, less
than the expected 100% total.  Attempts were made to make sure oxygen was not
incorporated:  under an atmosphere of CO<sub>2</sub>, the compound was made and
filtered and the solvent evaporated.  This product was much more soluble in
benzene than the first product and did not melt at 185&deg;.  Composition
analysis showed 93.8% carbon and 6.2% hydrogen:  hexaphenylethane.

<p>Dissolved in benzene, the substance was yellow in color.  If air was allowed
to enter, the yellow color disappeared, then came back after a few minutes. 
With more O<sub>2</sub>, the color disappeared then reappeared;  more air, it
finally disappeared, and the compound with 185&deg; appeared once more.  The
compound was now known to be peroxidized triphenylmethane, or
peroxybis(triphenylmethane).  The yellow color was the radical form, while the
dimer form he thought he was trying to synthesize was colorless, as well as the
peroxy form.  The dimer is not actually the hexaphenylethane, but was shown in
1968 to be completely different:

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image052.png"
alt="protonated intermediate of triphenylmethyl">

<p>Further evidence of a free radical character of these stabilized molecules is
that odd electrons are not opposed in spin as in a paired orbital.  Hence the
molecule has a net magnetic moment, making the compound paramagnetic (attracted
in a magnetic field) and able to show characteristic absorption in a electron
spin resonance spectrum.  The triphenylmethyl radical is stabilized because of
the high amount of delocalization that occurs over three rings rather than just
one.  In addition crowding from 3 aromatic rings weakens the C-C bond in the
dimer, and making it difficult for the atoms to approach each other.

<h3>12.16 Preparation of alkenylbenzenes.  Conjugation with ring</h3>

<p>Styrene can be prepared in 90% yield simply by a dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene with a catalyst
(Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) at high temp.
(600&deg;), and ethylbenzene is obtained by acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)-
catalyzed F-C alkylation with ethylene and benzene.

<p>Laboratory synthesis is most likely by used of dehydrohalogenation or
dehydration.  1-Phenyl-1-chloroethane + KOH (alc), heat &rarr; styrene. 
1-Phenylethanol + ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, heat  &rarr; styrene. 
With dehydrohalogenation of 1-phenyl-2-chloropropane or
dehydration of 1-phenyl-2-propanol, two isomers are
possible but only one is obtained:  1-phenylpropene.  The 3-phenylpropene
(allylbenzene) is not only not an elimination product, but when it is treated
with KOH + heat, it is converted to 1-phenylpropene.  The simple explanation is
that formation of a double bond in that position makes it conjugated with the
aromatic ring, an usually stable system which is very easily formed.

<h3>12.17 Reactions of alkenylbenzenes</h3>

<p>Alkenylbenzenes undergo both EAS and the reactions of alkenes, including
addition to the C=C bond.  Because of the pi electrons in the alkene side chain,
the ring and side chain will compete for electrophiles;  the alkenyl function
usually will win since the resonance-stabilized ring is less reactive.  As
proof, styrene can be catalytically hydrogenated to saturation:  but
hydrogenation conditions to produce ethylbenzene are relatively mild (Ni,
20&deg;, 2-3 atm, 75 min), while conditions to saturate the ring to make
ethylcyclohexane are intense (Ni, 125&deg;, 110 atm, 100 min from
ethylbenzene).

<p>The alkene bond can be treated to mild oxidation conditons to produce the
glycol, or oxidized completely to the carboxylic acid.  Styrene +
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (in formic acid) &rarr; phenylethylene glycol +
KMnO<sub>4</sub>  &rarr;  benzoic acid.

<p>With halogenation, the alkene bond reacts quickly and firstly by ionic
addition before ring halogenation occurs.  If ring halogenation without
electrophilic addition of the C=C bond is desired, it is necessary to halogenate
first and generate the double bond after:  ethylbenzene +
Cl<sub>2</sub> (FeCl<sub>3</sub>)  &rarr;  <i>o</i>- and
<i>p</i>-chloroethylbenzene + Cl<sub>2</sub>, heat &rarr;
1-(<i>p</i>-chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethane + KOH  &rarr; <i>p</i>-chlorostyrene.

<h3>12.18-.19 Addition to conjugated alkylbenzenes:  orientation.  Stability of
the benzyl cation.  Reactivity</h3>

<p>The rule in addition of an unsymmetrical reagent to a double bond which can
yield two different products is that the predominant product in the
electrophilic or free radical addition is the one yielding the more stable
particle, whether a carbonium ion or free radical.  1-Phenylpropene is treated
with HBr in the presence and absence of peroxides.  In the absence of peroxides,
Br is found in the benzylic position; the mechanism is considered ionic addition
with formation of a very stable benzyl cation intermediate.  In the presence of
peroxides, the Br atom is on the carbon once removed from the ring, next to the
benzyl carbon; the mechanism involves free radical additon of Br free radical,
which permits formation of a benzyl free radical intermediate.

<p>The evidence of a very stable benzyl free radical has been
shown in an earlier section of this chapter.  As for the benzyl cation, the
ionization potential of benzyl free radical is 179 kcal/mol, 69 kcal more
stable than a methyl cation, and just about as stable as tert-butyl cation. 
Hence the stability of carbonium ions follows this series:

<p>Stability of carbonium ions:  benzyl, 3&deg; &gt; allyl, 2&deg; &gt;
1&deg; &gt; CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>

<p>This stability is considerable, since otherwise the benzylic carbon might be
considered a 2&deg; carbon.  It is the resonance of the ring which makes this
lower potential energy possible.

<p>Since benzyl cations are more stable than what might occur in simple alkenes,
the rate of addition is expected to be faster.  However, because conjugated
alkenylbenzenes are so stable, they may be relatively unreactive compared to the
simple alkenes.  This contradiction is resolved as in the case of conjugated
dienes:  since both the <i>reactant</i> and the <i>transition state</i> are
resonance-stabilized, the rate of the reaction (faster or slower) will depend
upon <i>which</i> is stabilized <i>more</i>.  In fact, conjugated
alkenylbenzenes react faster to ionic and free-radical addition, since&mdash;as
in <i>most</i> cases&mdash;resonance stabilization of the transition state
leading to the carbonium or free radical intermediate is more important than
stability of the reactant. (This is not always true.)

<h3>12.21  Analysis of alkylbenzenes</h3>

<p>Arenes with saturated side chains are distinguished from alkenes by a failure
to decolorize Br<sub>2</sub> in CCl<sub>4</sub>  (with HBr evolution) and by
failure to decolorize cold, dilute, neutral permanganate.  They can be
distinguished from alkanes in that they dissolve&minus;because of
sulfonation&minus;in cold fuming H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.  They are
distinguished from ROH or other oxygen-containing compounds because they do not
<i>immediately</i> dissolve in cold concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. 
They are distinguished esp. from 1&deg; and 2&deg; alcohols by failure to give a
positive chromic anhydride test.

<p>Alkylbenzenes able to undergo F-C alkylation give orange- to red-colored
products when treated with CHCl<sub>3</sub> and AlCl<sub>3</sub>, these colors
due to formation of triarylmethyl cations, Ar<sub>3</sub>C<sup>+</sup>, existing
as salts of AlCl<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>.  The color produced is
characteristic of the aromatic:  orange to red for halobenzenes, blue for
<i>naphthalene</i>, purple for <i>phenanthrene</i>, green for
<i>anthracene</i>.

<p>Aromatics with unsaturated side chains can be analyzed in
the manner for analyzing aromatics or for functions with double or triple
bonds.

<h2>Chap. 13 Spectroscopy and structure</h2>

<h3>13.1 Determination of structure:  spectroscopic methods</h3>

<p>The use of spectroscopic instruments has made determination of structure for
complex compounds quite easy.  Most chemists rely on the use of nmr and ir
spectra, but determination of mass, uv and esr spectra is important and often
definitive.

<h3>13.2 Mass spectroscopy</h3>

<p>Molecules are bombarded with a beam of energetic electrons.  The molecules
are broken into fragments which are ionized.  Each ion has a particular mass-to-
charge value (<i>m/e</i>).  For singly charged ions, <i>m/e</i> is just the ion
mass.  Neopentane can lose an electron to form a <i>parent ion</i> with
<i>m/e</i> = 72.  It can also produce several fragments with the following
<i>m/e</i> and <i>relative intensities</i>:

<table style="margin:2em auto;">
<tr>
 <th>ion
 <th><i>m/e</i>
 <th>relative intensity
<tr>
 <td>(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sup>+</sup>
 <td>57
 <td>100 (<i>base peak</i>)
<tr>
 <td>(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sup>+</sup>
 <td>41
 <td>41.5
<tr>
 <td>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sup>+</sup>
 <td>>29
 <td>38.5
<tr>
 <td>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>)<sup>+</sup>
 <td>>27
 <td>15.7
</table>

<p>There are other fragments as well.  What is important about the list or plot
of data is that the fragments and their relative intensities are characteristic
of the compound, like fingerprints.  Comparison of an unknown with spectra on
record can establish the identity, much like identical m.p., b.p., density,
refractive index, etc.

<p>Mass spectra also establish features of a new compound, providing MW data and
narrowing the molecular structure down by the way it fragments.  Often the
parent ion is the base (highest) peak and can be identified to establish MW. 
Many tiny peaks among the large ones appear, and this is because of the
differences in naturally occurring isotopes of the atoms.  Knowing the abundance
of each possible isotope (see table) allows predictions of intensities in
isotopic peaks.

<table style="margin:2em auto;">

<p> Benzene has an <i>M</i><sup>+</sup> peak (parent ion peak) with m/e 78 (its
MW).  It has an <i>M</i> + 1 peak (<i>m/e</i> 79) because of the
C<sub>5</sub><sup>13</sup>CH<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup> and
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>D<sup>+</sup>.  The <i>M</i> + 2 peak can be
due to 3 different ions, one with two <sup>13</sup>C, one with a <sup>13</sup>C
and D, and the other with two D atoms.  The peak intensities are low, however,
because of the low natural abundance of the other isotopes.  But, it is because
of the smaller peaks that the molecular formula can be assessed accurately.

<h3>13.3 The electromagnetic spectrum</h3>

<p>It is important to know the EM radiation can be characterized by a frequency
and a wavelength, knowing its speed in a particular medium.  The energy
associated with particular EM radiation is known by the equation
<i>E</i>=<i>h</i>&nu; (<i>h</i>=6.5 &times; 10<sup>&minus;27</sup> erg-s)

<h3>13.4 The infrared spectrum</h3>

<p>IR spectra give the most information about the structure of organics.  Bonds
in the molecule are always vibrating, either by stretching or bending with
respect to each other.  These changes are caused by absorbing IR light.

<p>In referring to IR part of spectra, wavelengths are given in microns, m (1 m
= 10<sup>&minus;4</sup> cm or 10<sup>4</sup> A).  Frequencies are not expressed
in Hz, but wavenumbers, or reciprocal centimeters, cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> = 1/l
in where l is in cm.

<p>IR spectra can establish identity of an unknown by comparison to reference
spectra (as in ms), or can give information about the structure of a new
compound.  One region of the IR spectra, from 600-1500 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>, is
called the <i>fingerprint region</i> as it has a number of revealing
characteristic absorptions.  The presence or absence of characteristic bands
usually can help eliminate or confirm the presence of a functional group.

<p>Interpretation is made difficult by absorptions which overlap, or by the
presence of harmonics at twice the frequency of the fundamental band. 
<i>Shifting</i> of the characteristic band can occur as a result of the
functional group affected by certain structural features:  conjugation, electron
withdrawal by a neighboring atom or group, angle strain, van der Waals strain,
hydrogen bonding.  The table below presents the characteristic absorption
bands.

<h3>13.5 The ultraviolet spectrum</h3>

<p>Visible light fall in the region of 400-750 nm.  Beyond the red end above 750
nm is the IR region.  Just beyond the violet end less than 400 nm is the UV
region (actually between 200-400 nm).  UV spectrophotometers usu. measure both
visible and UV light.

<p>Molecules absorbing UV light undergo transitions at the electronic level. 
Countless number of sublevels exist; for this reason, which make UV absorption
bands broad  (IR spectra show sharp peaks, UV bands show very broad humps).  The
peak of the spectrum is its characteristic &lambda;<sub>max</sub>, with the
intensity of absorption given by &epsilon;<sub>max</sub>.

<p>The electronic transitions in molecules are typically:

<p>(1) transition of a nonbonding electron to a &pi;antibonding orbital
(<i>n</i> &rarr; &pi;*)

<p>(2) transition from &pi;
bonding to a &pi; antibonding (&pi; &rarr; &pi;*)

<p>With simple alkenes like ethylene, the bonding p to antibonding p transition
requires more enery, absorption in the far UV.  Conjugation of double bonds
lower the energy necessary for this transition.  With extensive conjugation,
energy is lowered so much that absorption begins to occur in the visible
region.  &beta;-carotene is a yellow pigment and precursor to vitamin A;  its 11
conjugated bonds give it its color, as it absorbs in the violet
(&lambda;<sub>max</sub> = 451 nm).  The reason conjugation brings about this
effect is the resonance effect stabilizing the excited state more than it
stabilizes the ground state; stabilization means lowering energy
differences.

<p>The information about molecules obtained from UV spectra gives no information
about functional groups, but the relationship between functional groups, viz.
conjugation between &ge; 2 carbon-carbon double or triple bonds, between carbon-
oxygen and carbon-oxygen double bonds, and between double bonds and aromatic
rings, and aromatic rings themselves.

<h3>13.6 The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum</h3>
<p>

Nuclei, like electrons, have <i>spin</i>. Spinning charges generate <i>magnetic
moments</i> along the axis of spin, such that the nucleus acts like a tiny bar
magnet. If placed in an external magnetic field, the magnetic moment aligns
itself either <i>with</i> or <i>against</i> the external field.  Alignment
<i>with</i> the field is more stable (requires lower energy); alignment
<i>against</i> requires a <q>flipping</q> of the spin of the nucleus. The energy
necessary to change this alignment depends upon the strength of the external
magnetic field. Since &Delta;<i>E</i>=<i>h</i>&nu;, any external radiation can
be used to cause the flip. The frequency necessary can be found in the equation:

<p class="center">
&nu; = &gamma;<i>H</i><sub>0</sub> / 2&pi;
<p>
&nu; is in Hz, <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> is the mag field strength in
guass, and &gamma; is the gyromagnetic ratio for a particular nucleus (26,750
for <sup>1</sup>H).  In a 14.092 kG field, the energy required for flipping
nuclei is 60 MHz, in the radio range.  Substances are placed in spectrometers to
find the absorption of the characteristic frequency.  It is possible to place
the substance in a constant external magnetic field, and then change the
radiofrequency to look at the absorption, but in practice, it is the
radiofrequency which is kept constant while the magnetic field strength itself
is increased.  The spectrum is a plot of absorption (at the point where nuclei
flip) vs. magnetic field strength, with terms like <q>downfield</q> referring
looking at signals from the high field region to the low field region.
<p>
If all nuclei absorbed at the same field strength, only one peak in a spectrum
would be observed, giving little information about structure. The magnetic
moments of nuclei in a molecule are affected by the environment is which they
are in, and because of this, there are subtle differences in the <i>applied</i>
mag. field strength and the <i>effective</i> mag. field strength. Since the
nuclei <i>and</i> electrons next to them generate their own mag. fields (albeit
very tiny), these magnetic fields can <b>shield</b> or <b>deshield</b> the
nuclei against the external field. <i>All nuclei absorb at the same effective
field strength, but they absorb at different applied field strengths.</i> NMR
spectra plot this absorption against the <i>applied</i> field strength, with
the result that incredibly detailed information about structure is obtained,
including:
<ol>
<li> the number of signals, indicating the different classes
of protons in a molecule
<li>the positions of the signals, indicating the electronic
environment of the proton
<li>the intensities of the signals, indicating the number of
protons in that class
<li>the splitting of signals into several peaks, indicating
the environment of the proton with respect to other nearby protons
</ol>

<h3>13.7 NMR. Number of signals.  Equivalent and non-equivalent protons</h3>
<p>
Protons in the same environment absorb at the same applied field strength, and
can be said to belong to a single class; they are <i>equivalent</i>. This
equivalence refers to a chemical equivalence. The illustration below
demonstrates what equivalence is.
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/image053.png" alt="proton classes for nmr">
<p>
Chemical equivalence includes <i>stereochemical</i> equivalence as well.
<p class="center">
<img  src="imagesOChemHTML/image054.png"
alt="proton classes for nmr signals in alkenes and cycloalkanes">
<p>
And 1,2-dichloropropane, whether optically active or inactive gives four NMR
signals just the same. The environments of the two protons on C1 are not the
same, and rotating them will not change their environment.

<p class="center">
<img  src="imagesOChemHTML/image055.png"
alt="proton classes for nmr in stereochemical molecules">
<p>
It is possible that even with the stereochemically different enviroments, the
differences can not be resolved on a spectra, so fewer signals may be seen than
predicted. Equivalence of protons can best be assessed by isomer number: by
replacing either of two protons with Z without rotating any bonds or reflecting
along planes, if the replacement yields the same product or their enantiomers,
then the protons are chemically equivalent. If a diastereomer results, the
protons are not equivalent.

<h3>13.8 NMR. Positions of signals.  Chemical shift</h3>

<p>The number of signals indicates how many classes there are.  The positions of
the signal in a spectra indicate what class the proton belongs to:  aromatic,
aliphatic, etc.  The position in a spectra depends upon the shielding or
deshielding of the magnetic field.  Electrons surrounding a proton circulate in
a way which generates a field opposing the applied field, and the proton is
shielded.  A <q>naked</q> proton requires very little applied strength, whereas
a shielded proton requires a higher applied strength to provide the effective
strength typical of absorption.  Shielding therefore <b>shifts</b> the
absorption <i>upfield</i>, and deshielding shifts it <i>downfield</i>.  These
shifts are called <b>chemical shifts</b>.

<p>Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million of the applied field
strength.  A <b>reference point</b> is used in measuring the shift, which is
tetramethylsilane (TMS), (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Si.  Silicon's low
electronegativity makes the shielding of its electrons greater than most organic
compounds, so most proton signals are downfield of the reference.  For pnmr, the
<i>delta</i> (&delta;) scale is used, with the TMS signal at 0.0 ppm and most
chemical shifts in pnmr 0-10 ppm downfield (actually between -10 and 0 ppm).  A
large &delta; is more downfield than a small &delta;.  Another scale is the
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span> scale, in which TMS is considered to
be 10.0 ppm and most values between 0 and 10 ppm (i.e., 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span> = 10 &mdash; &delta;).  To calculate the shift, use the
&nu; = &gamma;<i>H</i><sub>6</sub>0/2&pi; to obtain the frequency in Hz, then
find:

<p class="eqnserif">
&delta; = [ observed shift (Hz) &times; 10<sup>6</sup> ] / [ machine signal
 (Hz) ]

<p>For a 60 MHz spectrometer, all that is necessary is to divide the observed
shift by 60.  The table below indicates typical chemical shifts for protons in a
certain enviroment.

<p>Some major differences can be seen.  Protons attached to alkanes are more
shielded (upfield) than protons attached to the aromatic rings; this is because
&pi; electrons in the ring circulate in a way to reinforce the field.  The
electronegativity of halogens is expected to deshield protons, and it does: 
C<b>H</b><sub>3</sub>-Cl (&delta; 3.0), R-C<b>H</b><sub>2</sub>-Cl (&delta;
3.4), R<sub>2</sub>C<b>H</b>-Cl (&delta; 4.0).  If the halogen is once removed,
the deshielding effect is less intense:  C<b>H</b><sub>3</sub>-C-Cl (&delta;
1.5), R-C<b>H</b><sub>2</sub>-C-Cl (&Delta; 1.7), R<sub>2</sub>C<b>H</b>-C-Cl
(&delta; 1.6).  Multiple halogens on the carbon cause a greater deshielding.

<p>Note that in toluene, only two signals are observed.  Although the
<i>ortho</i>, meta, and <i>para</i> H on the ring are not strictly equivalent,
the differences on a spectra are not resolvable.

<h3>13.9 NMR. Peak area and proton counting</h3>

<p>Peak intensities give information of the number of hydrogens in each class. 
Peak areas of each peak class can be integrated, then expressed as relative
proportions to the peak class with the smallest area.  The 2 signals of toluene
show a 3:5 ratio, while for <i>p</i>-xylene, it is 3:2 or 6:4 for its 2
signals.  And for mesitylene's two signals, the ratio is 3:1, or 9:3. 
This shows the principle that <i>the area under an nmr signal is directly
proportional to the number of protons giving rise to the signal</i>.

<p>The area is calculated by an electronic integrator and drawn as a stepped
curved on the spectra.  The paper on the spectra itself has squares, and the
height of the steps can be counted and expressed relative to one another.  The
proportions are converted first to the lowest whole number of the smallest peak
(to 1.0), then multiplied by a factor to reflect the numbers of protons in the
class with the lowest signal.  Knowing the molecular formula is of great
assistance in doing this process.

<h3>13.10 NMR.  Splitting of signals.  Spin-spin coupling</h3>

<p>Proton equivalence does not mean that a single peak is necessarily observed
on spectra.  For 1,1,2-tribromoethane, 1,1-dibromoethane, and ethyl bromide,
only 2 peak signals are expected.  Instead, these compounds show 5, 6, and 7
peaks, resp.

<p>These peaks appear as splits of the average signal, and are the result of
<i>spin-spin coupling</i>.  Splitting of the peak does not reflect the
environment of the proton with respect to the electron (shown in the chemical
shift), but rather the environment of the proton affected by nearby protons. 
The molecule -CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, is shown with primary and secondary
group of protons:  a primary proton is in a field slight  increased or decreased
by the spins of the nearby secondary protons, depending upon whether the
secondary protons are aligned with or against the field.  Since there are
<i>two</i> secondary protons, each proton can have a spin with or against, and
the combination for the two can be with-with, with-against, against-with, or
against-against.  The effect on a primary proton of the against-with and with-
against is the same, soc a 1:2:1 effect on the applied field is seen, and this
is reflected in the areas of the split peaks.  This is true for all of the
primary protons.  Hence a triplet split about the average signal each would
observe is seen.  For the secondary protons, they are coupled to the primary
protons by a 1:3:3:1 splitting.  <i>In general a set of n equivalent protons
will split any nmr signal into n</i> + 1 <i>peaks.</i>

<p>With spin-spin coupling, the split peaks in the spectra often do not show a
symmetry unless the chemical shifts of the coupled protons are widely
separated.  If close to each other, the <q>inner</q> peaks of the split peaks
tend to be larger while the <q>outer</q> ones are relatively smaller.  This is
often a clue as which class of protons is coupling with each other;  that is,
the proton classes involved in coupling can be matched.

<p>Spin-spin coupling is expected to be observed only between <i>nonequivalent
neighboring protons</i>.  <q>Non-equivalence</q> is observed as differences in
chemical shifts.  <q>Neighboring</q> refers to protons on <i>adjacent</i>
carbons; sometimes protons more than one carbon away can couple, esp. if &pi;
bonds intervene.  Protons which are bonded to the <i>same</i> carbon but which
are nonetheless nonequivalent may show coupling.

<p>Important examples.  (1) 1,2-dichloroethane does not split its peaks because
all of the protons are equivalent even though they are on different carbons, and
spin-spin coupling requires nonequivalence.  (2) 1,2-dibromo-2-methylpropane
also shows no splitting for the reason that no proton is bonded to a carbon in
which an adjacent carbon has any protons, i.e., there are no neighboring
protons. (3) Isobutylene shows no splitting because both protons are
equivalent.  (4) On the other hand 2-bromopropene shows splitting, for the
reason that both protons are nonequivalent and they are bonded to the same
carbon.

<p>In interesting phenomenon is the coupling of protons to other nuclei. 
<sup>19</sup>F nuclei have spin and generate magnetic fields.  Fluorine nuclei
not only couple with each other, but also with protons.  <i>Absorption</i> by
fluorine nuclei do not appear in proton nmr spectra (their chemical shifts are
off-scale), but the <i>splitting</i> by fluorine nuclei of proton signals is
seen.  1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane gives produces a 1:2:1 triplet spaced at
11 Hz, even though both protons are equivalent and there are no other protons in
the molecule.

<h3>13.11 NMR.  Coupling constants</h3>

<p>The spacing between split peaks can be observed to have a value in Hz, and
the value in one set of split peaks (multiplet) matches the value in matched
set.  The value is called the <b>coupling constant</b>, <i>J</i>.  It is
important to remember that the J value remains constant no matter what the
applied field strength (or radiofrequency).  If the radiofrequency is altered,
the applied field strength is changed too, but only the chemical shift is
altered (prior to converting to ppm), not the spin-spin splitting.

<p>The absolute value of coupling constants depends a great
deal on the structure or conformational position held by the coupled protons. 
For example, in any pair of geometric isomers, J is always greater between
trans protons than between cis protons.  The size of J also varies consistently
with the electronegativity, such that one can assign configuration without
having both isomers.  (J is sometimes given a + or &mdash; designation to
permit theoretical correlations.)

alt="coupled protons in nmr signaling">

<h3>13.12 NMR. Complicated spectra.  Deuterium labeling</h3>

<p>Often, spectra are more complicated because the organic compound is quite
complex.  Computer are used to sort out the obvious details and will take over
the analysis as analyzing software improves.  Other methods can be used, such as
<b>double resonance</b> (or <i>double irradiation</i>), in which the spins of
two sets of protons can be <i>decoupled</i>, with simpler spectra obtained.  The
molecule is actually irradiated with two beams:  one is the usual whose
absorption is being measured, the other is a more intense beam whose frequency
varies from the first in such a way, that when the field strength is reached at
which a proton of interest absorbs, then the splitting protons are absorbing the
second frequency.  The splitting protons are <q>stirred up</q> and flip over
rapidly; this rapid flipping causes the signalling proton not to see them in
various spin alignments, but rather as a single <i>average</i> alignment.  The
spins are therefore decoupled, the signal appears as a single, unsplit peak.

<p>Deuterium labeling also simplifies spectra.  Deuterons have a much smaller
magnetic momet and absorb upfield and off-scale of the proton nmr spectrum.  It
couples with a proton very weakly, causing it to broaden the peak rather than
split it;  this effect is eliminated with decoupling anyway.  Such labeling is
in effect removing the proton but not altering the chemistry.  One can now
attribute an unknown signal to a particular proton by replacement of the proton
with a deuteron and observing changes in signals.

<h3>13.13 Equivalence of protons:  details</h3>

<p>Considering equivalence more thoroughly, it is important to keep in mind a
number of factors:  (a) <i>rotation about single bonds</i>, as in the
interconversion between conformations of substituted ethane or cyclohexanes; (b)
<i>inversion of molecules</i>, the turning inside-out of pyramidal molecules
like amines as an example; (c) <i>proton exchange</i>, for any functional group
with an exchangeable proton.  With these factors considered, protons which are
distinguishable by these criteria may still be considered equivalent because the
spectrometer does not resolve the <i>instantaneous</i> environment, but the
<i>average</i> environment.  However, if such an environmental control as
temperature makes the above factors significant, differences in spectra may be
observed.  In this way the spectrometer is much like a <q>slow</q> camera.

<p>On the methyl carbon of ethyl chloride, if the most stable (staggered)
conformation is obtained, two of the hydrogens assume a <i>gauche</i> position
with the Cl atom while the third proton is <i>anti</i>.  The hydrogen in the
anti position is not equivalent to the others, yet the nmr spectrum show a
triplet showing the H atoms are all equivalent.  The reason again is the
inability of the nmr spectrometer to gather the instantaneous picture.  Each
proton can be labeled, but all can rotate to the anti or gauche positions very
quickly and appear to the spectrometer to be the same.

<p>With diastereotopic protons, such as those on 1,2-dichloropropane in  13.7,
the protons can never assume an equivalent environment, no matter how much bond
rotation occurs.  The diastereotopic hydrogens on C1 not only couple with the
protons on C2, but they couple with each other.

<p>With cyclohexane, only one signal occurs for all 12 hydrogens, despite the
fact that there are 6 equatorial and 6 axial hydrogens.  However, because of the
bond rotation, the 6 holding equatorial positions can instantly hold axial
positions, and so can the other 6 change position.  If Br is substituted in one
position, the matter is different.  The axial and equatorial hydrogens are now
different;  replacing the hydrogens with Z would show <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i>-
diastereoisomerism.  All geminal hydrogens (hydrogens bonded to the same carbon)
would be in different average environments.

<p>Therefore in assessing equivalence, conformational isomerism is unimportant
for the purpose of predicting signals in nmr spectra.  It is true however, that
lowering the temperature sufficiently slows molecular rotational and
translational that the spectrometer is now able to resolve conformational
isomerism.  In fact, for cyclohexane, there is a point where the single peak
resolves into two (at -100&deg;), and this permitted the calculation for the
E<sub>act</sub> of 11 kcal/mol for conformation change.

<h3>13.14 The electron spin resonance (esr) spectrum</h3>

<p>Free radicals placed in magnetic fields respond similarly to nuclei when
irradiated at a certain frequency.  Electrons spin and have magnetic moments
lined with or against a magnetic field.  The absorption spectrum showing these
changes is an <i>electron spin resonance spectrum</i>.  The electron has a much
larger magnetic moment, and for this reason, more energy is required to reverse
the spin.  If H<sub>0</sub> = 3200 G, where nmr absorption is 14 MHz, esr
absorption is about 9000 MHz, which is in the microwave range.

<p>Spin-spin coupling is seen with electrons as with protons, and electrons
couple with the nearby protons, usually the protons bonded to the carbon holding
the free radical.  This presents information about structure as well.

<h3>13.15 Spectroscopic analysis of hydrocarbons. IR</h3>

<p>Looking more closely at the ir spectrum, bands due to <i>carbon-carbon
stretching</i> appear in the 1500 and 1600 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>  mark for
aromatic bonds, at 1650 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> for double bonds (shifted to ~1600
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> by conjugation), and at 2100 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> for
triple bonds.  These bands are unreliable however, since in fairly symmetrically
substituted alkenes and alkynes, they disappear because the vibrations do not
cause a change in the dipole moment essential for infrared absorption.  The more
useful bands are because of C-H vibrations.

<p>Absorption due to <i>C-H stretching</i> occurs at the high frequency end of
the spectrum, and is characteristic of the hybridization state of C holding the
H atom:  2800-3000 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> for tetrahedral carbon;  3000-3100
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> for trigonal carbon (alkenes and aromatics); and 3300
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> for digonal carbon (alkynes).

<p>Absorption due to various types of <i>C-H bending</i> occurs at the lower
frequencies.  Methyl and methylene groups absorb at 1430-1470
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; another band for the methyl group is at 1375
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  An <q>isopropyl</q> split is known:  a doublet with
equally intense peaks at 1370 and 1385 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and confirmed by a
band at 1170 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  The tert-butyl group gives an unsymmetrical
doublet:  1370 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>  (<i>strong</i>) and 1395
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> (<i>moderate</i>).

<p>Other C-H bending in alkenes and aromatics can be both in-plane and out-of-
plane, of which the latter is useful.  Out-of-plane bending in alkenes gives
strong bands in the 800-1000 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> region, and the exact
location depends on the nature and number of the substituents, and the
stereochemistry:

<p>When first confronted with an IR spectrum, the first distinction which can be
made is to determine whether the compound is aliphatic or aromatic.  Aliphatic
absorption is strongest at the high frequencies and missing below 900
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>, whereas aromatics have bands at the lower frequencies
between 650-900 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>, attributable to C-H out-of-plane
bending.  Aromatics also show C-H stretching at 3000-3100 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>,
and sometimes C-C stretching at 1500 and 1600 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> and C-H in-
plane bending in the 1000-1100 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> region.

<p>C-H stretching in alkenes is shown at 3000-3100 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and
most characteristically, strong out-of-plane C-H bending between 800-1000
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> (discussed above).

<p>Terminal alkynes shows a strong and sharp C-H stretching band at 3300
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> and carbon-carbon stretching at 2100
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  Disubstituted alkynes do not show the 3300
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> band (there is no C-H, of course), and if the two groups
are similar, may not show the 2100 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> band either.

<p>Alkyl halides are different from aryl halides in that they can be quite
reactive to many reactions in which aryl halides are most unreactive.  Alkyl
halides include a large number of compounds, whose physical properties are

<p>Because of the greater MW, RX compounds have higher b.p. than the
corresponding alkanes.  For any given alkyl group, the b.p. also increases with
the halogen MW, with fluorides lowest, and iodides the highest.  In spite of
their polarity, RX compounds are insoluble in water, probably because of an
inability to hydrogen bond.  Iodo, bromo, and polychloro compounds are denser
than water.

<p>Alkyl halides are prepared industrially by direct free radical halogenation
of hydrocarbons at high temperatures; the chlorides are generally prepared
because of the low cost of Cl<sub>2</sub>.  Other halides are prepared as they
would be in the laboratory:  1. acetylene + HCl, HgSO<sub>4</sub>  vinyl
chloride  2. ethylene + Cl<sub>2</sub>  1,2-dichloroethane (500&deg;)  vinyl
chloride

<p>Fluorine compounds are not prepared by direct fluorination, but by
replacement of Cl with inorganic fluorides:  1. methyl chloride +
Hg<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>  CH<sub>3</sub>F (b.p. -79&deg;) +
Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>   2. CCl<sub>4</sub> + SbF<sub>3</sub> 
CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>  (Freon-12, b.p. -28&deg;)

<p>Important polyfluorides (fluorocarbons) are prepared with inorganic fluorides
(Cobalt (III) fluoride is a convenient fluorinating agent): 
C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>16</sub> (<i>n</i>-heptane) + 32 CoF<sub>3</sub> 
C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>16</sub> (perfluoroheptane, b.p. 84&deg;) + 16 HF +
32 CoF<sub>2</sub>(2 CoF<sub>2</sub> + F<sub>2</sub>  2 CoF<sub>3</sub>)

<p>Alkyl halides are nearly always prepared from alcohols,
because the latter are available commercially.  The tendency for alcohols to
undergo rearrangement during replacement of -OH by -X is minimized by use of
phosphorous halides.  Certain halides, like benzylic or allylic halides, are
best made by free radical halogenation.  Alkyl iodides are usually prepared by
treating the corresponding bromide or chloride with NaI in acetone;  NaBr and
NaCl are not soluble in the solvent, precipitate, drive the reaction to
completion, and can then be filtered.

<h3>14.5 Reactions</h3>

<p>Halide ions in general are weak bases because of their electronegativity; 
there corresponding acids are very strong.  Attached to carbon, halide can be
easily displaced by other, stronger bases.  These bases have an unshared pair of
electrons, and are quite <b>nucleophilic</b>.  Halide ion is then a <i>good</i>
<b>leaving group</b> in alkyl halides (aryl and vinyl halides are forced to
leave with great difficulty)<b>.  </b>Besides substitution, alkyl halides
undergo elimination in basic conditions, so there is likely to be some
competition between elimination and substitution.

<h3>14.6 Alkyl sulfonates</h3>

<p>Although RX compounds are used in variety of syntheses since
X<sup>&minus;</sup> is a weak base and good leaving group, alkyl esters of
sulfonic acids, ArSO<sub>2</sub>OR, are also used since the sulfonates are very
weak bases as much as their acids are strong acids.  These compounds are
frequently employed in both <b>nucleophilic substitution </b>and <b>elimination
</b>reactions.

<p>The most common is the ester of <i>p</i>-toluenesulfonic acid, where the
<i>p</i>-toluenesulfonyl group is shorted to the name <i>tosyl</i> (Ts). 
<i>p</i>-Toluenesulfonyl chloride (<i>p</i>-
CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;) is called
<i>tosyl chloride</i> (TsCl) and esters of the acids are <i>tosylates</i>
(TsOR).  Other good sulfonate leaving groups are <i>brosylates</i> (Bs)
(<i>p</i>-BrC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;) and
<i>mesylates</i> (CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;) (Ms).

<h3>14.7 Rate of reaction:  effect of concentration.  Kinetics</h3>

<p>In looking at the rate of a reaction in chap. 2, it was found to depend on 3
factors:  collision freq., probability factors, and energy factor, with the last
factor of singular importance.  The rates of <i>different </i>reactions were
actually compared, with temperature and concentration kept constant for each
reaction.

<p>In studying the <i>individual</i> reaction however, manipulating experimental
conditions allows the obtaining of useful information.  Manipulating temperature
allows a determinination of E<sub>act</sub>.  <i>Changes in the
concentrations</i> of reactants also change the rate, because they change the
collision frequency.  The field of chemistry concerned with rate changes,
especially due to concentration changes, is called <b>kinetics.</b>

<h3>14.8 Kinetics of nucleophilic aliphatic substitution. 1st- and 2nd-order
reactions</h3>

<p>The reaction of methyl bromide with sodium hydroxide is
considered.  It is done in aqueous ethanol, in which both reactants are
soluble.

<p class="center">
CH<sub>3</sub>Br + OH<sup>&minus;</sup>  &rarr;
CH<sub>3</sub>OH + Br<sup>&minus;</sup>

<p>It would be expected that the rate depends upon the concentrations of both
reactants, [CH<sub>3</sub>Br] and [OH<sup>&minus;</sup>].  If one of the
reactants' concentrations were doubled, it is expected that the rate would
double;  if either cut in half, the reaction should be halved.  The rate is said
to depend upon the concentrations of both:

<p class="eqnserif">
rate = <i>k</i>[CH<sub>3</sub>Br][OH<sup>&minus;</sup>]

<p>The value <i>k</i> is called a <b>rate constant</b> and is used to express
the real values of the reaction under given conditions of the temperature and
solvent.  For example, at 55&deg; in 80% EtOH, the value of <i>k</i> is 0.0214 l
mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup>.

<p>Using another example, the reaction of tert-butyl bromide
with OH<sup>&minus;</sup> to
make tert-butyl alcohol:

<p class="center">
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CBr + OH<sup>&minus;</sup>  &rarr;
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>COH + Br<sup>&minus;</sup>

<p>If [RBr] is doubled, so is the rate;  if halved, so is the rate.  But if
[OH<sup>&minus;</sup>] is changed in any way, the rate is not affected.  The
rate is therefore independent of [OH<sup>&minus;</sup>] and is expressed:

<p class="eqnserif">
rate = <i>k</i>[RBr]

<p>The <i>k</i> value in 80% EtOH at 55&deg; is 0.010 s<sup>&minus;</sup><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span>, meaning that,
whatever the concentration of OH<sup>&minus;</sup>, 0.010 mole tert-butyl
bromide reacts in one second.

<p>The first reaction is said to follow <b>second-order kinetics</b>, because
rate depends on two substances.  The rate of the second reaction depends only
upon one substance, and is a <b>first-order kinetic </b>reaction.

<p>Why these nucleophilic substitution reactions follow different kinetics is
probably because nucleophilic substitution can follow two mechanisms.  Thanks in
large part to the work of Ingold and coworkers, these reactions have been
theorized.

<h3>14.9-.11 The S<sub>N</sub>2
reaction: mechanism and kinetics.  Stereochemistry.  Reactivity</h3>

<p>In the methyl bromide reaction, the simplest way to account for the kinetics
is a collision between hydroxide ion and the methyl bromide molecule. 
OH<sup>&minus;</sup> attacks at a face of the carbon atom which is opposite the
position of the Br atom.  Collisions with sufficient energy result in formation
of a C-OH bond and at the same time break the C-Br bond.  The transition state
probably appears as a partially bonded OH and partially bonded Br atom (see
diagram).  The OH group has begun to lose its negative charge as it begins to
share electrons with the carbon atom, while Br atom begins to acquire a partial
negative charge, eventually to leave.  Solvent is also participating in the
reaction, which breaking of ion-dipole bonds with OH and forming them with Br
atom.

<p>In the transition state, all three H atoms lie in a plane (having lost
tetrahedral arrangement), with the most stable bond angles in this state being
120&deg;.  The OH and Br atoms are like axles to a wheel, where the H atoms
serve as spokes.  The mechanism of this reaction is called
<b>S<sub>N</sub>2</b>:  <i>substitution nucleophilic
bimolecular.</i>  In general S<sub>N</sub>2-type reactions follow second-order
kinetics.

<p>2-Bromooctane and 2-octanol have chiral centers, and their resolved
enantiomers have optical activity.  The configurations have been determined (see
diagram);  the (&mdash;)-bromide and (&mdash;)-alcohol have the same
configuration, that is, -OH occupies the same place and -Br, with all other
groups being the same.

<p class="center"><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image059.png"
alt="SN2 reaction to produce alcohols from halo-alkanes">

<p>When the (&mdash;)-2-bromooctane reacts with NaOH under conditions favoring
second-order kinetics, the product is (+)-2-octanol, with 100% optical purity. 
The reaction can be seen to involve <b>inversion of configuration</b>, since the
OH group appears to have pushed Br out from the opposite direction.  (It is
insufficient to conclude that a reactant which is designated with the R
configuration and which yields a product with the S configuration has undergone
inversion of the absolute configuration; the product and reactant should be
drawn and compared.)  With all S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, complete
sterechemical inversion is the rule.  As proof, the reaction above shows that an
optically pure stereoisomer yields an optically pure isomer with a configuration
different from the reference.

<p>Reactivity of molecules to S<sub>N</sub>2 attack can be affected by the
nonreactive groups attached to carbon, for the very reason that they are
involved in the inversion of configuration reaction.  As hydrogens are replaced
by larger groups, as in methyl bromide to ethyl bromide to isopropyl bromide to
tert-butyl bromide, crowding which can inhibit formation of the transition state
might be expected.  The differences that are observed in the rate of two
S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are chiefly due to <b>steric factors</b>, and not to
electronic factors.  In other words, rate differences emerge with the bulk of
groups attached to the carbon and do not depend upon the withdrawing or
releasing of electrons.

<p>As an example, the rate of S<sub>N</sub>2 attack by I<sup>&minus;</sup> ion 
is compared for a number of reactants:  methyl, 150 &gt; ethyl, 1 &gt; 
Isopropyl, 0.01 &gt; tert-butyl, 0.001.  And for the aromatics, benzyl &gt; 
&alpha;-phenylethyl &gt; &beta;-phenylisopropyl, as would be expected for least 
to most substituted.

<p>The order of reactivity of RX to S<sub>N</sub>2 attack is therefore: 
CH<sub>3</sub>X &gt; 1&deg; &gt; 2&deg; &gt; 3&deg;

<h3>14.12-.15 The S<sub>N</sub>1
reaction: mechanism and kinetics.  Rate-determining step.  Stereochemistry. 
Reactivity.  Rearrangement</h3>

<p>As shown earlier, the reaction of tert-butyl bromide with NaOH follows first-
order kinetics.  If the rate appears to be independent of
OH<sup>&minus;</sup> ion, then that means the reaction upon which the rate
depends does not involve OH<sup>&minus;</sup>.

<p>This is consistent with the following mechanism:

<p>(1) (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CBr
 (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C<sup>+</sup> + Br<sup>&minus;</sup>   <i>slow</i>

<p>(2) (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>&minus;</sup>
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>COH    <i>fast</i>

<p>

Step one shows the dissociation of tert-butyl bromide into the tert-butyl
carbonium ion, then rapid combination with the hydroxide ion. The single step 
which often determines the rate of an overall reaction or series of reactions 
is called the <b>rate-determining step.</b> It is no surprise that the rate- 
determining step involves breaking of the breaking of a bond, which requires 
energy, in this case supplied by the solvent dipoles interacting with the 
nascent Br ion (although each is weak, together they supply 110-150 kcal/mol!). 
The mechanism of this reaction is called <b>S<sub>N</sub>1</b>: <i>substitution 
nucleophilic unimolecular</i>.

<p>
Since the rate of the reaction depends on how fast ionization of the alkyl
halide occurs, the rate itself depends only on the concentration of the RX
compound.

<p>
The set of reactions
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/image060.png"
alt="">

<p>
will have a rate equation for the formation of the product which will be:
<p>
The rate will depend directly upon A. The larger C is, the larger the rate as
well. The larger B is, the greater the reversal of step 1, and the slower the
product formation. Now if the term k<sub>2</sub>[C] is much larger than k<sub>
6</sub>-1[B], or the ratio of the two is much smaller than 1, the denominator
term drops out such that rate depends only upon k<sub>1</sub>[A]. For k<sub>
2</sub>[C] to be much larger than k<sub>-1</sub>[B], this means that step (2)
must be very fast compared to step (1), which is true if step (1) is to be the
rate- determining step. If R is considered to be the carbonium intermediate,
then the reaction mechanism is clear.
<p>
Considering that a primary bromide reacts by S<sub>N</sub>2 and a tertiary
bromide by S<sub>N</sub>1, it should not be surprising that <i>sec</i>-butyl 
bromide reacts with a combination of the two mechanisms. Increases in [OH<sup> 
&minus;</sup>] would be expected to speed up a second-order, but not the 
first-order reaction; at high [OH<sup>&minus;</sup>], the second-order reaction 
is so much faster for <i>sec</i>-butyl bromides that the reaction is almost 
entirely by S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism.
<p>
By lowering [OH<sup>&minus;</sup>], the first-order reaction then becomes
important. ThI guee stereochemistry of the reaction has been followed with
(&mdash;)-2-bromooctane in which a low [OH<sup>&minus;</sup>] concentration was
used; the product was (+)-2-octanol, which suggests that configuration of the
product obtained by a S<sub>N</sub>2-type mechanism. However, there was a loss
of some optical activity: 100% optically pure bromide reactant yields about 66%
optically pure alcohol, which means that the product contains some inverted
compound and a racemic modification (<b>partial racemization</b> has occurred).
<p>
This clearly results from the formation of a carbonium ion intermediate, which
can undergo back-side or front-side attack by the OH<sup>&minus;</sup>
nucleophile. However, a fully racemic modification would obtain, and it is 
true that a greater amount of the product shows inversion of configuration 
rather than retention. <i>This is presumably due to the departing halide ion 
having not completely departed before nucleophilic attack commences, and this 
attack is probably hindered a bit on the face of the carbon where the departing 
halide is.</i> Hence back-side attack with inversion of configuration occurs at 
a faster rate. In some cases, racemization is almost complete: a- phenylethyl 
chloride (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHClCH<sub>3</sub>) is converted to the 
alcohol under S<sub>N</sub>1 conditions with 87% racemization and 13% inversion.
Under S<sub>N</sub>2 conditions, there is complete inversion without
racemization.
<p>
Considering that S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions call for a carbonium ion forming, the
greater the stability of the carbonium, the greater the opportunity for an
S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction to occur.  Hence, the order of reactivity of RX
is:
<p class="center">
allyl, benzyl &gt; 3&deg; &gt; 2&deg; &gt; 1&deg; &gt; CH<sub>3</sub>X
<p>
For the reaction RBr + H<sub>2</sub>O (in the presence of HCOOH) ROH + HBr,
assuming the reaction of methyl Br is 1.0; the relative rate for ethyl Br is
1.7; for isopropyl, 45; and for tert-butyl, 100 million. Adding formic acid to
water helps promote the ionization. While S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions were seen to
be affected by the <i>bulk</i> of the substituent groups, S<sub>N</sub>1
reactions are subject to <b>electronic factors</b>, depending upon the ability
of the substituent groups to release or withdraw electrons.
<p>
Since S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions involve carbonium ion intermediates,
rearrangements to form the most stable ion should be expected. Neopentyl
bromide under S<sub>N</sub>1 conditions reacts invariably rearranges to a more
stable tert-pentyl cation before reacting with ethanol; there is virtually no
rearrangement in its reaction with ethoxide ion under S<sub>N</sub>2 conditions.

<h3>14.16 S<sub>N</sub>1 vs. S<sub>N</sub>2</h3>
<p>
Nucleophilic substitutions following first-order kinetics undergo racemization
and rearrangement, with reactivity being greater for 3&deg; and lower for
primary and methyl halides. With nuc. sub. of the second-order, there is
complete stereochemical inversion and the reactivity sequence is exactly
opposite. In general, it is found that CH<sub>3</sub>X and 1&deg; RX compounds
undergo an S<sub>N</sub>2-type reaction, 3&deg; RX undergo S<sub>N</sub>
1-type reaction, and 2&deg; RX is mixed.
<p>
Some control as to which mechanism predominates can be exerted by a change of
experimental conditions. These factors are:

<ol>
<li><i>concentration of the nucleophilic reagent</i>: high concentration of the
nucleophile favors an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, low concentration calls on
S<sub>N</sub>1.
<li><i>nature of the nucleophile</i>: neopentyl bromide was shown to react
ethoxide ion in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, and ethanol in S<sub>N</sub>1.
Ethoxide is more strongly nucleophilic (and pushes the halide out); ethanol is
a rather weak nucleophile and waits to be invited in.
<li><i>solvent polarity</i>: In the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, ionization of the
RX is possible if the energy needed to reach the transition state is supplied
by dipole-dipole interactions in the solvent and solvents supporting the polar
transition state (a developing positive carbonium ion and a developing negative
halide ion). An 80% ethanol solvent is much less polar than pure water, so use
of water ought to promote S<sub>N</sub>1-type reactions. With S<sub>N</sub>2
reactions, there is no polar transition state (a diminishing negative charge on
hydroxide is found on the other side by a developing negative charge on halide
ion). Increasing solvent polarity slows down the S<sub>N</sub>2-type reactions.
</ol>

<h3>14.17 Solvolysis</h3>
<p>
RX compounds dissolved in solvents often undergo reactions directly with the
solvent. This is called <b>solvolysis</b>, where the solvent molecule is 
sufficiently nucleophilic to cause replace the halide. Because no strong 
nucleophile is present, the reaction is presumed to be an S<sub>N</sub>1-type, 
requiring formation of a carbonium ion intermediate. A problem with determining 
the kinetics of this reaction to see whether it is a matter of the solvent 
pushing out the halide (as in S<sub>N</sub>2) or stabilizing ionization (as in 
S<sub>N</sub>1), is that the solvent concentration does not change appreciably.
<p>
The solvent no doubt provides <i>nucleophilic assistance</i> to solvolysis, the
strength of assistance depending upon the nucleophilic power of the solvent:
water and alcohols are strongly nucleophilic solvents, acetic acid is weaker,
HCOOH is weaker yet, and TFA is very weak. Reactivity of tertiary substrates to
solvolysis depends little on nucleophilic power, and more on solvent polarity.
With secondary substrates, more nucleophilic assistance is needed. With primary
substrates, the strength of the solvent molecule acting as a nucleophile in a
one-step reaction is clear.

<h3>14.18 Elimination:  E2 and E1</h3>
<p>
In the dehydrohalogenation reaction to prepare alkenes, it was observed that
basic attack on a proton on a carbon adjacent to a carbon holding a halide was
met with the simultaneous separation of the halide ion, assisted by the solvent
molecules interacting with the halide. This is an <b>E2</b> reaction:
<i>bimolecular elimination</i>.
<p>
In a two-step reaction, the halide in RX compounds, especially those capable of
forming very stable carbonium ions, can be induced to leave the alkyl function,
leaving a carbonium ion behind. The second step has some nucleophile removing a
proton with formation of the C=C bond. This is an <b>E1</b> reaction: <i>
unimolecular elimination</i>.
<p>
The order of reactivity to either E1 or E2 elimination is the same: 3&deg; &gt;
2&deg; &gt; 1&deg;. The sequence reflects in the E2 reaction the relative
stabilities of the alkene products which are formed, while in the E1 reaction,
it reflects the relative stabilities of the carbonium ion formed in the first
step.
<p>
The E2 reaction follows second-order kinetics, while E1 is first-order and
independent of the concentration of nucleophile.

<h3>14.19-.20 Evidence for E1 and E2 mechanism</h3>
<p>
The evidence for the E1 mechanism comes from the fact that:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>elimination follows first-order kinetics
<li>the effect of structure on reactivity is similar to that of S<sub>N</sub>1
reactions
<li>reactions are accompanied by rearrangement, where structure permits
</ol>
<p>
The evidence for the E2 mechanism comes from the fact that:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>elimination follows second-order kinetics
<li>there is no observed rearrangments
<li>there is a large deuterium isotope effect
<li>there is not hydrogen-deuterium exchange
<li>there is a large element effect shown
</ol>
<p>
Under E2 conditions, isopropyl bromide treated with NaOEt undergoes
dehydrobromination 7 times faster than (CD<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHBr: the
existence of an isotope effect reveals that the rate-determining step involves
a transition state in which a C-H bond is broken.
<p>
A plausible mechanism which discounts E2-type elimination is one that involves
a <b>carbanion</b> intermediate. In this reaction, the base abstracts a proton, 
leaving the electrons with carbon (and a negative charge) while the halide
remains attached to the adjacent carbon. To truly distinguish among the two
possibilities, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br
(&beta;-phenylethyl bromide) was dehydrohalogenated
in C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OD with NaOEt. If carbanions are intermediates,
then when <sup>&minus;</sup>OEt abstracts a proton, the reaction can proceed to
form the elimination product, but the carbanion base can abstract a deuteron to
reform the starting material. At the end of the reaction, it should be possible
to find some of the starting material or elimination product labeled with D if
there is a carbanion intermediate. None is found, which means that, if
carbanions are intermediates, the rate of halide leaving is greater than for D
exchanging for H. Proving that the leaving by the halide is not possible using
isotope effect studies as for D and H, whose masses differ two-fold, since the
differences in masses of isotopic halides is minimal.
<p>
J. Bunnett has shown evidence <i>against</i> carbanion mechanism by the <b>
element effect</b>. In S<sub>N</sub> and S<sub>N</sub>2 displacements,
reactivity follows the sequence: R&mdash;I &gt; R&mdash;Br &gt; R&mdash;Cl &gt;
R&mdash;F. The ease of breaking the C-X bond depends upon the strength: R-Br
react 25-50 times as fast as R-Cl. With elimination, reactivity similarly
follows the same sequence, so the rate of breaking the C-X bond <i>does</i>
affect the overall reaction. Were a carbanion intermediate formed, reversion to
starting material would occur many times before loss of the X<sup>&minus;</sup>;
 the isotopic exchange experiments show this does not happen.

<h3>14.21 Orientation of elimination  The variable E2 transition state</h3>
<p>
In the dehydrohalogenation of sec-butyl bromide (chap. 5), a mixture of isomers
was obtained: 81% 2-butene and 19% 1-butene. It was explained that this
orientation results from the alkene character of the transition state, with the
transition state leading to the more stable alkene being reached more easily.
Predominant formation of the more stable isomer is called <b>Saytzeff
orientation</b>, after A. Saytzeff who formulated the rule in 1875.
<p>
Orientation is not always Saytzeff. If the halides in the elimination of 2-
hexyl halide by NaOCH<sub>3</sub> are I, Br, and Cl, orientation is Saytzeff
(2- hexene). But with fluoride, the less substituted alkene obtains (1-hexene);
this is called the <b>Hofmann orientation</b>. The table shows the distribution
between 1- and 2-hexene depending upon the starting 2-hexyl halide.

<p>
The observations are better understood in terms of what Bunnett called the <i>
variable transition state</i> theory of E2 elimination. The transition state
can be represented as a spectrum of three different reactions: (1) one TS has a
carbonium-like state, in which the C-X bond is already well on its way to being
broken&mdash;forming a carbonium ion&mdash;before base B begins to abstract the
proton; (2) another TS is a carbanion-like TS, in which the base has abstracted
the proton a great deal to leave a carbanion intermediate as the C-X bond
resists being broken until the final moment; (3) the last TS is described as
being between the two extremes, with the C-X bond broken to the same degree
that the base is removing the proton. This last TS has much <i>alkene
character</i>, and the orientation is considered to by Saytzeff.
<p>
For the carbonanion-like TS, it is stabilized by electron-withdrawing
substituents which attempt to disperse the negative charge, and destabilized by
electron-releasing groups which tend to concentrate negative charge. For the
carbonium-like TS, C-X bond breaking has proceeded considerably before the C-H
bond is broken, giving carbonium-ion like character. The orientation is
expected to less Saytzeff.
<p>
With iodides, there is considerable breaking of both bonds in the TS, with much
alkene character, so orientation is Saytzeff. From I to F, the C-X bond becomes
stronger, not breaking as fast as the base abstracting the proton. The base
attacks the primary hydrogen in this case, because is has fewer electron-
releasing groups on the carbon which tend to destabilize this TS. Hence the
Hofmann orientation.
<p>
Under E2 conditions with bases like KOH and CH<sub>3</sub>ONa, most RX
compounds eliminate Saytzeff. R<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup> compounds give Hofmann
elimination usually. ROSO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> compounds fall in
between. Choice of solvent, base, and the reactant stereochemistry affect
orientiaton a great deal: the %age of 1-hexene jumps from 33% to 91% when 2-
hexyl chloride is treated with t-BuOK/t-BuOH rather than methoxide/methyl
alcohol, probably because of steric considerations.

<h3>14.22 Stereochemistry of elimination</h3>
<p>
1-Bromo-1,2-diphenylpropane
[C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHBrCH(CH<sub>3</sub>)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>] has
two chiral centers, and can exist as two pairs of enantiomers.  When the (1R,2R)
and (1S,2S) enantiomers are dehydrohalogenated, the product is exclusively
<i>cis</i>-1,2-diphenyl-1-propene.  When its enantiomeric pair of diastereomers,
(1S,2R) and (1R,2S) are treated, only the <i>trans</i> product is obtained.  If
the first set of diastereomers are drawn in a staggered conformation in which
the Br atom is <i>anti</i> to proton to be abstracted, the E2 reaction is seen
to produce the <i>cis</i> alkene.  If the other diastereomeric pair is drawn
with the same staggered conformation, but proton <i>anti</i> to Br, the E2 is
easily seen to be <i>trans</i>.
<p>
This spatial relationship between the halide and the abstracted proton is
termed <i>anti</i> elimination. If cyclic compounds are considered instead of
the open-chain, the 1,2-substituents can assume the anti-conformation only by
occupying axial positions, which is possible only if they are <i>trans</i> to
each other. <i>Neomenthyl chloride</i> (in diagram) undergoes E2 elimination to
form mixture of mostly 3-menthene, less of the 2-menthene, expected since the
3- menthene is the more highly substituted alkene. Its diastereomer <i>menthyl
chloride</i> is converted on the other hand exclusively to the 2-menthene.
<p>
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/(neo)menthyl-dehalogenation.png"
alt="products of dehalogenation of neomenthyl chloride and menthyl chloride">
<p>
Although the obvious difference between neomenthyl and menthyl chloride is that
the halogen is on the opposite side, with neomenthyl chloride, there are two
hydrogen atoms which are <i>trans</i> to it on the adjacent carbons, while with
menthyl chloride, there is only on hydrogen <i>trans</i> to it on the carbon
which eventually is involved in the double bond. So only the <i>trans</i>-1,
2-substituents are able to form the <i>anti</i>-conformation apparently
required in E2 eliminations.
<p>
Recent developments now show E2 eliminations can occur by syn-elimination: in
the transition state the hydrogen and leaving group are in the <i>eclipsed</i>
(or <i>gauche</i>) conformation, but this is uncommon for RX compounds and seen
more with quaternary ammonium salts and alkyl sulfonates. On reason that the H
atom and the leaving group should be periplanar (meaning syn or anti, with the
latter most propable), is the the p orbitals of the carbons to be involved in
&pi; bonding should be in a position to overlap, and such conformations assist
the development of alkene character.

<h3>14.23 Elimination vs. substitution</h3>
<p>
In elimination reactions, the base attacks the proton, the leaving group falls
out and the alkene is formed. In substitution reactions, the base attacks the
carbon (from the back side), and the leaving group is pushed out. It was
mentioned that acetylides are very strong bases (stronger than OH<sup>&minus;
</sup>) such that if synthesis of higher alkynes was desired using RX compounds,
 which is in effect a substitution, then the RX compound should be 1&deg;.
Moreover, to promote the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, a low-polarity solvent
(NH<sub>3</sub> or ether) was used.
<p>
The same is true for all RX compounds. If RX is 3&deg;, expect formation of the
E2 elimination product. If RX is 1&deg;, expect formation of the S<sub>N</sub>2
substitution product (note inversion of configuration for chiral centers).
<p>
When attempting to synthesize a 3&deg; alcohol from a 3&deg; RX compound, it is
important to choose conditions which favor the S<sub>N</sub>1-type reaction:
reagent with low nucleophilic power, solvents of high polarity. Simply boiling
with water is the usual course, which serves as solvent and nucleophile. Still
the elimination product comes out in significant yield. Alcoholic KOH for use
in dehydrohalogenation was chosen for a reason in forming alkenes: the solvent
is of low polarity, the nucleophile strong, and these are ideal elimination
conditions.

<h3>14.24 Analysis of alkyl halides</h3>
<p>
fsSimilar to alkanes in that they are (1) insoluble in cold concentrated H<sub>
2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, (2) inert to Br<sub>2</sub> in CCl<sub>4</sub>; (3) do
not react to KMnO<sub>4</sub> or CrO<sub>3</sub>, RX can be distinguished from
alkanes in the qualitative analysis reaction which shows the presence of
halogen (ch. 2).
<p>

Halogen presence can often be assessed without resort to sodium fusion or
Sch&ouml;niger oxidation: warm the unknown for a few min. with alcoholic 
AgNO<sub>3</sub>, a precipitate should form which is insoluble in dilute
HNO<sub>3</sub>. The reactivity toward alcoholic AgNO<sub>3</sub> follows the
sequence RI &gt; RBr &gt; RCl, or for a given halogen decreases in the order
3&deg; &gt; 2&deg; &gt; 1&deg;, which shows that the reaction depends upon how
easily a carbonium ion is formed and which C-X bond is weaker. Allyl and benzyl
halides react quickly! The AgNO<sub>3</sub> reaction has been studied very well,
 with Ag<sup>+</sup> believe to assist the development of the S<sub>N</sub>1-type reaction by
pulling halide away. (Vinyl and aryl halides are unreactive). Spectroscopic
analysis is also quite useful as mentioned elsewhere.

<h2>Chap. 15 Alcohols.  Preparation and physical properties</h2>

<h3>15.1-.5 Structure. Classification. Nomenclature.  Physical properties. 
Industrial source</h3>
<p>
Alcohols have the general formula <b>ROH</b>. R can be any alkyl group,
open-chain or cyclic, with double bond, halogen, aromatic ring. Alcohols
attached directly to the aromatic ring are called <i>phenols</i>. ROH compounds
are classified as <i>primary</i>, <i>secondary</i>, or <i>tertiary</i>,
depending on the number of other carbon atoms attached to it, as is usual.
<p>
Nomenclature of alcohols has 3 different systems. The system of common names
uses the alkyl group naming followed by the word <i>alcohol</i>, as in ethyl
alcohol. The <b>carbinol</b> system is convenient in that it considers all
alcohols to be derived from <i>methyl alcohol</i>. Triphenylcarbinol is
methanol but the 3 H atoms are replaced by phenyl groups; sec-butylcarbinol is
the IUPAC 2-methyl-1-butanol. And the IUPAC system is the third and most
versatile. Diols are often called as glycols.
<p>
Unlike the previous compounds studied, which have low m.p. and b.p. values
because of weak intermolecular forces holding them, and which are quite soluble
in nonpolar solvents but insoluble in solvents like water, alcohols have a very
polar -OH group, and hydrogen bonding becomes possible.

<p>Comparing boiling points, hydrocarbons depend mostly upon molecular weight
and shape, expected of molecules which are held together in the liquid phase by
van der Waals forces.  Alcohols show similar patterns in that b.p. increases
with carbon number and decreases with branching.  What makes ROH compounds is
that they boil much higher than their analogues or than substances of the same
MW, even higher than other cmpds. with considerable polarity (see table below). 
The reason is that they are <i>associated liquids</i>, meaning that hydrogen
bonding plays an important part.  With the ether and aldehyde, all H atoms are
bonded to carbon, and not to a more electronegative element.

<p>IR spectroscopy also has demonstrated the nature of hydrogen bonding.  Dilute
solutions of ethanol in CCl<sub>4</sub> or in the gas phase show little
association, and the O&mdash;H stretch is 3640 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  As the
concentration is increased however, a broader band at 3350
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> is now observed:  hydrogen bonding to a second oxygen
apparently weakens the O&mdash;H bond, lowers the energy and hence the vibration
frequency.

<p>Small alcohols do not much differ from water in the miscibility since
hydrogen bonding is the significant chemistry here.  But as the aliphatic chain
gets longer on the normal primary alcohols, the miscibility drops, the
borderline being at 4 or 5 carbons.  Polyhydroxy alcohols are very soluble in
the water, owing to the many OH groups.

<p>If an organic chemist were allowed to choose ten aliphatic compounds with
which to be stranded on a desert island, he would almost certainly pick
alcohols.  It is because from alcohols, nearly every kind of other compound can
be made:  alkenes, RX, ROR, RCHO, RCOR, RCOOH, etc.  Alcohols are not only
reactants but the solvents used to carry reactions or recrystallize products. 
Industrially, alcohols can be obtained by the <b>hydration of alkenes</b>
obtained from petroleum cracking, and by <b>fermentation of carbohydrates.</b> 
For hydration of alkenes, either water addition itself or catalyzed by
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> allows the synthesis of alcohol according to
Markovnikov's rule (can be a detriment if trying to synthesize <i>n</i>-
alkyl alcohols).  From fermentation of sugars by yeast, ethanol is still
prepared; the sugar source can be molasses from cane sugar or grain starch.  If
grain starch is used, <i>fusel oil</i> can be obtained as well, which is a
mixture of other primary alcohols:  mostly isopentyl alcohol, rest is n-
propanol, isobutyl alcohol, and 2-methyl-1-butanol.

<h3>15.6 Ethyl alcohol</h3>

<p>Ethanol is an important chemical for the entire world.  Used as a solvent for
lacquers, varnishes, perfumes, flavorings; a medium of chemical reactions; used
in recrystallizations.  Ethyl alcohol is medically classified as a
<i>hypnotic</i> (sleep producer), and is less toxic than other alcohols. 
Ethanol typically comes as the 95% product because 95:5 ethanol:water is a
binary azeotrope boiling at 78.15&deg; (ethanol b.p. = 78.3&deg;), and further
concentration of ethanol by distillation is not therefore possible.  Pure
ethanol (absolute alcohol) is obtained by using another azeotrope, this one a
ternary azeotrope boiling at 64.9&deg;:  7.5:18.5:74 water:ethanol:benzene.  For
removal of every possible trace of water, the alcohol can be treated with Mg
metal to produce insoluble Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, from which the alcohol can be
distilled.

<p>
In the above syntheses, one functional group can be converted to the alcohol,
retaining the carbon skeleton, or in the case of the Grignard synthesis, the
carbon skeleton can be expanded at the same time the alcohol is constructed. 
While it is alkyl halides that are usually prepared from alcohols rather than
the reverse, an useful synthesis of benzyl alcohol from toluene has toluene
being chlorinated and then treated with aqueous NaOH to make the alcohol.

<h3>15.8 Oxymercuration-demercuration</h3>
<p>
Mercuric acetate is known to react with alkenes in the presence of water to
produce hydroxymercurials. When reduced with NaBH<sub>4</sub> or other suitable
reductant, the product is an alcohol. Although the reaction amounts to
hydration, the reaction is convenient, fast, takes place under mild conditions,
and yields can be over 90%.
<p>
Alkene is added to an aqueous Hg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> solution diluted with
tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the reaction is complete in minutes. The
organomercurial is then reduced <i>in situ</i> by NaBH<sub>4</sub> (Hg can be
recovered as a ball of elemental mercury). The reaction is very regiospecific,
with single products showing Markovnikov addition.
<p>
The first oxymercuration step is believed to cause formation of a <i>cyclic
mercurinium</i> ion, similar to the cyclic halonium ions formed in halogen
addition. Olah (1971) has spectroscopic evidence that cyclic mercurinium ions
are formed. The absence of an rearrangment and the high degree of
stereospecificity (<i>anti</i>) argues against the open carbonium intermediate.
The nucleophilic solvent (water) then opens up the cyclic intermediate in a
back-side attack, resulting in the <i>anti</i>-addition, and similar to an
S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. A difference here is that orientation is to the more
highly substituted carbon, suggesting that the cyclic mercurinium transition
state has some S<sub>N</sub>1 character.
<p>
The demercuration step is not well understood, although free radicals are
thought involved. Demercuration is not stereospecific, and can be accompanied
by rearrangement in some cases.
<p>
The use of mercuration can involve nucleophilic solvents other than water as
well, which yield products other than alcohols.

<h3>15.9-.11 Hydroboration-oxidation.  Orientation and stereochemistry. 
Mechanism</h3>

<p>
Alkenes react with diborane (BH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> to yield alkylboranes,
R<sub>3</sub>B, which can be oxidized to alcohols. For example, ethylene reacts
exhaustively with diborane to produce triethylborane, which is treated <i>in
situ</i> with alkaline hydrogen peroxide to produce 3 moles ethanol and boric
acid, with high yields.
<p>
Diborane is a dimer of the hypothetical borane (BH<sub>3</sub>). Borane does
exist as a monomer dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, its oxygen providing a lone
pair for the boron atom. THF is one of the solvents used, for this reason, to
promote the reaction, but ether and <q>diglyme</q> (<i>di</i>ethylene
<i>gly</i>col <i>m</i>ethyl <i>e</i>ther, CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>
OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub> 3</sub>) are also used. Diborane is
commercially available in THF solution.
<p>
The addition is regiospecific, with the preferred product the opposite of the
oxymercuration-demercuration reaction or the direct acid-catalyzed hydration.
Propylene form n-propanol, 1-butene forms n-butanol, isobutylene forms isobutyl
alcohol, 2-methyl-2-butene forms 3-methyl-2-butanol, and 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene
forms 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol. Unlike with oxymercuration-demercuration, <i>
rearrangements do not occur with hydroboration-oxidation</i>. This is
presumably because carbonium ions are not intermediates. Addition is also
<b><i>syn</i></b>, as illustrated in the reaction of 1,2- dimethylcyclopentene:
<p>
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/image066.png"
alt="hydroboration-oxidation of 1,2-dimethylcyclopentene">
<p>
(The hydroboration-oxidation reaction discovered by HC Brown, originally an
inorganic chemist, was a result of work done to find volatile uranium compounds,
 in the course of which LiAlH<sub>4</sub> and NaBH<sub>4</sub> were first made
and their reducing properties studied.)
<p>
The mechanism leading to anti-Markovnikov addition has been elucidated. With
electrophilic addition of an acid HZ, the proton is the electrophile adding in
a way to produce the more stable carbonium ion intermediate. But with borane,
the lack of a complete octet in the boron atom makes it the center of acidity
rather than H.

<p class="center">
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/image067.png"
alt="hydroboration mechanism in the addition to the alkene double bond">

<p>
In forming the transition state however, there is no carbonium ion
intermediate.  As the carbon becomes electron-deficient

<p>
H crystals exist as Li<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>&minus;</sup>.  And
H<sup>+</sup> does not exist by itself, but is only theoretical.

<h3>15.12 Grignard synthesis of alcohols</h3>

<p>Grignard reagents have the forumula RMgX, prepared by mixing Mg with RX in
anhydrous ether.  The R can be any 1&deg;, 2&deg;, 3&deg; alkyl, allylic,
aralkyl (benzyl), or aryl (phenyl or substituted phenyl).  The X can be Cl, Br,
or I; arylmagnesium chlorides must be made in cyclic ether solvents (THF)
instead of ethyl ether.  Certain reagents with <b>carbonyl</b> (aldehydes,
ketones) group functions when added to RMgX will react to produce alcohols;  C=O
bonds are unsaturated like C=C bonds.

<p>Both the carbon-oxygen bond in the carbonyl and the Grignard reagent have
unsymmetrical charge distributions, that is, they are polar.  With the carbonyl
carbon, being the less electronegative, it has a slight positive charge and
should attract nucleophiles (bases), while the oxygen should attract
electrophiles (acids).  The C-Mg bond is the site of polarity in the Grignard: 
the more electronegative carbon is slightly negative (basic) and attack the
carbonyl carbon, bonding to it.  The MgX group subsequently attaches to the
carbonyl oxygen, with some degree of polarity as well.  By addition of a
stronger acid like water, the alcohol is subsequently formed.  A gelatinous
Mg(OH)X is formed, and dilute mineral acid (HCl or H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
is added to solubilize Mg(OH)X, which it does by forming Mg<sup>2+</sup>,
X<sup>&minus;</sup>, and H<sub>2</sub>O.

<h3>15.13 Products of the Grignard synthesis</h3>
<p>
When RMgX is added to formaldehyde, the product is a 1&deg; alcohol in which
the R group has been extended by 1 carbon. With higher aldehydes (R&prime;CHO),
the product is a 2&deg; alcohol, with the R groups bound around the aldehyde
carbon (R&mdash;CHOH&mdash;R&prime;). With ketones, the product is clearly a
3&deg; alcohol, with all R groups centered around the alcoholic carbon
(RR&prime;R&prime;&prime;COH).
<p>
RMgX add also to the cyclic ether <i>ethylene oxide</i>, which in the end makes
a 1&deg; alcohol with two carbons effectively added. The ring strain in the
&sigma; bonds of the cyclic ether accounts for the energy of the reaction.

<h3>15.14-.15 Planning and limitations of the Grignard synthesis</h3>
<p>
In planning a Grignard synthesis, it is necessary to examine the structure of
the alcohol product: of the groups attached to the carbon bearing the &mdash;OH
group, one must come from RMgX, the other two from the carbonyl. For example,
in examining 2-phenyl-2-hexanol, it could be made either from <i>n</i>-
butylmagnesium bromide + acetophenone or from methyl <i>n</i>-butyl ketone +
phenylmagnesium bromide. It is important to use readily available or
synthesizable reagents; in the synthesis of the hexanol, a better choice is the
first route using acetophenone (ch. 19 provides notes on why).
<p>
Grignard reagents are strong bases and will react very quickly with (protic)
acids: a hydrogen attached to any electronegative element or group, such as N,
O, S, or triply-bonded C. Grignards also react with O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>
2</sub>, and with every organic compound containing a C-O of C-N multiple bond.
Reaction conditions with the RX used in initial synthesis, with the carbonyl
subsequently, and in the ether solvent must be scrupulously dried and freed
from any alcohols (which were used to make the ether solvent), since RMgX
compounds do not form in the presence of water. The reaction must be protected
from water vapor, O<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> in the air; the better
setup uses CaCl<sub>2</sub> at the top to prevent the water coming in, and the
gases can be swept out by filling the chamber with dry N<sub>2</sub>.
<p>
Grignards can not be prepared from RX in which the R group contains a function
which reacts itself with the Grignard, e.g., HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br
is not workable, since as fast as RMgX is formed, it reacts to form ethanol.
With ArMgX compounds, this situation is quite important since they too contain
other (acidic) groups on the ring which can react (-COOH, -OH, -NH<sub>2</sub>,
-SO<sub>3</sub>H). Similarly multiply- bonded C-O and C-N groups (and -NO<sub>
2</sub>) are reactive. In fact, the very few functions allowed in RX in forming
the Grignard are: -R, -Ar, -OR, and -Cl (of an aryl chloride).
<p>
The carbonyl group must also be free of other reactive groups (the ones listed
above) if reaction of RMgX is to be limited to the site of the carbonyl
function, otherwise the acidic functions will decompose the Grignard to RH.

<h3>15.16 Steroids</h3>
<p>
<i>Cholesterol</i> belongs to a specific class of alcohols called <i>sterols</i>.
Sterols belong in turn to the broad class called <b>steroids.</b> Steroids
have the multi-ring aliphatic structures shown in the diagram. There is a
particular stereochemistry at carbons 10 and 13, which have methyl groups
attached, and at other carbons which have H atoms or other groups attached.
Steroids include sex and adrenal cortical hormones.

<h3>16.3 Dehydration</h3>

<p>
Dehydration was covered in Ch. 5. A review of the mechanism shows that the
acid-catalyzed reaction involves (i) formation of the protonated alcohol,
ROH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, (ii) slow dissociation of the C-O bond to form the
carbonium and water, (iii) rapid explusion of a proton (with the help of
solvent) to form the alkene.

<p>
This is a classic E1 elimination, which is in contrast to the E2-type reaction
necessary in RX compounds. Protonation by the acid of the OH group is necessary
to make a better leaving group, H<sub>2</sub>O.
<p>
The reactivity of a particular alcohol depends upon how stable the carbonium
intermediate is. Hence, 3&deg; alcohols should be much more reactive than 1&deg;
 alcohols. Benzyl alcohols are quite reactive because their carbonium ions can
be stabilized by resonance with the ring. And the orientation for formation of
the double bond strictly depends upon formation of the most stable alkene
generally: <i>sec</i>-butyl alcohol forms as chief product 2-butene, and with
1-phenyl-2-propanol, only 1-phenylpropene is formed since it is conjugated with
the ring. Rearrangments are also likely since there is a carbonium ion
intermediate.

<h3>16.4-.5 Reaction with HX.  Facts. Mechanism</h3>
<p>
ROH can be changed to RX by passing dry HX gas into the alcohol, or by heating
the alcohol with concentrated aqueous acid. (HBr can be generated with H<sub>
2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and NaBr for reaction with the alcohol.) HCl is the least
reactive HX, requiring ZnCl<sub>2</sub> for reaction with 1&deg; and 2&deg;
alcohols. tert-Butyl alcohol is very reactive however, requiring only conc. HCl
at room temp. Example reactions: 1. cyclohexanol + dry HBr cyclohexyl bromide;
2. n-butyl alcohol + NaBr/H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/reflux n-butyl bromide; 3.
 n-propyl alcohol + HCl/ZnCl<sub>2</sub>/heat n-propyl chloride; 4. tert-butyl
alcohol + conc. HCl tert-butyl chloride.
<p>
Some important facts: (a) the reaction is acid-catalyzed; even though HX are
strong acids, presence of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> helps; (b) alkyl group
rearrangment can occur, except with most primary alcohols; (c) the order of
reactivity toward HX is <i>allyl, benzyl &gt; 3&deg; &gt; 2&deg; &gt; 1&deg;
&lt; CH</i><i><sub>3</sub></i>. It should be noted that minimum reactivity is
with the primary and not the methyl alcohol.
<p>
The facts suggest the following mechanism. Catalysis by acid suggests that
dehydration is involved, starting with protonation of the -OH group. The
occurrence of rearrangement suggests a carbonium ion intermediate, except with
1&deg; alcohols; the reactivity of the alcohols adds further evidence of a
carbonium ion intermediate, except for the fact that 1&deg; is less reactive
than CH<sub>3</sub>. Hence a three-step S<sub>N</sub>1-type mechanism is
established but nor for methanol or most 1&deg; alcohols, the slow step
probably being the second one in which the C-OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> bond is
broken to yield a (stable) carbonium ion. The nucleophile is the X<sup>&minus;
</sup> ion in this case.
<p>
1&deg; and methyl alcohols react instead by an S<sub>N</sub>2-type mechanism:
the ROH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> has already been protonated and made a decent
leaving group, and it remains for the X<sup>&minus;</sup> to act sufficiently
nucleophilic to push it out. The reaction is though to be S<sub>N</sub>2
for these kinds of alcohols because 1&deg; and methyl alcohol carboniums are
too unstable to form as intermediates. The reason that methyl alcohol reacts
faster is because of the nature of the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction: bimolecular
attacks are assisted when no bulky substituents are found on carbon, and the
methyl group has none.
<p>
Neopentyl alcohol undergoes almost complete rearrangement prior to acting.
Although it is a primary alcohol and should not be expected to rearrange, its
bulk is sufficient to hinder S<sub>N</sub>2-type attack, so instead it does
form a carbonium ion intermediate, which although slow, is faster than
bimolecular substitution.

<h3>16.6  Alcohols as acids</h3>
<p>
The O-H bond is broken as much as the C-OH bond in alcohols. In that way, the
alcohol behaves as an acid, looking for electrons. As does water, alcohols
react with active metals to produce a metal alkoxide salt and hydrogen gas, and
with Grignard reagents to produce the weaker acid, RH. With the exception of
CH<sub>3</sub>OH, ROH compounds are weaker acids than water, but stronger acids
than acetylene and ammonia. The relative acidities and basicities are shown:
<p>
Relative acidities: H<sub>2</sub>O &gt; ROH &gt; HCCH &gt; NH<sub>3</sub> &gt;
RH
<p>
Relative basicities: OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; OR<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; HCC:
<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; R<sup>&minus;
</sup>
<p>
In general, the alkyl group R makes the OH less acidic, and the bigger the
group, the less acidic. The acid-weakening effect is <i>not</i> an electronic
effect, with electron release destabilizing the anion, effect making it a
stronger base. In fact in the gas phase, the acidities of the alcohols and of
alcohol and water are reversed. The reason alcohols are weaker acids in
solution than water has to do with a solvation effect, in which bulkier groups
interfere with ion-dipole interactions which would tend to stabilize the anion
formed.
<p>
As ROH compounds are weaker acids than H<sub>2</sub>O, alkoxides can not be
prepared by mixing NaOH with the alcohol, but rather mixing the active metal
itself to generate the alkoxide.

<h3>16.7 Formation of alkyl sulfonates</h3>
<p>
Sulfonyl chlorides are the acid chlorides of sulfonic acids, and are prepared
by reaction of sulfonic acids with phosphorous pentachlorides or thionyl
chloride:
<p class="reaxn">
ArSO<sub>2</sub>OH + PCl<sub>5</sub> &rarr;
ArSO<sub>2</sub>Cl + POCl<sub>3</sub> + HCl (or NaCl)

<p>Alcohols can then react in alkaline conditions to form alkyl sulfonate
esters:
<p class="reaxn">
ArSO<sub>2</sub>Cl + ROH (+ aqueous OH<sup>&minus;</sup> or
pyridine)  &rarr; ArSO<sub>2</sub>OR + Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O
<p>
Alkyl sulfonates have at least one advantage over RX compounds in reactions in
which stereochemistry is significant: RX compounds will nearly always be
prepared from ROH compounds, but ArSO<sub>2</sub>OR <i>must</i> be. Resolution
of enantiomers or separation of diastereomers is done at the ROH stage; the ROH
is then converted to RX or ROSO<sub>2</sub>Ar and products examined.
<p>
With reaction of R&mdash;OH to PX<sub>3</sub> or HX to form R&mdash;X,
stereochemical inversion or possibly racemization is likely. Preparation of the
sulfonation does not involve C-O bond breaking, so complete retention is
possibly. Later on the C-O bond can be broken with the creation of the
sulfonate leaving group.

<h3>16.8 Oxidation of alcohols</h3>
<p>
The products of oxidation of alcohols depends upon the number of hydrogens
attached to the carbon bearing the -OH group, i.e., whether the ROH compound is
1&deg;, 2&deg;, 3&deg;. Although a number of reagents can be used in the
oxidation, the more common ones are Mn(VII) and Cr(VI).
<p>
1&deg; ROH can be oxidized to RCOOH by heating with aqueous KMnO<sub>4</sub>. A
complete reaction produces the potassium salt of the acid, RCOO<sup>&minus;
</sup>K<sup>+</sup>, which is filtered from a brown MnO<sub>2</sub> ppt. (KOH
is produced, explaining the salt). The RCOOH is usu obtained by addition of a
mineral acid to liberate the insoluble acid.
<p>
1&deg; ROH can be oxidized to aldehydes, RCHO, with
K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. As the product is formed, it should
be quickly removed to prevent additional oxidation. In solution the
orange-red Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2</sup><sup>&minus;</sup> oxidizes
the alcohol, with formation of a green-colored Cr<sup>3+</sup> product.
<p>
2&deg; ROH (RR&prime;CHOH) can be oxidized to ketones, RR&prime;C=O, with
chromic acid in a suitable form: aqueous
K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, CrO<sub>3</sub> in glacial acetic acid,
CrO<sub>3</sub> in pyridine, etc. Hot KMnO<sub>4</sub> can be used, but
usually is not since oxidation goes past the ketone stage and oxidizes
C-C bonds.
<p>
<b>Under alkakine conditions, 3&deg; ROH compounds are not oxidized at all</b>.
However, under acidic conditions, dehydration of the alcohol is promoted to
form the alkene, and the alkene is oxidized.
<p>
The mechanism of oxidation is considered for one model, the reaction between a
2&deg; ROH and Cr(VI):

<p>
(1) R<sub>2</sub>CHOH + HCrO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>
R<sub>2</sub>CHOCrO<sub>3</sub>H + H<sub>2</sub>O

<p><img src="imagesOChemHTML/image069.png"
alt="mechanism step 2 of water addition to oxidized chromated alcohol">

<p>
(3) R<sub>2</sub>CHOH + Cr (IV)  R<sub>2</sub>COH + Cr (III)

<p>
(4) R<sub>2</sub>COH + Cr (VI)  R<sub>2</sub>C=O + Cr (V)

<p>
(5) R<sub>2</sub>CHOH + Cr (V) (via an ester)  R<sub>2</sub>C=O + Cr (III)

<p>
In step (2) is the oxidation step, which either can give the proton which
comes of the oxidized carbon to a solvent molecule or in which the chromate
abstracts the proton in some sort of cyclic transfer.  Additonal alcohol is
oxidized in reactions (3)-(5) until chromium attains the Cr(III) state.

<h3>16.9 Synthesis of alcohols</h3>
<p>
In the synthesis of more complicated alcohols, the starting point is often
simpler alcohols themselves. The synthetic process can be envisioned as:
<p>
Alcohol #1 Alkyl Halide Grignard reagent in one pathway. In the other pathway:
Alcohol #2 Aldehyde or Ketone. Then the final reaction: Grignard + Aldehyde or
Ketone more complicated ROH.
<p>
As an example, <i>sec</i>-butyl alcohol can be made strictly from ethanol using
only inorganic reagents (HBr, Mg, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>):

<p>
1. Ethanol + HBr &rarr; ethyl bromide + Mg &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>MgBr

<p>
2. Ethanol + K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CHO

<p>
3. CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>MgBr + CH<sub>3</sub>CHO &rarr; <i>sec</i>-butyl alcohol

<p>
The <i>sec</i>-butyl alcohol obtained can make even larger alcohols:

<p>
1. <i>sec</i>-butyl alcohol + PBr<sub>3</sub> &rarr;
<i>sec</i>-butyl bromide + Mg &rarr; RMgBr + CH<sub>3</sub>CHO
&rarr; 3-methyl-2-pentanol

<p>
2. <i>sec</i>-butyl alcohol + K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
&rarr; 2-butanone + ethylMgBr &rarr; 3-methyl-3-pentanol

<p>Other syntheses:

<p>
1. benzene + Br<sub>2</sub>/Fe &rarr; bromobenzene + Mg &rarr;
ArMgBr + CH<sub>3</sub>CHO (from oxidation of ethanol) &rarr; 1-phenylethanol

<p>
2. toluene + Cl<sub>2</sub>/heat &rarr; benzyl chloride + Mg &rarr;
benzylMgCl + acetone (from K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
oxidation of isopropanol) &rarr; 1-phenyl-2-methyl-2-propanol.

<p>
In planning a synthesis, it is useful to work backward, knowing that Grignard
reagents or the aldehydes/ketones are made in only a few ways. If 2-methyl-2-
hexanol is to be made, and all one has are alcohols with 4 carbons or fewer (a
reasonable expectation), the structure of the product is drawn and divided
reasonably between C2 and C3 or C1 and C2 of the long chain. However, if
division of C1 and C2 bond is considered, one of the reagents must necessarily
be &gt; 4 carbons long. Hence the other division is more reasonable. Once the
carbon skeletons of the immediate reactants are known, decision as to which
shall be the carbonyl and which the Grignard is done. Once that is done, the
preceding reactions working backward are determined.

<h3>16.10 Syntheses using alcohols</h3>

<p>
Summarizing the reactions of alcohols, three reactions can lead to the
formation of alkenes. In one path, the alkyl halide (RX) can be formed from the
ROH by reaction with phosphorous halides, then the RX compound de
hydrohalogenated alkene. In another, alkyl sulfonates (such as alkyl tosylates)
can be prepared by reaction with alkyl sulfonyl chlorides (such as TsCl), then
a base used to remove the proton and form the alkene. In a third,
acid-catalyzed dehydration can form the alkene directly. But the problem with
the dehydration is that rearrangements can occur. In a fourth reaction which
can make an RX from ROH, hydrogen halides can be used, but this can also lead
to rearrangement. Therefore a two-step synthesis from alcohol to alkene via RX
or RO<sub>2</sub>SOAr may be necessary to limit rearrangements.

<p>
With the alkenes, alkanes can be made by hydrogenation, showing that alcohols
can make more complicated alkanes. 3-Methyl-1-butene is to be made from the
following available chemicals: alcohols of four carbons or fewer, benzene, and
toluene. First, it is observed that there are 5 carbons, so it can not be made
directly from the available reagents. Working backward, the alkene could be
made by either dehydrohalogenation of an alkyl halide or by dehydration of an
alcohol. If the 3-methyl-2-halobutane or 3-methyl-butane-2-ol reactants are
used, the 3-methyl-1-butene can be made, but 2-methyl-2-butene is made in
greater amounts, as it is the more stable alkene that would be made in the
reactions. If instead the functional group is attached to C1 instead of C2:
with the alcohol, dehydration would still yield mostly the 2-butene rather than
the 1-butene, because the carbonium intermediate in the E1 reaction allow for
rearrangements. Only dehydrohalogenation of an RX with X on C1 would yield the
product in pure form.

<p>
How is the 1&deg; halide made? Assuming the RX compound is 1-bromo-3-
methylbutane, it can not be made by free radical bromination of isopentane,
since bromine would substitute at the tertiary carbon. The best recourse is
actually to make it from the alcohol by treating with PBr<sub>3</sub>: 3-
methyl-1-butanol + PBr<sub>3</sub> 1-bromo-3-methylbutane. Now the 1&deg;
alcohol can be made from mixing the aldehyde HCHO and the Grignard isobutylMgBr.
 While formaldehyde can be made by simple oxidation of methanol with K<sub>
2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, the Grignard is made first from
isobutyl alcohol treatment with PBr<sub>3</sub> to make isobutyl bromide, then
treatment with Mg. The synthesis from the available reagents to the product is
now complete.

<h3>16.11 Analysis of alcohols.  Characterization.  Iodoform test.</h3>

<p>
ROH cmpds dissolve in cold conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, a property also
of alkenes, amines, nearly all compounds containing oxygen, and easily
sulfonated cmpds. ROH is not oxidized by cold, dilute, neutral KMnO<sub>4</sub>
(although it is under more vigorous conditions); since alcohols contain
impurities which <i>do</i> oxidize, the permanganate color change should be
interpreted with caution. ROH do not decolorize Br<sub>2</sub> in CCl<sub>
4</sub>, which distinguishes them from C=C and CC.
<p>
ROH is oxidized by CrO<sub>3</sub> in aq. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>: within 2
seconds, the clear-orange solution turns an opaque blue-green; this reaction is
quite definitive for ROH cmpds, since alkenes and alkynes and no other cmpd
reacts similarly. 3&deg; ROH does not react. Aldehydes do react, but can be
otherwise distinguished.
<p>
Like any <i>wet</i> compound, ROH react with Na metal to evolve H<sub>2</sub>
gas. When reacted with an acid chloride or anhydride, ROH form esters which are
often sweet-smelling or which have sharp melting points.
<p>
The <b>Lucas test</b> is used to distinguish 1&deg;-3&deg; alcohols. The
reagent is conc. HCl and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. The alcohol is made into the
corresponding chloride, which is insoluble and precipitates (actually manifest
as a cloudiness). The test is the <i>amount of time</i> it takes to react:
3&deg; alcohols are highly reactive and the cloudiness appears immediately; a
2&deg; ROH reacts within 5 min.; a 1&deg; ROH does not appreciably react at
room temp. Allyl and benzyl alcohols react as fast as 3&deg;, but the allyl ROH
is soluble.
<p>
The <b>iodoform test<i></i> </b>identifies a particular sort of alcohol, namely
a 2&deg; ROH with the structural formula: R-CHOH-CH<sub>3</sub>, where R can be
H, alkyl, or aryl. The reaction involves ROH, I<sub>2</sub>, and NaOH (with
form NaOI). If the ROH has the structure, a yellow precipiate CHI<sub>3</sub>
(iodoform) (m.p. 119&deg;) appears. Ethanol, <i>sec</i>- propanol, 2-pentanol,
and &alpha;-phenylethanol gives positive reactions; in contrast, any 1&deg;
alcohol other than CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH, <i>tert</i>-butanol,
3-pentanol, and &beta;-phenylethanol do not react. The mechanism involves
oxidation, halogenation, and cleavage:

<p>
(1) RCHOHCH<sub>3</sub> + NaOI  &rarr; RCOCH<sub>3</sub> + NaI + H<sub>2</sub>O

<p>
(2) RCOCH<sub>3</sub> + 3 NaOI  &rarr; RCOCI<sub>3</sub> + 3 NaOH

<p>
(3) RCOCI<sub>3</sub> + NaOH  &rarr; RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> +
CHI<sub>3</sub> (yellow ppt.)

<p>
In step (2) it can be easily shown that methyl ketones (or acetaldehyde) of
RCOCH<sub>3</sub> will also react.

<p>
Considering that the reaction yields RCOOH in the end, hypohalites (not NaOI,
but NaOBr or the cheaper NaOCl) are used to synthesis these compounds.

<h3>16.12 Analysis of glycols.  Periodic acid oxidation</h3>

<p>
Treatment of vicinal diols, vicinal dioxo, or vicinal ketohydroxy (cmpds with
-OH or =O groups attached to <i>adjacent</i> carbons) with periodic acid,
HIO<sub>4</sub>, causes oxidation with C-C bond cleavage.

<p>
R-CHOH-CHOH-R&prime; + HIO<sub>4</sub> 
RCHO + R&prime;CHO (+ HIO<sub>3</sub>)

<p>R-CO-CO-R + HIO<sub>4</sub>  RCOOH + R&prime;COOH

<p>R-CHOH-CO-R&prime; + HIO<sub>4</sub>  RCHO + R&prime;COOH

<p>R-CHOH-CHOH-CHOH-R&prime; + HIO<sub>4</sub>  RCHO + HCOOH + R&prime;CHO

<p>R<sub>2</sub>-COH-CHOH-R&prime; + HIO<sub>4</sub>  R<sub>2</sub>CO +
R&prime;CHO

<p>R-CHOH-CH<sub>2</sub>-CHOH-R&prime; + HIO<sub>4</sub>  no reaction

<p>When AgNO<sub>3</sub> is added after some time after adding HIO<sub>4</sub>,
a white AgIO<sub>3</sub> indicates that oxidation did occur; if weighed the
amount of HIO<sub>4</sub>  consumed can be used to estimate how much oxidation
occurred.

<h3>16.13 Spectroscopic analysis of alcohols</h3>

<p>With ir spectroscopy, the distinguishing features to look for indicating ROH
or ArOH compounds is an O&minus;H stretch with a strong and broad absorption
between 3200-3600 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  A strong and broad C&mdash;O stretch
occurs as well, depending upon the ROH:  if 1&deg;, ~1050 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>;
if 2&deg;, ~1100 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; if 3&deg;, ~1150 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>;
and if ArOH, ~1230 cm<sup>&minus;</sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt;position:relative;top:-3.0pt'>1</span>.  
In interpreting the C&mdash;O stretch, it is important to distinguish from the stretching of ethers,
which lack O-H stretching, and RCOOH, which nonetheless show absorption of a C=O
group.

<p>With nmr spectra, a proton signal very far downfield (the -O-H proton) is
evident.  The chemical shift will depend upon degree of hydrogen bonding, which
itself depends upon temperature,  concentration, and nature of solvent.  The
signal can be hidden in alkyl proton signals, but is revealed with proton
counting.  Despite its exchangeable nature with solvent or other molecules, the
exchange is too fast for the spectrometer to resolve, so it is seen as a single
signal.

<h2>Chap. 17 Ethers and epoxides</h2>

<h3>17.1-.3 Ethers:  structure, nomenclature, physical properties, industrial
sources, dehydration of alcohol</h3>

<p>
Ethers can have the formula R-O-R, Ar-O-R, or Ar-O-Ar.  Ethers are named for
the groups on either side followed by the word <i>ether</i>, unless they are
symmetrical ethers:  C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>,
(di)ethyl ether; CH<sub>3</sub>OC(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>,
methyl <i>tert</i>-butyl ether;
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, isopropyl
phenyl ether.

<p>
An alternative is to name it as an <i>alkoxy</i> derivative: 
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(OCH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>,
3-methoxyhexane; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O(<i>p</i>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH),
<i>p</i>-ethoxybenzoic acid;
HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, 2-ethoxyethanol. 
The simplest aryl alkyl ether,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>, is given the special name
<i>anisole</i>.

<p>
The C&mdash;O&mdash;C bond angle is not 180&deg; (R-O-R bond angle is about
110&deg;), and therefore there is a net dipole moment (1.18 D for ethyl ether). 
The polarity is weak however, and the b.p. values for comparable MW with alkanes
is similar, and lower than for isomeric ROH cmpds.  E.g., <i>n</i>-heptane
(98&deg;), methyl <i>n</i>-pentyl ether (100&deg;), and <i>n</i>-hexyl alcohol
(157&deg;).  It is because ethers are unable to form H-bonds.  However, because
of the oxygen available for some H-bonding by water, ethers show water
solubility comparable to homologous alcohols.</p>

<p>
Ethers are important solvents and are made on a large scale as symmetrical
ethers from the corresponding alcohols using H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with
heat. 2 ROH + acid R-O-R + H<sub>2</sub>O. This amounts to a <i>dehydration</i>
reaction. To prevent formation of the alkene, the reaction conditions are
manipulated to favor the ether: ethyl ether is made by mixing EtOH and the acid
at 140&deg;, then EtOH is continuously added to keep it in excess. The
dehydration reaction is limited to production of symmetrical ethers, since two
different alcohols can potentially yield 3 different ethers. The reaction is
essentially S<sub>N</sub>2, with one alcohol acting as a nucleophile to push
out the leaving group H<sub>2</sub>O on the protonated alcohol.

<p>
Aliphatic ethers are subject to conversion to unstable peroxides on standing
with air, which are present in low concentrations but can cause explosions
during distillations. Peroxide presence is evaluated using Fe(II) ammonium
sulfate + KSCN: the peroxide oxidizes Fe(II) to Fe(III), which complexes with
SCN<sup>&minus;</sup> as
Fe(SCN)<i><sub>n</sub></i><sup>&minus;(3&minus;<i>n</i>)</sup>,
where <i>n</i>=1 to 6. The FeSCN complex gives a blood-red color.
Peroxides are removed by washing the ether with Fe(II) solutions (reduces
peroxides) or distilling with conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (oxidized
peroxides). In Grignard reactions, ether must absolutely be dry, and should be
distilled from conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, which removes water, alcohol,
and peroxides, then storing over Na metal.</p>

<h3>17.5 Ether preparation.  Williamson synthesis</h3>
<p>
The laboratory synthesis of ROR depends largely on the Williamson synthesis,
since it can make unsymmetrical ethers and aryl alkyl ethers, in addtion to
symmetrical and dialkyl products. An alkyl halide is permitted to react with
the sodium alkoxide or phenoxide, with the ether and sodium salt as products.</p>
<p>
In special cases, methyl sulfate (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> may
be used to make <i>methyl aryl ethers </i>since it is less expensive than RX
cmpds.</p>
<p>
The Williamson synthesis is strictly a S<sub>N</sub>2-type reaction,
wherein the alkoxide or phenoxide displaces the halide of RX; it is analogous
to the preparation of alcohols by treating RX with aqueous OH<sup>&minus;</sup>.
ArX can not be used, since this bond is stable and has very low reactivity.</p>
<p>
The sodium alkoxide is made by reaction of ROH with Na RO<sup>&minus;</sup>
Na<sup>+</sup>. Phenoxides are not made that way because phenols have
appreciable acidity, so reaction is with NaOH to form the salt
ArO<sup>&minus;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p>
In preparing unsymmetrical ethers, while two routes are possible, one is nearly
always better than the other. For example, ethyl <i>tert</i>-butyl ether is
made by reaction of ethyl bromide and sodium <i>tert</i>-butoxide. It cannot be
made with <i>tert</i>-butyl chloride and sodium ethoxide, since the 3&deg; RX
is prone more to elimination than substitution, and certainly so with a strong
base like ethoxide. The disadvantage with the first route is that Na metal
reacts slowly with <i>tert</i>-butyl alcohol. The synthesis of an ether
ultimately derives from two alcohols, since the both the 1&deg; RX and the
alkoxide come from alcohols.</p>

<h3>17.6 Ether preparation.  Alkoxymercuration-demercuration</h3>
<p>
As in the synthesis of alcohols, alkoxymercuration-demercuration can serve to
synthesize the other. Rather than use of a water solvent, the mercuric
trifluoroacetate is dissolved in the alcohol in with the RO will serve as one
adduct. The alkene is then added. Solvomercuration-demercuration amounts to
Markovnikorve addition of an alcohol to the C=C bond. The advantage of the
reaction is speed, convenience, high yield, and absence of rearrangement.
Moreover, there is no competing elimination reaction as there is with the
Williamson synthesis. For steric reasons, di-tert-alkyl ethers can not be
synthesized with this reaction. 3,3-Dimethyl-1-butene + isopropanol + Hg(tfa)
<sub>2</sub> + NaBH<sub>4</sub> 3-isopropoxy-2,2-dimethylbutane. Styrene +
isopropanol makes a-phenylethyl tert-butyl ether. The <i>trifluoro</i>acetate
of mercury is used instead of the acetate it makes very good yields with 2&deg;
or 3&deg; alcohols as solvents.</p>

<h3>17.7 Reaction of ethers.  Cleavage by acids</h3>
<p>
Ethers are very unreactive, stable in bases and to oxidizing and reducing
agents. Ethers can be cleaved by mineral acids, but the acids must be
concentrated and temperatures high.</p>
<p class="reaxn">
ROR&prime; + HX  &rarr; RX + R&prime;-OH;  R&prime;OH +
HX  &rarr; R&prime;X
<br>
Ar-OR + HX  &rarr; RX + Ar-OH</p>

<p>
The reactivity is HI &gt; HBr &gt; HCl, although HI or HBr is used. Alkyl
ethers yield alkyl halides and an alcohol; the alcohol may react further to
produce another alkyl halide. Examples are: isopropyl ether + 48% HBr (130-
140&deg;) 2 isopropyl bromide; anisole + 57% HI (120-130&deg;) phenol + CH<sub>
3</sub>I.</p>
<p>
The mechanism starts off with protonation of the ether oxygen. Either of the
alkyl groups now make a good leaving group (as an alcohol), which would leave a
carbonium ion. However, the substitution can be either S<sub>N</sub>1 or
S<sub>N</sub>2: S<sub>N</sub>1-type reactions require a stable carbonium,
which is afforded by a 3&deg; alkyl group, while the S<sub>N</sub>2
reaction is necessary if R is 1&deg;, so X<sup>&minus;</sup> must displace the
ROH.
</p>
<h3>17.8 EAS in aromatic ethers</h3>
<p>
The -OR function is listed as a <i>ortho</i>,<i>para</i>-director which is
moderately activating. It is stronger than -R but much weaker than -OH on the
ring. Ring carboniums are stabilized by resonance using one of lone pair on
oxygen, in which case every atom in the intermediate has an octet despite the
charge.
</p>
<h3>17.9 Cyclic ethers</h3>
<p>
Cyclic ethers are just like ethers of the open-chain form. One class of cyclic
ethers deserves special treatment is the <b>epoxides</b>.
</p>
<h3>17.10 Epoxide preparation</h3>
<p>
Epoxides are three-membered cyclic ethers (forming an oxirane ring). The
simplest epoxide is ethylene oxide, prepared by catalytic oxidation of ethylene:
 CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + (O<sub>2</sub>/Ag/250&deg;) CH<sub>2</sub>
CH<sub>2</sub>(O)
</p>
<p>
Other expoxides can be prepared in the lab:
</p>
<p>
1.  <i>From halohydrins</i>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/image070.png"
alt="addition of halogen and hydroxide to alkene to form halohydrin and epoxide">
</p>
<p>
2. <i>Peroxidation of C=C bonds</i>.

&mdash;C=C&mdash; +
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>OH (peroxybenzoic acid)
&rarr; -C-C(O)- + benzoic acid</p>

<p>
In reaction number 1, conversion of halohydrins is an adaptation of the
Williamson synthesis, but the reaction is intramolecular. Since halohydrins are
nearly always produced from alkenes, this reaction amounts to making the
epoxide from an alkene.</p>

<p>
When alkenes are allowed to stand with peroxybenzoic acid
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>OH) in ether or CHCl<sub>3</sub>
solution, benzoic acid and the epoxide result. Cyclopentene can be made
into cyclopentene oxide.  Cinnamyl alcohol (3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol) can be
made into its epoxide.</p>

<h3>17.11 Reaction of epoxides</h3>
<p>
Because of the 60&deg; bond angles in the three-membered ring, epoxides can be
expected to be highly reactive from the angle strain. Like other ethers,
acid-catalyzed cleavage occurs, but with extreme ease; unlike ethers, base-
catalyzed cleavage is also possible.

<p>
3. <i>Reaction with Grignard</i>
</p>
<p>
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/image073.png"
alt="mechanism of Grignard reaction with epoxides">

<h3>17.12 Acid-catalyzed cleavage of epoxides.  <i>anti</i>-Hydroxylation</h3>
<p>
Like normal ethers, acid-catalyzed cleavage begins with protonation of the
ether oxygen. A nucleophile starts a back side attack to yield the nucleophile
attached to one carbon, an -OH group to the other. If the nucleophile is water,
a vicinal diol (glycol) is the product. If the nucleophile is an alcohol, an
alkoxyalcohol or hydroxyether is the product. In each case the attack of the
nucleophile leaves the reaction unfinished, with only a proton to lose to
regenerate the catalyst for the next reaction.</p>
<p>
If glycols are desired products, a 2-stage process of epoxidation of alkenes
followed by hydrolysis will make for a stereospecific <i>anti</i> addition to
the C=C bond. In fact, alkene treatment with peroxyformic acid gives the same
stereochemistry, for the reason that an epoxide is an intermediate; the reason
the reaction does not stop at epoxide formation is because the acid medium
cleaves the epoxide. An epoxide being a cyclic ether is similar to the cyclic
halonium ion in halogen addition: subsequent attack must by <i>anti</i>.
Hydroxylation with permanganate on the other hand is <i>syn</i>-addition, with
hydrolysis producing the cis-glycol. Osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>) works
like permanganate as well, yield stable intermediates that prove the syn-
hydroxlation reaction.
</p>
<h3>17.13 Base-catalyzed cleavage of epoxides</h3>
<p>
In base-catalyzed cleavage, the epoxide itself and not the protonated epoxide
is subject to nucleophilic attack. A nonprotonated epoxide is less reactive
than one that is, but the strong nucleophiles compensate.
</p>
<h3>17.14 Reaction of ethylene oxide with Grignard reagents</h3>
<p>
This reaction has been covered in ch. 15, and amounts to synthesis of a primary
alcohol extended by 2 carbons. The R group in the RMgX Grignard can be any
alkyl or aryl group.
</p>
<h3>17.15 Orientation of cleavage of epoxides</h3>
<p>
If the epoxide is symmetrical, then the two carbons in the oxirane ring are
equivalent, so nucleophilic attack can occur at either. With unsymmetrical
epoxides, one is different from the other, but the attack of the nucleophile
depends upon whether the reaction is acid- or base-catalyzed.
<p>
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C-CH<sub>2</sub>(O) (isobutylene
oxide) + H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O / H<sup>+</sup> 
&rarr; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C<sup>18</sup>OHCH<sub>2</sub>OH
<br>
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C-CH<sub>2</sub>(O) + CH<sub>3</sub>OH /
NaOCH<sub>3</sub> 
&rarr; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>COHCH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>.
</p>
<p>
The cleavage for both acid and base catalysis is of the S<sub>N</sub>2-type,
but the acid- catalyzed reaction has the nucleophile attacking the <i>more</i>
substituted carbon, the base-catalyzed reaction involve Z: attacking the
<i>less</i> substituted.
</p>
<p>
The acid-catalyzed attack on the more hindered carbon can be explained as a
partial carbonium ion forming in the transition state on the more stable carbon
of the epoxide ring; the more substituted carbon should therefore be better
equipped to distribute the positive charge. While the bond is not entirely
broken, it is enough advanced that the bond breaking is ahead any bond making,
and the nucleophile is attracted to the carbon being some positive charge.
Hence this reaction is S<sub>N</sub>2 since the nucleophile must give it a push,
 but the reaction demonstrates considerable S<sub>N</sub>1 character.
 </p>
<p>
Base-catalyzed cleavage depends strictly on the nucleophile, and since there is
no charge on the epoxide, both carbons are equivalent with respect to
nucleophilicity. However, where the carbons differ with respect to substitution,
 the carbon with the least steric hindrance will be favored in the final
orientation.
</p>
<h3>17.16-.17 Analysis and spectroscopy of ethers</h3>
<p>
Ethers are generally unreactive in many ways, like alkanes. After running
suitable tests for alkanes, ethers can be distinguished by their solubility in 
cold, conc. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, in which they form oxonium salts. 
Comparison of physical properties to listed properties can establish as
previously identified ether. Hot HIO<sub>4</sub> can be used in a cleavage
reaction, with easy identification of one or both products. ArOR can be
converted to solids by bromination or nitration, with determination of m.p.
</p>
<p>
In looking at ir spectra, a strong and broad band for C-O stretching at 1060-
1150 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> should be conspicuous, but the large -OH band should
be missing to rule out alcohols. Aryl and vinyl ethers show bands at 1200-1275
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> with weaker band at 1020-1075 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
Carboxylic acids and esters show C-O stretching as well, but can be spotted by
bands showing carbonyl groups.
</p>
<h2>Chap. 18 Carboxylic acids</h2>

<h3>18.1-.3 Structure.  Nomenclature.  Physical properties</h3>
<p>
Compounds have the structure RCOOH, all have appreciable acidity. Among the
acids are formic acid, acetic acid, lauric acid, oleic acid
(<i>cis</i>-9-octadecanoic acid), benzoic acid, <i>p</i>-nitrobenzoic acid,
phenylacetic acid, acrylic (propenoic) acid.
</p>
<p>
Certain common names occur: formic, acetic, butyric, caproic. Where branched
chains or substitutes occur along the straight-chain, the designation is
&alpha;-, &beta;-, &gamma;-, &delta;-, along the chain is used for these acids.
Aromatic acids have as their parent benzoic acid, and are named according. The
methylbenzoic acids have the special name <i>toluic</i> <i>acids</i>. IUPAC
naming takes the alkyl parent chain, replaces the suffix - <i>e</i> of the
alkane with the suffix -<b>oic acid</b>.
</p>
<p>
RCOOH are polar like ROH and form H-bonds with each other and other molecules.
The aliphatic acids show similar properties with the ROH: the first 4 are
miscible, the 5-carbon partly, and the higher acids quite insoluble. The
simplest aromatic acid, benzoic acid, has too many C atoms to show appreciable
water solubility.

<p>
RCOOH is soluble in less polar solvents like ether, alcohol, benzene, etc.
RCOOH does have a higher b.p. than the ROH of corresponding MW. The high
boiling points are because RCOOH are not held together by only one H-bond, but
by 2 as a pair of RCOOH form a symmetrical bonding relationship. Odors
associated with RCOOH range from the sharp and irritating (formic and acetic)
to distinctly unpleasant (butyric, valeric, caproic); the higher acids have low
volatility and little odor.
</p>
<h3>18.4 Salts of RCOOH</h3>
<p>
RCOOH is in between the strong mineral acids (HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>
2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and the very weak acids (ROH, HC&equiv;CH), and the
carboxylic are stronger acids than water. Aq. hydroxides change RCOOH to their
salts, while mineral acids change them to the acid. The salts can be melted at
high temperatures normally required of ionic lattices; most often, the salt
decomposes first, a result of covalent bond breaking, because the temperature
of the melt exceeds the covalent bond strength. Dissolution requires very polar
solvents. The alkali metal salts (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub>
<sup>+</sup>) are quite soluble in water, but insoluble in nonpolar solvents.
Heavy metal salts (Fe, Ag, Cu, etc.) are generally insoluble in water.
</p>
<p>
The difference in water solubility between RCOOH and its alkali metal salt is
often a definitive test used in determining the presence of the -COOH group; it
is also used to separate organic cmpds. Although NaOH can be used to solubilize
a suspect acid, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> can be similarly used, with the advantage
that CO<sub>2</sub> escapes as bubbles in the reaction. No other organic
compound reacts in the same way.
</p>
<p>
Often in the preparation of aldehydes by oxidation of 1&deg; ROH, some
contamination of the RCOOH may present as overoxidized product. The acid can
sensibly be removed by washing the product with a dilute aqueous base.
</p>

<h3>18.5 Industrial Source</h3>
<p>
Acetic acid is produced in large amounts by the air oxidation of acetaldehyde.
The acetaldehyde is available from either the hydration of acetylene or by the
dehydrogenation of ethanol.
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/AceticAcidIndustrialSynthesis.png"
 alt="industrial synthesis of acetic acid">
</p>
<p>
When produced in its dilute form as consumer product vinegar, ethanol is
oxidized by bacterial enzymes from <i>Acetobacter</i>.
</p>
<p>
Important sources of aliphatic carboxylic acids come from animal and plant 
fats, with purities of straight chain carboxylic acids greater than 90%, and
even-numbered carbons from 6 to 18 carbon atoms.  These can be reduced to
corresponding alcohols.
</p>
<p>
<b>Benzoic acid</b> and the <b>phthalic acids</b> are the most important 
aromatic carboxylic acids and prepared on industrial scale by oxidation of
alkylbenzenes.   Toluene and xylenes that are precursors can be extracted from
coal tar and by the catalytic reforming of aliphatic hydrocarbons from petroleum.
A precursor for <i>o</i>-phthalic acid is the aromatic hydrocarbon <i>naphthalene</i>,
also in coal tar.  Oxidizing agents like chlorine or plain air (although in
presence of catalysts) are inexpensive.
</p>

<p>
5. Malonic ester synthesis (ch. 26)

<p>
6. Special methods for phenolic acids (ch. 24)

<p> Generally, <b>oxidation</b> is most direct and generally used.  The
<b>Grignard</b> and <b>nitrile</b> syntheses extend the chain as well as make
the acid.  The Grignards and nitriles are conveniently made from RX cmpds, 
which are themselves prepared from ROH.  Ar-C&equiv;N cannot be made from Ar-X
(unreactive), but are made from diazonium salts.  In fact, synthesis of an
ArCOOH can evolve by these steps:

<p class="center"> ArH &rarr; ArNO<sub>2</sub> &rarr;
ArNH<sub>2</sub> &rarr; ArN<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>  &rarr; ArC&equiv;N &rarr;
ArCOOH

<h3>18.7 Grignard synthesis</h3>
<p>
The Grignard synthesis of a RCOOH is done by bubbling CO<sub>2</sub> gas into
the Grignard sitting in ether, or by pouring the Grignard on to dry ice, which
also serves to cool the reaction. RMgX reacts to the double bonds in O=C=O just
like aldehydes or ketones. The RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup>MgX<sup>+</sup> is salt
which can then be acidified. The RMgX can be prepared from 1&deg;, 2&deg;, and
3&deg; RX and from ArX.

<h3>18.8 Nitrile synthesis</h3>
<p>
With the mixing of primary RX with NaCN in a solvent dissolving both reactants
(in DMSO, reaction is rapid and exothermic at room temp.), aliphatic nitriles
are synthesized. The RC&equiv;N can subsequently be hydrolyzed in boiling
aqueous alkali or acid to produce the RCOOH (in acid) or RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup>
(in base).
<p>
In preparing the nitrile, it is known that HCN is a rather weak acid, making
CN<sup>&minus;</sup> a strong base, and therefore a good nucleophile. For this
reason, reaction conditions with the RX must be controlled to prevent the
possibility of elimination vs. substitution. If 3&deg; RX is used, elimination
is the chief reaction; with 2&deg; RX, substitution is still poor, so the best
RX is 1&deg;.
<p>
Nitriles are sometime named as <i>cyanides</i> or <i>cyano</i> compounds, but
take their names from the acids they would yield upon hydrolysis. For example,
acetonitrile (acetic acid), <i>n</i>-valeronitrile or pentanenitrile (valeric
acid or pentanoic acid), benzonitrile (benzoic acid).

<h3>18.10 Ionization of RCOOH.  Acidity constant</h3>
<p>
RCOOH are called acids because that is their significant feature: to ionize and
give a hydrogen ion to a base or acceptor: RCOOH + H<sub>2</sub>O &harr;
RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>. The reaction is an
equilibrium and can be expressed as a constant: <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> =
[RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup>][H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>]/[RCOOH]. RCOO<sup>&minus;
</sup> can also be as base, but it is quite a weak base. Relative acidities and
basicities are shown.

<p>
<b>Relative</b> <b>acidities</b>:  RCOOH &gt; HOH &gt; ROH
&gt; HC&equiv;CH &gt; NH<sub>3</sub> &gt; RH

<p>
<b>Relative</b> <b>basicities</b>:  RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt;
HO<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; RO<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt;
HC&equiv;C<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> &lt;
R<sup>&minus;</sup>

<h3>18.11-.12 Equilibrium.  Acidity of RCOOH</h3>
<p>
Most of the reactions up to this point are irreversible, one-way reactions. But
many reactions are in equilibrium. If A + B &harr; C + D is an equilibrium, the
concentrations of components at equilibrium is related by a constant, K<sub>
eq</sub> = [C][D]/[A][B], products over reactants. The K<sub>eq</sub> can be
related to free energy by: &Delta;<i>G</i>&deg; = &minus;<i>RT</i> ln <i>K</i>
<sub>eq</sub>, in which the <i>standard free energy change</i> is expressed. A
free energy vs. progress reaction curve can be drawn in the way given before.
The &Delta;<i>H</i> is related to &Delta;<i>G</i>&deg; by: &Delta;<i>G</i>&deg;
= &Delta;<i>H</i> &minus; <i>T</i>&Delta;<i>S</i>&deg; (&Delta;<i>H</i> is only
slightly different from &Delta;<i>H</i>&deg;). The standard entropy change
expresses the randomness of the system, and contributes to the free energy term
in such a way that equilibrium favors a state with the fewest restrictions.
<p>
It has been shown that polar solvents speed up the S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions
which depend upon stabilization of a carbonium intermediate, not so much by
lowering the <i>E</i><sub>act</sub>, but by making the entropy of activation
favorable. A more polar solvent is already rather ordered, and its clustering
about the ionizing molecule amounts to little loss of randomness.
<p>
The Hammett equation, log [<i>K / K</i><sub>0</sub> ] = <i>&rho;&sigma;</i>,
correlates the relative acidities quantitatively with the relative acidities of
another set of acids, or even the relative rates of a set of reactions. The <i>
K</i> value refers to one reaction, for example, ionization of an <i>m</i>- or
<i>p</i>-substituted benzoic acid, and the <i>K</i><sub>0</sub> value points to
some reference, e.g., ionization of the unsubstituted benzoic acid. The
constant &sigma;, called the <i>substituent</i> <i>constant</i>, is a number (+
or &minus;) showing the relative electron-withdrawing or -releasing properties
of a substituent. The constant &rho;, called the <i>reaction</i> <i>constant</i>,
is a number (+ or &minus;) expressing the relative <i>need</i> of a
particular reaction for electron withdrawal or release.
<p>
The Hammett relationship holds for hundreds of sets of reactions. The relative
<i>K</i><sub>eq</sub> values or relative rates of reactions can be calculated 
for thousands of reactions having a table of &sigma; and &rho; constants. For 
example, the &sigma; value for <i>m</i>-NO<sub>2</sub> (+0.710) and the &rho; 
value for ionization of benzoic acids in water at 25&deg; (+1.000) can be used
to show that the <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> for <i>m</i>-nitrobenzoic acid is 5.13
times larger than the <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> for benzoic acid. Using the same
&sigma; value, and with the &rho; value for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of
benzamides in 60% EtOH at 80&deg; (&minus;0.298), it can be shown that
<i>m</i>-nitrobenzamide is hydrolyzed at 0.615 the rate of benzamide.
<p>
The Hammett relationship is also called the <i>linear free energy
relationship</i>, since it reveals the linear relationship between free energy
changes and the effect exerted by substituents.

<h3>18.12-.13 Acidity of RCOOH.  Structure of RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup></h3>
<p>
The structure of the -COOH is what accounts for the acidity of the carboxylic
acid. With alcohols, the ROH and its conjugate base, RO<sup>&minus;</sup>, can
be represented by single structures. For RCOOH and its conjugate base, RCOO<sup>
&minus;</sup>, both can be represented by two (resonance) structures. However,
with RCOOH, the one structure has the carbonyl attached to a hydroxyl function
in which atom has no formal charge, and the other has an oxyanion and oxonium
arrangement, with both O atoms having formal charges. These structures are
non-equivalent, and resonance is not important. With R-COO<sup>&minus;</sup>,
the resonance structures are equivalent, and resonance effects will be
significant. Pot. energy vs. progress of reaction curves comparing ROH to RCOOH
would show a slightly lower energy for RCOOH compared to ROH (there is a slight
resonance stabilization), but a large difference between RO<sup>&minus;</sup>
and RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup>. This resonance stabilization enables RCOOH to be an
acid for this reason.
<p>
Consistent with resonance theory, RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup> should be a hybrid of
the two resonance structures having equal stability. The negative charge is
dispersed equally between the oxygen atoms, and the C-O bond could be said to
be a 1&frac12; bond. The C-O bonds in these ions should be of equal length,
whereas in the acid, there should be different lengths since the C=O and C-O
bond are expected to exist. X-ray and electron diffraction confirm this
hypothesis: HCOOH has two kinds of C-O bonds, a single bond with length 1.36 A
and a double bond with length 1.23. Sodium formate (HCOONa) has only one kind
of C-O bond with length 1.27 A, in between both bonds, suggesting its 1&frac12;
bond character. The orbital picture shows a trigonal bonding arrangement of
carbon to R and both O atoms, 120&deg; bond angles are suggested, and the
charge can be accommodated in the p orbitals of three nuclei, C and both O
atoms.

<h3>18.14 Effects of substituents on acidity</h3>
<p>
Given a structure GCOOH, it is important to look at G at its effects on acid
strength, i.e., the effect of G on stabilizing or destabilizing
GCOO<sup>&minus;</sup>. Any group which <i>withdraws</i> electrons would
tend to pull on the negative charge, thereby distributing the charge more
evenly, and <i>stabilizing</i> the anion.  Stabilizing the anion in this way
makes it possible to be a better acid, i.e., the acidity of G&rarr;COOH should
be increased.
<p>
On the other hand, a group G releasing electrons or at least unable to
contribute in the maximizing the entropy of charge distribution would <i>
destabilize</i> formation of an anion. The enhanced negative charge would tend
to keep protons from leaving, making G&rarr;COOH a poorer acid therefore. The
p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> = &minus;log <i>K</i><sub>
a</sub>) for the various RCOOH are shown below and agree with this theory: e.g.,
 ClCH<sub>2</sub>COOH is 100 times stronger than acetic acid; TCA is 10,000
times stronger.

<p>
With both being &alpha;-chloro acids, it can be seen that
&alpha;-chlorobutyric acid is about as strong as chloroacetic acid, which are both
about 90 times stronger than butyric acid. As the Cl atom becomes far removed
from the -COOH, the inductive effect destabilizing the atom decreases:
&beta;-chlorobutyric acid is only 6 times stronger as butyric acid, while
&gamma;-butyric acid is only twice as strong. Such inductive effects are seldom
important when acting through &gt;4 carbons.
<p>
For aromatics, the -CH<sub>3</sub>, -OH, and -NH<sub>2</sub> groups make
benzoic acid weaker, but -Cl and -NO<sub>2</sub> make it stronger. The
difference here is in the groups activating and deactivating the ring for EAS.
Depending upon the position of the -OH and -OCH<sub>3</sub> groups, acid-
strengthening occurs when these groups are <i>meta</i> to benzoic acid, but
from the <i>para</i> position, they are acid-weakening. <i>Ortho</i>
-substituted acids do not fit this pattern; nearly all <i>ortho</i> groups are
<i><u>acid- strengthening</u></i>, whether electron-withdrawing or -releasing,
and the effect is quite large (see table).

<h3>18.15 Conversion into acid chlorides</h3>
<p>
RCOOH cmpds are converted to RCOCl cmpds more than any other derivative of
RCOOH. This is because RCOCl is the most reactive to forming any other desired
derivative in high yield. Three reagents are generally used: <i>thionyl
chloride</i>, SOCl<sub>2</sub>; <i>phosphorus trichloride</i>, PCl<sub>3</sub>;
and <i>phosphorus pentachloride</i>, PCl<sub>5</sub>. These reagents themselves
are acid chlorides of HSO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>
3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.
<p>
The reaction involves refluxing the acid chloride with the carboxylic acid.
Thionyl chloride is particularly convenient, since along with the RCOCl product,
 SO<sub>2</sub> and HCl are gaseous products easily separated; moreover,
unreacted SOCl<sub>2</sub> has a low b.p. (79&deg;) and is removed by
distillation. With PCl<sub>3</sub> or PCl<sub>5</sub>, the products are POCl or
POCl<sub>3</sub>.

<h3>18.16 Conversion into esters</h3>
<p>
RCOOR&prime; can be made from RCOOH in two ways. 1. By synthesis via the acid
chloride, in which RCOOH is treated with SOCl<sub>2</sub> or suitable reagent
to make RCOCl, which is then treated with R&prime;OH to make the ester,
RCOOR&prime;. 2. By acid-catalyzed alcoholysis of the RCOOH with R&prime;OH. A
small amount of mineral acid (either conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or dry
HCl) is added. This reaction is reversible and reaches an equilibrium; 1 mol
acetic acid + 1 mol ethanol in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
reaches equilibrium after several hours, with a mixture which produces
two-thirds mole each of the products (the ester and water) and one-third each
of the reactants (the acid and alcohol). This same equilibrium would obtain if
the ester and water had been mixed to hydrolyze the ester.
<p>
Synthesis from the acid chloride is therefore preferred, since preparation of
and reaction with the acid chloride goes to completion. However, the acid-
catalyzed reaction is often useful in preparing the ester. Because of the
usefulness of an equilibrium reaction, increasing either one or both of either
the reactants or products can dramatically shift what is obtained. On the
reactant side ROH products are generally cheap and can be used in excess of the
RCOOH to produce high yields of ester. For example, 1 mol &gamma;-phenylbutyric
acid with 8 mol ethanol refluxed in sulfuric acid produces an 85-88% yield of
the ester.
<p>
Removing the product can shift equilibrium as well, as demonstrated by the
elegant synthesis of ethyl adipate. The dicarboxylic acid adipic acid + excess
ethanol and toluene are heated in sulfuric acid in a distillation column. The
lowest boiling point component (75&deg;) is a reaction mixture of an azeotrope
of H<sub>2</sub>O:ethanol:toluene (see &sect;15.6). As fast as the water is
removed, the more the equilibrium is shifted to synthesis of the ester (b.p.
245&deg;).
<p>
With synthesis of phenolic esters, with 1 mol acid + 1 mol ArOH as reactants,
the equilibrium is particularly unfavorable toward ester formation, favoring
the reactants. But if H<sub>2</sub>O is removed during the reaction, synthesis
of the ester can be driven.
<p>
Bulky groups near the site of esterification, whether on ROH or RCOOH, slow
down esterification (as well as its reverse, hydrolysis). This steric hindrance
is so marked that special methods are needed to prepare esters from 3&deg; ROH
or from acids like 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoic acid (mesitoic acid). The
reactivities are shown:
<p>
<b>Reactivity in esterification</b>: CH<sub>3</sub>OH &gt; 1&deg; &gt;
2&deg; (&gt; 3&deg;)

<p>
HCOOH &gt; CH<sub>3</sub>
COOH &gt; RCH<sub>2</sub>COOH &gt; R<sub>2</sub>CHCOOH
&gt; R<sub>3</sub>CCOOH

<h3>18.17 Conversion into amides</h3>
<p>
RCONH<sub>2</sub> cmpds are generally prepared via acid chlorides by mixing the
RCOCl with ammonia. (There is no mention in the text of preparing amides by
mixing RCOOH directly with NH<sub>3</sub> in some sort of base- or acid-
catalyzed amidation.)

<h3>18.18 Reduction of acids to alcohols</h3>
<p>
Although ROH cmpds are more readily available than RCOOH, and ROH is usu.
converted to RCOOH for this reason, it is sometimes necessary to reduce an
RCOOH to an alcohol. The reducing agent, LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, is one of the few
reagents strong enough to perform this reduction:
<p>
4 RCOOH + 3 LiAlH<sub>4</sub> &rarr; 4 H<sub>2</sub> + 2 LiAlO<sub>2</sub> +
(RCH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>AlLi
<p>
(RCH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>AlLi + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; 4
RCH<sub>2</sub>OH (a 1&deg; alcohol) + LiAl(OH)<sub>3</sub>
<p>
The initial product is an alkoxide, which can be liberated by hydrolysis.
Yields are excellent, and LiAlH<sub>4</sub> is used for more than reducing
acids. The agent is somewhat expensive (for the purpose of large-scale
industrial use), and is used to prepare small amounts of valuable raw materials.
<p>
Often the acid is esterified, and the ester can be reduced by alternative
methods, methods available to both lab and industry.

<h3>18.19 Halogenation of aliphatic acids.  Substituted acids</h3>
<p>
The <b>Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky</b> reaction takes advantage of the basicity of
the &alpha;-carbon of aliphatic RCOOH molecules. In the presence of a small
amount of phosphorus, either Cl<sub>2</sub> or Br<sub>2</sub> can react to
produce an &alpha;-haloacid; this reaction is termed <i>alpha-halogenation</i>.
In fact the reaction can occur <i>exhaustively</i> for all hydrogens attached
to the alpha carbon, such that acetic acid reacts with P &amp; Cl<sub>2</sub>
to produce chloro-, dichloro- and trichloroacetic acid. The reaction is thought
to occur as follows

<p>
(1)  P + X<sub>2</sub> &rarr; PX<sub>3</sub>

<p>
(2) RCH<sub>2</sub>COOH + PX<sub>2</sub> &rarr; RCH<sub>2</sub>COX  (prodn of
acid chloride)

<p>
(3) RCH<sub>2</sub>COX + X<sub>2</sub> &rarr; RCHXCOX (&alpha;-haloacid
chloride)

<p>
(4) RCHXCOX + RCH<sub>2</sub>COOH &rarr; RCHXCOOH + RCH<sub>2</sub>COX

<p>
The &alpha;-haloacid chloride produced in step (3) can continue to react with
X<sub>2</sub>. Note that only a small amount of phosphorus is added to start
the reaction, and is not needed after step (2).

<p>
Once the &alpha;-haloacid is produced, it is typically involved in subsequent
syntheses. RCHXCOOH cmpds can undergo both <i>nucleophilic displacement</i> and
<i>elimination</i> reactions as normal RX compounds; hence alpha halogenation
is important in preparing substituted RCOOH cmpds.

<p>
RCHBrCOOH + excess ammonia &rarr; &alpha;-amino acid

<p>
RCHBrCOOH + NaOH &rarr; RCHOHCOONa + H<sup>+</sup> &rarr; &alpha;-hydroxy acid

<p>
RCH<sub>2</sub>CHBrCOOH + KOH (alc) &rarr; RCH=CHCOO<sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sup>
+</sup> &rarr; &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated acid

<p>
As far as acidity with polyprotic acids, ionization constants are not identical,
 and the second ionization is more difficult. This relates to the fact that
more energy is required to separate a proton from a doubly negatively charged
molecule.

<h3>18.21-.22  Analysis of RCOOH.  Neutralization equivalent.  Spectroscopy</h3>
<p>
RCOOH compounds are identified by their acidity, viz., their ability to
dissolve in aqueous NaOH or NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, the latter reaction showing gas
bubbles. Phenols fall in between water and RCOOH as far as their acidity: they
dissolve in aq. NaOH, but not in bicarbonate. While sulfonic acids are stronger
and dissolve in both, elemental analysis will show the presence of sulfur. Once
shown to be an RCOOH, the particular acid is identified by its physical
properties and by derivatization to an ester or amide so that <i>its</i>
physical properties confirm determination.
<p>
A <b>neutralization equivalent</b> should be assessed by titration with a
standard base. A weighed sample of acid dissolved in acid or aq. alcohol is
given a volume of standard base. For example, 0.224 g of unknown acid (m.p.
139-140&deg;) requires 13.6 ml of 0.104 N NaOH to the phenolphthalein end point.
1 equivalent of acid is therefore = 158 g.
<p>
Metal salts of RCOOH can be recognized because they (a) leave a residue when
strongly heated (<i>ignition test</i>), (b) decompose at a fairly high
temperature instead of melting, (c) change to their acid forms when treated
with dilute mineral acids.
<p>
When analyzing acids with ir spectroscopy, the O&mdash;H stretch band is strong
and broad for both enols and -COOH in the 2500-3000 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> range,
while alcohols and phenols (ROH and ArOH) show their absorption at 3200-3600
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>. In addition the carbonyl (C=O) stretch is encountered
for the first time: absorption of the C=O stretch is strong, with a narrow band
near 1700 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>. For RCOOH, 1700- 1725 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>;
for ArCOOH, 1680-1700 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; for &minus;C=C&minus;COOH (&alpha;,
&beta;-unsaturated acids), 1680-1700 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; and for &minus;COH=
CH&mdash;COOH (which is the enol form of a &beta;-keto acid&mdash;the H of
&beta;-hydroxy group being H-bonded to acid carbonyl), 1540-1640 cm<sup>&minus;
1</sup>. Acids also show C&mdash;O stretching at ~1250 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>
(cf. to ROH and ROR), and O&mdash;H bending bands near 1400 cm<sup>&minus;
1</sup> and 920 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> (broad). Enols also show O-H and C=O
bands, but the C=O band is distinct in freq. from the acid. Aldehydes, ketones,
and esters show C=O absorption, but no O&mdash;H band.
<p>
For nmr spectra, the acid proton is shifted very far downfield (&Delta; 10.5-12)

<h2>Chap. 19 Aldehydes and ketones.  Nucleophilic addition</h2>

<h3>19.1-.3 Structure.  Nomenclature.  Physical properties</h3>

<p>
Although aldehydes and ketones are formally distinct, with ketones representing
just substituted aldehyde hydrogen, they are collectively called <b>carbonyl
compounds</b>, since it is the C=O group giving them their distinct chemistry.
Some important differences: 1. RCHO are more easily oxidized, while RR&prime;CO
are oxidized with great difficulty. 2. RCHO are more reactive to nucleophilic
addition reactions.
<p>
Molecular geometry shows both cmpd types have trigonal geometry about the
carbonyl <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon, with bond angles of 120&deg;.
A <i>p</i> orbital of carbon overlaps a <i>p</i> orbital on oxygen to form a
&pi; bond. The C=O bond is quite polar, accounting for the difference in the
electronegativity of C and O. Physical studies through electron diffraction and
spectroscopy confirm this picture of molecular geometry and quantum mechanics.
A considerable dipole moment (2.3-2.8
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>) confirms the polarity.
<p>
The common names of the aldehydes can be abstracted from the corresponding
acids by replacing -<i>ic acid</i> with the suffix -<i>aldehyde</i>.  With IUPAC
naming convention, the longest chain carrying the -CHO group is the parent
structure, and is named by replacing the -<i>e </i> of the alkane name with -
<i>al</i>.  Examples are:  HCHO:  formaldehyde (methanal);  CH<sub>3</sub>CHO,
acetaldehyde (ethanal);  CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO, propionaldehyde
(propanal); CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO, <i>n</i>-
butyraldehyde (butanal); C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHO, benzaldehyde;
p-O<sub>2</sub>NC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHO, p-nitrobenzaldehyde;
<i>p</i>-CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHO, <i>p</i>-tolualdehyde;
<i>o</i>-HOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHO, salicylaldehyde
(<i>o</i>-hydroxybenzaldehyde); C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO,
phenylacetaldehyde (phenylethanal);
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CHO,
&alpha;-methylvaleraldehyde (2-methylpentanal);
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>CHO,
&beta;-methylvaleraldehyde (3-methylpentanal);
CH<sub>3</sub>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO,
isocaproaldehyde, &gamma;-methylvaleraldehyde (4-methylpentanal).

<p>
The simplest ketone is <i>acetone</i>.  For aliphatic unsymmetrical ketones,
the alkyl names are followed in succession followed by the word <i>ketone</i>. 
Any ketone in which the carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring is suffixed
with -<i>phenone</i>.  IUPAC name replaces the alkane -<i>e</i> with the suffix
-<i>one</i>.  Examples are:  CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>, acetone
(propanone); CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>, methyl ethyl ketone
(butanone); CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>, methyl
<i>n</i>-propyl ketone (2-pentanone);
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>, ethyl ketone (3-pentanone);
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>, methyl isopropyl
ketone (3-methyl-2-butanone);
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>, benzyl methyl ketone
(1-phenyl-2-propanone); C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>,
acetophenone;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>,
<i>n</i>-butyrophenone; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>,
benzophenone; <i>p</i>-CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO(<i>m</i>-
O<sub>2</sub>NC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), 3-nitro-4&prime;-
methylbenzophenone.

<p>
Because of the polar carbonyl function, aldehydes and ketones have higher b.p.
values than nonpolar cmpds of comparable MW; on the other side, their b.p.
values are lower than comparable ROH or RCOOH since the latter are able to H-
bond. Up to five carbons, aldehydes and ketones retain solubility in water, in
which the solvent can interact by H-bonding. All aldehydes and ketones are
soluble in the usual organic solvents.

Because formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is handled in aq
solutions (as <i>formalin</i>), or as one of its solid polymeric forms:
<i>paraformaldehyde</i> (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><i>n</i>,</sub> or <i>trioxane</i>
(CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>. When dry HCHO is desired for reaction with a
Grignard reagent, heating with paraformaldehyde or trioxane is done.
Acetaldehyde can be generated by the heating of its higher boiling (b.p.
125&deg;) trimeric form <i>paraldehyde</i> (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>
3</sub>; the trimer is formed during an acid-catalyzed polymerization.

4. Acetoacetic ester synthesis. (ch. 26)

<p>
Most of the reactions should be familiar for preparation of the aldehydes and
ketones. Oxidation or reduction of some alcohol, hydrocarbon, or acid chloride
of the same number produces the aldehyde or ketone. Industrial preparation
looks for low-cost reagents and methods: catalytic oxidation of alcohols with
air, or hot copper dehydrogenation of the alcohols.

<h3>19.5 Preparation of aldehydes by oxidation methods</h3>
<p>
In the laboratory, RCHO are produced by the same method used to produce RCOOH,
viz., oxidation in acidic dichromate of the corresponding RCH<sub>2</sub>OH
(primary alcohol) or of methylbenzene. Since an intermediate in the oxidation
is the aldehyde, further oxidation is prevented by removing the aldehyde as
fast as it is formed, either physically or chemically.
<p>
Since aldehydes have lower b.p. than their alcohols, the dichromate and
sulfuric acid are dripped into boiling alcohol, well above the b.p. of the
aldehyde, and the product aldehyde formed escapes as fast as it is formed
before additional oxidation can occur. The reaction is carried out using a
fractionating column which allows the RCHO to pass but returns the alcohol to
the reaction vessel.

<p>
For oxidation of the methylbenzenes, acetic anhydride is present in the
dichromate oxidation solution because the benzaldehyde formed reacts with the
anhydride to form a non-oxidizable <i>gem</i>-diacetate. The aldehyde is later
liberated by hydrolysis of the <i>gem</i>-diacetate product.

<h3>19.6 Preparation of ketones by Friedel-Crafts acylation</h3>

<p> An important EAS reaction is the reaction of acid chlorides on the aromatic
ring using a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl<sub>3</sub>).  A mechanism typical of EAS
and analogous to the F-C alkylation is supposed:

<p>
(1) RCOCl + AlCl<sub>3</sub> &rarr; RC&equiv;O<sup>+</sup> +
AlCl<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>

<p>
(2) ArH + RC&equiv;O<sup>+</sup> &rarr;  H-Ar<sup>+</sup>-COR

<p>
(3) ArH-COR<sup>+</sup> + AlCl &rarr; ArCOR + HCl + AlCl<sub>3</sub>

<p>
(3) R-C(Cl)=O<sup>+</sup>-Al<sup>&minus;</sup>Cl<sub>3</sub>

<p>
The electrophile is the <b>acylium ion</b>, RC&equiv;O<sup>+</sup>, and is much
more stable than any carbonium ion since every atom has an octet. It is
possible that the electrophile is a complex between RCOCl and AlCl<sub>3</sub>:


<p>
In preparing diaryl ketones, Ar-CO-Ar&prime;, it is particularly important to
decide the proper combination of Ar&prime;COCl and ArH. If <i>m</i>-
nitrobenzophenone is to be the product, it is essential to make the nitro group
on the acid chloride, since if it is on the ring to undergo substitution, the
nitro group is often too deactivating to allow the F-C acylation. To illustrate:
 Benzoyl chloride + nitrobenzene produces no reaction. However: toluene +
KMnO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; benzoic acid + HNO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>
4</sub> &rarr; m-nitrobenzoic acid + PCl<sub>5</sub> &rarr; <i>m</i>
-nitrobenzoyl chloride + benzene + AlCl<sub>3</sub> &rarr; <i>m</i>-
nitrobenzophenone.

<p>
F-C acylation is one of the most important synthetic steps in putting aromatic
rings on to aliphatics. The ketones prepared can be reduced to 2&deg; alcohols,
or treated with Grignards to produce 3&deg; ROH, and go on to form many other
compounds.

<p>
Aryl ketones can be exhaustively reduced by either of two reduction reactions:

<p>
1. <b>Clemmensen</b> <b>reduction</b>, in which amalgamated zinc in the
presence of conc. HCl is added to the arylketone to make the alkylbenzene:
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> +
Zn(Hg), HCl &rarr;
 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>

<p>
2. <b>Wolff-Kishner reduction</b>, in which the arylketone is heated with
alkaline hydrazine:  <i>m</i>-
CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>  + NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, OH<sup>&minus;</sup>, 200&deg; &rarr;
<i>m</i>-
CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>

<p> Because straight-chain alkyl groups longer than ethyl cannot be attached in
good yields to the benzene ring using F-C alkylation due to possible
rearrangements, the typical step is to use F-C acylation of the acid chloride, 
which cannot under rearrangement, and then use one of the two above reduction
steps.  The organocadmium reaction, described in the next section, can be used
in place of F-C acylation.

<h3>19.7 Preparation of ketones by use of organocadmium compounds</h3>

<p>
Grignard reagents react with CdCl<sub>2</sub> to produce the organocadmium
products, which can then react with acid chlorides.  <i>The organocadmium R
group must be either aryl or a primary alkyl chain</i>.

<p> (1) 2 R&prime;MgX + CdCl<sub>2</sub> &rarr; R&prime;<sub>2</sub>Cd + 2
MgXCl (R&prime; = aryl or 1&deg; alkyl)

<p> (2) R&prime;<sub>2</sub>Cd + 2 RCOCl &rarr; 2 RCOR&prime; +
CdCl<sub>2</sub>

<p> The acid chloride undergoes nucleophilic substitution, with the nucleophile
being the basic alkyl or aryl group or the organometallic rearrangement. 
R&prime;MgX reacts with RCOCl itself, but the products are usually 3&deg; ROH. 
This is because the initially formed ketone continues to react with Grignard
reagent at the C=O carbonyl;  organocadmium cmpds do not react with ketones. 
(3&deg; ROH are better prepared from esters rather than acid chlorides.)

<p> This low reactivity of organocadmium cmpds extends to -NO<sub>2</sub>, -CN,
-CO-, and -COOR, all of which react with the highly reactive Grignard cmpds.  It
can be seen that the CdCl<sub>2</sub> originally used is regenerated in the
second step.

<h3>19.8 Reactions.  Nucleophilic addition</h3>

<p> Two kinds of chemistry are seen with compounds having a C=O group:  (a) the
C=O bond provides a site for <i>nucleophilic addition</i>, (b) increasing the
acidity of H atoms on the alpha carbon.  Both of these effects are due to the
oxygen atom&prime;s ability to accommodate a negative charge.

<p> The carbonyl carbon is made highly reactive to nucleophilic attack because
of the polarized double bond, in which the mobile p electrons are pulled toward
the electronegative oxygen.  An electron-rich nucleophile (Lewis base) is the
most likely to attack this carbonyl carbon, leading to a transition state in
which the oxygen develops a negative charge while the carbonyl carbon changes
from the flat trigonal geometry to a tetrahedral form.  Once the oxygen has
acquired its full negative charge, it acquires a proton, usually from the
solvent.

<p> Although large groups on R or R&prime; might be thought to be involved in
steric hindrance, nucleophilic addition is comparatively less hindered than
S<sub>N</sub>2 attack, which must form a pentavalent carbon compared to forming
a tetrahedral carbon for the addition reaction.  Aldehydes react more quickly
than do ketones, and a combination of both electronic and steric factors explain
the difference in reactivity:  while the extra steric hindrance is obvious for
ketones bearing alkyl or aryl groups, the electronic factors are due to the
extra alkyl groups of the ketone which tend to be electron-releasing,
destabilizing the development of negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen, which
would rather disperse the transition state intermediate charge over the entire
molecule.  Aryl groups attached to the carbonyl actually deactivate it to
nucleophilic addition, not by any electron-withdrawing induction effect, but by
resonance:  as the C=O &pi; bond moves toward the oxygen, the carbonyl carbon
has little chance of becoming reactive to nucleophiles since any developing
positive charge results in &pi; bond rearrangement in the ring (resonance) to
stabilize the carbon.

<p class="reaxn">
<img src="ORGCHEM2_files/image004.png"
alt="delocalized positive charge input the aryl ring of a phenyl keton">
<p>
Where a protic acid is present, the H<sup>+</sup> ion attaches to one of the
nonbonding electron pairs in the valence shell of oxygen. This protonation puts 
a positive charge in the carbonyl function; the O atom compensates by removing 
the p electrons from the bond, letting carbon assume a great deal of the charge.
 The nucleophile, whether weak or strong, now attacks one side of the carbon, 
and the product amounts to the same reaction.

<h3>19.9 Oxidation</h3>
<p>
For aldehydes oxidation is rapid and easy. A hydrogen and its bonding electrons
are made available. It is easily distinguished from ketones in this regard. A
mechanism is suggested below, and may follow this pattern or via a cyclic
chromate ester (&sect;16.8). The intermediate is the chromate ester of the
aldehyde <i>hydrate</i>, RCH(OH)<sub>2</sub>. It may be that the ester is
formed not from the aldehyde, but rather its hydrate which exists in
equilibrium with the aldehyde. It is likely oxidation occurs with this special
alcohol, namely <i>gem</i>-diol.

<p class="reaxn">
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/AldehydeOxidationByChromate.png"
alt="chromate oxidation mechanism form an aldehyde">

<p>
Aldehydes are sensitive to not only strong oxidizers like permanganate and
dichromate, but also to Ag<sup>+</sup>, a noble metal with mild oxidizing 
ability. An alkaline medium is required, so ammonia is complexed with
Ag<sup>+</sup> to prevent precipitation of Ag<sub>2</sub>O. The formation a
<q>silver mirror</q> on the surface of the container is indicative of aldehyde
oxidation, and is the basis for the <b>Tollens' test</b>, used in the
identification of aldehydes. Tollens' reagent may also be used in
oxidizing &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated aldehydes to their acids, since
it does not attack the C=C bond. (Oxidation by Cu<sup>2+</sup> is
also a characteristic considered in reactions of carbohydrates, ch. 34.)
<p>
Oxidation of ketones other than the haloform reaction for methyl ketones
requires use of oxidizing reagents under vigorous conditions. Conditions are
such to promote formation of the enol tautomeric form of the ketone; the
resulting C=C bond can form on either side of the carbonyl carbon, which
becomes sensitive to bond cleavage. Because either side of the carbonyl carbon
forms a double bond in the enol, a mixture of RCOOH bonds will be formed from
the oxidation.
<p>
The haloform reaction has been discussed in &sect;16.11, but one significant
feature of the reaction is that, like Tollens' reagent, OX<sup>&minus;</sup>
does not attack C=C bonds and is used to convert &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated
methyl ketones to &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated acids.

<h3>19.10 Reduction</h3>

<p>

Aldehydes can be reduced to primary alcohols and ketones to secondary alcohols.
Catalytic hydrogenation with H<sub>2</sub> gas and Ni, Pt, or Pd or the strong
reducing agent, LiAlH<sub>4</sub> or NaBH<sub>4</sub>, are used. Examples are
LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reduction of cyclopentanone to cyclopentanol, crotonaldehyde
(CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CHCHO) reduction by H<sub>2</sub> and Ni to <i>n-</i>butanol,
and cinnamaldehyde (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH=CHCHO) reduction by
NaBH<sub>4</sub> to cinnamyl alcohol. NaBH<sub>4</sub> is unable to reduce
the C=C bond, and is useful in reducing &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated carbonyls.

<p>
Both RCHO and RCOR&prime; are reduced to fully saturated hydrocarbons by
either the Clemmensen reaction with zinc amalgam [Zn(Hg)] and conc. HCl, or by
the Wolff-Kishner reduction with hydrazine and a strong base like KOH or
potassium <i>tert</i>-butoxide.

<p>
The mechanism by metal hydrides is shown:

<p>
4 R<sub>2</sub>C=O + LiAlH<sub>4</sub> &rarr; (R<sub>2</sub>CHO)AlLi +
H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; 4 R<sub>2</sub>CHOH + LiOH + Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>

<p>
An aluminum hydride complex is probably involved in an attack resembling
nucleophilic addition, but the nucleophile is hydride, making it a reduction.

<p>

-C=O + H&minus;AlH<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr;
-CH-OAlH<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> + 3 other -C=O &rarr;
(-C-O)<sub>4</sub>Al<sup>&minus;</sup>

<p>
The complex of metal ester is then hydrolyzed in acidified water.

<h3>19.11 Addition of Grignard reagents</h3>

<p>
The reaction of Grignards has been discussed in ch. 15.  Its
ability to add as a nucleophile has been shown.

<h3>19.12 Addition of cyanide</h3>
<p>
The CN<sup>&minus;</sup> is a strong base, and therefore quite
nucleophilic.  The carbonyl is added to a mixture of the mineral acid and NaCN,
from which a cyanohydrin is obtained.  This reaction is often done with
bisulfite addition product of carbonyls:  the carbonyl exists in equilibrium
with its bisulfite adduct, and will form the cyanohydrin.  The medium should
only be mildly acidic, since it generates too much HCN otherwise (a very poor
nucleophile), which is also dangerous.  This reaction is useful for generating
either &alpha;-hydroxyacids or &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated acids, which form
readily by a combined hydrolysis of the nitrile and dehydration in conjugation
with the carbonyl.

<h3>19.13 Addition of bisulfite</h3>
<p>
In concentrated aqueous solutions of NaHSO<sub>3</sub>, aldehydes and ketones
which do not have bulky groups react to form sulfohemiacetals. These products
separate as crystalline solids. Bisulfite ion is the nucleophile in this case.
The addition reaction, like many is reversible, and the equilibrium can be
shifted toward elimination of the bisulfite by adding either acid or base,
which react with bisulfite. Acid causes formation of H<sub>2</sub>O and a
gaseous SO<sub>2</sub>. Base causes formation of H<sub>2</sub>O and SO<sub>
3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>.

<p>
Bisulfite addition is usu. used to separate carbonyls from
noncarbonyls.

<h3>19.14 Addition of derivatives of NH<sub>3</sub></h3>

<p> Derivatives ammonia include such compounds as hydroxylamine,
phenylhydrazine, and semicarbazide.  They are all basic (as is ammonia),
reacting with mineral acids to form salts, the salts being less easily oxidized
by air than the free bases (for this reason, they come preserved as salts). 
When needed, sodium acetate is added to liberate the free base for use.

<p> Conditions for reaction with these derivatives depend upon addition of an
acid to catalyze the reaction.  The proton will attach to the carbonyl oxygen to
an make it sensitive to nucleophilic attack.  However, if the acidity is high,
the amine becomes protonated as well and is virtually non-nucleophilic. 
Therefore a balance experimentally arrived at is necessary.  The exact
conditions depend upon the reactivity of the carbonyl and the basicity of the
reagent.

<h3>19.15 Addition of alcohols.  Acetal formation</h3>
<p>
In the presence of anhydrous mineral acids, alcohols will react with
aldehydes to form <b>acetals</b>.  2 moles of ROH are consumed for every
aldehyde.
<p>
R&prime;CHO + 2 ROH + H<sup>+</sup> &harr;
R&prime;CH(OR)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

<p>
The reaction is done by allowing the aldehyde to stand with excess alcohol
in a little anhydrous acid, usually HCl.  Ethyl acetals are obtained by taking
advantage of the azeotropic water:benzene:ethanol (b.p. 64.9&deg;) combination
(benzene is obviously added), so that as water is formed, it is taken off.

<p>
In alcoholic solutions, aldehydes probably exist in equilibrium as their <b>
hemiacetal </b>forms, in which the alcohol adds to the carbonyl. It is both an
ether and alcohol, but with few exceptions, is not stable enough to be isolated.
The formation of an acetal continues in which the acid proton binds to the -OH
group to form a suitable leaving group. The water molecule then leaves to form
a carbonium which becomes an oxonium intermediate as a nonbonding pair from the
oxygen of the OR group already attached stabilizes the intermediate (all atoms
have an octet). An ROH then attacks as a nucleophile, latter eliminating its
proton to stabilize the acetal. The mechanism is classic S<sub>N</sub>1.
Formation of the acetal therefore combines (a) nucleophilic addition to a C=O
group and (b) ether formation via a carbonium/oxonium.

<p>
Acetals are similar to ethers in that they are unstable in acids, being cleaved
more easily and rapidly than are ethers, and are stable in basic solutions.
Acid-hydrolyzed cleavage can be done at room temperature in dilute mineral
acids.

<h3>19.16 Cannizzaro reaction</h3>
<p>
Aldehydes with no &alpha;-hydrogens can react with concentrated alkali to form
a mixture of their alcohol and the salt of their acid. This amounts to a
self-oxidation and -reduction reaction, and is called the <b>Cannizzaro
reaction</b>. The -CHO compound is allowed to stand at room temp. with
concentrated aq. or alcoholic hydroxide.
<p>
2 formaldehyde + 50% NaOH &rarr; methanol + sodium formate

<p>
<i>p</i>-nitrobenzaldehyde + 35% NaOH &rarr; <i>p</i>-nitrobenzyl alcohol +
Na <i>p</i>-nitrobenzoate

<p>
With mixtures of two aldehydes, the Cannizzaro reaction can yield all possible
products (two different salts of the acid, two different alcohols). If one of the
aldehydes is formaldehyde, the mixture almost exclusively yields sodium formate
and the alcohol of the other aldehyde. This is called the <b>crossed Cannizzaro
reaction</b>, in which it is known that the formaldehyde has a strong tendency
to undergo oxidation.
<p>
Evidence from kinetic studies and experiments using isotopes shows this
reaction essentially involves nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl. In step 1,
hydroxide adds to the carbonyl, and then the <i>hydrogen</i> of the aldehyde
becomes a nucleophilic hydride attacking second molecule of the aldehyde at its
carbonyl carbon, which occurs in step 2.

<p class="reaxn">
<img src="imagesOChemHTML/CrossedCannizzaroMechanism.png"
alt="crossed Cannizzaro reaction mechanism">

<p>
The first aldehyde becomes thus oxidized, while the second molecule becomes
reduced. In the crossed Cannizzaro, there can be several explanations as to why
HCHO comes out the acid while the other aldehyde comes out the alcohol: (i)
formaldehyde is likely to react with OH<sup>&minus;</sup> first for both steric
(unsubstituted carbonyl) and electronic reasons (greater stabilization of the
intermediate since no alkyl electron-withdrawing groups). (ii) while the other
aldehyde can react as well, the formaldehyde reacts more quickly because it has
<i>two</i> hydrogens which can serve as the hydride nucleophile donor, so the
probability is higher for formaldehyde being oxidized. (iii) positioning of the
hydride nucleophile next to the carbonyl of the second molecule would require
that the first molecule (or at least one of them) have small substituents so
that positioning is convenient.

<h3>19.17-.18 Analysis of aldehydes and ketones.  Spectroscopy</h3>
<p>
Carbonyls are typically identified with their unique reaction with the ammonia
derivatives: 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine + RCHO or RCOR&prime; will react to
form an insoluble yellow or red solid.
<p>
Aldehydes are distinguished from ketones by their ability to react to Tollens'
reagent and by the ease of oxidation with cold, dilute, neutral KMnO<sub>4</sub>
and with CrO<sub>3</sub> in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The Tollens' should
be interpreted cautiously since phenols and amines give a positive test as well;
these compounds do not react with 2,4-DNPH.

<p>
The <b>Schiff test</b> is a highly sensitive test in which
the RCHO reacts with fuschin-aldehyde reagent to produce a magenta color.

<p>
Aliphatic RCHO and RCOR&prime; having &alpha;-hydrogens will decolorize
Br<sub>2</sub> in CCl<sub>4</sub>, but the reaction is too slow compared
to truly unsaturated compounds, and moreover, it liberates HBr.

<p>
The particular RCHO and RCOR&prime;, once the functional group is established,
is identified by melting point determinations or 2,4- dinitrophenylhydrazones,
oximes, and semicarbazones. Methyl ketones react according to the iodoform test.

<p>
In the infrared, the C=O stretch at 1700 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> is
characteristic, being seldom obscured by other absorptions, and the first band 
looked for. Once distinguished from an acid or derivative of an acid, more 
definitive information is revealed in the C=O stretch depending on its location 
in the spectra: RCHO, 1725 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; R<sub>2</sub>CO, 1710 cm<sup>
&minus;1</sup>; ArCHO, 1700 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; ArCOR, 1690 cm<sup>&minus;
1</sup>; cyclobutanones, 1780 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; cyclopentanones, 1740 
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated aldehyde, 1685 cm<sup>&minus;
1</sup>; &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated ketone, 1675 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; enolic 
form of &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated carbonyl, 1540- 1640 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>. 
The C-H stretch of the -CHO group is found near 2720 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>, 
which when found with the particular C=O stretch is definitive for an aldehyde. 
RCOOH and RCOOR&prime; show C=O stretches, but the broad O-H stretching band of 
the acid is disqualifying, and esters have their C=O band at higher freq. than 
ketones of comparable structure and also show definitive C-O stretches.

<p>
In nmr spectra, aldehyde protons are absorb fairly downfield (&Delta; 9-10).
Coupling to adjacent protons has a small <i>J</i> or 1-3 Hz, with this fine
splitting superimposed on other splittings.

<p>
Taking uv spectra can be useful. While fully saturated aldehydes and ketones
absorb weakly (the R band with &lambda;<sub>max</sub> = 270-300 nm and &epsilon;
<sub>max</sub> = 10-20). When conjugated to a C=C bond, this R band moves to a
longer wavelength (&lambda;<sub>max</sub> = 300-350 nm and
&epsilon;<sub>max</sub> = 10-20) and moves an intense K band from far UV
into near UV (&lambda;<sub>max</sub> = 215-250 nm and &epsilon;<sub>max</sub>
= 10,000-20,000). The K band position gives information about both the
number and location of substituents in the conjugated system.

<h2>Chap. 20 Functional derivatives of carboxylic acids.  Nucleophilic acyl
substitution</h2>

<h3>20.1-.3 Structure.  Nomenclature.  Physical properties</h3>

<p>
The functional derivatives of RCOOH are the <i>acid chlorides</i>, <i>
anhydrides</i>, <i>amides</i>, and <i>esters</i>. In each of the cmpds, the -OH
group is replaced by -Cl, -OOCR, -NH<sub>2</sub>, or -OR&prime;, and they all
contain and <b>acyl group</b>.

<p>
Names are taken from the common name or the IUPAC name of the corresponding
acid. Acid chlorides change the suffix -<i>ic acid</i> to -<i>yl chloride</i>,
anhydrides from <i>acid</i> to <i>anhydride</i>, amides from -<i>ic acid</i> of
the common name and -<i>oic acid</i> of the IUPAC name to -<i>amide</i>, and
the esters from -<i>ic acid</i> to -<i>ate</i> preceded by the name of the
alcohol or phenol esterified.

<p>
The C=O group strongly affects the physical properties of the acid derivatives.
RCOCl, RCOOOCR, and RCOOR&prime; cmpds have b.p. values to RCHO and RCOR&prime;
of comparable MW. Amides have very high b.p. because of multifaceted and very
strong hydrogen bonding. The borderline for water solubility is 3-5 carbons for
esters and 5-6 carbons for the amides, while all derivatives are quite soluble
in the usual organic solvents. The volatile esters have pleasant odors and are
found in perfumes and flavorings.

<h3>20.4 Nucleophilic acyl substitution.  Role of the carbonyl group</h3>

<p>
The derivatives of RCOOH contain a C=O group, as does the
acid.  The acid is convertible to these derivatives, and the derivatives
hydrolyzed to the acid.  As in aldehydes and ketones, the C=O group has two
effects:  (a) it provides a nucleophilic attack site, (b) it increases the
acidity of &alpha;-hydrogens.

<p>
The acyl compounds (distinguished from plain aliphatic or
aryl carbonyl) typically undergo <b>nucleophilic substitution</b> instead of
nucleophilic addition of carbonyls.  Also, such substitutions take place more
readily than at a saturated carbon, as in the S<sub>N</sub>1- or
S<sub>N</sub>2-type attacks shown earlier.  For example, -NH<sub>2</sub> can
not replace the -OH of an alcohol directly.  This substitution is allowed
because of the chemistry of the carbonyl with its <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized
carbon, all &sigma; bonds lying a plane with the &pi; bond slightly polarized
negatively toward the oxygen.

<p>
The mechanisms of nucleophilic addition and substitution are
compared:

<p class="reaxn">
RR&prime;C=O + :Z &harr; RR&prime;CZO<sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> &harr;
RR&prime;CZOH <i>Addition</i>

<p class="reaxn">
RWC=O + :Z &harr; RWCZO<sup>&minus;</sup>  &harr;
RZC=O + :W <i>Substitution</i>

<p>
Both have the tetrahedral intermediates with the oxygen atom stabilizing the
negative charge, but the acyl compounds loses one of its substituents, W,
reforming the carbonyl, while aldehydes and ketones obtain a proton to form the
hydroxy addition product. The ease with which W leaves the carbonyl carbon
depends upon its basicity (nucleophilicity). For the acid derivatives, acid
chlorides have the very weak base Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>, for anhydrides the
moderately weak base RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup>, and for esters and amides the very
strong bases R&prime;O<sup>&minus;</sup> and NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>.
For aldehydes, W would be the hydride ion (H<sup>&minus;</sup>) and for ketones
the alkide ion (R<sup>&minus;</sup>), and both of these bases are much too
strong to leave at all (their <q>acids,</q> H<sub>2</sub> and RH, are not
really acids at all). So with RCHO and RCOR&prime;, there is no substitution at
all. On the other hand, it is easy to see why acid chlorides are very reactive
and are used in the synthesis of the other derivatives.

<p>
Nucleophilic acyl substitution can be either acid- or base-catalyzed, if the
reaction is to proceed without delay. Formation of the tetrahedral intermediate
occurs in both mechanisms, and is the rate-determining step. The electronic and
steric factors which govern formation of the tetrahedral intermediate in
aldehydes and ketones govern the same way for acyl compounds. In the
acid-catalyzed reaction, H<sup>+</sup> adds to a nonbonding pair on oxygen, and
the charge becomes distributed more to the carbonyl C making it susceptible to
nucleophilic attack; the positive charge is transferred to the nucleophile in
this case, and the weaker nucleophile leaves, restoring the carbonyl and
ejecting the H<sup>+</sup> ion. In the base-catalyzed attack, the nucleophile
is strong and attack the carbonyl C without any change having occurred in the
molecule previously, and the oxygen assumes a negative charge; the weaker
nucleophile then leaves to restore the carbonyl and make a new acid derivative.
If water is the nucleophile in the acid-catalyzed reaction, and hydroxide in
the base-catalyzed, the net effect is hydrolysis of the acid derivative.

<h3>20.5 Nucleophilic substitution:  alkyl vs. acyl</h3>

<p>
Nucleophilic acyl substitution occurs much more readily than nucleophilic alkyl
substitution. Acid chlorides RCOCl are more reactive to substitution than are
alkyl chlorides R-Cl, and the same for amides RCONH<sub>2</sub> vs. amines
RNH<sub>2</sub>, or esters RCOOR&prime; vs. ethers ROR&prime;. In the S<sub>
N</sub>2 alkyl substitution, the nucleophile must attack already crowded <i>
tetrahedral</i> carbon to form a <i>pentavalent</i> carbon in the transition
state to form the product. In the acyl substitution, a flat trigonal carbon is
attacked by nucleophile to form a much more stable tetrahedral intermediate in
the transition state. In the alkyl substitution, a strong &sigma; bond must be
broken to form another one, while in the acyl substitution, only a
comparatively weak &pi; bond must be broken.

<h3>20.6-.7 Preparation and reactions of acid chlorides</h3>

<p>
The preparation of RCOCl was discussed in ch. 18.

<p>
RCOCl are the most reactive of the acid derivatives, namely because Cl<sup>
&minus;</sup> is a very weak base and leaves the acyl group easily. 1. It
reacts with HZ, and assuming Z is more basic, the products will be RCOZ and HCl
(or Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> in a base catalyzed reaction). 2. It reacts with water
rapidly (water is a stronger base here) to essentially hydrolyze the derivative
to form the acid. 3. It reacts with 2 moles of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) in <i>
ammonolysis</i> to form the amide, RCONH<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. 4.
It reacts with alcohols R&prime;OH (<i>alcoholysis</i>) to form esters,
RCOOR&prime;.

<p>
5. Acid chlorides participate in Friedel-Crafts acylation: RCOCl + benzene
or moderately active substituted benzene + Lewis acid catalyst
(AlCl<sub>3</sub>) to form a ketone (phenone). 6. Acid chlorides react with organocadmium
compounds to form ketones (aryl or alkyl); the organocadmium cmpds are first
made from Grignards: R&prime;MgX + CdCl<sub>2</sub> &rarr; R&prime;<sub>2</sub>
Cd + acid chloride &rarr; ketone. R&prime; in the organocadmium should be aryl
or 1&deg; alkyl. 7. And acid chlorides can be reduced to aldehydes using
reducing agent LiAlH(OBu-<i>t</i>)<sub>3</sub>. The last three reactions have
been discussed in ch. 19.

<h3>20.8 Conversion of acid chlorides into acid derivatives</h3>

<p>
This technique is quite common. RCOOH is usu. converted to its acid chloride,
which is then converted to amides or esters, with both steps usually going to
completion irreversibly. The aromatic acid chlorides (ArCOCl) are much less
reactive than the aliphatic acid chlorides (RCOCl): acetyl chloride reacts
explosively with cold water, while benzoyl chloride reacts very slowly.
Reaction of ArCOCl with an alcohol or phenol is usu. done by the
<b>Schotten-Baumann</b> technique: the ArCOCl is added in portions with vigorous
shaking after each addition to a mixture of the -OH bearing cmpd and a base
(usu. aq. NaOH or pyridine). The base serves to catalyze the reaction and
neutralize liberated HCl, forcing the reaction further; it apparently does not
react with the acid chloride.

<h3>20.9-.10 Preparation and reactions of acid anhydrides</h3>

<p>
Generally acid anhydrides are infrequently encountered, but
one is very important and encountered a great deal, <b>acetic anhydride</b>. 
It can be prepared from <b>ketene</b>, CH<sub>2</sub>=C=O, by reaction with
acetic acid:

<p>
CH<sub>3</sub>COOH in AlPO<sub>4</sub> catalyst, 700&deg; &rarr;
CH<sub>2</sub>=C=O + CH<sub>3</sub>COOH &rarr; acetic anhydride

<p>
In the laboratory, ketene can be made from pyrolysis of acetone:

<p>
CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub> (700-750&deg;) &rarr; ketene + methane

<p>
Dicarboxylic acids also form anhydrides, but more easily than the
monocarboxylic acids, requiring relatively less heat essentially to dehydrate
the acid to form 5- and 6-membered anhydride rings. Succinic acid forms its
anhydride. Phthalic acid forms phthalic anhydride. Ring size is apparently
critical: adipic acid would form a 7-membered anhydride on heating, and the
reaction does not occur. Instead (in Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> at 285-95&deg;),
cyclopentanone is formed and water and CO<sub>2</sub> are removed.

<p>
Acid anhydrides react more slowly than the acid chlorides. However, when a
compound is to be acetylated (a common reaction), acetic anhydride is preferred
to acetyl chloride because it is cheap, readily available, less volatile, and
the reaction does not form the corrosive HCl product, which more readily reacts
with other groups on the molecule. Acetic anhydride is often used in
esterifying cellulose and other polyhydroxy compounds.

<p>
The reactions of anhydrides are typically: 1. Conversion into other acid
derivatives. (a) into RCOOH by hydrolysis with water, (b) into amides
RCONH<sub>2</sub> by ammonolysis with ammonia, and (c) conversion into esters by
alcoholysis with alcohols. 2. Formation of ketones by the F-C acylation. The
anhydride can be mixed with AlCl<sub>3</sub> or any Lewis acid and undergo EAS
in a somewhat activated benzene ring.

<p>
In reactions of the anhydride, one product is the desired product, the other is
a RCOOH. Cyclic anhydrides make RCOOH part of the molecule however, meaning the
product now has the acyl group and a -COOH function. Such bifunctional
compounds are of great interest in synthesis.

<h3>20.11-.14 Preparation and reactions of amides.  Hydrolysis of amides. 
Imides</h3>

<p>
Laboratory preparation of amides has been discussed in this chapter. In
industry RCONH<sub>2</sub> is made by heating
RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, which is in equilibrium
with NH<sub>3</sub> and the acid.

<p>
1.  Hydrolysis.  RCONH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O in base or acid
&rarr; RCOOH or conjugate base + ammonium or conj. base

<p>
2. Conversion to imides (20.14)

<p>
3. Hofmann degradation of amides (ch. 22 and 28) to amines. RCONH<sub>2</sub>
or ArCONH<sub>2</sub> + OBr<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; RNH<sub>2</sub> or
ArNH<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>

<p>
The hydrolysis of amides can proceed in the presence of acid or base, by a
mechanism covered previously. (No mention is made how the -NH<sub>2</sub> is
made into a leaving group even though it is a stronger nucleophile than -OH or
-OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, or whether base- or acid-catalysis proceeds
better.)

<p>
Cyclic anhydrides, like anhydrides, can undergo ammonolysis to yield a
combination amide and ammonium salt of the acid: R(CO)<sub>2</sub>(O) + 2
NH<sub>3</sub> &rarr; H<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>OOCRCONH<sub>2</sub>. If this
acid-amide is now heated, water is lost and a ring reforms, with nitrogen
centered between the acyl groups. This class of compounds are called <b>
imides<i>. </i> </b>Phthalic anhydride heated in the presence of NH<sub>3</sub>
forms phthalimide; ammonium phthalamate (the ammonium salt of the acid-amide)
heated by itself to 300&deg; forms the same product; and phthalamic acid
(merely the acid-amide itself) heated also forms the same thing.

<h3>20.15-.16 Preparation and reactions of esters</h3>

<p>
Esters are prepared in the laboratory:

<p>
1. from acids.  RCOOH + R&prime;OH in acid &harr; RCOOR&prime; + water
(R&prime;OH reactivity:  1&deg; &gt; 2&deg; (&gt; 3&deg;)

<p>
2. from acid chlorides or anhydrides.

<p>
RCOCl + R&prime;OH (or ArOH) &rarr; RCOOR&prime; (or RCOOAr) + HCl

<p>
(RCO)<sub>2</sub>O + R&prime;OH (or ArOH) &rarr; RCOOR&prime; (or RCOOAr) +
RCOOH

<p>
3. from other esters.  Transesterification.  (20.20)

<p>
A hydroxyacid is both an alcohol and acid, and if it can form a 5- or
6-membered ring under the proper conditions (meaning that it is a &gamma;- or 
&delta;-hydroxyacid), intramolecular esterification occurs. The product is 
called a <b>lactone</b>, either a &gamma; - or &delta;-lactone, and is a cyclic 
ester. Lactones can be rapidly hydrolyzed in basic medium.

<p>
Esters undergo reactions typical of acyl substitution inasmuch as they are
prepared from them. Often a little acid is added to promote the speed of the
reaction.

(a) into RCOOH. Hydrolysis.  either acid- or base-catalyzed.

<h3>20.17 Alkaline hydrolysis of esters</h3>

<p>
RCOOR&prime; undergoes base-catalyzed hydrolysis to form the RCOO<sup>&minus;
</sup> and R&prime;OH (R&prime; can be alkyl or aryl). The OH<sup>&minus;</sup>
present in basic aqueous solutions is a strong nucleophile. Although the
reaction is an equilibrium reaction, hydrolysis is irreversible since the
RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup> formed has incredible stability and resists attack by
the alcohol to reform the ester.
<p>
Kinetics is found to be second-order, so the more OH<sup>&minus;</sup>
available, the higher the rate (a base is only a catalyst if not involved in
the product).
<p>

Could the OH<sup>&minus;</sup> hydrolyze the ester by reacting with the alcohol
by nucleophilic <i>alkyl</i> substitution rather than with the C=O via acyl
substitution? Evidence of the acyl substitution comes from two types of studies.
 1. <i>Stereochemistry</i>. When (+)-<i>sec</i>-butyl alcohol is mixed with
benzoyl chloride, the <i>sec</i>-butyl benzoyl ester is formed, with
stereochemistry retained. Now the ester is to be hydrolyzed. If chiral C-O bond
is involved in the hydrolysis, it would be exactly like a S<sub>N</sub>2
reaction which produces stereochemical inversion (or if S<sub>N</sub>1,
inversion + partial racemization). If by an acyl substitution, the chiral C-O
bond is not broken and configuration is not altered. In fact, the optical
rotation of optically active alcohol is the same before ester synthesis and
after hydrolysis. 2. <i>Isotopic tracer studies</i>. [<sup>18</sup>O]Ethyl
propionate was prepared in which [<sup>18</sup>O-enriched]ethanol was the
alcohol. After alkaline hydrolysis, the ethanol retained its <sup>18</sup>
O-enriched isotope, while the propionate had the background amount. Again acyl
substitution.

<p>
M. Bender has proved that the acyl substitution occurs in two steps (1. bonding
of nucleophile to form tetrahedral intermediate, 2. leaving of other
nucleophile) as has always been shown for acyl substitution. He carried out
alkaline hydrolysis of [<sup>18</sup>O-carbonyl O]ethyl benzoate. At various
times points, the reaction chamber was sampled and the ester reactant analyzed
for <sup>18</sup>O content. His results show that not only did the ester
undergo hydrolysis but also <i>exchange of carbonyl</i> <sup>18</sup>O <i>for
ordinary oxygen in the solvent</i>. In forming the tetrahedral intermediate,
<sup>18</sup>O is negatively charged and can obtain a proton from water. In
that case, two -OH groups are attached to the acyl carbon and are chemically
equivalent, hence either can leave to reform the ester at equilibrium
conditions. Although Bender&prime;s work alone does not prove the mechanism,
taken together with other work, it makes any other mechanism unlikely.

<h3>20.18 Acidic hydrolysis of esters</h3>

<p>
Acid-hydrolysis of esters accomplishes the same thing as base hydrolysis, but
reversibility is greater than under alkaline conditions, since the RCOOH
product formed is less resistant to nucleophilic attack by R&prime;OH.

<p>
The mineral acid protonates the C=O oxygen, and the weak nucleophile water
makes its attack. There are actually more intermediates in the acid-catalyzed
attack: once water bonds, a proton from the molecule must leave or directly
transfer to protonate the R&prime;O- oxygen and form its oxonium, maximizing
its potential as a leaving group. The same kinds of studies done to examine
what particular C-O bonds are cleaved in the base-catalyzed reaction also show
that any bond-making and -breaking is done with the acyl carbon in the
acid-catalyzed reaction.

<h3>20.19 Ammonolysis of esters</h3>

<p>
Esters can be converted into their amides directly by mixing the ester with
NH<sub>3</sub>, generally in alcoholic solvents to prevent hydrolysis.

<h3>20.20 Transesterification</h3>

<p>

One particular ester can be converted to another ester by <b>tran
sesterification</b>. The reaction can be acid-catalyzed (sulfuric or dry HCl) 
or base-catalyzed (usually an alkoxide). The ester (RCOOR&prime;) is mixed in 
the alcohol (R&prime;OH), probably serving as both solvent and reactant, with
some acid (free of water), and allowed to come to equilibrium. In a base
catalyzed reaction, the ester should be mixed with the alcohol as solvent and
its salt (R&prime;OH and R&prime;O<sup>&minus;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>). Either a
large excess of R&prime;OH or removal of one of the products will shift the
reaction according to its equilibrium.

<h3>20.21 Reaction of esters with Grignard reagents</h3>

<p>
Esters are prepared with Grignards as an excellent method for preparing 3&deg;
alcohols. 2 moles of R&prime;MgX are consumed, first to convert the ester
(RCOOR&prime;) to a ketone (+ R&prime;OMgX), then the ketone reacts with
another R&prime;MgX to form R(R&prime;)<sub>2</sub>COMgX, which can be
hydrolyzed. The alcohol will have two of its alkyl groups contributed by the
Grignard.

<h3>20.22 Reduction of esters</h3>

<p>
Ester reduction, no matter what method is used, always yields two alcohols, one
of them primary (from the acid portion), amounting to a cleavage of the ester.
One method is <b>hydrogenolysis</b> (cleavage by hydrogen), requiring very high
pressures and temperatures and a catalyst, the catalyst used most often being
<i>copper chromite</i> (CuO.CuCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). For example, methyl
laurate is reduced to lauryl alcohol (1-dodecanol) and methanol with H<sub>
2</sub>, the catalyst, 150&deg;, and 5000 psi. <b>Chemical reduction</b> is
done in the lab, either with Na metal and alcohol, or typically by use of
LiAlH<sub>4</sub>.

<h3>20.23 Functional derivatives of carbonic acid</h3>

<p>
Carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) is carboxylic acid of a special
kind, being formed in a reaction of H<sub>2</sub>O with CO<sub>2</sub>, but the
equilibrium tilted towards water and CO<sub>2</sub>. It is essentially
bifunctional, and stable acid derivatives are produced from it. Phosgene or
carbonyl chloride (COCl<sub>2</sub>) is the acid chloride; urea or carbamide
(NH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>) is the amide derivative; ethyl (pyro)carbonate
(EtOCOOEt) is the ethyl ester, and are symmetrical derivatives. Other useful
but unsymmetrical derivatives are ethyl chlorocarbonate (EtOCOCl), cyanamide
(H<sub>2</sub>NCN), and urethane or ethyl carbamate (H<sub>2</sub>NCOOEt).

<p>
When carbonic acid derivatives have an -OH group, they are unstable and
decompose to CO<sub>2</sub> and the protonated function on the other side.
Carbamic acid decomposes to ammonia and CO<sub>2</sub>. Most derivatives of
carbonic acid are made from three industrially available compounds: phosgene,
urea, and cyanamide.

<p>
<b>Phosgene</b> is highly poisonous and made by chlorination of carbon monoxide:
 CO + Cl<sub>2</sub> (activated charcoal, 200&deg;) &rarr; phosgene. When mixed
with water, CO<sub>2</sub> and HCl are produced; when mixed with NH<sub>3</sub>,
 urea is produced; when mixed with ROH, an alkyl carbonate is produced; if
mixed with ROH and NH<sub>3</sub>, and alkyl carbamate (urethane) is produced.

<p>
<b>Urea</b> is made from ammonia and carbon dioxide under heat and pressure. It
is weakly basic (unlike ordinary amides), forming a salt with strong acids; the
proton bind to a nonbonding pair on oxygen rather than either of the nitrogens.
Its basicity is attributed to resonance stabilization. Urea is hydrolyzed in
the presence of acids or bases. Urea can react with nitrous acid (HONO) to
produce CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>; this is useful in destroying any
unreacted HONO used in diazotizations. Urea also reacts with hypohalites to
form nitrogen and carbonate: urea + Br<sub>2</sub> + OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr;
 N<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + Br<sup>&minus;</sup>.
Treatment of urea with RCOCl or (RCO)<sub>2</sub>O can produce <b>ureides</b>:
urea + acetyl chloride &rarr; acetylurea (CH<sub>3</sub>CONHCONH<sub>2</sub>),
an <i>ureide</i>. In fact a cyclic ureide is formed by reaction of urea with
ethyl malonate: urea + (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O (ethyl
malonate) in NaOEt/EtOH at 110&deg; &rarr; barbituric acid (malonylurea).

<p>
<b>Cyanamide</b> is obtained industrially by reaction of calcium carbide +
nitrogen gas at very high temperature to form the calcium salt: CaC<sub>2</sub>
+ N<sub>2</sub> at 1000&deg; &rarr; CaNCN + C. This reaction amounts to
nitrogen fixation. When water is added, ammonia is release and used as a
fertilizer.

<h3>20.24-.25 Analysis of RCOOH derivatives.  Saponification equivalent. 
Spectroscopic analysis</h3>

<p>
Functional derivatives of acids can by recognized first by hydrolysis to the
RCOOH. The derivative is known by its product (HCl, NH<sub>3</sub>, ROH, RCOOH).
 The structure of the derivative is usu. done on its acid form; for esters, the
ROH is also analyzed.
<p>
The <b>saponification equivalent</b> is a determination of the equivalent
weight of an ester: an known amount of base is added (to exceed the ester
equivalent) and the amount of base consumed is determined by titration with a
standardized acid.
<p>
In the infrared, all acyl compounds show a strong band near 1700
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> for the C=O stretch. The particular derivative can be identified more
precisely: for esters of aliphatic acids, 1740 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> ; for
esters of aryl acids or for esters of &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated acids,
1715-1730 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; for aryl esters or for esters conjugated to C=
C in the ester group, 1770 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>. RCOOH forms can be ruled out
by the absence of a O-H stretch. Ketones can be ruled out if two strong C-O
stretches in the 1050-1300 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> range are evident.

<p>
For ir of amides, besides the C=O bands, N-H stretching at 3050-3550
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> can be seen (the # of bands and their location depends
upon extent of H-bonding). N-H bends are found in the 1600-1640
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> region.

<p>
Nmr spectra will show that hydrogens on the alkyl portion of an ester absorb
farther downfield than protons on the acid portion. Absorption of the protons
on the nitrogen of an amide show a broad, low hump in the range &Delta; 5-8.

<h2>Chap. 21 Carbanions.  Aldol and Claisen condensations</h2>

<h3>21.1 Acidity of &alpha;-hydrogens</h3>

<p>
Recall that the other effect of a C=O group other than being a site for
nucleophilic addition or substitution was <i>an increased acidity of the
hydrogens attached to carbons adjacent to the carbonyl</i>. In order to be
acidic, that means that the carbonyl must play a part in the stabilization of
allowing a nucleophile (base :B) to abstract a proton from the compound. When
that is done, the adjacent carbon is left with a net negative charge and an
electron pair. A carbon with a net negative charge is a <b>carbanion</b>. The
intermediate is stabilized by <i>resonance</i>, in which the electron pair
forms a double bond with the carbonyl carbon, and the electrons of the p bond
between the already polarized C=O bond are taken by oxygen, able to more easily
accommodate the charge.

<p>
Were the &beta;- or &gamma;-hydrogens abstracted, no such resonance is possible,
indicating why they are not acidic. The resonance hybrids for the carboxylate
ion (COO<sup>&minus;</sup>) can be compared analogous to the hybrids in the
carbonyl carbanion (CCO<sup>&minus;</sup>). However, the structural difference
do make the H on COOH much more acidic that the H-CC=O, but the latter is quite
acidic compared to hydrogens on the rest of the molecule.

<h3>21.2 Reactions involving carbanions</h3>
<p>
If the alpha hydrogens of carbonyls are only very weakly acidic, that must mean
that the resulting carbanions are very strongly basic; they are exceedingly
reactive, behaving as <i>nucleophiles</i>. As nucleophiles, they can attack the
very kind of carbonyl carbon than produces, not the same carbonyl carbon in the
molecule that produces them, but the C=O carbon on another molecule.

<p>
Reactions typical of carbanions are:

<p>
1.  Halogenation of ketones.  -CH-C=O + X<sub>2</sub> 
(in either H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&minus;</sup>) &rarr; -CX-C=O + HX 
X<sub>2</sub>=Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>

<p>
2. Nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl.

<p>
2a.  Aldol condensation.  -C=O + -CH-C=O (in either base or
acid) &rarr; -COH-C-C=O (an aldol, &beta;-hydroxycarbonyl)

<h3>21.3 Base-promoted halogenation of ketones</h3>

<p>
Acetone can react with bromine to form bromoacetone, a
reaction accelerated by bases (OH<sup>&minus;</sup>,
CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>&minus;</sup>, etc.).

<p class="center">
CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub> + Br<sub>2</sub> + :B &rarr;
CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>Br + Br<sup>&minus;</sup> + H:B

<p>
The rate is found to be independent of the bromine
concentration, but depends upon the acetone and base:  rate = <i>k</i>[acetone][:B]. 
This means that the rate-determining step must not involve Br<sub>2</sub> at all. 
The kinetics is consistent with the following two-step mechanism:

<p>
(1) CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub> + :B &harr; H:B +
{CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>}<sup>&minus;</sup>     <i>slow</i>

<p>
(2) {CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>}<sup>&minus;</sup> +
Br<sub>2 </sub> &rarr;
CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>Br + Br<sup>&minus;</sup>   <i>fast</i>
</p>
<p>
When iodination was done instead, there was no change in the
rate, again showing the halogens are not involved, no matter how reactive or
unreactive.
</p>
<h3>21.4 Acid-catalyzed halogenation of ketones.  Enolization</h3>

<p>
A big difference between halogenation in acidic medium and
in basic medium is that the acid is not consumed, indicating that it is truly a
catalyst in the reaction.  The mechanism does not involve a carbanion
intermediate, but is similar to the base-promoted reaction which does have such
an intermediate, and is considered here.

<p>
The rate is also independent of [X<sub>2</sub>], but depends upon [ketone] and
[H<sup>+</sup>].  The mechanism
involves a reversible protonation of carbonyl oxygen in the first step,
tautomeric rearrangement to form the enol with loss of a proton in the second
step, electrophilic addition of the halogen to the enol C=C bond in the third
step with formation of an oxonium, then elimination of the proton in the 4th
step.

<p>
(1) CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub> + H:B &harr;

<p>
The rate-determining step is the formation of the enol,
consistent with the kinetic studies.  Once formed, it is expected the halogen
might add to the C=C bond as shown for normal electrophilic addition.  Indeed,
it starts out, with a positive halogen adding in the proper orientation to
produce the more stable carbonium, but tautomeric rearrangement allows
reformation of the carbonyl.

<h3>21.5 Aldol condensation</h3>

<p>
The reaction in dilute acid or base of two molecules of an aldehyde or a ketone 
to combine to form a &beta;-hydroxyaldehyde or &beta;-hydroxyketone is called an 
<b>aldol condensation</b>. The reaction is essentially a <i>nucleophilic
addition</i> of the &alpha;-carbon as a carbanion on one carbonyl to the C=O of 
another carbonyl-bearing compound. Examples:

<p>
acetaldehyde in OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; aldol (&beta;-hydroxybutyraldehyde,
3-hydroxybutanal)

<p> propionaldehyde in OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; &beta;-hydroxy-&alpha;-
methylvaleraldehyde (3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanal)

<p>
acetone in OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone

<p>
If the aldehyde or ketone has no &alpha;-hydrogens [ArCHO, HCHO,
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CCHO,
ArCOAr, ArCOCR<sub>3</sub>], there is no reaction in dilute OH<sup>&minus;</sup>. 
(However, if the base is concentrated, the Cannizzaro reaction is likely!)

<p>
The generally accepted mechanism:

<p>
(1) CH<sub>3</sub>CHO + OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &harr;
[CH<sub>2</sub>CHO]<sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O

<p>
(2) [CH<sub>2</sub>CHO]<sup>&minus;</sup> + CH<sub>3</sub>CH=O &harr;
CH<sub>3</sub>CHO<sup>&minus;</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO

<p>
(3) CH<sub>3</sub>CHO<sup>&minus;</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO +
H<sub>2</sub>O &harr; CH<sub>3</sub>CHOHCH<sub>2</sub>CHO +
OH<sup>&minus;</sup>

<p> Hydroxide abstracts a mildly acidic &alpha;-proton, the resulting molecule
becomes nucleophilic and adds to the carbonyl of a second molecule, and the
charged oxygen in the tetrahedral intermediate completes the addition by getting
a proton from the solvent, regenerating the base catalyst.

<h3>21.6 Dehydration of aldol products</h3>

<p>
&beta;-Hydroxyaldehydes
and -ketones obtained from an aldol condensation are quite easily dehydrated,
forming &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated carbonyls.

<p class="center">
Aldol in warm, dil. HCl &rarr; crotonaldehyde (2-butenal) + water

<p class="center">
4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone + I<sub>2</sub> &rarr; mesityl oxide
(4-methyl-3-penten-2-one) + water

<p> The ease with which dehydration occurs to form the C=C bond is attributable
to the resulting conjugation of pi-bonded atoms.  Alkenes conjugated to aromatic
rings are particularly stable.  When acetophenone is placed in NaOEt for an
aldol condensation, formation of the &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated ketone (1,3-
diphenyl-2-buten-1-one) that would result from acid-catalyzed dehydration is so
favorable the aldol condensation and dehydration occur in the same reaction: 
the &beta;-hydroxyketone is never isolated.

<h3>21.7 Use of aldol condensation in synthesis</h3>

<p> When the &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones obtained from the
aldol condensation and dehydration steps are subjected to catalytic
hydrogenation, addition of H<sub>2</sub>  occurs at both the C=C and C=O bond,
producing a larger alcohol.  In 3 steps, acetaldehyde can be used to produce
<i>n</i>-butanol.  In 4 steps, n-butanol itself can make the 8-carbon 2-ethyl-1-
hexanol:  1. Cu at 250&deg; to make the aldehyde, 2. dilute
OH<sup>&minus;</sup> to get the 8-carbon b-hydroxy aldol product of combining
the aldehyde, 3. dehydration to make the &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated aldehyde, 4.
H<sub>2</sub> with Ni for the reduction.

<p>
If the C=C bond is not to be reduced, NaBH<sub>4</sub> will limit
reduction of the C=O to the alcohol to produce the unsaturated alcohol.

<h3>21.8 Crossed aldol condensation</h3>

<p>
When two different carbonyls are mixed in dilute base, a <b>crossed
aldol condensation</b> results, producing a mixture of 4 possible products.  It
is commercially useful if the 4 products are useful and can be separated.

<p> However, a crossed aldol condensation will yield a single product if (a) one
reactant has no &alpha;-hydrogens and cannot condense with itself or the other
molecule (such are aromatic aldehydes or HCHO); (b) this reactant is mixed with
the catalyst; and (c) a carbonyl which has &alpha;-hydrogens is added slowly to
the mixture.  Using this technique, benzaldehyde has no &alpha;-hydrogens and
reacts with acetaldehyde to produce cinnamaldehyde, with acetone to make
benzalacetone, or with acetophenone to make benzalacetophenone.

<h3>21.9 Reactions related to the aldol condensation</h3>

<p> There are a large number of reactions which have their own name, usually
after the chemist that discovered them (for example, <i>Perkin</i>,
<i>Knoevenagel</i>, <i>Doebner</i>, <i>Claisen</i>, <i>Dieckmann</i>), but all
share the fact that they are condensation reactions which follow the mechanism
of the aldol condensation, i.e., are variations on the reaction.  They all use a
base (NaOH, NaOEt, NaOOCCH<sub>3</sub>, amines) to exploit the acidity of
&alpha;-hydrogens on a carbonyl.

<p>
A <b>Perkin</b> <b>condensation</b>:  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHO +
(CH<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O in sodium
acetate &rarr; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH=CHCOOH (cinnamic acid)

<p>
A <b>Knoevenagel</b> <b>reaction</b>:  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHO +
CH<sub>2</sub>(COOEt)<sub>2</sub> in 2&deg; amine &rarr;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH=C(COOEt)<sub>2</sub>

<p>
A <b>Cope</b> <b>reaction</b>:  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O (cyclohexanone) +
NCCH<sub>2</sub>COOEt in ammonium acetate &rarr;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>=C(CN)COOEt

<h3>21.10 The Wittig reaction</h3>

<p>
G. Wittig (1954) reported a synthesis of alkenes from
carbonyl amounting to a replacement of the carbonyl oxygen, =O, with
=CRR&prime;.  The reaction involves any carbonyl with an <b>ylide</b> to form
an intermediate <b>betaine</b>, which eliminates usually spontaneously to form
the alkene.

<p>
-C=O + Ph<sub>3</sub>P=CRR&prime; (an ylide) &rarr;
-C(O<sup>&minus;</sup>)CRR&prime;-P<sup>+</sup>Ph<sub>3</sub> 
(a betaine) &rarr; -C=CRR&prime; + Ph<sub>3</sub>PO (triphenylphosphine oxide)

<p>
Example reactions:

<p>
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C=O + Ph<sub>3</sub>P=CH<sub>2</sub> 
&rarr; (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C(O<sup>&minus;</sup>)CH<sub>2</sub>P<sup>+</sup>Ph<sub>3</sub> &rarr; (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub>

<p> The reaction occur under mild conditions, and the C=C bond position is never
in doubt.  The success of the chemistry is in the extreme polarity of the P-C
bond of the ylide which, although represented as P=C, has the more
electronegative carbon bearing the negative charge, making it a strongly basic
carbanion.  [Ph<sub>3</sub>P<sup>+</sup>&minus;<sup>&minus;</sup>CRR&prime;]. 
The carbanion is capable of nucleophilic attack.

<p> Ylides are prepared in two stages:  (1) by nucleophilic attack of the basic
triphenylphosphine on an alkyl halide (which cannot be 3&deg;); (2) treatment of
the resulting phosphonium salt with a base to form the ylide.

<p>
1.  RR&prime;CHX + Ph<sub>3</sub>P &rarr;

<p>
2. [Ph<sub>3</sub>P<sup>+</sup>&mdash;CHRR&prime;]X<sup>&minus;</sup> + base &rarr; Ph<sub>3</sub>P=CRR&prime; (ylide)  + base:H

<p> The preparation of ylides themselves is fascinating chemistry, involving
many different bases&mdash;usu. alkoxides and organometallics&mdash;and in a
variety of solvents:

Ph<sub>3</sub>P=CHCH=CH<sub>2</sub> + EtOH + NaCl

<h3>21.11 Claisen condensation. Formation of &beta;-keto
esters</h3>

<p> The C=O carbonyl contributes to the acidity of &alpha;-hydrogens seen in
aldehydes and carbonyl.  Esters have acidic &alpha;-hydrogens as well.  When
ethyl acetate is treated with NaOEt, and the mixture is later acidified, there
is recovered ethyl b-ketobutyrate (ethyl 3-oxobutanoate), generally known as
<b>ethyl acetoacetate</b> or <b>acetoacetic ester</b>.  Ethyl acetoacetate is
the ester of a b-keto acid, and is prepared by a condensation known as the
<b>Claisen condensation</b>.  The mechanism is:

<p class="center">
<img src="ORGCHEM2_files/image007.png"
alt="">

<p>
The Claisen condensation <i>shares</i> one aspect of its chemistry with the
aldol condensation in that it takes advantage of the acidity of the carbon
alpha to carbonyl to form a carbanion. The Claisen <i>differs</i> from the
aldol in that, while the aldol is essentially a nucleophilic<i> addition</i>
reaction to the carbonyl, the Claisen is a nucleophilic <i>substitution</i>
typical of acyl compounds. The actual product of the reaction is the sodium
salt of the acetoacetic ester (because of the basic conditions), still a
carbanion, but a much more stable one now because it is sandwiched between two
carbonyls which can accommodate the negative charge. The resonance structures
of the acetoacetic carbanion are illustrated and the hybrid is the stable
molecule represented by all three.

<p class="center">
<img src="ORGCHEM2_files/image008.png"

<p>
An example of the <b>Dieckmann condensation</b> referred to previously involves
ethyl adipate being treated with NaOEt to form 2-carbethoxycyclopentanone (see
diag.)

<p class="center">
<img src="ORGCHEM2_files/image009.png"
alt="">

<h3>21.12 Crossed Claisen condensation</h3>
<p>
The usefulness of a crossed aldol condensation comes from that fact that one of
the reactants has no &alpha;-hydrogens. A <b>crossed Claisen condensation</b>
also includes a reactant with no &alpha;-hydrogens.
<p>
Ethyl benzoate + ethyl acetate + NaOEt &rarr; ethyl benzoylacetate + EtOH
<p>
Ethyl formate + ethyl acetate + NaOEt &rarr; ethyl formylacetate + EtOH
<p>
Ethyl oxalate + ethyl acetate + NaOEt &rarr; ethyl oxaloacetate + EtOH
<p>
Ethyl carbonate + ethyl phenylacetate + NaOEt &rarr; ethyl phenylmalonate + EtOH

<h3>21.13 Reformatsky reaction. Preparation of &beta;-hydroxy esters</h3>
<p>
The Claisen condensation demonstrates an ester's ability to form a carbanionic
molecule which can react with another of its molecules or with any acyl
compound. Another familiar type of organic reagent also has considerable
carbanionic character: <i>organometallic</i> compounds.
<p>
An &alpha;-bromo ester treated with zinc metal in the presence of a nonacyl
carbonyl, i.e. aldehyde or ketone, produces a b-hydroxy ester. This reaction is
called the <b>Reformatsky reaction</b>, and is the most important method for
preparing b-hydroxy acids and their derivatives.

<p>
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C=O
+ BrCH<sub>2</sub>COOEt
+ Zn in ether &rarr; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C(OZnBr)CH<sub>2</sub>COOEt

<p>
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C(OZnBr)CH<sub>2</sub>COOEt + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>
&rarr; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>COOEt
<p>
In the reaction, ethyl bromoacetate reacts with the zinc in absolute ether to
form an organozinc (just as Mg reacts with RX to form an organomagnesium in the
Grignard), and the organozinc has sufficient carbanion character to add to the
carbonyl of the ketone. The reason a Grignard is not made is because
organomagnesium compounds are much more reactive than organozinc compounds:
Grignards can react with the ester, but organozinc compounds react only with
aldehyde and ketone carbonyls. The product of nucleophilic addition is
hydrolyzed in dilute acid to make ethyl 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoate in the
example above.
<p>
There appears to be no limitations on the groups on either side of the added
carbonyl: either an aldehyde or ketone with any alkyl or aryl group. The
b-hydroxy ester formed, like b-hydroxy aldehydes or ketones, can be quickly
dehydrated to form an &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated ester.

<h2>Chap. 22 Amines. Preparation and physical properties</h2>

<h3>22.1-.4 Structure.  Classification.  Nomenclature.  Physical properties</h3>
<p>
Amines are the most basic of organic compounds, deriving from their essential
chemistry of ammonia, with the nonbonding pair of nitrogen providing its basic
character. An amine is any nitrogenous compound in which one, two, or all three
of its hydrogens are substituted. Like C atoms, the nitrogen and the hydrogens
attached to it can be designated as primary (RNH<sub>2</sub>), secondary
(R<sub>2</sub>NH), or tertiary (R<sub>3</sub>N).
<p>
In naming aliphatic amines, the alkyl group or groups attached are named,
followed by the suffix -<i>amine</i>. More complicated compounds often include
the prefixed name <i>amino</i>- given to the parent name. Aromatic amines are
named as derivatives of the simplest aromatic amine, <b>aniline</b>. The
aminotoluenes are given the special name <i>toluidine</i>.
<p>
The physical properties of amines prove that they are polar compounds capable
of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Amines generally have higher b.p. values
than nonpolar cmpds. of the same MW, but lower b.p. values that ROH or RCOOH.
The smaller amines are quite soluble in water, the borderline about 6 carbons;
they are soluble in the usual organic solvents as well. Methylamines and
ethylamines smell much like ammonia; and the higher alkylamines have fishy
odors.

<p>
Aromatic amines are very toxic, being readily absorbed
through the skin with fatal results.  They are easily oxidized by air;  the
pure amine is usually colorless, but obtain color when oxidation products are
present.

<h3>22.5 Salts of amines</h3>
<p>
Aliphatic amines are as basic as NH<sub>3</sub>; aromatic amines are less basic.
In the relative order of basicity, they are less basic than OH<sup>&minus;</sup> 
or OEt<sup>&minus;</sup>, but more basic than water, ROH, ROR,
RCOOR&prime;, etc. Aqueous mineral acids convert amines to salts, and aq.
OH<sup>&minus;</sup> converts it to its free base. Amines and their salts
behave in the same way as RCOOH and its salts: the salts are nonvolatile ionic
solids, they usually decompose before reaching melting temperature, they are
soluble in water but not in nonpolar solvents. The difference in water
solubility of the free base and its salt, and the requirement of adding a
mineral acid to get a solid to dissolve in water, are techniques used to
identify amines.

<h3>22.6 Stereochemistry of nitrogen</h3>
<p>
Nitrogen hybridizes its orbitals in the valence shell to <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>
just as tetrahedral carbon does. Three of the bond orbitals overlap with the s
orbitals of hydrogen or carbon bonding orbitals. The fourth has an unshared
pair of electrons. In viewing the stereochemistry of nitrogen, it would appear
that chirality is possible and that amines would show optical activity. But
spectroscopic studies show that the pyramidal arrangement of groups with the
nonbonding pair have an energy barrier that requires no bond-breaking
comparable energy, and so pyramidal inversion happens easily, making it
possible to isolate any enantiomers.
<p>
On the other hand, quaternary ammonium salts (still <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-
hybridized) have no nonbonding pair but a fourth group. They do exist as
configurational isomers, show optical activity, and their enantiomers can be
resolved.

<h3>22.7 Industrial source</h3>
<p>
The ways that amines are prepared industrially are not practical for the lab.
The most important is <i>aniline</i> for which there are several cheap ways: 1.
reduction of nitrobenzene with iron and dilute HCl or by catalytic
hydrogenation: nitrobenzene + Fe + 30% HCl + heat &rarr; anilinium chloride +
Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> &rarr; aniline. 2. treatment of chlorobenzene with
ammonia at high pressures and temperatures with a catalyst: chlorobenzene +
NH<sub>3</sub> + Cu<sub>2</sub>O, 200&deg;, 900 psi &rarr; aniline.
<p>
Methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine are made from ammonia and
methanol in successive substitution of the H atom on nitrogen by heating
(450&deg;) in a catalyst (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Alkyl halides are also
used to make the higher alkylamines. And the fatty acids are treated with
ammonia and then reduced to make primary aminoalkanes: RCOOH + NH<sub>3</sub>,
heat &rarr; RCONH<sub>2</sub> + heat&rarr; RCN (nitrile) + H<sub>2</sub>/cat.
&rarr; RCH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> (amine)

<h3>22.8 Preparation</h3>

<h3>22.9 Reduction of -NO<sub>2</sub> compounds</h3>

<p>
Reduction of nitro compounds, usually arylnitro compounds, can be done by
either (a) catalytic hydrogenation using H<sub>2</sub> or (b) chemical
reduction with a metal and acid. For the catalytic hydrogenation, the nitro
compound is dissolved in alcohol and shaken with finely divided nickel or
platinum under H<sub>2</sub> gas; the method is useless if the molecule has a
C=C bond, which is also easily hydrogenated. Chemical reduction starts by adding
HCl to a mixture of the nitro compound and a metal (granulated tin), which
forms a salt with the oxidized tin. The amine can be separated from the
unreacted nitro compound by taking advantage of the salt of the amines
solubility in water.

<p class="center">
<img src="ORGCHEM2_files/image010.png"
alt="">

<p>
This reduction of the nitro compounds is useful for preparing the amino for
conversion to a diazo compound, and to build more complicated molecules.

<h3>22.10 Ammonolysis of halides</h3>
<p>
Organic halogens are converted to amines on standing at room temp (or with some
heating under pressure) with aqueous or alcoholic solution of ammonia. The
NH<sub>3</sub> displaces the halide from the alkyl group in a nucleophilic
substitution reaction in much the same way hydroxide, alkoxide, cyanide,
acetylide, and water do. This amounts to ammonolysis. Because of its highly
basic nature, the alkyl halide may also undergo elimination instead of
substitution, so higher yields are obtained with primary halides (where
substitution predominates) and is not done with tertiary halides.
<p>
ArX is not very reactive, but are converted to the amines if (a) the ring
carries an -NO<sub>2</sub> group or other strongly electron-withdrawing group
<i>ortho </i>or <i>para</i> to the halogen, or (b) a high temperature or
strongly basic reagent is used.
<p>
A problem with ammonolysis is that, once the primary amine is formed from the
ammonia, the result salt is made into its free base (because of the basic
conditions) which can itself react with another RX to form the secondary amine,
which can itself react with RX until the nitrogen is exhaustively alkylated.
This is less of a problem if a large excess of ammonia is used to reduce the
probability that the primary amine will encounter another RX.

<h3>22.11 Reductive amination</h3>
<p>
Many RCHO and RCOR&prime; can be reduced in the presence of ammonia to form
amines; this is <b>reductive amination</b>. The reduction is by a catalytic
action or by the use of sodium cyanohydridoborate, NaBH<sub>3</sub>CN. In the
reaction, an <i>imine</i> intermediate is formed, either RCH=NH or R<sub>2</sub>
C=NH, namely a C=N bond which is sensitive to reduction.
<p>

Example reactions: 1. heptaldehyde &rarr; <i>n</i>-heptylamine 2. benzaldehyde
&rarr; benzylamine  3. 2-pentanone &rarr; 2-aminopentane  4. acetophenone &rarr;
 &alpha;-phenylethylamine.
<p>
Often reductive amination is used to convert produce an amine which might
otherwise produce an elimination reaction due to the basicity of NH<sub>3</sub>:
 cyclohexanol treated with PBr<sub>3</sub> to make cyclohexyl bromide cannot be
expect to product cyclohexylamine by nucleophilic substitution when treated
with ammonia (it makes cyclohexene). Instead the cyclohexanol is treated with
K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> in sulfuric acid to produce the ketone,
 cyclohexanone, which can be reductively aminated (NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>
2</sub>/Ni) to form cyclohexylamine.

<p> In some reactions, the 1&deg; amine produced by the reduction process can
continue to react with carbonyl and form the 2&deg; amine, but controlling the
proportions of the reactants eliminates that possibility.

<h3>22.12 Hofmann degradation of amides</h3>
<p>
The mechanism is discussed in ch. 28. The effect of the Hofmann degradation is
to produce an amine from an amide which is reduced in carbon number by one.
RCONH<sub>2</sub> + OBr<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; RNH<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>
3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>

<h3>22.13 Synthesis of 2&deg; and 3&deg; amines</h3>
<p>
Most of the synthetic reactions shown outline the synthesis of primary amines.
The 2&deg; and 3&deg; amines are produced merely by adapting and controlling
the reagents in ammonolysis of RX compounds and in reductive amination.

<h3>23.2 Basicity of amines.  Basicity constant</h3>
<p>
Amines do not differ from ammonia in their ability to form salts with mineral
acids, or become free bases with aqueous OH<sup>&minus;</sup>; they are less 
basics than OH<sup>&minus;</sup> but more basic than H<sub>2</sub>O. Amines 
react with water to produce the protonated amine and OH<sup>&minus;</sup>, an
equilibrium reaction expressed by a <b>basicity constant</b>:

<p>
Although the principal base in aqueous solution is the amine, the measurement
of [OH<sup>&minus;</sup>] is a convenient way to compare basicities. Aliphatic 
amines tend to have <i>K</i><sub>b</sub> values between 10<sup>&minus;3</sup>
and 10<sup>&minus;4</sup>, being somewhat stronger than NH<sub>3</sub> itself
(<i>K</i><sub>b</sub> = 1.8 &times; 10<sup>&minus;5</sup>). Aromatic amines are
very weak on the other hand (10<sup>&minus;9</sup> or less), and the basicity
of substituted anilines is about 1/4000 that of aniline.

<h3>23.3 Structure and basicity</h3>
<p>
Amines are more basic than ROH, ROR, RCOOR&prime;, etc., for the same reason
that ammonia is more basic than water:  N is less electronegative than O, and
can better accommodate the positive charge of the ion.  Aliphatic amines are
more basic than ammonia because the alkyl groups attached to N stabilize the
positive charge by releasing electrons, similar to the stabilization of a
carbonium ion.
<p>
Why are aromatic amines weak bases? Neither aniline or the anilinium ion have
any difference in their resonance structures, and while resonance participates
in lowering the energy of both, there is no difference in the &Delta;G of
ionization of the ion or the base. For this reason, the basicity of aniline
might be expected to have the same basicity as ammonia. However, the basicity
is much lower because the nonbonding pair is need in the free base to
participate resonance with the aromatic ring, an energy stabilization much
lower than would be possible in the anilinium ion. Because resonance lowers the
energy in aniline more than it would in anilinium ion, aniline's affinity
for a proton is reduced.

<h3>23.4 Effect of substituents on basicity of aromatic amines</h3>
<p>
Basicity of substituted aromatic amines largely depends on the divide between
substituents activating the ring (-NH<sub>2</sub>, -OCH<sub>3</sub>, -CH<sub>
3</sub>) and those deactivating the ring (-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, -NO<sub>
2</sub>, -SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>, -COOH, -X). Clearly those
releasing electrons to the ring disperse the positive charge better, making the
amine a better base. Electron withdrawal tends to intensify the positive charge,
 and would decrease basicity. It is noted that the effect is opposite for that
of aromatic acids, in which the ring is expected to accommodate a negative
charge.
<p>
The <b>ortho</b> effect seen to increase acidity in RCOOH weaken the basicity
of aromatic amines, even with electron-releasing groups on the ring.

<h3>23.5 Quaternary ammonium salts.  Exhaustive methylation.  Hofmann
elimination</h3>
<p>
Amines have been shown to repeatedly attack alkyl halides in a nucleophilic
substitution, forming a higher class of amine, which is a side reaction of the
ammonolysis of halides. The final product is a quaternary ammonium salt.
Primary, secondary, and tertiary amine salts react with OH<sup>&minus;</sup> to
liberate the free base, but 4&deg; amines do not. Quaternary ammonium halides
do react with silver oxide, however, to form the <b>quaternary</b> <b>
ammonium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> and the silver halide, which precipitates:

<p>
R<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>X<sup>&minus;</sup> + Ag<sub>2</sub>O &rarr;
R<i><sub>4</sub></i>N<sup>+</sup> OH<sup>&minus;</sup> + AgX
<p>
This hydroxide is just as basic as NaOH or KOH, since is essentially a salt
like them. When this hydroxide is heated (to 125&deg; or more), it decomposes
to from water, a 3&deg; amine, and an alkene.

<p>
[(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> OH<sup>&minus;</sup> (heat) &rarr; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>N + CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
<p>
This reaction is called the <b>Hofmann elimination</b>, and analogous to
dehydrohalogenation of RX. The reaction is typically E2, with the OH<sup>&minus;
</sup> abstracting a proton at the same time the amine is leaving because it is
a very good leaving group.

<p class="center">
<img src="ORGCHEM2_files/image011.png"
alt="">

<p>
Bases other than OH<sup>&minus;</sup> can also be used.  E1 elimination is
also possible, and competing with the elimination reactions are the
S<sub>N</sub>2 and S<sub>N</sub>1-type reactions as well.

<p>
The orientation is also strongly Hofmann, a rule Hofmann
formulated after observing the effects of this reaction:

<p>
[CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(NMe<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> 
+ NaOEt/EtOH &rarr; 1-pentene (96%) + 2-pentene (4%)

<p>
The transition state has considerable carbanion character because the
positively charged nitrogen favors its development by pulling electrons away.
The primary carbon can best accommodate the partial negative charge, and so its
proton is removed. The stereochemistry of the Hofmann elimination is <i>anti</i>
, but less than was believed. <i>Syn</i> elimination is preferred in some
cyclic compounds, and can be important for open-chain cmpds by the proper
choice of base and solvent. 4&deg; amines are more prone to <i>syn</i>
elimination than RX or ROSO<sub>3</sub>H. Electronically, <i>anti</i> formation
of the double bond is favored in eliminations, but conformational factors can
force the final outcome.

<p>
Structural identification of the amine is often done in two stages: 1. <b>
exhaustive methylation of the amine</b> with CH<sub>3</sub>I, in which the
number of methyl groups taken up by the amine are assessed; 2. Formation of its
hydroxide with Ag<sub>2</sub>O, then heating to amine to produce the alkene and
3&deg; amine, often which can be analyzed to deduce the original structure.

<p>

<h3>23.6 Conversion of amines into substituted amides</h3>

<p>
NH<sub>3</sub> can react in a nucleophilic substitution with the acid chlorides
of RCOOH or of ArSO<sub>2</sub>OH to produce amides and sulfonamides, resp. In 
the same way primary and secondary amines (but not 3&deg; amines, because the 
loss of proton is required), will react with acid chlorides to form substituted 
amides. The amides are named as derivatives of the unsubstituted amides: CH<sub>
3</sub>CONHC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, N-ethylacetamide; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>
2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CON(CH<sub>3</sub>)C<sub>2</sub>H<sub> 5</sub>, 
N-methyl-N-ethylbutyramide. Substituted amides of aromatic carboxylic acids are 
prepared by the Schotten-Bauman technique in which the ArCOCl is added to amine 
in the presence of a base, either aq. NaOH or pyridine: aniline + benzoyl 
chloride (in pyridine) &rarr; benzanilide; di-<i>n</i>-butylamine + 
benzenesulfonyl chloride (in NaOH) &rarr; N,N-di-<i>n</i>-butylbenzenesulfonamide.
<p>
Acetylation of amines is done using the less reactive acetic
anhydride (not acetyl chloride).  Like unsubstituted amides, the substituted
amides undergo either base- or acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.  Sulfonamides are
hydrolyzed more slowly, the reason being that sulfonyl nucleophilic
substitution is distinct from acyl nucleophilic substitution in that it must
form a pentavalent intermediate, with a decet around sulfur.  Sulfur may be
able to accommodate a decet, but it prefers the octet.
<p>
The amides and sulfonamides may be contrasted further. With substituted amides
and sulfonamides still possessing a hydrogen attached to nitrogen, this
nitrogen is quite <i>acidic</i>, especially in the sulfonamide. The sulfonamide
proton is less acidic than RCOOH, but as acidic as phenols (Ar-OH), and will
react with aqueous hydroxide to form salts.

<p class="center">
ArSO<sub>2</sub>NHR + OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>O +
[Ar&minus;SO<sub>2</sub>&minus;NR]<sup>&minus;</sup>
<p>
The difference in acidity is understandable since the negative charge is
distributed over three O atoms instead of the two in -COO<sup>&minus;</sup>.
Similarly sulfonamides are more acidic because the resulting negative charge is
dispersed over two O and one N instead of only one O and one N atom.

<h3>23.7 Ring substitution of aromatic amines</h3>
<p>
The -NH<sub>2</sub>, -NHR, and -NR<sub>2</sub> groups are powerful activators
of EAS to the aromatic ring, and <i>ortho</i>,<i>para</i>-directing. Resonance
stabilization shows the nonbonding pair becomes involved in the pi bonding,
making nitrogen assume the positive charge, but permitting every atom (except
hydrogen) to have the necessary octet in the valence shell.
<p>
The acetamido group, -NHCOCH<sub>3</sub> (acetylated amine), is also activating
and <i>ortho,para</i>-directing, but less so than a free amino group, mainly
because the carbonyl oxygen pulls on the nonbonding pair of nitrogen somewhat. 
Moreover, being an amide, the basicity is virtually nonexistent in these
aromatic amides, since the carbonyl destabilizes the positive charge acquired
by nitrogen when protonation occurs.
<p>
Quaternary ammonium groups, -NR<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, on the ring have no
nonbonding pair to contribute to resonance stabilization in EAS.  Because of the
positive charge, they destabilize any attempt at EAS reaction, and are
<i>meta</i>-directors.
<p>
A problem with aromatic amines in EAS is that they are often <i>too</i>
reactive:  bromination of p-toluidine results in dibromination of both
<i>ortho</i> positions, and would also result in bromination at the <i>para</i>
position if it were not occupied.
<p>
HNO<sub>3</sub> is involved in nitration of EAS.  But it is also an
oxidizing agent, oxidizing the highly reactive ring into a useless tar.  In the
acidic medium, the amine is protonated, making the substitution controlled by -
NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and not by -NH<sub>2</sub>;  the positive charge is
usually <i>meta</i>-directing.  To control this reactivity of the amine to other
future reactions, acetylation is often used to protect the function.

<h3>23.8 Sulfonation of aromatic amines.  Dipolar ions</h3>
<p>
Aniline can be sulfonated by <q>baking</q> the anilinium hydrogen sulfate salt
at 180-200&deg;. The sulfur group is attached mostly to the <i>para</i>
position. This sulfonation is reversible, and the p-isomer is considered the
most stable isomer. Hence this reaction is not rate-controlled (being faster),
but equilibrium-controlled. The <i>p</i>-aminobenzenesulfonic acid is called <b>
sulfanilic acid</b>. Both aniline (m.p. -6&deg;) and benzenesulfonic acid (m.p.
66&deg;) have low melting points, but sulfanilic acid decomposes (at 280-
300&deg;) before its m.p. is reached. Sulfonic acids are very soluble in water;
indeed when introduced to a molecule, a sulfonic acid group makes it soluble.
But sulfanilic acid is insoluble in organic solvents, are nearly insoluble in
water. Amines dissolve in acids because they become salts, but sulfanilic acid
is insoluble in aqueous acids (but soluble in aqueous bases).
<p>
The reason for these properties is that sulfanilic acid is a dipolar (zwitter)
ion. When placed in water, the sulfonic acid donates a proton to the water, but
the amine takes up a proton. The molecule has a net charge of zero, when it
would be least soluble in water (but many salts are insoluble in water as well).
 Because it is a dipolar ion (with 2 charges) it should be insoluble in organic
solvents. In basic solutions, the OH<sup>&minus;</sup> is a stronger base than
-NH<sub>2</sub> and only a single charge is on the molecule, making it soluble.
In acid, the amino group is protonated, but the sulfonic acid group is such a
weak base it would take a highly concentrated acid to protonate it.

<h3>23.9 Sulfanilamide.  The sulfa drugs</h3>
<p>
The amide of sulfanilic acid represents a class of medically
important drugs called <i>sulfa</i> <i>drugs</i>.  Sulfianilamides are prepared
from sulfonamides first by acetylating the anilino group and then by preparing
the sulfonyl acid chloride where it can react with ammonia or a substituted
amine.  Acetylating the anilino group prior to preparing the acid chloride
prevents the aromatic amine from reacting with the acid chloride.
<p>
Starting from aniline, the molecule is acetylated with acetic anhydride. This
is treated with sulfonyl chloride (ClSO<sub>3</sub>H) to make p-
acetamidobenzenesulfonyl chloride. This product can then be treated with either
ammonia or substituted amines to make the acetylated sulfaniliamide. Afterward,
acid-catalyzed hydrolysis de-acetylates the amino group to make the
sulfanilamide. It can be seen that the sulfonamide is itself not hydrolyzed
under these conditions, indicating the amides of RCOOH are more easily
hydrolyzed. Sulfaniliamides are found to mimic the <i>p</i>-aminobenzoic acid
used by bacteria, but are not functional and thereby prevents bacterial growth.
<p>
Substituted sulfaniliamides perform much better than sulfaniliamide itself as
antimicrobials. The acidity of the proton on nitrogen is quite important. Of
the hundreds of sulfa drugs made and tested, the best ones have the right
combination of antibacterial activity and low human toxicity are those in which
the substituted have a heterocyclic ring:

<h3>23.10 Reactions of amines with nitrous acid</h3>
<p>
Each class of amine reacts with nitrous acid (HONO), produced by mixing mineral
acids and sodium nitrite (NaNO<sub>2</sub>), to form a different kind of
product.

1&deg; aliphatic amines react to produce these salts, but are unstable and
break down to yield a complicated mixture of products. The reaction has little

<p>
3&deg; aromatic amines will undergo ring substitution to yield products with
a nitroso group (-N=O) joined to carbon:

<p>
insert reaction on top of p 764

<p>
The reaction is an EAS reaction with the electrophile <i>nitrosonium ion</i>
(<sup>+</sup>NO) or perhaps another species (H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>+</sup>&minus;
NO or NOCl). This ion is very weakly electrophilic compared to the
electrophiles involved in nitration, sulfonation, halogenation, or the
Friedel-Crafts reaction. This nitrosation of the ring occurs only in rings with
powerful activating groups, like the dialkylamino (-NR<sub>2</sub>) or hydroxy
(-OH) group.

<p>
insert diagram middle p 764

<p>

In all reactions with NaNO<sub>2</sub> in acid, the <sup>+</sup>NO becomes
an electrophile attacking the available lone pair on the nitrogen of 1&deg; and
2&deg; amines, and a H<sup>+</sup> is lost from the amine nitrogen as a result.
3&deg; aromatic amines are attacked on the ring.

<p> 3&deg; aliphatic amines (and to an extent, 3&deg; aromatic amines) can react
with HONO to form the N-nitroso derivative of a <i>secondary</i> amine;  the
group lost from the nitrogen appears as an aldehyde or ketone.  The mechanism is
thought to start with <sup>+</sup>NO reaction on nitrogen.

<h3>23.12 Diazonium salts.  Replacement by halogen.  Sandemeyer reaction</h3>
<p>
Replacement of the diazonium salt by -Cl or -Br is done with the cuprous
chloride or bromide at room temperature or slightly warmed. N<sub>2</sub> is
steadily evolved over several hours to make the aryl halide. This is called the
<b>Sandemeyer reaction</b>. The <i>Gatterman reaction</i> is a modification of
this synthesis, involving Cu powder and HX.
<p>
Formation of the aryl iodide does not require CuI or copper. Usually just an
iodide salt (KI) is sufficient.
<p>
Formation of the aryl fluoride is done with fluoboric acid, HBF<sub>4</sub>,
which is added to the diazonium salt to form the diazonium fluoborate,
ArN<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>BF<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, a fairly stable
salt which is filtered, washed and dried.  The dry salt is then heated and
decomposes to form the aryl flouride, boron trifluoride, and nitrogen.  An
analogous procedure is used with the diazonium hexafluorophosphate,
ArN<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>PF<sub>6</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>.
<p>
ArF and ArI compounds, which cannot be synthesized by direct halogenation, and
prepared in this way. ArCl and ArBr can be prepared by direct halogenation of
the ring, but if a mixture of o- and p-isomers is difficult to separate because
of similar b.p. values.

<h3>23.13 Diazonium salts.  Replacement by &minus;CN.  Synthesis of RCOOH</h3>
<p>
CuCN addition to the diazonium salt produces the aryl nitrile. Prior
neutralization the medium of ArN<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> with Na<sub>2</sub>
CO<sub>3</sub> is necessary to prevent loss of CN<sup>&minus;</sup> by HCN
formation. The nitrile may then be acid-hydrolyzed to form the carboxylic acid.
<p>
This synthesis leading to an Ar-COOH may be better than the carbonation of
the Grignard or the oxidation of alkyl side chains.  The Grignard would have
been prepared from a -Br side chain, which itself is made from the diazonium
anyway; other groups on the molecule may react during the formation of the
Grignard as well.  A nitro group leading to the diazonium is introduced more
readily than an alkyl side chain; moreover, conversion of the side chain by
oxidation if there are other groups sensitive to oxidation.

<h3>23.14 Diazonium salts.  Replacement by &minus;OH.  Synthesis of phenols</h3>
<p>
Diazonium salts react with water to produce phenols, which occurs slowly in
ice-cold solutions, which is why diazonium salts are used immediately after
preparation.  At higher temperatures, it is the chief reaction of diazonium
salts.  Phenols can couple with ArN<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> to form diazo
compounds; but the more acidic the solution is, the slower the coupling. 
Coupling to the phenol can be minimized by adding slowly the diazonium to a
large volume of boiling sulfuric acid.

<h3>23.15 Diazonium salts.  Replacement by &minus;H</h3>
<p>
A number of reducing agents, the most useful by <i>hypophosphorus</i> <i>
acid</i>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>, can be used to reduce diazonium to Ar- H.
This acid can be used as both the diazotizing and reducing agent: since the
diazotization requires NaNO<sub>2</sub> and <i>acid</i>, and the reduction is
provided by this particular acid, the two processes can occur one after the
other. The effect of this action is to remove either -NH<sub>2</sub> or -NO<sub>
2</sub> from the ring.

<h3>23.16 Syntheses using diazonium salts</h3>
<p>
It was previously mentioned that <i>o</i>- and <i>p</i>-isomers, especially of
halogens, are difficult to separate by distillation. So how might they be
prepared separately? If <i>o</i>-bromotoluene and <i>p</i>-bromotoluene are to
be prepared from toluene, the syntheses might go like this:

the <i>ortho</i> and <i>para</i> bromo isomers (b.p. 182&deg; and 185&deg;,
resp.)

<p>
Synthesis of the meta isomer is more complicated:

The purpose of the synthesis is to introduce a very strong ortho,para- director
other than -CH<sub>3</sub>, putting the halogen in the right position. The
group -NHCOCH<sub>3</sub> is quite suitable, put their by nitration, reduction,
then acetylation; removed by hydrolysis, diazotization, then reduction.

<h3>23.17 Coupling of diazonium salts.  Synthesis of azo compounds</h3>
<p>
<b>Azo compounds</b> have the general formula Ar-N=N-Ar&prime;, and are the
result of coupling to stabilize the diazonium. The diazonium, Ar- N<sub>2</sub>
<sup>+</sup>, is an electrophile, just as is any cationic molecule, and capable
of EAS on another ring. However, Ar-N<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is a very weak
electrophile, and for that reason the ring to which it is coupled must be very
active to EAS. Usually an activating group should be attached: -OH, - NR<sub>
2</sub>, -NHR, or -NH<sub>2</sub>. The substitution occurs at the <i>para</i>
position usually, and coupling with phenols is carried out under mildly
alkaline conditions, and with amines mildly acidic solutions. Kinetic studies
reveal that the diazonium is the electrophile. Its electrophilicity is about as
strong as the nitrosonium ion, <sup>+</sup>NO, which is involved in nitrosation.
 Both of these electrophiles requires significant ring activation to be
involved in EAS.
<p>
Coupling is not so easy as mixing the diazonium and phenol or arylamine. With
water present, the diazonium will react with water to produce a phenol; if
conditions for coupling are slow, phenol formation may predominate. The phenol
which forms may also react with diazonium to form the wrongly coupled product.
The right degree of alkalinity or acidity for coupling is necessary; addition
of the correct amt. of NaOH, sodium acetate, or sodium carbonate creates an
equilibrium which allows formation a product ready to react.

<table class="td-center no-background td-align-bottom">

 <td>Ar-N&equiv;N<sup>+</sup>OH<sup>&minus;</sup> <br>

</table>

<p>
It can be seen that too much alkalinity converts the diazonium into a compound
unable to couple. A low concentration of hydroxide, or high acidity would
promote the reaction.
<p>
A problem with high acidity is that the amine or phenol to be coupled becomes
protonated. With the amine, a positive charge develops, deactivating the ring
too much to allow the diazonium to react. With phenols, the deprotonated
phenolate ion is a much better target for electrophiles because of its negative
charge than the protonated phenol; coupling is slower for the phenol than for
the phenoxide ion. Experience shows that amines couple best in mildly acidic
solutions, and phenols fastest in mildly alkaline solutions.

Azo compounds are important dyes. Some structures are given.

<h3>23.18 Analysis of amines.  Hinsberg test</h3>
<p>
Any water-insoluble compound dissolving in cold, dilute HCl, or a water-
soluble material in aqueous solutions turning litmus blue is almost certainly an
amine.  Elemental analysis shows a nitrogen presence.
<p>
The <b>Hinsberg test</b> allows determination of whether the amine is 1&deg;,
2&deg;, or 3&deg;: the amine is shaken with benzenesulfonyl chloride in the
presence of aqueous <i>potassium</i> hydroxide. 1&deg; and 2&deg; amines form
substituted sulfonamides; 3&deg; amines do not. The 1&deg; amine will form a
monosubstituted sulfonamide which has an acidic proton; its reaction with KOH
should convert the sulfonamide to a partly soluble salt if the amine is 8
carbons or fewer (a clear solution). Acidification produces the insoluble amide.
 The 2&deg; amine forms a disubstituted sulfonamide which has no acidic
hydrogen and should remain insoluble in the KOH solution. The 3&deg; amine does
react with benzenesulfonyl chloride, apparently forming a quaternary
sulfonamide salt, which is unstable in the presence of OH<sup>&minus;</sup>,
which displaces it to form the sulfonic acid and regenerate the insoluble R<sub>
3</sub>N. Upon acidification of the 3&deg; amine, the insoluble compound
dissolves as the aqueous soluble salt is formed.
<p>
Nitrous acid is useful for identifying amine class as well. In the presence of
&beta;-naphthol, highly colored azo compounds are formed which is indicative of
1&deg; aromatic amine conversion to diazonium.
<p>
1&deg; and 2&deg; amines can be converted to amine derivatives, namely amides
by reaction with the acid chlorides of acetic acid, benzoic acid, or
benzenesulfonic acid: the physical properties of these derivatives assist in
this determination. Quaternary ammonium salts will form for tertiary amines
treated with benzoyl chloride or methyl iodide, and can be assessed.

<h3>23.19 Analysis of substituted amides</h3>
<p>
Typically, amides of RCOOH are insoluble in dilute acid or base. The presence
of nitrogen should be determined. Hydrolysis should yield the acid and amine,
and determination of their structures will indicate identification the final
structure.

<h3>23.20 Spectroscopy of amines and substituted amides</h3>
<p>
In analyzing ir spectra, substituted or unsubstituted amides reveal a C=O band
in the 1640-1690 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>  region. A free N&minus;H stretch, if
present, will be seen at 3050-3550 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> , and an N&minus;H
bend for RCONH<sub>2</sub> is found at 1600-1640 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> and for
RCONHR&prime; at 1530-1570 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
<p>
For free amines N-H stretching occurs in the 3200-3500 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>:
for 1&deg; amines, often two bands; for 2&deg;, one band; for 3&deg; amines, no
band (since no N-H). 1&deg; amines show N-H bending having strong bands at
650-900 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> (broad) and one at 1560-1650 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
<p>
C&minus;N stretching for aliphatic amines shows a weak band at 1030-1230 cm<sup>
&minus;1</sup> (3&deg; amines may show a doublet), whereas aromatic amines show
a strong <i>two</i> bands at 1180-1360 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
<p>
The N-H protons of amines absorb usually in the range &Delta; 1-5, where simply
proton counting determines the assignment. With N-H protons of amides (&minus;
CO&minus;NH&minus;), absorption is seen as a broad, low hump farther downfield
in &Delta; 5-8.

<h2>Chap. 24 Phenols</h2>

<h3>24.1-.2 Structure.  Nomenclature.  Physical properties.</h3>
<p>
The general formula is ArOH, with Ar=phenyl, substituted phenyl, or other aryl
group. They are distinguished from alcohols in that the -OH is attached
directly to the aromatic ring. The simplest member is <b>phenol</b>. The
methylphenols have the special name <i>cresols</i>. Occasionally the phenols
are named as <i>hydroxy-</i> compounds. Some important phenols: <i>o</i>-
chlorophenol, <i>m</i>-cresol (<i>m</i>-methylphenol), catechol (<i>o</i>-
hydroxyphenol), resorcinol (<i>m</i>-hydroxyphenol), hydroquinone (<i>p</i>-
hydroxyphenol), salicylic acid (<i>o</i>-hydroxybenzoic acid).
<p>
The simplest phenols are liquids or low m.p. solids. Hydrogen bonding explains
their high b.p. values. Phenol is somewhat soluble in water (9 g per 100 g
water), but most other phenols are insoluble. Phenols, like aromatic amines are
easily oxidized, and color present in these compounds may be the impurities of
oxidized reagent.
<p>
The properties of the nitrophenols in the special table show that the ortho-
nitrophenol has a very low b.p. and a lower solubility in water than the other
isomers. This is because the o-isomer is capable of intramolecular hydrogen
bonding: because of the nearness of the -OH and then -NO<sub>2</sub> groups to
each other on the aromatic ring, the proton on the -O-H group is in an ideal
location to hydrogen-bond with one of the oxygens of the nitro group on the
same molecule. The m- and p-isomers show no such advantage and form hydrogen
bonds between molecules or with the solvent. This intramolecular hydrogen
bonding is manifest as both a lower solubility and a lower b.p., both affected
by hydrogen bonding with solvents or other molecules.

<p>
insert physical properties of phenols and nitrophenols

<h3>24.3 Salts of phenols</h3>
<p>
Unlike ROH, phenols are fairly acidic, but less acidic than water.  Aq.
OH<sup>&minus;</sup> converts them to their salts, and acids back into phenols,
with salts being soluble in water and the acid forms not soluble.  The
K<sub>a</sub> of phenols is about 10<sup>&minus;10</sup>.  Since carbonic acid
is a stronger acid than phenols, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> are unable to react with
phenols to produce a sodium phenolate.  This ability to dissolve in NaOH and not
in NaHCO<sub>3</sub> can be used to identify a phenol, distinguishing it from
RCOOH.  Phenols can also be separated from RCOOH by their insolubility in
bicarbonate.

<h3>24.4 Industrial source</h3>
<p>
Although the laboratory methods often apply industrially, some special
processes exist, especially for production of phenol itself. Some phenol and
some cresols come from coal tar. But &gt;90% is synthesized. Fusion of sodium
benzenesulfonate with alkali is one method. The Dow process is a second method
in which nucleophilic substitution of chlorobenzene by aqueous NaOH at high
temperature is done.

<p>
Recent work with thallation of rings shows that arylthallium compounds can be
oxidized by lead tetraacetate, Pb(OAc)<sub>4</sub>, and in the presence of
triphenylphosphine to produce the phenolic ester of trifluoroacetic acid.
Simple hydrolysis produces the phenol. No isolation of intermediates is
necessary in carrying out the steps. It does have two advantages over diazonium
synthesis of phenols: (a) speed and high yield as a result of fewer steps, (b)
orientation control in the thallation step. A review of ch. 11 will explain the
thallation process. For example, the thallation-oxidation of chlorobenzene
produces only <i>p</i>-chlorophenol isomer.

<h3>24.7 Acidity of phenols</h3>
<p>
As previously described, phenols are converted to their salts by NaOH, but are
not sufficiently acidic to react with NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Phenols are stronger
acids than water, but weaker than RCOOH. They are also much more acidic than
alcohols, which have <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values between 10<sup>&minus;16</sup>
and 10<sup>&minus;18</sup>.
<p>
Acidity of phenol can be attributed to resonance stabilization of its conjugate
base, phenoxide ion. With phenol, resonance structures in which the oxygen 
shares a pair of electrons with the ring result in a separation of charges: the 
oxonium positive formal charge and the carbanion in the ring. This charge 
separation is less stable than a phenoxide ion, in which the charge can be 
better distributed as represented by three structures. With alcohols,
R-O<sup>&minus;</sup> has only one structure to represent it, and therefore is a far
worse acid.
<p>
Aromatic amines have been shown to be weaker bases than aliphatic amines (23.3)
for this same resonance effect as phenols are shown to be stronger acids than
alcohols. Electron-withdrawing (nitro groups) and -releasing (methyl groups) on
the ring also increase and decrease acidity, resp., reflecting their
stabilization of the negative charge left after the H<sup>+</sup> ion leaves.

<h3>24.8 Formation of ethers.  Williamson synthesis</h3>
<p>
Phenols can be made into ethers when treated with RX in alkaline solutions.
Methyl ethers can be formed using (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
The substitution of RX in alkaline conditions, in which phenoxide is an
excellent nucleophile, is classically S<sub>N</sub>2.
<p>
Some special aryl ether preparation reactions can use sodium alkoxides:
<p class="center">
2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene + Na<sup>+&minus;</sup>OCH<sub>3</sub> &rarr;
2,4-dinitroanisole (2,4- dinitrophenyl methyl ether)
<p>
Alkylethers are less activating to the ring than the -OH group, which means
that some reactions available to the reactive phenols are not available to
arylethers, viz., coupling, Kolbe reaction, Reimer-Tiemann, etc. This is
because the ether can not ionize to form the highly reactive phenoxide form of
phenols. An advantage of lower reactivity is the aromatic ethers are not
sensitive to oxidation:

<h3>24.9 Ester formation.  Fries rearrangement</h3>

<p> The conversion of phenols to esters by action of acids, acid chlorides, and
acid anhydrides has been discussed (  18.16, 20.8, 20.15).  Esters of phenols
heated with AlCl<sub>3</sub> cause the acyl group to migrate from phenolic
oxygen to an <i>ortho</i> or <i>para</i> position of the ring, yielding a
ketone.  This is called the <b>Fries rearrangement</b>, and is used to
synthesize phenolic ketones rather than direct acylation.  For example, phenol +
propionyl chloride &rarr; phenyl propionate, which is then treated with
AlCl<sub>3</sub> in CS<sub>2</sub> to make <i>o</i>- and <i>p</i>-hydroxyphenyl
ethyl ketones.  (The <i>o</i>-isomer is separated from the p-isomer taking
advantage of its ability to be steam-distilled.)

<h3>24.10 Ring substitution</h3>

<p> EAS on phenols is very much promoted;  as for aromatic amines, a nonbonding
pair can form a double bond with the ring to participate in resonance.  The
oxonium formed assumes the charge, but every atom except hydrogen has the
octet.  The phenoxide form of the phenol is even more prone to EAS than phenol,
being quite ready to stabilize any positive charge coming to the ring.  Indeed
the intermediate features the bound substituent to the ring as an uncharged,
unsaturated ketone.

<p> When phenols are treated with aqueous solutions of bromine, just about every
H atom <i>ortho</i> or <i>para</i> to the -OH group is replaced by Br.  If a low
temperature and a solvent of low polarity (chloroform, CCl<sub>4</sub>,
CS<sub>2</sub>) are used, the reaction can be limited to o- or p-bromophenol,
although the p-isomer is the chief product.  Polynitration also occurs in
concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> with formation of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric
acid), but considerable oxidation also occurs.  Dilute HNO<sub>3</sub> at lower
temperatures (20&deg;) will produce mononitrophenols (o-isomer, 40%; p-isomer,
13%), but the yields are poor.

<p> Alkylphenols can be made by F-C alkylation, but the yields are poor. 
Nitrosation of the ring has been shown earlier, with phenol + NaNO<sub>2</sub>,
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 7-8&deg;;  the <sup>+</sup>NO ion is a weak
nucleophile, but phenol has a very active ring.

<h3>24.11 Kolbe reaction.  Synthesis of phenolic acids</h3>

<p> Phenolic salts treated with CO<sub>2</sub> (at 125&deg; and 4-7 atm
pressure) can result in a substitution reaction (called the <b>Kolbe
reaction</b>) just like an EAS reaction.  The products are sodium <i>o</i>- or
<i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoate, which can be acidified.  <i>o</i>-Hydroxybenzoic acid
is <i>salicylic acid</i>, and is the chief product of the reaction.  The
intermediate may involve CO<sub>2</sub> attaching itself to the phenoxide oxygen
instead of the ring, but the electron-deficient carbon appears to attack the
ring.

<h3>24.12 Reimer-Tiemann reaction.  Synthesis of phenolic aldehydes. 
Dichlorocarbene</h3>

<p> Phenol mixed with CHCl<sub>3</sub> in aq. NaOH introduces an -CHO group to
the ring, generally in the <i>ortho</i> position, and is known as the
<b>Reimer</b>-<b>Tiemann</b> <b>reaction</b>.  A substituted benzal is said to
form, but is hydrolyzed in the alkaline medium.

The mechanism involves a dichlorocarbene (:CCl<sub>2</sub>) formed from
chloroform by action of a strong base and shown to occur earlier in C=C bond
addition (9.16).  Even though electrically neutral, dichlorocarbene is
considered a powerful electrophile because the carbon has only a sextet of
electrons.

<h3>24.13-.14 Analysis and spectroscopy of phenols</h3>

<p> The difference between the reaction of phenol with NaOH and
NaHCO<sub>3</sub> has already been thoroughly discussed.  Many (but not all)
phenols can form a colored complex (ranging from green to blue and violet to
red) with FeCl<sub>3</sub>.  Phenols can often be identified by their esters and
ethers, and by bromination products.</p>

<p> Phenols are distinguished in ir spectra by the strong and broad O-H stretch
in the 3200-3600 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>  region present for all ArOH and ROH. 
They are distinguished from ROH by a C&mdash;O stretch which is strong and
broad:  for phenols, at 1230 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>;  for ROH, at 1050-1200
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.</p>

<p> Like all ethers, phenolic ethers show no O-H stretch but do show C-O
stretching:  aryl &amp; vinyl ethers, a strong and broad 1200-1275
cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> and a weaker 1020-1075 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>; ROR, 1060-
1150 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.</p>

<p>
Nmr spectra will show the O-H proton, the shift affected by
the degree of H-bonding, and hence by temperature, concentration, and solvent
nature.  Signals at d 4-7 are to be expected, d 6-12 with intramolecular
hydrogen bonding.</p>

<h1>Part II   Special Topics</h1>

<h2>Chap. 25 Aryl halides.  Nucleophilic aromatic substitution</h2>

<h3>25.1-.2 Structure.  Physical properties</h3>

<p>
Aryl halides have the general structure ArX, with the
requirement of having a halogen directly attached to the aromatic ring.  Benzyl
chloride is not an ArX, for the chloride is not attached to the ring but the
molecule is just a substituted RX compound.  They are not as reactive as RX to
nucleophilic substitution unless other groups are present on the ring which
increase their reactivity, or by the use of very basic reagents or high temps. 
The nucleophilic aromatic substitution (NAS) reactions they can undergo involve
two mechanisms:  the <i>bimolecular displacement mechanism</i> for activated
ArX, and the <i>elimination-addition mechanism</i> involving a <b>benzyne</b>
intermediate.</p>

<p> Related somewhat to aryl halides in the lack of reactivity are the <i>vinyl
halides</i> (-C=C-X), with a number of interesting parallels.  While ArX can
undergo electrophilic substitution, vinyl halides are subject to electrophilic
addition.  In EAS, ArX deactivates but directs <i>ortho</i>,<i>para</i>;  in
electrophilic addition, halogen deactivates but causes Markovnikov orientation. 
By its inductive effect, halogen deactivates the molecule toward electrophilic
attack;  by resonance it releases electrons but only to certain sites.</p>

<p>
Both are also unreactive to nucleophilic substitution, in
contrast to alkyl halides.  The low reactivity is due to the partial double
bond character which exists in the C-X bond.</p>

<p> The physical properties of ArX and RX are very much the same if comparing
the same MW.  Chlorobenzene and bromobenzene as an example have nearly the same
b.p. as n-hexyl chloride and n-hexyl bromide.  ArX are insoluble in water and
soluble in the usual organics.  Boiling points tend to be affected by weight,
whereas melting points are affected by a particular symmetry;  the p-isomer
tends to be 70-100&deg; lower in m.p. than the <i>o</i>- or <i>m</i>-isomer.</p>

                                             <i>for iodides only</i>
</p>
<p> Direct halogenation of the aromatic ring is more useful than for alkanes: 
although two isomers (ortho and para) are the products, attack is not as random
as in free radical halogenation.  Moreover, if thallation is done with the bulky
thallium acetate, direct bromination can occur <i>exclusively</i> to the
<i>para</i> position.  RX is often prepared from ROH, but ArX is not prepared
from ArOH, being instead prepared from the diazonium salt
(ArN<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) which comes from ArNO<sub>2</sub>.  (ROH bears the
same relationship as ArNO<sub>2</sub> as the precursor to RX as to ArX.)
</p>
<p> Halogenation via diazonium salts may be the most important, however.  Rings
can not be fluorinated or iodinated by directly but through this pathway. 
Moreover, direct halogenation produces o- and p-isomers which are difficult to
separate from one another.  On the other hand, the o- and p-nitro isomers which
are precursors to the diazonium can be separated more easily (by distillation)
from one another.

<h3>25.4 Reactions</h3>

<p> RX typically undergoes nucleophilic substitution with functions like

CN<sup>&minus;</sup>, etc., to form alcohols, ethers, amines, nitriles, etc. 
Even F-C alkylation can be seen as a substitution by a basic aromatic ring
displacing halide in RX.  Aryl halides show no such reactivity except under the
most rigorous conditions.
</p>
<p> ArX can undergo an NAS reaction readily if the ring contains other groups
which are quite deactivating (e.g., -NO<sub>2</sub>, -NO, -CN) <i>and</i> which
are located in the proper position, viz., <i>ortho</i> or <i>para</i> to the
halogen.  Reactions of inactivated ArX with strong bases or at high temps occur
by the <i>benzyne</i> intermediate and can be made to occur.

<h3>25.5 Low reactivity of aryl and vinyl halides</h3>

<p> When alcoholic AgNO<sub>3</sub> is mixed and warmed with alkyl halides,
silver halides are produced as the allyl, benzyl, and 3&deg; bromides react
almost instantly, whereas the 1&deg; and 2&deg; bromides react within about 5
minutes.  Halogens joined directly to the ring or C=C carbon do not react, even
when heated for days.  Neither do OH<sup>&minus;</sup>, OR<sup>&minus;</sup>,
NH<sub>3</sub>, CN<sup>&minus;</sup>, or ArH + AlCl<sub>3</sub> react with ArX
or C=C-X.</p>

<h3>25.6 Structure of aryl and vinyl halides</h3>

<p> The reason for the low reactivity is attributable to (a) delocalization of
electrons by resonance; (b) differences in the &sigma; bond energies because of
differences in hybridization of carbon.</p>

<p>
insert structures of chlorobenzene and vinyl chloride on p
824.</p>

<p> Structures I-V show the possible resonance structures of chlorobenzene, and
VI and VII of vinyl chloride.  The fact that the resonance structures showing a
carbon-chloride double bond (C=Cl) are possible shows that the C-Cl bond is
something more than a single bond, something less than double.  The transition
state in nucleophilic substitution is far less stable than the reactant, making
the <i>E</i><sub>act</sub> for displacement untenable.</p>

<p> The other interpretation is simply that the carbon in alkyl halides is
sp<sup>3</sup>- hybridized to the halogen, while the carbon in ArX and C=C-X is
sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized.  The latter bond is simply shorter and stronger, and
the molecule is more stable.  Such an interpretation was put forth in  5.4.  The
C-Cl bond length in chlorobenzene and vinyl chloride is 1.69   compared with a
1.77-1.80   range of bond lengths in many alkyl chlorides.  For bromobenzene and
vinyl bromide, C-Br bond length is 1.86   compared with 1.91-1.92   in alkyl
bromides.  Double bonds are shorter than single bonds as shown by physical data
and by quantum mechanics.</p>

<p> Another interesting fact is that dipole moments in ArX and C=C-X are smaller
than for RX.  RX is quite polar because halogens are quite electronegative
compared to carbon, causing the polarity;  alkyl Cl and Br show values of
between 2.02 and 2.15 <span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>.  With ArX
and C=C-X, it is expected that the very mobile &pi; electrons would contribute
to a larger or as large dipole than in RX.  However chloro- and bromobenzene
have moments of only 1.7 <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>d</span>, and
the vinyl analogs even less at 1.4 <span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>.  
This fact is consistent with the resonance stabilization of
these molecules, where the inductive effect of the halogen is opposed by the
fact that resonance places the electrons away from where they might want to go. 
The net displacement is less than were there no resonance.   Alternatively,
sp<sup>2</sup>- hybridized carbon is more electronegative than the
sp<sup>3</sup>-carbon, and would be less willing to release electrons to
chlorine.</p>

<p>
Added in proof of the willingness of halogens to participate
in electron pair sharing in resonance at the cost of assuming a formal charge
is the mechanism of halogen addition to C=C bonds, in which a cyclic halonium
is the only possible explanation for the <i>anti</i>-addition result; here
halogen is willing to form 2 bonds.</p>

<h3>25.7 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (NAS):  bimolecular displacement</h3>

<p> Chlorobenzene can be converted to phenol in aqueous NaOH, but only a very
high temperatures over 300&deg; (the Dow process:  6-8% NaOH, 350&deg;, 4500
psi).  If an -NO<sub>2</sub> group is attached either ortho or para to the ring,
the reaction will occur at a lower temp.:  160&deg; with 15% NaOH.  A -
NO<sub>2</sub> group meta to chlorine has no effect.  If -NO<sub>2</sub> is now
attached both para and ortho (2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene), boiling
Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> at 130&deg; will perform the conversion to 2,4-
dinitrophenol.  And if the other ortho position is nitrated (2,4,6-
trinitrochlorobenzene), warm water is enough to form the phenol (picric
acid).</p>

<p> This same effect is seen in other nucleophilic displacement reactions, with
-NO<sub>2</sub> groups making the Ar-X very reactive.  Groups other than nitro
which are ortho or para to the halogen have similar effects:  -
N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, -CN, -SO<sub>3</sub>H, -COOH, -CHO, -
COR.  These are the familiar ring deactivators which are meta-directing to
<i>electrophilic</i> substitution.  If such groups are activating to NAS, then
it would be expected that electron-withdrawing groups are <i>deactivating</i>,
and this is found to be true.  The general rule for NAS is that electron
withdrawal causes activation and electron release causes deactivation.</p>

<h3>25.8 Bimolecular displacement mechanism of NAS</h3>

<p>
The two-step mechanism for NAS is thus shown:
</p>
<p class="center">
<img src="ORGCHEM2_files/image012.png"
alt="nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism">
</p>
<p> The first step involves the nucleophilic attack on the ring to form a
carbanion as part of the ring.  The second step involves expulsion of a weak
base, the halide ion, to form the product.  The carbanion can be said to be
stabilized by resonance structures in the ring, with the anionic charge of the
intermediate concentrated on the carbons which are at the positions ortho and
para to the carbon holding the nucleophile, but with the charge distributed over
the entire molecule.  The geometry of the transition state of NAS can be
compared to the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction of aliphatic halides, in which a
pentavalent carbon intermediate in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction appears as a less
stable reaction, requiring greater energy input (larger <i>E</i><sub>act</sub>)
than the intermediate in NAS, in which the carbon assumes a less crowded
tetrahedral geometry.  In fact the intermediate in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction
is not a stable structure, but is the transition state (<q>the top of the energy
hill</q>), whereas in NAS, the carbanion is formed and represents an energy
minimum between the transition states of the nucleophile adding and the halide
leaving.
</p>
<h3>25.9-.10 Reactivity and orientation in NAS</h3>

<p>
Reactivity of the aryl halide in NAS is again a matter of what groups attached
to the ring stabilize or ease formation of the incipient carbanion in the
transition state.  The groups listed in the sections on EAS which are either
activating or deactivating in correlation with the electron-releasing or -
withdrawing abilities are conversely related to the reactions
in NAS;  what is activating in EAS is deactivating in NAS, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>
In consideration of orientation, a model of the formation of the carbanion
intermediate comparing both p- and m-chloronitrobenzene is used.  In drawing the
resonance structures of intermediates in which the carbanion is rotated to the
carbons ortho and para, the most stable resonance structure in either the m- or
p-chloronitrobenzene is one of the resonance structures in the p-isomer. 
Although the -NO<sub>2</sub> is electron-withdrawing and affects all carbons on
the ring, it does so most with the carbon to which it is attached, and it helps
to disperse the anionic charge on this carbon.  If the nitro group were ortho to
the carbon undergoing substitution, one of its 3 resonance structures would
also show this enhanced stability.</p>

<p>
insert para and meta resonance structures on bottom p 831,
top p 832</p>

<h3>25.11 Electron withdrawal by resonance</h3>

<p> The inductive effect accounts for a change in aromatic ring reactivity in
both EAS and NAS, but inasmuch as ring reactivity is also affected by
<i>resonance</i> in EAS, so it may be with NAS as well.  Considering the p- and
o-isomers of chloronitrobenzene again, the oxygens on the -NO<sub>2</sub> are
very electronegative, like the nitrogen on the group too.  The illustration
shows resonance structures of both isomers in which the negative charge leaves
the ring and is assumed by the oxygen atom or atoms in the nitro group.  The
electronegativity of oxygen makes them especially able to assume the charge. 
Such resonance structures, in which the anionic charge moves out of the ring and
onto the more electronegative atoms of the electron-withdrawing group, can be
drawn for other groups as well:  -CN, -COOH, -COR, -NO.</p>

<h3>25.12 Evidence for the two steps in bimolecular displacement</h3>
<p>
The evidence for the multiple steps in EAS came about from kinetic studies,
among others, in which no isotope effect could be observed in formation of the
product.  Isotope effect studies are of little use in NAS, however, since a
higher atomic weight halogen is used and isotopes of a halogen would not amount
to a significant change in rate even if the rate depended upon the leaving of
the halogen.</p>
<p>
However, making use of the J. Bunnet's notion of the <i>element effect</i>, if
the rate does not depend upon the breaking of the C-X bond, then it should not
matter which halogen is attached. In S<sub>N</sub>2 and S<sub>N</sub>1
displacements of alkyl halides, there is a tremendous difference in reactivity,
with the C-F bond much more difficult to break than the C-I bond:</p>

<p class="center">
Reactivity of RX: R&minus;I &gt; R&minus;Br &gt; R&minus;Cl &gt; R&minus;F</p>
<p>
In NAS it has been shown that there is no difference in reactivity among the
halides and that, more often than not, the aryl fluoride is the <i>most</i>
reactive of the halogens. This comparative indifference in reactivity forces
the conclusion that the reaction rate is independent of C-X bond breaking, and
that attack of the nucleophile to form the carbanion is the slow step.</p>
<p>
The faster reaction of aryl fluorides has been interpreted as a strong
inductive effect in fluorine, which serves to stabilize the transition state of
nucleophilic attack.</p>

<h3>25.13 Nucleophilic substitution:  aliphatic and aromatic</h3>

<p>
Of the three types of nucleophilic substitution, the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction
involves the leaving of the halide prior to the nucleophile attacking, forming a
<i>positive</i> charge on the carbon in which the carbon is in an environment to
favorably accommodate the charge.  The S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is favored
because of electron release.  With the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, very little
charge develops on the carbon which is the center of the reaction, and this is
probably because the carbon is in an environment in which it is unsuitable to
assume a charged intermediate state.  Reactions of the S<sub>N</sub>2-type are
relatively insensitive to electron withdrawal or release.  With NAS, the carbon
undergoing attack does not assume the developing <i>negative</i> charge at all,
but passes it to other carbons forming the especially stable array of the
aromatic ring.  NAS reactions are promoted by groups promoting electron
withdrawal.</p>

<h3>25.14 Elimination-addition mechanism for NAS.  Benzyne</h3>
<p>
NAS following the bimolecular displacement mechanism requires the presence of
electron-withdrawing groups on the ring, in which the nucleophile (base) is
easily added.  NAS can occur without such groups, but an especially strong
nucleophile (base) is required, and even then, the mechanism
is believed to proceed via a <b>benzyne</b> intermediate, or by steps of
<i>elimination-addition</i>.</p>
<p>
Aryl halides treated with the very strong base (nucleophile) amide ion, NH<sub>
2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, in ammonia form aniline. The total mechanism
involves 4 steps, the first two corresponding to an elimination to form the
benzyne, the last two with the nucleophile attacking the reactive benzyne to
form the substituted product, aniline.</p>

<p>
Insert mechanisms of 4 steps on p 836 and 837 and draw a benzyne structure.</p>
<p>
A proton is pulled of the ring to form a carbanion, and the halide leaves with
the bonding electrons while the carbanion bonds to form the benzyne. With
reaction of the nucleophile to the benzyne, the proton is restored to the
carbon now bearing the anionic charge. The benzyne structure is supposed to
involve formation of a p bond within the ring plane (neither above or below
with the other conjugate pi bonds), and there is little sideways overlap
permitted, making the bond reactive.</p>

<p>
That this mechanism is possible comes from a number of facts.</p>

<p>
(a) In looking at the benzyne intermediate, it can be deduced that not only the
carbon originally bearing the halogen can be a target of the nucleophile, but 
so can the carbons on either side, depending on the benzyne bond orientation. 
Using chlorobenzene in which the carbon attached to the Cl atom had been 
labeled with <sup>14</sup>C, J. D. Roberts (1953) found that in a reaction with
NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> in liq. NH<sub>3</sub> that 47% of the aniline
had -NH<sub>2</sub>-bonded directly to <sup>14</sup>C, and the other 53% to the
carbon next to the label.</p>
<p>
(b) The loss of a proton on the carbon next to, i.e., <i>ortho</i> to the
carbon bearing the halide is necessary in supposing a benzyne intermediate. In
fact compounds like 2-bromo-3-methylanisole with no available ortho hydrogens
do <i>not</i> react with NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> in liq. NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>
(c) The mechanism not only supposes that a proton is removed in the first step
to form the benzyne intermediate, but that this should logically be the slow
(rate-determining) step in the reaction. Evidence of this comes from
experiments in which a 50:50 mixture of bromobenzene and <i>o</i>-
deuteriobromobenzene was treated with NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> for a
period, and the amount of unreacted material of both compounds determined. The
result showing much more unreacted <sup>2</sup>H-bromobenzene indicated an
isotope effect which involves hydrogens of the ortho position, and in which the
reaction rate depends upon C-H bond breaking.</p>
<p>
(d) That the first step is proton removal by the base is further confirmed by a
reaction in which o-deuteriofluorobenzene is treated with NH<sub>2</sub><sup>
&minus;</sup>, which forms aniline slowly if at all. When reactant is isolated
prior to any significant aniline formation, the reactant is found to be
ordinary fluorobenzene. An equilibrium reaction in which base removes the
proton (deuterium) and then replaces it because of the difficult of breaking a
C-F bond is indicated. Clearly with other halides, such as C-Br, the
carbon-halogen bond is broken perhaps as the base is removing the proton, but
with a stronger carbon-halogen bond, formation of the benzyne is inhibited.</p>

<p>
(e) If a benzyne intermediate is to be formed, it must be formed in such an
orientation in which the more stable carbanion intermediate is formed in respect
to the groups attached to the aromatic ring.  When m-bromoanisole and o-
bromoanisole are treated with NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> in liq.
NH<sub>3</sub>, they both yield the same product <i>m</i>-anisidine (<i>m</i>-
aminoanisole).  The -OCH<sub>3</sub> is electron-withdrawing as far as its
inductive effect, although in EAS, it is involved in <i>activation</i> of the
ring by resonance.  But because resonance stabilization is not possible with
benzyne in which the carbanion electrons are out of the plane of the p cloud,
only the inductive effect is observed.  The inductive effect is greater on the
carbons nearer the -OCH<sub>3</sub> group.  When o-bromoanisole is reacting with
NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, there is only one proton ortho to the Br atom,
so the benzyne formed is constrained.  And although there are protons on either
side of Br in m-bromoanisole, the proton between -OCH<sub>3</sub> and -Br is
preferentially abstracted (as opposed to the proton para to -OCH<sub>3</sub>,
ortho to -Br) because its carbon will yield the more stable carbanion:  the
negative charge is dispersed by the closely located -OCH<sub>3</sub> group. 
Both benzynes are equivalent, and even the attack of
NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> to the benzyne intermediate is directed to the
carbon meta to -OCH<sub>3</sub>, as the resulting carbanion intermediate is on
the carbon closest to -OCH<sub>3</sub> and the more stable.  Placing the
-NH<sub>2</sub> group ortho to -OCH<sub>3</sub> with the carbanion meta to
-OCH<sub>3</sub> would be a less stable carbanion intermediate.
</p>

<p>
Organolithium compounds can also produce benzyne intermediates.  
o-fluoroanisole (<i>o</i>-FC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>) can be
treated with phenyllithium
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>), in which the
strong phenyl ion base abstracts proton to form the weaker base, [<i>o</i>-
FC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>&minus;</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> plus
the weaker acid, benzene.  The carbon-fluorine bond breaks to form the benzyne
and Li<sup>+</sup>F<sup>&minus;</sup>.  The benzyne then reacts with additional
phenyllithium to produce the carbanion-containing base Li<sup>+</sup>[<i>m</i>-
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>&minus;</sup> which can undergo
no further reaction for want of a strong acid.  H<sub>2</sub>O (a strong acid)
is added to complete the reaction to form the <i>m</i>-phenylanisole and
Li<sup>+</sup>OH<sup>&minus;</sup>.
</p>

<p>
Organolithium compounds (RLi) resemble Grignard reagents (RMgX) in their
reactions.  The carbon metal bond is not only highly polar covalent, but nearly
ionic, more so in RLi than RMgX since Li is more electropositive than Mg.  For
this reason RLi is more reactive than RMgX.
</p>

<h3>25.15 Analysis of aryl halides</h3>
<p>
ArX demonstrate many predictable reactions or nonreactions:  insolubility in
cold <i>conc</i>. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; inertness to Br<sub>2</sub> in
CCl<sub>4</sub> and to permanganate; formation of orange to red colors when
CHCl<sub>3</sub> and AlCl<sub>3</sub> are added; dissolution in cold
<i>fuming</i> H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, but at a rate slower than for
benzene.  Elemental analysis should be halogen-positive when evaluating aromatic
compounds.  RX reacts with AgNO<sub>3</sub>, whereas ArX and vinyl-X are
negative.

<h2>Chap. 26 Carbanions.  Malonic ester and acetoacetic ester syntheses</h2>

<h3>26.1 Carbanions in organic synthesis</h3>
<p>
Carbanions are <i>nucleophilic carbons</i>.  Organometallic compounds are
examples of such (basic) carbons, in which the strongly or weakly
electropositive metal makes possible what amounts to acid-base chemistry.  The
Grignard and organocadmium reagents, the lithium dialkylcopper of the Corey-
House reaction, and the organozinc intermediate of the Reformatsky reaction show
carbons with negative charges.  The carbanions generated because of the
increased acidity &alpha;-hydrogens brought about by carbonyls is another
example.
</p>

<h3>26.2 Malonic ester synthesis of RCOOH</h3>
<p>
The synthesis of larger RCOOH molecules is usually done by the use of ethyl
malonate, CH<sub>2</sub>(COOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), in the <b>malonic ester
synthesis.</b>  Two factors make this synthesis useful:  (a) the alpha hydrogens
are quite acidic with the presence of <i>two</i> activating carbonyls instead of
one; (b) malonic acid and substituted malonic acids undergo decarboxylation very
easily.</p>
<p>
The reaction usually involves mixing ethyl malonate with sodium ethoxide
(NaOEt) to produce the salt <i>sodiomalonic</i> <i>ester</i>.  When brought into
contact with an alkyl halide, RX, the basic carbanion of the malonate reacts to
produce the nucleophilic substituted product.  ArX do not react at all to the
carbanion, as it is not sufficiently basic.  3&deg; RX will react, but the
elimination product is obtained.  The best reaction is with 1&deg;
RX&mdash;lower yields with 2&deg; RX&mdash;to produce the alkylmalonic ester
product (and Na<sup>+</sup>X<sup>&minus;</sup>).</p>
<p>
Since there is still one &alpha;-hydrogen remaining, an additional reaction
to form the <i>di</i>alkyl malonic ester is possible.</p>
<p>
Malonic acid when heated above its m.p. decomposes with loss of CO<sub>2</sub> 
to form acetic acid. In a similar way, the substituted malonic acid can be 
heated to cause a decomposition resulting in loss of CO<sub>2</sub> to form what 
is a substituted acetic acid. First the ester is hydrolyzed in warm <i>
alkaline</i> medium (base catalysis drives the reaction to the right because of 
a more stable carboxylate ion). The acid salt is acidified then heated (to about 
140&deg;), resulting in decarboxylation. <i>Hence, a malonic ester synthesis 
yields an acetic acid in which one or two of its hydrogens have been replaced by 
alkyl groups.</i></p>
<p>
When planning the synthesis, the only problem is selection of the proper RX. 
Consider the structure of the acid. For example, isocaproic acid, 
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH is an acetic acid in which a 
hydrogen has been replaced with an isobutyl group. Isobutyl bromide is an ideal 
RX, being a 1&deg; RX, and the acetic acid group is provide by ethyl malonate:</p>

<p>

<p>
3. ethyl isobutylmalonate
&minus;&minus;&rarr; dicarboxylate salt
&minus;&minus;&rarr; dicarboxylic acid
&minus;&minus;&rarr; isocaproic acid
</p>

<p>
If &alpha;-methylvaleric acid, 
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)COOH, is to be made,
this is clearly a disubstituted acetic acid, with one substitute a methyl group,
the other <i>n</i>-propyl. Therefore, two different RX compounds are necessary:
methyl bromide and <i>n</i>-propyl bromide. Either the addition of small amounts
of one reactant to the other or the proportions of reactants is adjusted
to limit the extent of reaction in which one RX is substituted then the other.</p>
<p>
Although NaOEt was shown as the base, modifications of malonic ester
synthesis are done with potassium tert-butoxide.  Moreover leaving groups other
than halides are exploited, such as ROSO<sub>3</sub>Ar or 
ROSO<sub>3</sub>R&prime;.  Polar aprotic solvents have also been used:  DMSO,
DMF.  In place of simple RX compounds are &alpha;-bromo esters (not 
&alpha;-bromo acids).</p>

<h3>26.3 Acetoacetic ester synthesis of ketones</h3>
<p>
Whereas the malonic ester synthesis makes RCOOH, the <b>acetoacetic
ester</b> <b>synthesis</b> uses ethyl acetoacetate,
CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>COOEt, to make <i>ketones</i>.  The ester is
treated with NaOEt to produce the reactive &alpha;-carbanion, which then reacts
with RX to make the alkylacetoacetate ester.  The presence of another a-hydrogen
allows one more reaction to make the dialklyacetoacetate ester.  Hydrolysis of
the ester is done in basic or acidic solution, to make the corresponding acid,
which then undergo rapid decarboxylation (heated if necessary) to form a methyl
ketone (mono- or disubstituted acetone) of either one form,
CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>R, or another, CH<sub>3</sub>COCHRR&prime;.  The
decarboxylation step occurs more readily with acetoacetic acids than with
malonic acids.</p>
<p>
In planning a synthesis, careful thought is first given as to whether it has
the acetone structure.  The substitutions on one of the methyl carbons is then
assessed.  5-methyl-2-hexanone has a single substitution in which isobutyl
bromide would be the ideal halide.  3-methyl-2-hexanone has a structure showing
disubstitution, and so n-propyl bromide and methyl bromide would be appropriate
in the synthesis.</p>

<h3>26.4 Decarboxylation of &beta;-keto acids and malonic acids</h3>
<p>
These carbanionic mediated syntheses leading to acids or ketones depended
upon (i) acidity of a-hydrogens and (ii) decarboxylation.  Decarboxylation of b-
keto acids involves both examination of the free acid structure and its
conjugate base, the carboxylation ion.  If CO<sub>2</sub> is lost from the
carboxylate ion, the resulting molecule is a enolic carbanion which is
stabilized by sharing of the negative charge with the ketolic oxygen. 
Decarboxylation of the acid form would involve proton transfer to the keto
oxygen either prior to or in synchrony with loss of CO<sub>2</sub>.  An
uncharged enol is clearly present, rearranging to form acetone.</p>

<h3>26.5 Direct and indirect alkylation of esters and ketones</h3>
<p>
Rather than preparing a-substituted acids and ketones via the dicarbonyl
esters used, why not do it directly, i.e., by preparing the carbanions of the
acids and ketones to react with the alkyl halides?  Because certain obstacles
obtain:  (a) self-condensation, such as an aldol condensation with the ketones;
(b) polyalkylation; (c) for unsymmetrical ketones, alkylation at both a-carbons
can occur, or at the wrong one.  As to the self-condensation reaction, RX
competes with the carbonyl carbon of a second ketone molecule for the
carbanion.  While the right base-solvent combination allows for direct use of
ketones, there is limited applicability.  With the esters, there is only one
particular &alpha;-carbon which directs alkylation to that carbon, giving
somewhat more control.</p>

<h3>26.6 Synthesis of acids and esters via 2-oxazolines</h3>
<p>
Acids and esters can also be synthesized via <i>2-oxazolines</i>. The carboxylic 
acid reacts to form the cyclic 2-oxazoline. This serves to protect the -COOH 
group. If these compounds are treated with a strong base, such as an 
organolithium to abstract the hydrogen from the &alpha;-carbon, these basic 2- 
oxazoline can easily react with an alkyl halide to form a substituted 2- 
oxazoline, and the RCOOH can be regenerated by acidification. The reaction 
sequence is illustrated:</p>

<p>
insert reaction bottom p 855.</p>

<p>
The synthesis depends upon: (a) ease of formation and hydrolysis of 2-oxazolines;
(b) the retained acidity of the &alpha;-hydrogens; (c) the inertness
of the ring to a strong base such as the organolithium (Grignards can also be
used).</p>

<h3>26.7 Organoborane synthesis of acids and ketones</h3>
<p>
Hydroboration of the C=C followed by oxidation produced alcohols. 
Organoboranes do not have to be oxidized however.  In the presence of base,
alkylboranes can react with bromoacetone to produce alkylacetones and with ethyl
bromoacetate to yield ethyl alkylacetates.
</p>

<p class="center">

<p class="center">
R<sub>3</sub>B + BrCH<sub>2</sub>COOEt
&minus;&minus;&rarr; RCH<sub>2</sub>COOEt
</p>

<p>
The mechanism of the reaction has been postulated below.  A base abstracts a
proton from the carbon holding the Br atom, and alpha to the carbonyl.  The
strong base now finds a (Lewis) acid in the organoborane, the boron atom
assuming the negative charge.  A 1,2-alkyl shift from the boron to the alpha
carbon, with leaving of the Br atom occurs, and protonolysis occurs leaving a
substituted acetone product.  This last reaction is more difficult than
protonolysis of Grignard reagent;  it is not equilibrium-controlled, but rate-
controlled since it is not the stronger base R:<sup>&minus;</sup> that gets the
proton, but rather the resonance-stabilized
RCHCOCH<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> carbanion.
</p>

<p>
insert 4-step mechanism on pp 856-7
</p>

<p>
The mechanism essentially is three acid-base reactions and a 1,2-alkyl shift. 
The organoborane synthesis is comparable to acetoacetic ester synthesis since it 
furnishes an acetone unit (as bromoacetone) or an acetic acid unit (as 
bromoacetic ester). Bromine plays the same part as &minus;COOEt as it increases 
the acidity of &alpha;-hydrogens and determines the carbon to be alkylated. It 
is also easily lost during the alkylation process; &minus;COOEt must be removed 
by a hydrolysis and decarboxylation process.
</p>
<p>
High yields of product depend upon proper selection of reagents.  The best
base is the bulky potassium 2,6-di-<i>tert</i>-butylphenoxide.  The best
alkylating agent is B-alkyl-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, or B-alkyl-9-BBN,
produced by the reactions shown.</p>

</p>

<p>
In addition to bromoacetone, other bromomethyl ketones (BrCH<sub>2</sub>COR)
can be used if available.  Bromination is best carried out with
CuBr<sub>2</sub>, and on ketones in which R contains no &alpha;-hydrogens to
compete those on the methyl:  acetophenone, methyl <i>tert</i>-butyl ketone.
</p>

<h3>26.8 Alkylation of carbonyl compounds via enamines</h3>

<p>
Amines can react with carbonyls by a nucleophilic addition.  1&deg; amines
add, but dehydrate to form an <i>imine</i>.
</p>

<p class="center">
-C=O + H<sub>2</sub>NR&prime;
&mdash;&minus;&rarr; -C(OH)-NHR&prime;
&mdash;&minus;&rarr; -C=NR&prime; (an <i>imine</i>)
</p>

<p>
If the carbonyl cmpd contains an a-hydrogen, the elimination favors the imine 
rather than an enamine (-C=C-NHR&prime;) since the imine is more stable. Indeed 
enamines rapidly tautomerize to form the imine. This is quite analogous to the 
keto-enol tautomerization wherein the keto form is preferred.
</p>

<p>
2&deg; amines react to, but in this case the enamine <i>does</i>
form so long as there are &alpha;-hydrogens;
the nitrogen having no available hydrogens, the imine is not possible.
</p>

<p class="center">
-CH&mdash;C=O +
HNR&prime;<sub>2</sub> &mdash;&minus;&rarr; -CH&mdash;C(OH)-NHR&prime; &mdash;&minus;&rarr; -C=C&minus;NR&prime;<sub>2</sub> (an <i>enamine</i>)
</p>
<p>
As shown by G. Stork in 1954, enamines have a nucleophilic carbon as a result of 
the high electron density of the C=C bond. Alkylation of an enamine is possible 
with an alkyl halide, to form an <i>iminium</i> ion, which can be hydrolyzed to 
regenerate the carbonyl.
</p>
<p>
show reaction on p. 859 with the RX compound
</p>
<p>
The overall process is a 1&deg; amine reacts with a ketone (with
at least one a-hydrogen) to produce an alkylated ketone.  Although the enamine
nitrogen is just as nucleophilic as the carbon, a quaternary nitrogen would
result.  Heating of the N-alkylated compound changes it to the C-alkylated
product.
</p>
<p>
The nitrogens of enamines behave similarly to aromatic amines, which is not 
surprising since they are vinyl amines, and aryl and vinyl amines share similar 
properties. The commonly used 2&deg; amines in the reaction are the heterocyclic 
<i>pyrrolidine</i> and <i>morpholine</i>:

<h2>Chap. 27 &alpha;,&beta;-Unsaturated carbonyl
compounds.  Conjugate addition</h2>

<h3>27.1-.2 Structure and properties.  Preparation</h3>

<p>
Because these cmpds contain both C=C and C=O, they undergo reactions typical
of cmpds containing only those groups:  electrophilic addition of acids and
halogens, hydrogenation, hydroxylation, and cleavage at C=C; nucleophilic
substitution typical of -COOR and addition typical of &minus;COR of &minus;CHO. 
The double bonds are <i>conjugated</i>, which will bring a special condition to
their chemistries.  Some &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated compounds possess special
names given in the table showing the physical properties.
</p>
<p>
insert table of a,b-unsaturated carbonyls
</p>
<p> Preparation is via the <b>aldol condensation</b> to make unsaturated
aldehydes or ketones or the <b>dehydrohalogenation of </b><b>&alpha;-halo
acids</b> or the <b>Perkin condensation </b>to make the unsaturated acids.
</p>
<h3>27.3 Interaction of functional groups</h3>

<p> The C=C bond is generally activated by electron-releasing groups,
deactivated by electron-withdrawing groups, but nonetheless serves as a source
of electrons for electrophiles.  Since a carbonium will necessarily form as an
intermediate, electron-releasers attached to the C=C bond should stabilize the
transition state by dispersing the developing positive charge.  C=O, -COOH,
&minus;COOR, and -CN groups are very electron-withdrawing, so reactivity to
electrophilic addition should be low.  It is found that a,b-unsaturated ketones,
acids, esters, and nitriles are less reactive than simple alkenes to halogens or
hydrogen halides.
</p>
<p>
Quite the contrary, the deactivation of C=C bond in
a,b-unsaturated ketones, acids, esters, and nitriles makes it susceptible
toward <i>nucleophilic</i> addition rather than electrophilic addition.
</p>
<h3>27.4 Electrophilic addition</h3>

<p> The carbonyl group both lowers the <b>reactivity</b> and affects the
<b>orientation</b> of the addition.  With addition of an unsymmetrical agent,
the electrophile (H<sup>+</sup> if an acid) tends to add to the a-carbon, while
the negative group (nucleophilic portion) adds to the &beta;-carbon.

<p>
The mechanism starts with protonation of the <i>carbonyl oxygen</i> rather than 
attack of the C=C bond (!). The initially formed oxonium rapidly becomes a 
dispersed polycarbonium ion as a result of resonance stabilization by the 
adjacent double bond. Addition of the hydrogen to the b-carbon in the compound 
would produce a less stable resonance structure since the oxygen does not want 
to part of the positive charge distribution. The nucleophile :Z is then 
attracted to one of three carbons bearing the charge. The a-carbon can be ruled 
out just as it would not allow proper reformation of the p bond. Addition to the 
carbonyl carbon (a 1,2-addition) would produce an unstable hydroxy compound. 
Addition to the b-carbon (1,4-addition) produces the more stable product, 
allowing reformation of the p bond. The result is an enol which quickly 
tautomerizes to form the keto form, and the product is as shown.

<p> The second reaction converts fumaric acid to aminosuccinic acid (aspartic
acid).
</p>
<p> The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack directly on the &beta;-carbon,
causing formation of a negative charge resonance-stabilized by the a-carbon and
carbonyl carbon and oxygen;  the oxygen is particularly suitable for
accommodating the charge.  The H<sup>+</sup> then adds to either the a-carbon or
oxygen, forming either the keto or enol, equilibrium ultimately favoring the
keto.
</p>
<p> The nucleophiles are typically the strong bases which add to the simple
carbonyls, aldehydes and ketones.  In fact these nucleophiles add to the
<i>carbonyl</i> of a,b-unsaturated <i>aldehydes</i> instead of to the carbon-
carbon double bond.
</p>
<h3>27.6 Comparison of electrophilic and nucleophilic addition</h3>

<p> Both the nucleophilic and electrophilic addition can be compared in a number
of ways:  (a) addition occurs in two steps;  (b) the first and controlling step
is formation of an intermediate ion; (c) orientation of addition and reactivity
are determined by stability of the intermediate, or rather, the stability of the
transition state leading to formation of the intermediate; (d) the stability
depends upon dispersal of the charge.
</p>
<p> Of the differences, the nucleophilic addition involves stabilization of a
negative charged intermediate, while electrophilic addition a positively charged
intermediate.  Groups attached to the carbons either activate or deactivate
either of the addition reactions, depending upon whether they are electron-
withdrawing or -releasing.
</p>
<h3>27.7 The Michael addition</h3>

<p> The <b>Michael addition</b> takes advantages of the acidity of malonic
esters or their malonic analogs to form their conjugate bases, which can now act
as nucleophiles for a,b-unsaturated compounds.

<p> The carbanionic ethyl malonate ester formed is stabilized by distribution of
the negative charge over a five-atom resonance hybrid involving both atoms of
both carbonyls and the alpha carbon.  Ethyl cyanoacetate and ethyl acetoacetate
are similar to ethyl malonate in their stabilization of the carbanion, and by
their ability to react with the unsaturated carbonyls.

<h3>27.8 The Diels-Alder reaction</h3>

<p>
The mechanism is a concerted single-step reaction most
likely, and demonstrates <i>cycloaddition</i>:  the diene has 4 p electrons
while the <q>dienophile</q> has 2 p electrons to contribute, so it is
called [4+2] cycloaddition.

<h3>27.9 Quinones</h3>

<p> Quinones are cyclic diketones (&alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated ketones) of a
rather special nature.  Oxidation of aniline with dichromate produces p-
benzoquinone, a yellow-colored substance.  In fact, all quinones are colored
because of extensive conjugation.  p-Benzoquinone can be reduced (e.g., with
SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>) to form hydroquinone (p-hydroxyphenol), which
can be oxidized (e.g., with Fe<sup>3+</sup>) to re-form the benzoquinone.  This
ease of cyclic oxidation and reduction makes them ideal oxidizing and reducing
systems in biological forms.

<h2>Chap. 28 Rearrangements and neighboring group effects.  Nonclassical ions</h2>

<h3>28.1 Rearrangements and neighboring group effects:  intramolecular
nucleophilic attack</h3>

<p> The driving force behind all carbonium ion reactions is the need to provide
electrons for the electron-deficient carbon.  Rearrangements reflect this need
to stabilize not just carbon, but any electron-deficient atom.  Carbonium ions
result from the departure of a leaving group, and this may cause a group on the
molecule to migrate, making rearrangement effectively an <i>intramolecular
nucleophilic substitution</i>.  As nucleophilic substitution, it may be
S<sub>N</sub>2-like, in which the migrating group may actually help, assist, or
push out the leaving group, called <b>anchimeric assistance</b>.  Or it may be
S<sub>N</sub>1-like:  waiting from the leaving group to disjoin at its own pace,
taking advantage of the developed charged intermediate.

<p> Some rearrangements may be considered <q>aborted</q> rearrangements:  the
near-by group bring the electrons to stabilize the carbocation, but goes back
where it came from.  This occasions what are <b>neighboring group effects</b>: 
groups near the reaction center which participate in, direct the course of, or
otherwise assist in or promote the reaction.  Indeed neighboring group effects
involve the same processes as rearrangements, but their mechanism is
<i>hidden</i>.  In a reaction such as the one illustrated below, the group G may
actually participate in the reaction by forming a <i>bridged intermediate</i> to
stabilize the carbonium until the proper nucleophile displaces it.

<p>
Neighboring group effects reveal themselves by <i>stereochemical</i>
changes or by <i>deviations</i> <i>from</i> <i>what</i> <i>is</i> <i>expected</i>
<i>in the stereochemistry of the reaction</i> or perhaps by an <i>unusually
fast rate of reaction</i>.  Examples of neighboring group effects have been
studied:  the reaction of halohydrin to form an epoxide, which is a stable and
isolable briged intermediate.

<p>
The neighboring group which will stabilize the carbonium ion
must bring with electron pairs to bond with the carbonium.  These can be
nonbonding pairs as are found on oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or bromine.  They
might be the p electrons of a double bond or in an aromatic ring.  In some
cases they might be the bonding electrons of s MOs.

<p>
Although stronger nucleophiles compete with the neighboring
group, its advantage is its proximity as a member of the molecule, making its
<q>effective concentration</q> quite high.

<h3>28.2 Hofmann rearrangement.  Migration to electron-deficient nitrogen</h3>

<p>
The Hofmann degradation of amides to form amines was briefly
discussed in the section on amines.  The reaction mechanism is believed to
occur as follows:

<p> (1) R&minus;CO&minus; + OBr<sup>&minus;</sup> &mdash;&minus;&rarr;
R&minus;CO&minus; + OH<sup>&minus;</sup>

<p>
(2) R&minus;CO&minus;+ OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &mdash;&minus;&rarr; R&minus;CO&minus;<sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O

<p>
(3) R&minus;CO&minus;<sup>&minus;</sup> &mdash;&minus;&rarr;  R&minus;CO&minus; + Br<sup>&minus;</sup>

<p>
(4) R&minus;CO&minus;  &mdash;&minus;&rarr; R&minus;=C=O

<p>
(5) R&minus;=C=O + 2 OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &mdash;&minus;&rarr; R&minus;H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>

<p> The halogenation of the amide in step 1 is known and is isolable so long as
the base is not present.  If base is present, the amine forms.  In step 2, a
proton is removed by hydroxide, a reaction promoted by the increased acidity
because of the bonding of bromine.  As the halogen leaves in step 3, the
nitrogen is now very electron deficient with only 6 valence electrons, but this
intermediate does not exist in all likelihood.  In step 4 the electron-deficient
nitrogen bond with the R group in probably what is an S<sub>N</sub>2-like
reaction, in which the R group pushes out the halide, making step 3 and 4
simultaneous.  The carbonyl carbon must similarly let loose its hold.  The
isocyanate in step 4 is sensitive to the presence of water, and forms the amides
and carbonate;  the isocyanate can be isolated if the reaction is done without
water.

<p> The reaction is essentially similar to the 1,2-shifts seen with carbonium
ions, which involve electron-deficient carbons, but the development of electon
deficicency occurs <i>while</i> migration takes place rather than
<i>before</i>.  The evidence of the mechanism is strong:  (1) many intermediates
have been isolated; (2) the intermediates used to start the reaction yield the
degradation products; (3) analogous mechanisms of other reactions support the
mechanism.

<h3>28.3 Hofmann rearrangement.  Intramolecular or intermolecular?</h3>

<p> Although the Hofmann rearrangement has been shown as <i>intra</i>molecular,
there remains a question of whether it is in fact <i>inter</i>molecular,
yielding a mutually assured product.  T. J. Prosser and E. L. Eliel carried out
the degradition using <i>m</i>-deuteriobenzamide and [<sup>15</sup>N]benzamide. 
If the intermolecular reaction occurred, the double-labeled, i.e.,
[<sup>15</sup>N]m-deuteriobenzamide, and unlabeled, i.e. just benzamide, would
be found.  They were not, so the intramolecular mechanism as shown is the
correct one.

<p>

<h3>28.4 Hofmann rearrangement.  Stereochemistry at the migrating group</h3>

<p>
The S<sub>N</sub>2-like substitution supposed as a step in the Hofmann
rearrangement has also been studied.  Optically active (+)-a-phenylpropionamide
was subjected to Hofmann degradation and produce (&minus;)-a-phenylethylamine,
which optically pure and shows <i>retention</i> of configuration (see diagram)

<p>
insert stereochemical structure middle p 890

<p>
This means that the N atom takes the same relative position
of the carbonyl C, and that the carbonyl C does not break away until it has
been attaching itself to N.  If the chiral carbon-carbonyl carbon were to break
away, the reaction would in fact become intermolecular, and the freedom would
entail considerable loss of configuration.  The actual reaction supposes the
formation of a pentavalent intermediate about the chiral carbon.

<p>
insert reaction sequence bottom p 890

<h3>28.5 Hofmann rearrangement.  Timing of the steps</h3>

<p>
Steps (3) and (4) of the rearrangement were considered to be
simultaneous.  One reason supposing such is that an intermediate with a highly
electronegative element like nitrogen possessing <i>only</i> a sextet of
electrons is hard to imagine:  it is even less stable than a primary
carbocation, which are seldom formed.

<p> Another reason is structure on the reaction rate.  Various p-substituted
benzamides were treated with OBr<sup>&minus;</sup> and their order of reactivity
depended upon the group para to -CONH<sub>2</sub>.

<p> Order of reactivity:   -OCH<sub>3</sub> &gt; -CH<sub>3</sub> &gt; -H &gt; -
Cl &gt; -NO<sub>2</sub>

<p> The order clearly demonstrates that electron-releasing group enhance the
reaction.  The migration of the alkyl group has been shown to involve
pentavalent carbon, but the migration of an aryl group requires the formation of
positive charge in the ring in order to bond with both nitrogen and the carbonyl
carbon.  This is amounts to an EAS intermediate, and electron-releasing groups
clearly activate the ring toward such reactions.

<p> If it were supposed that steps (3) and (4) were distinct, one of the steps
would be rate-determining compared to the other.  If the rearrangement step,
i.e., step 4, is slower, then halide leave with the formation of ArCON, waiting
to rearrangement.  This would entail an equilibrium in which ArCON could react
with Br<sup>&minus;</sup> to re-form ArCONBr, or more likely, to combine with
the water solvent to form ArCONHOH, which is <i>hydroxyamic acid</i>.  But this
does not form.  If therefore the leaving of the halide is the slow step, this is
contrary to the kinetic finding that rearrangement is the slow step, and N-Br
bond breaking is not.  Therefore (3) and (4) are considered <i>concerted</i>
reactions.  The migrating group undergoes electrophilic substitution, but the
nitrogen is involved in nucleophilic substitution.

<h3>28.6 Rearrangement of hydroperoxides.  Migration to electron-deficient
oxygen</h3>

<p>  24.4 showed how peroxidation of isopropylbenzene (cumene) led to formation
of cumene hydroperoxide, which could be acid-treated in water to form phenol and
acetone.  The mechanism is considered to involve a rearrangement which depends
upon formation of an electron-deficient oxygen with a 1,2-shift.

<p> Acid in step (1) protonates the hyrdroperoxide to generate a good leaving
group in H<sub>2</sub>O [step (2)], leaving the electron-deficient oxygen.  The
rearrangement then occurs as in step (3) in Hofmann style, favored by the
aromatic ring&prime;s ability to disperse the positive charge typical of EAS. 
The nucleophilic H<sub>2</sub>O returns to the carbon controlling most of the
positive charge on the alkyl side chain, and a hemi-acetal is formed in step
(4), which breaks down in step (5) normally to form the carbonyl and alcohol
which forms it:  acetone and phenol in this case.

<h3>28.7 Rearrangement of hydroperoxides.  Migratory aptitude</h3>

<p>
A difference between the hydroperoxide and Hofmann
rearrangement is that the rearrangement could have involved either one of two
groups:  either the phenyl ring, which actually migrated, or one of the methyl
groups which did not.  This ultimately would have yielded different products,
viz., methanol and acetophenone.  Since the phenol and acetone products are
formed quantitatively, this indicates the faster migration of phenyl versus
methyl.

<p> One clear reason why this is true is the transition state intermediate: 
migration of -CH<sub>3</sub> would have required a <i>pentavalent</i> carbon
bearing the positive charge, where the aryl migration produces not a tetrahedral
benzenonium ion much better able to disperse the charge and a assume not only a
comfortable geometrical transition state, but perhaps be an intermediate.

<p> Insofar as the preference of the aryl group, the substituents attached to it
affect which group, if there are many aryl groups, will migrate;  and the
particular group which migrates is one stabilized by electron-releasing groups,
as mentioned in sec. 28.5.  <i>p</i>-Nitrotriphenylmethyl hydroperoxide treated
with acid forms only phenol, and <i>p</i>-nitrobenzophenone, showing how -
NO<sub>2</sub> takes away its group&prime;s migrating potential.

<h3>28.8 Pinacol rearrangement.  Migration to electron-deficient carbon</h3>

<p> 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol, also called <i>pinacol</i>, treated with
mineral acid forms methyl tert-butyl ketone or 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone, also
called <i>pinacolone</i>, and H<sub>2</sub>O.  The dehydration of this glycol is
a model for other glycols as well, since they undergo similar dehydration and
what is called the <b>pinacol rearrangement</b>.

<p>
The mechanism is similar to most acid-base reactions
involving formation of a carbonium, which is a tertiary carbocation, one of the
most stable.  However, it is not as stable as the protonated carbonyl, so there
is a 1,2-shift which allows formation of the protonated ketone.  Release of the
H<sup>+</sup> ion accounts for the observed product.

<p> When the groups attached to the carbon bearing the -OH group differ from one
another, the rearrangement may give rise to more than one product.  The products
obtained depend therefore upon (a) which -OH group leaves in step (2) of the
mechanism, (b) which group migrates to the carbonium ion formed from step (2). 
For 1-phenyl-1,2-propanediol, either one of two carboniums may be formed in the
intermediate, either at C1 or C2.  If the carbocation is at C1, either the -H
group or the -CH<sub>3</sub> group could migrate, to form either methyl benzyl
ketone or a-phenylpropionaldehyde, resp.  If carbocation is at C2, then either
the C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>- group migrates to form a-phenylpropionaldehyde,
or -H migrates to form ethyl phenyl ketone.  The only product obtained is the
methyl benzyl ketone.

<p> This makes sense at least in the consideration of deciding which carbonium
ion is to be formed:  the C1 carbonium is a benzyl cation whereas the C2 is
2&deg;, so the carbonium should be favored at C1.  Predicting the migratory
group is not so easy.  Aryl groups migrate in preference to alkyl groups (-Ar
&gt; -R) as shown in previous sections, but when the migratory group is
hydrogen, in the pinacol rearrangement, -H can migrate in preference to -Ar or -
R, but -R can migrate in preference to -H.

<p>
One difference between the
pinacol rearrangement and the rearrangements involving electron-deficient
nitrogen and oxygen is that this rearrangement is typically S<sub>N</sub>1-like in
character whereas the others are truly concerted.  This reflects the ability of
carbon to accept the positive charge in its transition state while the more
electronegative elements show no such tolerance.

<p>
The mechanism of this reaction
permits a better study of the pinacol rearrangement, for the reason that the
carbon which will become the carbonium intermediate is certain:  it is the one
holding the amino group.   This is important when studying certain
<i>conformational effects</i> of the rearrangement.

Optically active
2-amino-1,1-diphenyl-1-propanol (the chiral carbon is at C2) is treated with
HONO to produce 1,2-diphenyl-1-propanone, which has an <i>inverted</i>
configuration, and has a lower optical purity (77% inversion,
23% racemization which is
equivalent to 88.5% inversion plus 11.5% retention).  The stereochemistry of
the reaction is typical of an S<sub>N</sub> 1  reaction with an open
carbonium intermediate.  C. Collins did the reaction, but with one
of the phenyl groups <i>stereospecifically</i> labeled with <sup>14</sup>C
(the carbon at C1 becomes chiral as well now).  Once Collins performed the
reaction, the products were degraded to determine the label.

<p>
insert projections on p 899 

<p> The phenyl group is the migrating group for the reaction, but when the
labeled phenyl group is the migratory group, the configuration at C2 is
<i>inverted</i>, whereas if the unlabeled phenyl group migrates, the
configuation at C2 is <i>retained</i>.  The reaction has been interpreted in
terms of conformational differences.  First, using Newman projections, the most
stable conformer of the formed diazonium is drawn, which is a staggered
arrangement with the hydrogen atom in between the phenyl groups&mdash;clearly
the most stable (see diagram).  The position of the labeled phenyl group in
Collins&prime; experiment must be anti to the diazonium group.

<p>
insert all of Fig. 28.1 here

<p> As the N<sub>2</sub> group leaves to form the carbonium, the <i>labeled</i>
phenyl group is <i>already</i> in the plane of the empty p orbital of the
carbonium, which is ideal for instant migration to give the <i>inverted</i>
configuration.  In fact, a <i>concerted</i> push from the labeled phenyl group
(in S<sub>N</sub>2-like manner almost certainly accounts for part of the
reaction.  However, a true open carbonium is in fact formed since the unlabeled
phenyl also migrates:  this requires a 60&deg; counterclockwise rotation to
position the unlabeled phenyl on the opposite side before the migration, which
gives a product with <i>retained</i> configruation.

<p> It is clear that the open carbonium intermediate is not very long-lived to
allow for thorough C1-C2 bond rotation, otherwise complete racemization is the
outcome.  The reaction thus demonstrates how conformation plays a role in the
product formation:  (a) how conformation at the beginning of the reaction
determines product formation, and (b) what product can be formed from an ion
where conformational rearrangements and bond rotation are constrained.  As for
(b), the 60&deg; counterclockwise rotation was constrained only by eclipsing of
the -OH and -CH<sub>3</sub> groups, whereas the clockwise rotation of 120&deg;
would have eclipsed the labeled phenyl with -CH<sub>3</sub>.  A 180&deg; bond
rotation of the carbonium ion to put the labeled phenyl group in a position to
attack from the opposite side&mdash;with labeled phenyl migration to form a
<i>retained</i> configuration (a product not observed)&mdash;would have
effectively put two bulky groups (&minus;CH<sub>3</sub> and unlabeled phenyl)
next to each other, and two relatively less bulky groups (&minus;H and
&minus;OH) next to each other:  a very unlikely state (such a bond rotation is
not required if the initial diazonium is already in a conformation to form that,
but that conformation is less stable).

<p> 2-amino-1-anisyl-1-phenyl-1-propanol is just like Collins&prime; reactant
except one of the phenyl compounds is an anisyl (p-methoxyphenyl) group instead
of labeled and unlabeled phenyl.  D. Y. Curtin.  The C1 and C2 are both chiral,
and Curtin prepared their diastereomers for reaction (see diagram)

<p>
insert structures and reaction on
p 902.

<p> Diastereomer I and its enantiomer formed products in which anisyl migrated
94% of the reaction, the pheny group 6%.  Diasteromer II and its enantiomer had
the phenyl group migrating 88% of the reaction, 12% with anisyl migration.  The
anisyl is relatively more electron-releasing than phenyl, and stabilizes
carbonium ions during EAS, but in the reaction with diastereomer II, these
electronic effects count for little as phenyl migration occurs in greater
proportion.

<p>
The  most reasonable
interpretation of Curtin&prime;s work again is the relative population of
conformers of the diazonium parent (see diagram).  The groups already in a
position and which have any migratory aptitude will be involved in the
migration.  The anisyl and phenyl groups have comparable bulk and the most
stable parent diazonium conformer will reflect this fact.

<p>
insert Fig 28.2 here

<p> It should be observed that the percentage of phenyl migration (88%) is
quantitatively identical to the results of Collins&prime; work:  this should be
so, as it reflects the competition between phenyl migration and rotation about
the carbon-carbon in which the steric groups are the same.  [The book does not
note this, but slight difference of 6% between 94% anisyl migration in one
diastereomer and 88% phenyl migration shows how a slight electronic effect may
be at play, but overall the steric forces and constraints on conformatioal
isomers are significant.]

<h3>28.10 Neighboring group effects: 
stereochemistry</h3>

<p> 3-bromo-2-butanol treated with conc. HBr produced 2,3-dibromobutane.  The
reaction is a nucleophilic substitution by bromide ion (S<sub>N</sub> 1 or
S<sub>N</sub>2).  S. Winstein and H. J. Lucas were the ones who described the
stereochemistry of this reaction, opening the door to the study of neighboring
group effects.  Using the racemic <i>erythro</i>-bromohydrin (see diagram)
enantiomers, the product was only the <i>meso</i>-dibromobutane.  When using the
racemic <i>threo</i>-bromohydrin, the products were only racemic dibromobutane
enantiomers.

<p>
insert Fig 28.3 here

<p> The products show complete <i>retention</i> of configuration, quite unusual
in substitution.  Using optically active <i>erythro</i>-bromohydrin, they
obtained optically inactive <i>meso</i>-dibromobutane; and using optically
active <i>threo -</i>bromohydin, they obtained racemic diastereomers of the meso
compound (see figure below).

<p>
insert Fig 28.4 here

<p> Winstein and Lucas interpreted their results in light of what Roberts and
Kimball had proposed earlier about Br<sub>2</sub> addition to the C=C bond: 
formation of a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate.  The mechanism must first
involve protonation of the -OH group to make it a good leaving group, then a
conformation in which the Br on the one carbon is <i>anti</i> to the leaving
group &minus;OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is to be assumed.  The Br atom will
assist the leaving of the &minus;OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> with a
S<sub>N</sub>2-like push to begin to stabilize the developing carbonium ion,
ultimately to form the cyclic bromonium intermediate.  Attack by a
Br<sup>&minus;</sup> nucleophile will occur on the opposite face at
<i>either</i> carbon, in which attack (also S<sub>N</sub>2) at one gives
retention at both chiral centers, and attack at the other gives inversion of
both chiral centers, accounting for the products.

<p>
insert mechanism middle of p 906

<p> An truly open carbonium ion intermediate would have entailed the formation
of diastereomers since rotation about the carbon-carbon bond would have
occurred.  The same process seen in rearrangements occurs here:  intramolecular
nucleophilic attack.  And rearrangement does occur as well:  in half the
molecules, the bromine forming the cyclic bromonium will migrate from one carbon
to the next.

<h3>28.11 Neighboring group effects:  rate of reaction.  Anchimeric assistance</h3>

<p> Alkyl halides (RX) can undergo a hydrolysis, and mustard gas (&beta;,&beta;-
dichloroethyl sulfide,
ClCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>&minus;S&minus;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl) is
not any different except that (a) the kinetics of hydrolysis is first order,
with rate independent of the concentration of base, and (b) hydrolysis is faster
than for ordinary 1&deg; RCl.  The kinetics suggests, of course, that rate is
controlled by an S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism, in which the molecule unimolecularly
produces the carbonium, followed by rapid reaction with the solvent or
nucleophile.  However, primary alkyl halides hardly form carbonium ions except
by brute force, normally reacting by S<sub>N</sub>2, and the sulfur atom may be
sufficiently electron-withdrawing to destabilize any carbonium.

<p> But in this case, the sulfur is sufficiently nucleophilic and in the right
position for intramolecular nucleophilic substitution; this accounts for the
faster rate of reaction.  A cationic intermediate forms, but not an unstable
1&deg; carbonium, rather a cyclic sulfonium in which every atom has the octet. 
Open-chain sulfonium ions (R<sub>3</sub>S<sup>+</sup>) are themselves reactive,
but this cyclic sulfonium is even more reactive, with a nucleophilic
H<sub>2</sub>O molecule breaking it up to the alcohol.

<p> Additional evidence comes from solvolytic reactions with substituted
cyclohexyl chlorides.  In a mixture of water and ethanol, substitution of the
2&deg; alkyl chloride to form the alcohol and the ethyl ether occurs, but the
rate can be very much enhanced if there is a particular stabilizing group on the
adjacent carbon of the cyclic molecule.  The reaction of a 2&deg; alkyl halide
in substitution is plausibly S<sub>N</sub>1, with formation of 2&deg; carboniums
and high solvent polarity favorable conditions.  If the group on the carbon next
to the C-Cl is a phenylthio ether (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>S&minus;) and is
<i>trans</i> to the -Cl, then the rate is 70,000 times greater than if there
were no group (just H&minus;).  If instead the group is <i>cis</i> to the -Cl
group, the molecule reacts more slowly (0.16 times) than the unsubstituted
cyclohexyl chloride.  The <i>trans</i> relationship is easily explained, as the
group is easily able to be in the <i>anti</i> conformation necessary for
anchimeric-assisted intramolecular nucleophilic substitution.  Notwithstanding
the inability of the cis-position phenylthio ether to assume the <i>anti</i>
position, the slowness of the reaction can be attributed to the electron-
withdrawing inductive effect taking away the ability to form the carbonium ion
more easily.

<p> Solvolysis of the alkyl esters of sulfonic acids with acetic acid is a well-
known reaction, producing the alkyl acetates.  Acetate, although itself weak
base, is nonetheless a much stronger base than the sulfonates, like tosylate
(Ts) and brosylate (Br).  Loss of the sulfonate ions leaves a carbonium which
forms an ion pair with acetate, eventually to combine with the solvent.

<p class="center">
R&minus;OTs + HOAc/NaOAc &mdash;&minus;&rarr; R&minus;OAc

<p> 2-acetoxycyclohexyl tosylate heated in acetic acid causes formation of the
diacetate of 1,2-cyclohexanediol.  The reactant can exist as diastereomers (in
either the <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i> relationship).  Both the <i>cis</i> and
<i>trans</i> tosylates yield the <i>trans</i> diacetate.  With the <i>cis</i>
reactant there is apparently an <i>inverted</i> configuration; with the
<i>trans</i> reactant, a <i>retained</i> configuration.  Two facts bring the
reaction into view:  (a) reaction of optically active <i>trans</i> acetate-
tosylate isomer yields a racemic mixture of the <i>trans</i> diacetate
enantiomers; (b) the <i>trans</i> tosylate reacts 800 times faster than the cis
isomer.

<p>
insert stereochemical cyclic structures middle p 910

<p> The results show that in the <i>trans</i> isomer, the neighboring acetoxy
group, being in the suitable <i>anti</i> conformation, assists the leaving of
the tosylate by back-side intramolecular attack to form the <i>acetoxonium
ion</i>, a 5-membered cyclic structure dispersing the positive charge mostly
around the carboxylate group.  A nucleophilic HOAc can then attack at either
carbon with equal probability to account for the racemic mixture of <i>trans</i>
diacetates.

<p> The <i>cis</i>-acetoxy group contributes no such neighboring group effect,
not being able to assume a conformer suitable for back-side attack, hence the
rate is slower than for <i>trans</i>.

<p> In comparing the rates of reaction, it has already been explained that the
<i>trans</i> isomer is 800 times faster than <i>cis</i>, but it is only one-
third as fast as the unsubstituted tosylate.

<p>
Despite anchimeric assistance which often makes the <i>trans</i>
isomers react much faster than the unsubstituted, here the greater effect is
electronic, with the inductive electron-withdrawing of the acetoxy
substituent.  Hence the potential for anchimeric assistance does not always
translate into a faster rate of reaction.  Although S<sub>N</sub>2-like,
the attack by the acetoxy group has considerable S<sub>N</sub>1 character. 
Cyclic haloniums and protonated epoxides show considerable S<sub>N</sub>1
character as well in the ring-opening process;  according to the microscopic
reversibility principle, if ring-opening has S<sub>N</sub>1 character,
so must ring-closing.

<h3>28.12 Neighboring group effects.  Neighboring aryl</h3>

<p> Solvolysis of 3-phenyl-2-butyl tosylate with HOAc forms the acetate ester,
3-phenyl-2-butyl acetate.  The reactant and product have two chiral centers and
can exist as two racemic modifications.  When the racemic <i>erythro</i> tosyl-
phenyl diasteromer is treated with HOAc, the racemic erythro acetoxy-phenyl
diastereomer is obtained.  With threo racemic enantiomers as reactants, the
acetolytic products are the threo racemic acetoxy-phenyl enantiomers. 
Solvolysis is completely stereospecific with <i>retention</i> of
configuration.

<p>
insert Fig 28.7 here

<p> Use of optically active <i>threo</i> isomer, however, yields the racemic
<i>threo</i> enantiomers.  D. J. Cram (1949) has interpreted the results by
saying that the pi electron cloud of the neighboring phenyl makes it a decent
nucleophile, and is involved in back-side attack to push out the tosylate.  A
bridged-cyclic <i>benzenonium</i> intermediate forms, distributing the positive
charge in the ring, an intermediate postulated in mechanisms discussed
previously.  The reaction finishes with an opposite-side attack by a HOAc
nucleophile on either carbon to account for the products.

<p>
A problem with the mechanism was not so much the formation
of the intermediate bridged ion&minus;although this was questioned,
too&minus;but that, if the reaction receives anchimeric assistance from the
phenyl group, the rate of acetolysis should be enhanced, as it was found that
the unsubstituted sec-butyl tosylate undergoes solvolysis at the same rate as
the 3-phenyl-2-butyl tosylates:  formolysis a little faster, acetolysis
somewhat slower.

<p> A bridged benzenonium must be necessary to explain why other isomers are not
formed as well, as would be with an open carbonium.  As for reasons why the
rates were not different, it was supposed that the rate-determining step is the
leaving of tosylate, followed by a very rapid bridging before C-C bond rotation
could occur.  H. C. Brown suggested that the intermediate ion is not a bridged
one, but open carbonium ions in rapid equilibration, with the phenyl group on
one, then the other.

<p> Some evidence of mechanism has now been presented.  It was believed that
2&deg; carboniums of their own accord with little assistance from the solvent,
as for 3&deg; carboniums.  Using special secondary substrates with structures
which prevent solvent assistance, P. Schleyer (1971) has shown that ordinary
secondary substrates require a great deal of solvent assistance (see  14.17). 
Cram&prime;s proposed mechanism appears correct then:  the aryl group <i>can</i>
give anchimeric assistance by formation of brigded ions.  Competition is not
between aryl-assisted solvolysis and unassisted solvolysis, but rather between
aryl-assisted and <i>solvent</i>-assisted solvolysis.  And anchimeric assistance
does not need to proceed at an accelerated rate, where the bridged cation or
open cation can form with aryl assistance or an equally strong solvent
assistance.

<p> If the neighboring aryl groups contain strongly electron-withdrawing
substituents, the reaction products are normal, namely alkenes plus inverted
ester, and the rate of solvolysis is the expected one for supposing open cation
formation slowed by electron-withdrawing inductive effects.  With use of
increasingly electron-releasing subsituents (p-Cl, m-CH<sub>3</sub>, p-
CH<sub>3</sub>, p-CH<sub>3</sub>O), the rate increases more than expected if
only inductive effects were operating.  For example, the rate data
determinations for reaction of 3-aryl-2-butyl brosylates show that m-tolyl
calculates to assist in 73% of the reaction, with 68% of the product having a
retained configuration.  For p-methyl, the calculation is 87%, found to be 88%. 
And for p-methoxyphenyl, calculated to be 99%, found to be 100%.  The amount of
anchimeric assistance given depends upon how nucleophilic the neighboring group
is and on how badly the assistance is needed.  The more nucleophilic the
solvent, the more assistance <i>it</i> gives, with the neighboring group
participating hardly at all.  The stability of the carbonium ion is a factor,
for if it forms readily (as for benzylic or 3&deg; cations), little assistance
is need by either solvent or neighboring group.

<h3>28.13 Neighboring group effects:  nonclassical ions</h3>

<p>
Meerwein (1922) first postulated carbonium ion
rearrangements to explain why camphene hydrochloride is converted to isobornyl
chloride.

<p>
insert reaction structures on top p 915 here; incorporate
structures below

<p>
The reaction seems easy to explain.  Chloride ion (Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>) is lost
to form a 2&deg; cation, in which a 1,2-alkyl shift occurs to form another 2&deg;
cation, and then chloride reattaches to that cation.  However the chloride
attaches from only one side to form the <i>exo</i> chloride (isobornyl
chloride) and not the <i>endo</i> chloride (bornyl chloride).  Moreover,
camphene undergoes solvolysis thousands of times faster than tert-butyl
chloride.

<p>
Three findings were reported by Winstein (1949):  (i)  <i>exo</i>-norbornyl
brosylate and its enantiomer, along with <i>endo</i>-norbornyl brosylate and
its enantiomer, form upon acetolysis only the <i>exo</i>-norbornyl acetate and
its enantiomer; (ii) optically active exo-norbornyl brosylate forms racemic
exo-norbornyl acetate; (iii) the reaction of exo-norbornyl brosylate to
acetolysis is 350 times faster than for the <i>endo</i> brosylate.

<p>
insert structures and reactions to p. 916 and second from

<p>
Winstein interpreted these results as the formation of a
nonclassical bridged ion in which brosylate leaves and the carbonium is a
hybrid of two structures in which the bond is between carbons C1-C6 (C2 with
positive charge), C2-C6 (C1 positive), and C1-C2 (C6 positive).  The bridging
C6 is actually pentavalent.  With the optically active <i>exo</i> brosylate,
there is a back-side S<sub>N</sub>2-like attack by C6 on C2 to push out the
brosylate (see diagram below).  The <i>endo</i> brosylate geometry permits
no such attack; rather, its rate depends upon the brosylate leaving in
S<sub>N</sub>1-like manner to form the open
cation followed by rapid conversion to the bridged ion.  The nucleophile HOAc
can attack either at C1 or C2, but because it must attack from the opposite
face, only the <i>exo</i> acetoxy product is possible.  The bridged ion
intermediate must be supposed, otherwise an open cation would allow formation
of the <i>endo</i> diastereomer as well.

<p>
insert mechanistic structures and reactions bottom and 2nd
from bottom p. 916 and in fig 28.9.

<p> The difference of this reaction with all others previously shown is that
<i>saturated</i> carbon is a neighboring group using its &sigma; electrons to
give anchimeric assistance to expelling the leaving group, to form a bridged
intermediate with a pentavalent carbon.  Such ions with delocalized bonding s
electons involved are <i>nonclassical </i>ions.

<p> H. C. Brown (1962) has said that the mechanism was too readily accepted, and
was not necessarily wrong, but not necessarily right.  He offered alternative
explanations including the rapidly equilibrating open carbonium ions as was
postulated for the cyclic benzenonium ion.  He suggested that substitution
occurs on the exo face because the endo face lies in a fold and is screened from
attack.  He also suggested that rate differences between endo and exo brosylate
may result from a steric hindrance experienced by the brosylate on the endo
side.  The 6000-fold higher ethanolysis of camphene HCl compared to tert-butyl
chloride has been attributed to the anchimeric assistance-bridged ion
intermediate model, but Brown maintains this is the wrong standard for
comparison, showing that a number of (3&deg;) cyclopentyl chlorides <i>also</i>
react faster than tert-butyl chloride.  The faster rate of reaction he has
attributed to <i>relief of steric strain</i>, certainly present in the bicyclo
camphene with its 5-membered bicyclo rings.  On ionization, chloride ion is lost
and the methyl group on the <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon moves into
the plane of the ring:  four non-bonded interactions disappear, two for chlorine
and two for methyl.

<p> Evidence of a bridging nonclassical ion is now in.  G. Olah (1970) reported
isolation of a stable norbornyl cation prepared in SbF<sub>5</sub>-
SO<sub>2</sub>.  The data from analysis by pmr, cmr, and Raman spectra suggest
the existence of a nonclassical ion with delocalized s electrons.  The norbonyl
cation is fully bridged.  Substituted norbonyl molecules show a different
character:  2-methylnorbonyl cation forms some bridging with some s electron
delocalization, and 2-phenylnorbonyl cation has no bridging, the open benzylic
cation quite stable.  (The bridging in the 2-methylnorbornyl cation appears to
result not from the C6-C7 bond, but rather the C6-H bond;  Olah suggests the
back lobe of the C-H bond overlaps the <i>p</i> orbital of C2.)

<h2>Chap. 29 Molecular orbitals.  Orbital symmetry</h2>

<h3>29.1 MO theory</h3>

<p> MOs are orbitals not centered about the various nuclei, but orbitals
centered about all nuclei in the molecule.  Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations
will not be made since they are enormously complicated, but the results of
calculations will be addressed.  The concepts of <i>phase</i> and orbitals which
are either <i>bonding</i> or <i>antibonding</i> are discussed.  Moreover, the
importance of <i>orbital symmetry</i> is especially important in seeing why
organic reactions occur.

<h3>29.2 Wave equations.  Phase</h3>

<p> <i>Standing waves</i> or <i>stationary waves</i> a vibrating waves with an
unchanging waveform and may represent a natural property of the energy in a
piece of matter:  plucking a guitar string provides a certain wave motion of a
particular frequency and no other.  The waveform has a certain <i>amplitude</i>
(&phi;), representing the maximum displacement either <i>negative</i> or
<i>positive</i>.  Where the amplitude of the wave has zero value is the
<i>node</i>, and the plane of symmetry at the nodes are called the <i>nodal
plane</i>.  The upward and downward displacements of the waves correspond to
opposite <i>phases</i> of the wave.  Superimposition of the waveform with
another of the same frequency but aligned such that the sum of the waves cancel
each other at all points to zero value, are <i>out of phase</i> waveforms.

<p> The differential equation describing the wave is called a <i>wave
equation</i>.  Solutions of this equation give the amplitude, &phi;, as a
function, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>), of the distance along the wave, <i>x</i>.  This
function is a <i>wave function</i>.  Electron waves are described by a wave
equation, and the wave functions which are acceptable solutions of this equation
give the amplitude, &phi;, a function not of a single coordinate but of three
coordinates to describe motion in three dimensions.  These electron wave
functions are <i>orbitals</i>.

<p> Electron waves, like string waves, can have nodes.  The p orbital has a
nodal plane between its two lobes, in which the lobes are of opposite phase,
being + or &minus;, and not referring to any charge properties of the orbital. 
The amplitude or wave function, &phi;, <i>is</i> the orbital.  However, it is
the square of the amplitude, &phi;<sub>2</sub>, which has physical meaning,
being the probability of finding an electron at any particular place.  The
geometric figures used to describe the physical presence of orbitals typically
reflects the place where an electron can be found 95% of the time.

<h3>29.3 MOs.  LCAO method</h3>

<p> In forming bonds, electrons of opposite spin will pair and are attracted by
both nuclei in the bond, making electrostatic attraction between nuclei a
significant factor in bond-making.  The qualitative model used in QM to describe
MOs is <b>the method of linear combination of atomic orbitals</b>
(<b>LCAO</b>).  The MO is the result of a mathematical operation on atomic
orbitals.

<p class="center">
&psi; = &phi;<sub>A</sub> + &phi;<sub>B</sub>

<p> where &psi; is the MO, &phi;<sub>A</sub> is atomic orbital A, and
&phi;<sub>B</sub> is atomic orbital B.  When the electron is near atom A, &psi;
resembles &phi;<sub>A</sub>, when near atom B, &psi; resembles
&phi;<sub>B</sub>.

<p>
The combination is considered <i>effective</i>, namely the
MO is more stable than the AOs, only if AOs &phi;<sub>A</sub> and
&phi;<sub>B</sub>:

<p>
(a) overlap to a considerable extent;

<p>
(b) are of comparable energy;

<p>
(c) have the same symmetry about the bond axis.

<p> If there is no considerable overlap, the energy of &psi; is equal to that of
&phi;<sub>A</sub> or that of &phi;<sub>B</sub>; if the energy of
&phi;<sub>A</sub> and &phi;<sub>B</sub> are quite different, the energy of &psi;
is essentially that of the more stable AO.  Insofar as symmetry, the relative
phases of any lobes and their disposition in space is of consequence.  Hydrogen
fluoride is a useful model (see diagram).

<p>
insert Fig 29.3 here

<p> The bond can result from overlap of the hydrogen s orbital with the fluorine
<i>p</i> orbital.  Three <i>p</i> orbitals are available, and only one has the
proper orientation for the greatest overlap.  The other two (one of them
diagrammed on the right) also overlap <i>both lobes</i>, but the mathematical
representation of the + and &minus; lobes predict the <q>cancelling out</q> of
the bond overlap, and therefore no bonding is likely.  This dependence of
overlap on phase is critical to predicting chemical bonding.

<h3>29.4 Bonding and antibonding orbitals</h3>

<p> The LCAO method actually calls for <i>two</i> wave equations describing
<i>two</i> MOs:  one a <i>bonding</i> MO and the other an <i>antibonding</i>
MO:

<p>
&psi;<sub>+</sub> =
&phi;<sub>A</sub> + &phi;<sub>B</sub> bonding orbital: 
<i>stabilizes molecule</i>

<p>
&psi;<sub>&minus;</sub> = &phi;<sub>A</sub> &minus; &phi;<sub>B</sub>     
antibonding orbital:  <i>destabilizes molecule</i>

<p>
The addition of two s orbitals to form a s bonding orbital
can be done, or likewise the substraction can be done to depict the s*
antibonding orbital.

<p>
insert figures p 929

<p> The need for one MO for every AO (conservation of orbital number) can be
seen easily, since one AO can bring two electrons, two bring four, and only two
electrons are allowed in an MO as for an AO.  The different combinations of s
and <i>p</i> orbitals to form variously either s or p bonding and antibonding
combinations is depicted.  The phase relationships are also shown.

<p>
insert Fig 29.4 on p 930 here

<p> In bonding MOs, the orbital region is between nuclei (where bonding is
expected) so that electrons can be attracted by both nuclei; the increase in
electrostatic attraction lowers the energy of the system.  In antibonding MOs,
electron density is away from the area in between nuclei, resulting in nuclei
seeing each other, creating a charge repulsive effect, and leading to bond
breaking.  An additional MO is created in the scheme in which electrons are
neither bonding or antibonding, but rather <i>nonbonding</i>.  They do not
contribute to bond strengthening or weaking in the <i>ground state</i>.

MOs can be mathematically <q>mapped out</q> from
their AO equations, then the number of available electrons assigned to them. 
The assignment of electrons to MOs, as for AOs, follows the Pauli exclusion
principle and Hund&prime;s rule.

<p>
Considering the p bonding orbitals of ethylene, the two p AOs of the carbons
can be mathematically combined to form a two MOs, one p bonding MO and one p
antibonding MO, which has a higher relative energy for reasons given in the
last section. Each carbon contributes one p electron, and in this case, both
are paired with opposite spins in the p bonding MO, if the molecule has the
lowest energy state, the <i>ground state</i>. The designation is &pi;<sup>
2</sup>.

<p>
The jump of one electron to the p antibonding MO has a certain energy which
corresponds to a certain wavelength of the EM spectrum (<i>E</i>=<i>hc</i>
/&lambda;, normally in the UV), and a jump corresponds to an <i>excited
state</i>. The electron is the antibonding MO, still of opposite spin, and the
designation is now &pi;&pi;*, indicating one electron in the bonding and one in
the antibonding MO.

<p>
insert fig 29.5

<p>
With 1,3-butadiene, four p AO from each carbon mean four MOs for the p
electrons.  The ground state is
&psi;<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>&psi;<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, with
y<sub>2</sub> representing a somewhat higher energy state for isolated &pi;
orbitals, or rather &psi;<sub>1</sub> representing a delocalization of the
entire conjugated system and a lower energy state.  The effect of light
absorption to raise the configuration to
&psi;<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>&psi;<sub>2</sub>&psi;<sub>3</sub>  in the first
excited state is depicted.

<p>
insert Fig 29.6 on p. 932

<p>
The allyl system, its cation, free radical, and anion are also depicted. Three
component <i>p</i> AOs are brought by the three carbons to give rise to
&psi;<sub>1</sub>, &psi;<sub>2</sub>, and &psi;<sub>3</sub> MOs. &psi;<sub>1</sub>
is considered bonding, and &psi;<sub>3</sub> is antibonding. &psi;<sub>2</sub>
MO involves the end carbons, a node at the middle carbon and has the same
energy as an isolated <i>p</i> orbital: it is considered nonbonding. The
electron assignments put all electrons in either the bonding MO or nonbonding
MO for whatever form the allyl system is in: cation, free radical, or anion.
The important thing here is that the bonding &psi;<sub>1</sub> MO encompasses
all three carbons and is therefore more stable than one encompassing only two.
It is what gives the allyl system its special stability.

<p>
insert fig 29.7 on p 933

<p>
As for benzene, it brings 6 component <i>p</i> AOs which means 6 <i>p</i> MOs.
The three most stable are all bonding MOs, and they get all of the available
electrons. The LCAO method gives one of the bonding MOs, &psi;<sub>1</sub>, the
lowest relative energy, with distribution of the electron pair around all 6
carbons, where &psi;<sub>2</sub> and &psi;<sub>3</sub> MO have equal energy and
distribute over the molecule as well.

<h3>29.6 Aromatic character.  The H&uuml;ckel 4<i>n</i> + 2 rule</h3>

<p> The low energy of a molecule presented by its ability to delocalize charge
or electron density is an important factor explaining stability of the
molecule.  But delocalization is not enough to explain why certain molecules
having a conjugated pi system with a certain number (2, 6, 10, etc.) of pi
electrons obtain a greater stability.  H&uuml;ckel proposed the 4<i>n</i> + 2 p
electron rule in 1931 after extensive study in using LCAO.

<p> The cyclopentanedienyl system is a useful model.  It has five
sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbons with five component <i>p</i> AOs, producing
five MOs.  The lowest energy MO is one encompassing all five carbons.  Two
degenerate orbital pairs are higher in energy, but still bonding MOs, and the
other two with still higher energy are antibonding MOs.  The cation has four
electrons:  two are paired in the lowest bonding MO; the other two distributed
into the degenerate bonding MOs of higher relative energy.  With the free
radical, an additional electron is paired with either one of the electrons in
the degenerate bonding MOs.  But with the anion, all three bonding orbitals are
filled.  This state represents maximum bonding and maximum stability.  The
configuration of cyclopentadienyl anion, benzene, and cycloheptatrienyl cation
are entirely the same, and this accounts for the <i>aromaticity</i> of the
molecules.

<p>
insert figure 29.9 and combine with elements of figure 29.10
as well.

<p> The same depiction for a 2 &pi;-electron system can be drawn.  Cyclopropenyl
cation (aromatic with its two &pi; electrons) bring 3 component <i>p</i> AOs,
therefore 3 MOs, two of which are degenerate antibonding, and one bonding MO. 
The free radical and anion forms are forced to put electrons into antibonding
MOs, an unstable state.

<p>
insert Fig 29.11 on p 937

<h3>29.7 Orbital symmetry and the chemical reaction</h3>

<p> Bonding results from maximal overlap of orbitals, and that orbitals be of
the same phase.  Chemical reactions proceed more easily when the energy barrier
is not too high.  To a large extent, the occurrence of reactions is controlled
by <b>orbital</b> <b>symmetry</b>.  Of the people contributing to the
development of this concept are K. Fukui of Japan and H. C. Longuet-Higgins of
England, and in 1965 in a series of papers published by R. B. Woodward and R.
Hoffmann.

<p> Orbital symmetry effects are observed in <i>concerted</i> reactions,
reactions in which several bonds are made or broken simultaneously.  Woodward
and Hoffmann formulated what are called <i>symmetry-allowed</i> and <i>symmetry-
forbidden</i> <q>rules,</q> which apply only to concerted-type reactions.  A
symmetry-forbidden reaction is one in which the concerted mechanism is
difficult, or if it occurs at all, it will be by a concerted mechanism which is
symmetry-allowed or which is a nonconcerted step-wise mechanism.

<h3>29.8 Electrocyclic reactions</h3>

<p>
Conjugated polyenes are known to undergo isomerization
reactions under the influence of heat or light which involve cyclization and
decyclization.  1,3,5-hexatriene can form 1,3-cyclohexadiene:  in the
cyclization, one double bond disappears and the double bonds shift their
positions to form a still conjugate system.  Cyclobutene can be opened to form
1,3-butadiene.  These reactions are classified <b>electrocyclic reactions</b>. 
When substituted molecules are used, the stereochemistry is of particular
interest.

<p> 3,4-Dimethylcyclobutene can be interconverted to 2,4-hexadiene;  the
cyclobutene can exist as cis or trans, whereas the hexadiene can exist as
cis,trans; cis,cis; or trans,trans.  The <i>cis</i> cyclobutene produces only
one of the three (the cis,trans hexadiene) and the <i>trans</i> cyclobutene a
different isomer (the trans,trans hexadiene).  These reactions are therefore
completely stereospecific.  Moreover, photochemical cyclization of the cis,trans
diene produces a different cyclobutene than the one from which the diene is
formed by the thermal (heat-promoted) ring opening.

<p>
insert fig 29.12 but draw cyclobutenes in 3-D fashion

<p> Interconversions of the dimethylcyclohexadienes and the 2,4,6-octatrienes
are also stereospecific, with the thermal and photochemical reactions producing
a different stereochemistry (see diagram below).  In addition the triene-
cyclohexadiene interconversions are <i>opposite</i> to that of the diene-
cyclobutene interconversions.  For the thermal reactions, the cis methyl groups
in the cyclobutene become cis and trans in the diene, whereas the cis methyl
groups in the cyclohexadiene are trans and trans in the related triene.

<p>
insert entirety of fig 29.13 here

<p> The exact stereochemistry of electrocyclic reactions depends upon (a) the
number of double bonds in the polyene and (b) whether the reaction is
photochemical or thermal.

<p> Cyclization of the open chain depends upon two &pi; electrons of the polyene
forming the new &sigma; bond of the cycloalkene.  Which two electrons are used
depends upon the <b>highest occupied molecule orbital</b> (<b>HOMO</b>) <i>of
the polyene</i>.  Electrons in this orbital may be considered to the
<q>valence</q> electrons of the molecule, inasmuch valence electrons are
available in bonding in an atom;  they are less tightly held and more easily
manipulated in a reaction.

<p> A disubstituted butadiene, RCH=CH&mdash;CH=CHR, has as its HOMO the
&psi;<sub>2</sub> MO (see  29.5) because it is a conjugated diene; its ground
state is depicted below.  These electrons do not require a significant energy
push to bring them to the excited state for bond breaking and making.  Bond
formation requires p orbital overlap of carbons C1 and C4 of the diene.  In
order to bring the lobes into proper position for s bonding, bond rotation about
the C1-C2 and the C3-C4 bonds must occur.  Bond rotation of two bonds in the
same direction may be said to be <b>conrotatory</b>, whereas bond rotation of
the two bonding in opposite directions is <b>disrotatory</b>.

<p>
insert figures at bottom of p 941, and then figure 29.14 on
p 942 and 29.15 on p 943

<p> For the conrotatory motion, lobes of the same phase would be brought
together in the overlap, and bonds are formed.  Disrotatory motion bring lobes
of opposite phase together, and antibonding properties obtain.  When this motion
is considered specifically for the cis,trans- and trans,trans-hexadienes to form
the cyclobutenes, the predictions are identical with the actual products.

<p> Why does photochemical cyclization produce the opposite effect?  Recalling
that butadiene in the excited state causes an electronic transition from
&psi;<sub>2</sub> to &psi;<sub>3</sub>, in which &psi;<sub>3</sub> is an
antibonding MO.  Since there is an electron in &psi;<sub>3</sub>, it is now the
HOMO, and the orbital symmetry is different.  Indeed the orbital symmetry of the
terminal carbons is opposite to that of the ground state butadiene, when
&psi;<sub>2</sub> is the HOMO.  Hence, a <i>disrotatory</i> motion will bring
together lobes of the same phase, with reversed stereochemistry.

<p>
insert fig 29.16 on p 943 along with figures on top of p 945.

<p>
With thermal cyclization of a disubstituted hexatriene,
RCH=CH&mdash;CH=CH&mdash;CH=CHR, the HOMO for the ground state is &psi;<sub>3</sub>.  The orbital
symmetry and electronic configuration and relative energy levels is diagrammed
just below.

<p>
insert fig 29.17 here

<p> The terminal carbons in this case are have their lobes positioned such that
<i>disrotatory motion</i> in the heat-induced cyclization causes overlap of the
bonding phases, and therefore the trans,cis,trans-octatriene forms the cis-
cyclohexadiene, where as the trans,cis,cis-octatriene forms the trans-
cyclohexadiene.  This is compared to the <i>conrotatory motion</i> of the
hexadiene in forming the cyclobutadiene.

<p>
Insert fig 29.18 here

<p> In the excited state, as induced by a photochemical process, the
y<sub>4</sub> orbital is the HOMO, the terminal carbons of the polyene have
different symmetry, and a conrotatory motion is necessitated in cyclization.

<p> The Woodward-Hoffmann rules for the electrocyclic reactions are summarized
in the table.  As the number of pairs of p electrons in the polyene increases,
the relative symmetry about the terminal carbons in the HOMO alternates
regularly.  Also symmetry in the HOMO of the first excited state is always
opposite to that in the ground state.

<h3>29.9 Cycloaddition reactions</h3>

<p>
In the Diels-Alder reaction, a diene reacted with a
dienophile to form a cyclohexene, described as a [4+2] cycloaddition since one
reactant required 4 p electrons, the other 2 p electrons.  The reaction can
take place easily, often spontaneously with only a little heat required.

<p> In the reaction the diene was presented to the dienophile with the <i>s-
cis </i> conformation, in which the single bond is rotated so that both double
bonds are presenting the terminal carbons to the dienophile.  The reaction was
also shown in such a way that a <i>concerted</i>, <i>syn</i>-addition to the
dienophile was occurring, with the terminal carbons of the conjugated diene
forming new single bonds in which one of the pi bonds from the diene contributed
one bond, and the pi bond in the dienophile contributing the other.

<p> Another fact is that the reaction occurs with <i>endo</i> addition in
preference to <i>exo</i> addition.  This refers to the position of other
unsaturated groups which may be present in the dienophile (for example
&minus;CO&minus;O&minus;CO&minus;) preferring to lie nearer the developing
double bond in the diene (see figure immediately below).

<p>
insert fig. 29.19 on p 949

<p> [2+2] cycloadditions can be obtained, such as two molecules of ethylene
forming cyclobutane.  However, the reaction is via diradicals and not under
thermal conditions producing the concerted mechanism.  Thus photochemically-
induced [2+2] cycloadditions are common.  On the other hand, photochemically
induced [4+2] cycloaddtions are difficult to obtain.

<p>
In cycloaddition, two new s bonds are to be formed by using
p electrons of the reactants.  The electrons in the HOMO of one molecule will
have to overlap with the HOMO of the other, but since the HOMO of the other
already has two electrons, it becomes necessary to find an empty orbital, and
the most stable empty orbital, viz., the <b>lowest unoccupied molecular</b>
<b>orbital</b> (<b>LUMO</b>).  In the transition state, stabilization is a
result of overlap between the HOMO of one reactant and the LUMO of the other.

<p>
insert Fig 29.20 on p 950 here

<p> The electronic configuration and orbital symmetry states for alkenes and
dienes has been shown in a previous section.  Two combinations are possible: 
either the HOMO of butadiene (&psi;<sub>2</sub>) with the LUMO of ethylene
(&pi;*), or the HOMO of ethylene (p) and the LUMO of butadiene
(&psi;<sub>3</sub>).  In either case, overlap of orbitals of the same phase
occurs, and so does bonding (illustrated above).  It should not be forgotten
that jumps to the LUMO are photochemically necessary.

<p> If thermal [2+2] cycloaddition of ethylene were desired, the picture of
orbital overlap of the HOMO, &pi;, of one ethylene would not show the proper
phase overlap with the LUMO, &pi;*, another ethylene.  The interaction is
antibonding and the concerted reaction can not occur.  The photochemical [2+2]
cycloaddition is symmetry-allowed, since the HOMO of the excited state (&pi;*)
does show overlap with the LUMO of the ground state (&pi;*) of another molecule,
and the interaction results in bonding.

<p>
insert figs 29.21 and 29.22 here

<p> Special terms apply for the bond-making and -breaking on one face of a
molecule in concerted reactions; this same face reaction is called
<b>suprafacial</b>.  If bonds are being broken and formed with the two carbons,
but at opposite faces, this type of reaction is <b>antarafacial</b>.

<p>
insert figure at bottom p 951

<p> Most reactions discussed up to now have been concerned with suprafacial-type
reactions.  In the thermal [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, although symmetry
forbids a supra,supra concerted reaction, symmetry should allow a supra,antara
reaction, although the geometric result clearly makes such a reaction
impossible.

<p>
insert fig 29.23 here

<p> However, where rings are big enough, the supra,supra and supra,antara
processes can occur, leaving orbital symmetry to control how the reaction
occurs.  The Woodward-Hoffman rules are extended.  These cycloadditions are also
reversible (cycloreversions) and must follow the same symmetry rules as for
cycloadditions.

<h3>29.10 Sigmatropic reactions</h3>

<p> A concerted reaction which involves migration of a group on the framework
simultaneously with bond (usu. p bond) shifting or rearrangement is called a
<b>sigmatropic reaction</b>.

<p>
insert figure of 1,3 and 1,5 and 3,3 sigmatropic reaction on p 954

<p> The reactions can be designated to show the distance the group is traveling
on the framework, from the carbon it is at (carbon #1) to a carbon five atoms
down (carbon #5), which is [1,5].  The <i>Cope rearrangement</i> of 1,5-
hexadienes, the reaction is a [3,3] sigmatropic reaction, where the group G is
the &pi; framework itself.

<p> In the transition state of the reaction, there must be an overlap of one
HOMO on one component and the HOMO of the other.  In the allylic radical, the
migrating group is passed from one end of the radical to the other, so the end
carbons become signficant.  It can be seen that the orbital symmetry about the
carbons in the framework alternates from C1 to C3 to C5, etc.  In the simplest
case involving the migration of hydrogen, the sigmatropic shift can be
suprafacial or antarafacial (see below).

<p>
insert all figs on p 955 here

<p> The transition state requires a 3-center bond between the hydrogen s orbital
and the lobes of the <i>p</i> orbitals of the terminal carbons.  Whether a
suprafacial or antarafacial shift occurs depends upon orbital symmetry.  In
particular, antarafacial shifting is difficult for small molecules because of
the geometrical constraints on such twist;  such twisting goes against the need
to make all atoms coplanar during charge delocalization in the reaction.  For
this reason, [1,3] and [1,5] sigmatropic shifts are generally <i>supra</i>
shifts.  Hence hydrogen migration is only going to occur with [1,5] shifts and
not with [1,3] shifts.

<p>
insert figs top and middle of p. 956

<p> Experience proves the theory here:  [1,3] hydrogen sigmatropic shifts do not
occur, and the thermally-induced [1,5] hydrogen shifting does occur with
CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CH&mdash;CH=CD<sub>2</sub>, in which
CH<sub>2</sub>=CH&mdash;CH=CH&mdash;CHD<sub>2</sub> is isolated.  With
photochemically-induced reactions, it is the <i>reverse</i>:  [1,3] hydrogen
shifting occurs, but not [1,5].

<p>
When 3-deuteurioindene (I) is heated, it is known to cause a

<p>

<p> Formation of structure III can be accounted for by a [1,3] shift of H.  A
[1,3] shift of D would not do anything but regenerate structure I.

<p>
insert fig middle p 957

<p> If the <i>p</i> orbitals of the benzene ring were included in the shifting,
a [1,5] shift of D can be obtained, placing at the right position, yielding an
unstable nonaromatic structure.  A [1,5] shift of hydrogen yields the stable
aromatic product and structure II is accounted for.

<p>
insert fig bottom p 957 and show additionally the [1,3] H
shift

<p> If <i>carbon</i> is the migrating group, stereochemistry comes into play. 
Shifts occurring in which the same lobe of carbon which was bonded to one part
of the frame is used to bond the other means the configuration is retained.  If
however, the opposite lobe (and therefore opposite face) is used, inversion of
configuration occurs as in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.  For [1,3] and [1,5]
carbon shifts, geometry prevents antarafacial movements, which means suprafacial
[1,3] migrations demand inversion and [1,5] shifts demand retention.

The diamond is the ultimate polycyclic aliphatic system, but
another allotropic form of elemental carbon, <i>graphite</i>, is a polycyclic
fused ring aromatic system.  X-ray analysis shows carbons arranged in layers,
with each layer a continuous network of planar hexagonal rings.  The bonding in
all carbons is strong, the 1.42 A bond length only slightly longer than in benzene
(1.39 A).  The layers are 3.4 A apart, being held togther by weak forces, and
probably accounting for why graphite has a <q>greasy</q> feel and comes
apart.

<h3>30.2 Nomenclature of naphthalene derivatives</h3>

<p>
Naming monosubstituted naphthalenes is comparatively easy,
since only two isomeric forms are possible.  The prefixes of either 1- or 2-,
or a- or b-, are used interchangably.

<h3>30.3 Structure of napthalene</h3>

<p>
Naphthaline is aromatic as is benzene, meaning it is not
subject to simple addition reactions but rather EAS to preserve the ring
structure.  All carbons are sp<sub>2</sub>-hybridized, coplanar (for that reason)
and an aromatic sextet of p electrons exist in each ring, with both rings sharing
a common pair.  The resonance stabilization shown by combustion of naphthalene
has been determined to be 61 kcal/mol.

<p>
X-ray analysis has shown that all C-C bonds are not
equivalent.  The C1-C2 bond is shorter (1.365 A) than the C2-C3 bond (1.404
A).  There are three possible resonance structures making up the hybrid of
naphthalene, and when these 3 structures are drawn, the difference in bond
lengths is explained.  In two of the structures, the C1-C2 bond is a double
bond (known to be shorter in length than a single bond), in the third structure
a single bond;  the C2-C3 bond is a double bond in only one resonance
structure, a single bond in the other structures.  Hence, C1-C2 bonds have more
double bond character than C2-C3 bonds.  (Although two rings with circles in
them are drawn for naphthalene structures suggesting some equivalence of all
carbons in the molecule, the intent is to show the aromaticity of the molecule
and has no other purpose.)

<h3>30.4 Reactions of napthalene</h3>

Naphthalene is usually obtained as purified from its natural

<h3>30.5 Oxidation of napthalene</h3>

<p>
Naphthalene undergoes oxidation and reduction actions more
easily than benzene.  Benzene&prime;s resonance stabilization is 36 kcal/mol. 
The 61 kcal/mol stabilization of naphthalene shows that only 25 kcal/mol is
sacrificed by destroying the ring.  Oxidation usually stops though with the
extra ring, leaving substituted benzenes.

<p>
In the presence of O<sub>2</sub> gas and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> 
catalyst and high temperature (500&deg;), phthalic
anhydride can be obtained.  This reaction is important since coal tar contains
much naphthalene and phthalic anhydride is in high demand.

<p>
Preparing the carboxylic acid derivatives of naphthalene
such as by the oxidation of 2-methylnapthalene to its acid is not as simple as
adding the oxidizing reagents.  In CrO<sub>3</sub> and HOAc at room temperature,
naphthalenes oxidize
the second ring to form quinones (for naphthalene, 1,4-naphthoquinone in 40%
yield; 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone in the case of the 2-methylnaphthalene, 70%
yield).  Oxidation of methyl side chains is a problem.

<h3>30.6 Reduction of napthalene</h3>

<p> Chemical reducing agents can reduce naphthalene unlike benzene, which is
unreactive.  One double bond in naphthalene is reduced when treated with sodium
metal in ethanol at 78&deg;, the product 1,4-dihydronaphthalene.  The second
double bond in the ring is reduced to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (also called
<i>tetralin</i>) with Na metal in isopentyl alcohol at 132&deg;.  Further
reduction of tetralin to decalin (C<sub>6</sub>H <sub>18</sub>) involves
reduction of the benzene ring which remains after chemical reduction, and this
certainly requires catalytic hydrogenation under very vigorous conditions.

<h3>30.7 Dehydrogenation of hydroaromatic compounds.  Aromatization</h3>

<p> Compounds like 1,4-dihydronaphthalene, tetralin, and decalin have the right
carbon skeleton for forming aromatic rings, but have too many hydrogens.  These
compounds are classed as <b>hydroaromatic compounds.</b>  Rather than reduction
of aromatic ring systems, a preferred process is to dehydrogenate these
saturated rings to produce the aromatic systems, the process called
<b>aromatization</b>.

<p> Typically the catalysts used in hydrogenation are used in dehydrogenation as
well.  The hydrogenation-dehydrogenation process is certainly reversible, the
catalyst being used only to lower the energy barrier involved in the reaction. 
Since the reaction is reversible, an equilibrium obtains.  The equilibrium is
shifted either by decreasing or increasing concentration of one factor in the
reaction.  Hydrogenation is promoted with high pressures of H<sub>2</sub> gas; 
dehydrogenation by sweeping away formed H<sub>2</sub> with an inert gas like
CO<sub>2</sub>.  In one elegant modification of the H<sub>2</sub> removal
process, 1-(a-naphthyl)-cyclohexene is aromatized to 1-phenylnaphthalene by
incubating in the presence of chloranil (tetrachlorobenzoquinone), which readily
accepts H<sub>2</sub>  to form tetrachlorohydroquinone.

<p>
insert 2nd reaction on p 975

<p> The stabilization resulting from aromatization is often strong enough to
force the removal of certain groups other than hydrogen.  Abietic acid (a
substance in rosin) aromatizes to form 1-methyl-7-isopropylphenanthrene by
eliminating a methyl group at the point of ring fusion (the so-called <i>angular
methyl group</i>).

<p>
insert reaction bottom p. 975

<p> Aromatization is also done in the presence of selenium, sulfurm and organic
disulfides (RSSR), with hydrogen removed to form hydrogen selenide, hydrogen
sulfide, and thiols.  Many polynuclear aromatics are synthesized from their
open-chain forms first by ring closure, then by aromatization.  Naturally
occurring hydroaromatic compounds are analyzed by aromatization and the
aromatized product compared to the tables.  This reveals structures (e.g.
cholersterol aromatized by Se and heat to Diels&prime; hydrocarbon:  3&prime;-
methyl-1,2-cyclopentenophenanthrene).

<h3>30.8 Nitration and halogenation of naphthalene</h3>

<p> Nitration and halogenation occur exclusively in the 1- or a-position. 
Chlorination and bromination occur so readily that a Lewis acid catalyst is
unnecessary.  Other groups are prepared at the 1-position starting from the 1-
nitronaphthalene:  reduction to the amine, oxidiation to diazonium, then either
introduction of the halide, nitrile, or reaction with aromatics to form azo
compounds.  With the 1-halonaphthalene, synthesis of the Grignard leads to
formation of alcohols, ketones, etc.

<h3>30.9 Orientation of electrophilic substitution in naphthalene</h3>

<p> Why the EAS reactions occur at the a-position can be ascertained if it is
remembered that EAS involves formation of a carbonium ion intermediate, and
formation of the <i>most stable</i> carbonium intermediate.  In nitration, the
nitronium NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is the electrophile.  If nitration is at
the alpha position, structures of the carbonium ion intermediate can be drawn
and some conclusion about their stabilities made.  <i>All possible</i> resonance
structures should be drawn.  In the figure, the possible resonance structures
for attack at both alpha and beta positions is shown.  Two of the alpha-attack
resonance structure are relatively stable since the aromaticity of the other
ring is preserved in their intermediate;  for beta attack, only one resonance
structure shows such ability.

<p>
insert resonance structure drawings on p 978

<p> Because of this difference in the number of stable resonance structures
forming the hybrid, the alpha attack is considered to be preferable.  This rule
about the <i>number of stabilizing structure</i> contributing to the transition
state or a true intermediate holds in considerations of the orientation of a
chemical reaction.

<h3>30.10 Friedel-Crafts acylation of naphthalene</h3>

<p> Depending upon the solvent used, naphthalene can be acetylated with acetyl
chloride in presence of AlCl<sub>3</sub>;  if CS<sub>2</sub> or something like
tetrachloroethane is the solvent, acetylation is predominantly at the
<i>alpha</i> position;  if nitrobenzene is the solvent, substitution is
<i>beta</i>.  The effect of nitrobenzene is attributed to its forming a complex
with the acid chloride and AlCl<sub>3</sub> which attacks the roomier
<i>beta</i> position.

<p> This acetylation (and sulfonation in the next section) allows access to beta
derivatives of naphthalene.  For example treatment of 2-acetonaphthalene (methyl
b-naphthyl ketone) with hypohalite (NaOCl, 60-70&deg;) is the best route to b-
naphthoic acid (88% yield; chloroform is another product).

<p> Naphthalene can also be treated with succinic anhydride (in
AlCl<sub>3</sub> and nitrobenzene) and this attaches to both the alpha and beta
position to form 4-(1-naphthyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid [b-(1-naphthoyl)propionic
acid] and 4-(2-naphthyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid [b-(2-naphthoyl)propionic acid],
resp.

<p> F-C alkylations have little success:  the high reactivity of naphthalene
causes side reactions and polyalkylations.  Alkylnaphthalenes are obtained
typically by acylation and ring closure.

<h3>30.11 Sulfonation of naphthalene</h3>

<p> Naphthalene can be sulfonated using concentrated
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.  At 80&deg;, mostly the alpha substituted 1-
naphthalenesulfonic acid is formed.  When the temperature is raised to 160&deg;,
it is converted to the 2-isomer.  Even after the sulfonation has occurred at the
1-isomer, raising the temperature to 160&deg; converts it to the 2-isomer,
showing that an equilibrium exists.  The reversibility of sulfonation reactions
has been discussed previously (Sec. 11.12).

<p> The reason for this is rate vs. equilibrium.  Since sulfonation at the a-
position involves formation of a more stable intermediate carbonium ion, its
formation is more rapid.  However, attack by H<sup>+</sup>  at the sulfonated
position is also rapid, therefore desulfonation is as rapid as sulfonation. 
Sulfonation at the b-position is slower, too, but so is desulfonation.  This
rate vs. equilibrium has been shown with 1,2- and 1,4-addition to conjugated
dienes (Sec 8.22), Friedel-Crafts alkylation of toluene (12.11), and sulfonation
of phenols (see prob. 24.13, p. 803).

<h3>30.12 Naphthols</h3>

<p> As with phenols, naphthols can be made from corresponding sulfonic acids
with alkali.  They can also be made from naphthylamines in very high yields by
direct hydrolysis under acidic conditions, a reaction which does not work in the
benzene series but is superior to hydrolysis of diazonium salts.

<p>
insert both reactions on bottom p 981

<p> a-Substituted naphthalenes are often prepared by a sequence of reactions
which lead back to the nitro compound.  Preparation of b-substituted
naphthalenes cannot start with nitro compounds since nitration is not possible
as the beta position.  For all b-substituted compounds, it is better to
sulfonate to make 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, then prepare the 2-naphthol.  From
the 2-naphthol, b-napthylamine is made by the <b>Bucherer reaction</b> by
heating the naphthol under pressure with ammonia and ammonium sulfite, a
reaction which is not useful with the benzene series except in rare cases.  From
the b-naphthylamine, the diazonium can be produced, which can be used to make
halides, nitriles, azo compounds, etc.

<p>
insert series on p 982

<h3>30.13 Orientation of electrophilic substitution in naphthalene derivatives</h3>

<p> Naphthalene undergoes substitution at chiefly the a-position, and
sulfonation and F-C acylation at either the a- or b-position.  To what position
will a second group attach?  Such orientation is difficult to assess, since 7
positions are possible, whereas only 3 are possible with benzene.  The rules are
as follows:

<p>
(a) An activating (electron-releasing) group tends to direct
further substitution into the same ring.  Activating groups at position 1
direct further substitution to position 4, and to a lesser extent to position
2.  Activating groups at position 2 direct substitution to position 1.

<p>
(b) A deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group tends to
direct further substitution into the other ring:  at an a-position in nitration
or halogenation, or at an a- or b-position (depending upon temperature) in
sulfonation.

<p>
The reactions below provide examples:

<p>
insert all reactions on p 983

<p>
These rules do not always hold in sulfonation, because the
reaction is reversible and at high temperatures tends to take place at a
b-position.

<p>
The mechanism involved in directing orientation incorporate
the same rules seen with attack of naphthalene.  Relative stabilities of
carbonium ion intermediates, resonance structures tending to preserve the
aromatic sextet in one ring.  In general, when the electrophile comes to the
ring, it is that ring which will assume the positive charge, so
electron-withdrawing groups will destabilize any attack of the ring to which
they are attached; electron withdrawing groups will stabilize same-ring
attack.  In the case of electron-releasing groups at position 1, resonance
structures can be drawn when substitution is at the 2- or 4- position which
place the + charge on the carbon to which the electron-releasing group is
attached, hence making it the more stable.  This is true whether the activating
group releases by induction (as with methyl) or resonance (as with hydroxyl). 
Electron-releasing groups at the 2-position direct strictly to the 1-position
since its resonance structure is quite stable;  substitution at the 3-position
requires a resonance structure breaking up the aromatic sextet of the other
ring.

<h3>30.14 Synthesis of naphthalene derivatives by ring closure.  The Haworth
synthesis</h3>

<p>
Typically benzene derivatives are produced starting from
benzene or one of its substitutes.  One rarely ever attempts to follow a
synthetic route which creates the benzene ring.  In some cases a ring system is
generated by a two stage process of <b>ring closure</b> (or <b>cyclization</b>)
and then <b>aromatization</b>.  The <b>Haworth synthesis</b> is an important
route in preparing naphthalene derivatives.  All of the steps are familiar: 
F-C acylation to start the second ring, a Clemmensen reduction, then another
F-C acylation to close the ring, another Clemmensen reduction, then
aromatization.

<p>
insert fig 30.2 on p 987

<p>
Substituted naphthalenes can be prepared from a few
approaches:

<p>
(a) A substituted benzene rather than benzene is used, then
the naphthalene is synthesized from it.  Toluene, anisole, or bromobenzene or
any group G = &minus;R, &minus;X, &minus;OCH<sub>3</sub> is the substituted benzene.  The F-C
acylation with succinic anhydride should place it mostly <i>para</i> to the
group.  The continued Haworth sequence produces a b-substituted naphthalene.

<p>
insert sequence middle p 986

<p>
(b) The intermediate cyclic ketone (an a-tetralone) is
treated with a Grignard reagent or organolithium to produce and alkyl or aryl
group into the a-position.  Dehydration with hot acid leads to the alkenyl
benzene, which can be quickly aromatized with Pd catalyst and heat to form an
a-alkylnaphthalene

<p>
insert sequence bottom p 986

<p>
(c) The keto acid obtained after the first F-C acylation of
a substituted benzene can be esterified, then treated with a Grignared, which
reacts with the keto group to form the tertiary alcohol.  Dehydration, ester
hydrolysis, then catalytic hydrogenation produces the substituted benzene, and
Haworth synthesis can proceed to make the 1,6-disubstituted naphthalene

<h3>30.15-.16 Nomenclature and structure of anthracene and phenanthrene
derivatives</h3>

<p>
The positions of the important substitutable carbons on
anthracene and phenanthrene are shown:

<p>
insert structures bottom p 988

<p>
Anthracene can assume 4 possible resonance structure. 
Phenanthrene can be drawn as a resonance hybrid of 5 possible resonance
structures.  Heats of combustion analyses show a resonance energy stabilization
of 84 kcal/mol for anthracene, 92 kcal/mole for phenanthrene, the difference
probably due to the extra resonance structure which can be drawn.

<h3>30.17 Reactions of anthracene and phenanthrene</h3>

<p>
Anthracene and phenanthrene are even less resistant to
oxidation than naphthalene.  Both are oxidized to their 9,10-quinones and
reduced to their 9,10-dihydro compounds.  The attack at the 9,10 positions is
predictable since it leaves two benzene ring structures intact, with a
sacrifice of only 12 kcal resonance energy (84&minus;2<span style='font-family:
Symbol'> </span>36) for anthracene, and 20 kcal (92&minus;2<span
style='font-family:Symbol'> </span>36) for phenanthrene.  (With phenanthrene,
the structure remains conjugated, estimated anywhere from 0 to 8 kcal
stabilization, so the actual sacrifice may be less than 20 kcal.)

<p>
insert all structure/reactions on p 990

<p>
Although both compounds undergo EAS, the reactions are of
little use since mixture and polysubstitution products abound.  Derivatives are
usually obtained by electrophilic substitution of the 9,10-anthraquinone or
9.10-dihydrophenanthrene.

<p>
Bromination for either phenanthrene or anthracene takes
place at the 9-position.  Without the Lewis acid catalyst in the phenanthrene
reaction, the reaction is <i>addition</i> rather than <i>substitution</i> to
form the 9,10-dibromo-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene.  The mechanism of attack at the
9-position is easy to understand:  a stable carbonium intermediate is formed in
which either a nucleophile can add to the carbonium to make the addition
product or a proton can be lost to form the substitution product.  The
sacrifice of energy is adding has already been shown to be minimal.  In all the
mechanism preserves two of the three aromatic rings.

<h3>30.18 Preparation of anthracene derivatives by ring closure. 
Anthraquinones</h3>

<p> The derivatives of anthracene are seldom prepared from anthracene itself. 
Typically a ring closure to form a reducible <b>anthraquinone</b> is typical. 
The reduction is done with Zn and alkali, but is seldom done since
anthraquinones are very important compounds.  Reaction first involves F-C
acylation of benzene with phthalic anhydride to form the o-benzoylbenzoic acid,
and ring closure to form the 9,10-anthraquinone is done with sulfuric acid and
heat.

<p>
insert reaction sequence bottom p 992

<p>
Where monosubstituted benzenes, such as toluene, are used,
F-C acylation is to the para position typically, ultimately to yield a
2-substituted anthraquinone.  (Blocked para positions can direct the F-C
acylation to the ortho position.

<p>
Instead of benzene, a polynuclear compound such as
naphthalene can be used to give a product with three or more rings.

<p>
insert sequence 2nd from top on p 993

<p>
The intermediate o-aroylbenzoic acid produced after F-C
acylation can first be reduced at the keto group (with Zn and alkali) prior to
ring closure.  With ring closure, <i>anthrone</i> (a keton group in the 9
position) is formed, which reacts with Grignard reagents and is dehydrated to
form 9-alkylanthracenes.

insert reaction sequence 3rd from top p 993

Anthraquinoid dyes like alizarin, indanthrene Golden Yellow
GK, and indanthrone, are very important commercial products.

<h3>30.19 Preparation of phenanthrene derivatives by ring closure</h3>

<p>
Starting with naphthalene instead of benzene, the Haworth
synthesis can be used to synthesize substituted phenanthrenes.  Naphthalene can
be acylated in AlCl<sub>3</sub> with
succinic anhydride at either the 1- or 2-positions, the keto group reduced via
Clemmensen, attachment of the other end to the 1- or 2-position which was not
substituted before, then reduction of the keto and then aromatization to yield
a phenanthrene.  The second acylation step of the 2-substituted naphthalene to
the 3-position does not occur, which would form the anthracene.

<h2>Chap. 31 Heterocyclic compounds</h2>

<h3>31.1 Heterocyclic systems</h3>

<p>
Any <b>heterocyclic</b> ring is one with a ring made up of
more than one kind of atom.  In the systems studied so far, nearly all members
of the ring are carbon and are thus homocyclic or alicyclic.  Other ring
systems are numerous however.

<p>
insert all structures on p 1002

<p>
insert table 31.1 on p 1003

<p>
Some heterocyclic compounds have already been encountered: 
cyclic anhydrides, cyclic imides, lactones, lactams, cyclic acetals of
dihydroxy alcohols, the solvents <i>dioxane</i> and <i>tetrahydrofuran</i>.

<p>
Three-membered rings have been encountered:  epoxides,
aziridines;  the fleeting but important carbonium ion intermediate structures
<i>cyclic halonium</i> and <i>cyclic sulfonium</i>.

<p>
Typically heterocyclic reagents are used as <i>protecting
groups</i>:  the 2-oxazoline ring and the temporary formation of
<i>tetrahydropyranyl</i>(<i>THP</i>) <i>esters</i>, which are resistant to
alkali but cleaved easily with acid.

<p>
A large number of heterocyclic compounds are naturally
occurring:  penicillin G, thiamine, reserpine (a tranquilizer), nicotine,
copper phthalocyanine, and chlorophyll <i>a</i>.

<h3>31.2 Five-membered rings.  Structure of pyrrole, furan, and thiophene</h3>

<p>
The three simplest five-membered heterocycles containing a
single hetero atom are pyrrole, furan, and thiophene.  One might judge them to
be conjugated dienes with an amine function, an ether, and a thioether, and
undergoing reactions typical of these functions.  However, except for a
tendency to undergo addition, they do not have the expected properties.

<p>
Rather these compounds and their derivatives undergo
electrophilic substitution:  nitration, sulfonation, halogenation, F-C
acylation, and even the Reimer-Tiemann reaction and coupling with diazonium
salts.  Heats of combustion put an estimate of 22-28 kcal/mol resonance
stabilization, somewhat less than for benzene (36 kca/mol) but far greater than
for conjugated dienes (~3 kcal/mol).  Hence these compounds are clearly
aromatic.

<p>
However, when the structure of pyrrole is analyzed, it can
be shown that all of the ring atom lie in a plane:  the four
sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized
carbons necessarily force the nitrogen into this position.  The carbons bring 1
p electron to the ring in the pi structure (4 total) but nitrogen brings a
nonbonding pair in one of its <i>p</i> orbitals.  That make the 4<i>n</i> +
2 H ckel <i>six</i> needed for aromaticity.

<p>
As a result of the nitrogen&prime;s nonbonding pair
contributing to the aromatic character of the ring, this nonbonding pair is no
longer available in the typical acid-base chemistry characteristic of amines in
general.  Pyrrole is a very weak base in fact, with a <i>K</i><sub>b</sub> ~ 2.5
&times; 10<sup>&minus;14</sup>.  In representing pyrrole structure, it
becomes necessary to represent nitrogen with a positive charge as its electron
pair is distributed to all other four carbons, which can be represented as
carbanions in the structure.

<p>
Furan and thiophene can be similarly analyzed in terms of
their aromaticity.  Each brings a nonbonding pair in one its <i>p</i> orbitals to
form an aromatic sextet.  As a result, their resonance structures show the ring
bearing a distributed negative charge and the hetero atom positively charged.

<h3>31.3 Source of pyrrole, furan, and thiophene</h3>

<p>
Pyrrole and thiophene can be obtained in small amounts from
coal tar.  During fractional distillation, thiophene (b.p. 84&deg;) is collected in
the benzene fraction (b.p. 80&deg;);  benzene typically contains a 0.5% thiophene
contamination and must be especially treated if thiophene-free benzene is to be
used.

<p>
Industrial synthesis of thiophene is possible from <i>n</i>-butane and sulfur.

Furan is more readily obtained from the decarbonylation
(elimination of carbon monoxide) of <b>furfural</b> (furfuraldehyde), which is
prepared from the treatment of oat hulls, corncobs, or rice hulls with hot
HCl.  Pentosan (polypentosides) present in the plant materials are hydrolyzed
to pentoses, and are caramelized (dehydrated) to the furfural.

<p>
Although substituted pyrroles, furans, and thiophenes can be
made from substitution, some unique reactions can be made from ring closure of
open-chain compounds.  Acetonylacetone (2,5-hexadione) can be closed in
phosphorus pentoxide, ammonium carbonate, or phosphorus pentasulfide to make
the furan, pyrrole, and thiophene, resp.

<h3>31.4 Electrophilic substitution in pyrrole, furan, and thiophene. 
Reactivity and orientation</h3>

<p>
The EAS reactions which these heterocycles undergo have
already been listed.  In fact these rings are much more reactive than benzene,
resembling the very active benzene derivatives (amines and phenols) in
undergoing such reactions as the Reimer-Tiemann, nitrosation, and coupling with
diazonium salts.  The substitution occurs primarily at the 2-position.

<p>
In some of the reactions, the high reactivity means that relatively weak Lewis
acid catalysts can be used:  stannic chloride in the F-C acylation of
thiophene.  Pyrrole and furan are sensitive to protic acids, the former
undergoing polymerization, the latter ring-opening, so the sulfonating
agent must be modified.

<p>
In understanding EAS in the aromatic heterocycles, again the
more stable carbonium ion intermediate is likely to form.  If attack were to
occur at the 3-position yields two possible resonance structures in the
positively charged ring intermediate.  The charge is distributed to the
nitrogen and the 2-carbon in these intermediates.  Attack at the 2-position
produces <i>three</i> possible resonance structures in the intermediate, with
positively charged nitrogen or carbons at positions 3 and 5 being involved. 
Because of the more favorable entropy of charge distribution, attack at
position 2 is favored.  In both the attacks at the 2- or 3-position, there is
one resonance structure in which every atom has the octet (the one in which
nitrogen assumes the positive charge), a very stable arrangement, which is why
pyrrole resembles anilinium ion in its reactivity.

<h3>31.5 Saturated five-membered heterocycles</h3>

<p>
The aromatic heterocycles have their fully saturated analogs. 
Pyrrole can be catalytically reduced with H<sub>2</sub>, Ni at 200-250&deg;
to form <i>pyrrolidine</i>. 
Furan can be similarly reduced but at a lower temperature (50&deg;) to
form <i>tetrahydrofuran</i>. 
Thiophene poisons most catalysts, so its saturated analog,
<i>tetrahydrothiophene</i>, is prepared from open-chain compounds.

<p>
Of course, saturation destroys the aromaticity of the ring. 
But the saturated rings acquire the properties typical of the functional groups
present which were missing with aromatization:  pyrrolidine is a typical
secondary aliphatic amine which is significantly basic; tetrahydrofuran is a
typical alphatic ether, and tetrahydrothiophene a typical aliphatic thioether. 
THF is used in reductions with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> in preparation of ArMgCl,
and in hydroborations. 
Oxidiation of tetrahydrothiophene produces <i>tetramethylene sulfone</i>
(of <i>sulfolane</i>), which is a solvent.  Pyrrolidine is a secondary amine
used in preparing enamines.

<h3>31.6 Six-membered rings.  Structure of pyridine</h3>

<p>
Of the many possible six-membered aromatic heterocycles,
only <b>pyridine</b> is considered because of its widespread use.  Evidence of
pyridine&prime;s aromatic nature comes from its flatness, with bond angles of
120&deg;.  All bond lengths between atoms in the ring are the same:  the four C-C
bonds and the two C-N bonds.  It resists addition and prefers EAS-type
reactions.  Heat of combustion analysis shows a 23 kcal/mol resonance
stabilization.

<p>
Pyridine does differ from pyrrole in its aromaticity.  It is
a much stronger base.  In determining the contributions of different electrons
to the pi ring, and the drawing of the sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized orbitals,
an unshared pair is held in one of the sp<sub>2</sub> orbitals. 
This means that it is not necessary for this
nonbonding pair to contribute to ring aromaticity;  it can easily participate
in acid-base chemistry, so pyridine is therefore a stronger base than pyrrole.

<h3>31.7 Source of pyridine compounds</h3>

<p>
Pyridine is isolated from coal tar.  It is found also with a
number of methylpyridines, the most important being the monomethyl pyridines,
or <i>picolines</i>.  Oxidation of picolines (either the 2-, 3-, or
4-picolines) produces pyridine carboxylic acids.  The 3-isomer is <i>nicotinic
acid</i> or <i>niacin</i> and is a vitamin.  The 4-isomer, <i>isonicotinic acid</i>,
has been used in the hydrazide form (isonazid) in the treatment of
tuberculosis.

<p>
Pyridine derivatives are in such demand that a synthesis
involving ring closure and using acreolin and ammonia has been developed.

<h3>31.8 Reactions of pyridine</h3>

<p>
Pyridine is an aromatic and a base.  Typically it undergoes
both EAS and NAS, and it is also a base.

<h3>31.9 Electrophilic substitution in pyridine</h3>

<p>
In EAS, pyridine resembles a highly deactivated benzene
derivative.  It undergoes nitration, sulfonation, and halogenation only under
very vigorous conditions, but does not undergo F-C reactions at all. 
Substitution is at the 3- (b-) position.

<p>
insert the reactions bottom p 1013

<p>
The reactivity and orientation can
be accounted for in the intermediate structures of EAS.  If attack is at the 4-
(or &gamma;-)position of pyridine, three resonance structures can be drawn with
positive charge at the two positions <i>ortho</i> and at the <i>para</i>
(nitrogen) position.  This last resonance structure is especially unstable: 
while N is willing to share electrons and assume a positive charge, it is
surrounded by only a sextet of electrons, a resonance structure untenable for a
highly electronegative atom such as nitrogen.  Attack at the 2-position (this
time nitrogen is <i>ortho</i>) follows the same reasoning in drawing the
resonance structures.

<p>
Attack at the 3-position at least
affords that in all resonance structures, every atom has the octet.

<p>
However, all of these resonance
structures are less stable because of nitrogen&prime;s inductive effect which
intensifies the positive charge in the ring intermediate, making it much less
reactive than benzene.

<h3>31.10 Nucleophilic substitution in pyridine</h3>

<p>
Knowing that pyridine resembles a benzene with deactivating
properties, it is known that what is deactivating in EAS is usually activating
insofar as NAS.

<p>
In fact, the reactivity of pyridine to NAS is so great that the powerfully basic
hydride ion, :H<sup>&minus;</sup>, can be displaced.  One is amination by sodium
amide (<b>Chichibabin reaction</b>) and another alkylation or arylation
of organolithium compounds.

<p>
The mechanism involves stabilizing the developing negative
charge in the ring.  With nucleophilic attack at the 4-position, two carbanion
and one nitroanion resonance intermediates can be drawn, the latter one putting
the negative charge on the nitrogen.  Being quite electronegative, the latter
resonance structure is especially stable, and every atom has an octet.  As
before, attack at the 2-position resembles attack at the 4-position.  With
3-position attack, every intermediate is a carbanion, and while stable, the
most stable resonance structure puts the negative charge on the nitrogen.  For
this reason, 2- and 4-position attacks should be more favorable to 3-position
attacks.

<h3>31.11 Basicity of pyridine</h3>

<p>
Pyridine is intermediate in its basicity (pK<sub>a</sub> = 5.36), with
pyrrole (pK<sub>a</span> =
0.4) and most amines (pK<sub>a</sub> ~ 10). 
Why is pyridine such a weaker base than aliphatic amines?

<p>
Benzene is a stronger acid that an alkane, shown by its
ability to displace an alkane from its salts;  hence phenyl anion,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, is a
weaker base than the alkyl ion, R<sup>&minus;</sup>.

<p class="center">
R:<sup>&minus;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>  + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>:H
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;((&mdash;
R:H + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>:<sup>&minus;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>

<p>
Similarly, acetylene is a stronger acid than benzene,
meaning acetylide ion is a weaker base than the phenyl anion.

<p class="center">
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>  + HC&equiv;C:H
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;((&mdash;
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>:H + HC&equiv;C:<sup>&minus;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>

<p>
The relative acidities and basicities can be shown as:

<p>
Relative acidity:   HC&equiv;C:H
&gt; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>:H &gt; R:H

<p>
Relative basicity:  HC&equiv;C:<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>:<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; R:<sup>&minus;</sup>

<p> The difference in basicity may result from the nature of the carbanions.  In
the alkyl, phenyl, and acetylide ions, the unshared pair is found in an
sp<sup>3</sup>, sp<sup>2</sup>, and sp orbital.  The successively increasing s
character tends to pull the electrons toward the carbon, making them less
available in for an acid.  The increasing p character, with the p lobe more
extended from the nuclear center, puts the electron pair at a greater distance
allowing for interaction.  Hence electron pairs held in sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals
would be expected to be more basic than those in sp<sup>2</sup> orbitals.  That
is the difference between the aliphatic amines, with their nonbonding pairs in
sp<sup>3</sup>  orbitals, and pyridine, its nonbonding pair in
sp<sup>2</sup> orbital.

<p>
As weak a base as it is, it can still react with RX (like CH<sub>3</sub>I) to form a
quaternary ammonium salt.

<h3>31.12 Reduction of pyridine</h3>

<p> Pyridine can be catalytically hydrogenated to form its aliphatic
heterocyclic, <b>piperidine</b>.  (H<sub>2</sub>, Pt, HCl, 25&deg;, 3 atm are
the conditions).  Piperidine (pK<sub>a</sub> = 11.3) has the basicity typical of
a secondary aliphatic amine.  Pyridine and piperidine are common in naturally
occurring alkaloids, such as nicotine, strychnine, cocaine, and reserpine.

<h3>31.13 Fused rings.  Quinoline.  The Skraup synthesis</h3>

<p>
Quinoline (pK<sub>a</sub> = 4.48) is a benzene ring and pyridine ring fused as shown.

<p>
insert quinoline structure on p 1018

<p>
It can be found in coal tar.  While certain derivatives are
prepared by substitution of quinoline, the ring closure of a benzene derivative
is the typical method.

<p>
The <b>Skraup synthesis</b> is the typical method for
preparing substituted quinolines.  Quinoline itself is obtained by a complex
mixture of aniline reacting with glycerol and nitrobenzene in the presence of
concentrated sulfuric acid and ferrous sulfate.

<p>
insert reaction top 1019

<p>
The mechanism appears to have the following steps.

<p>
(1) Glycerol by the action of hot sulfuric acid is
<q>caramelized</q> (dehydrated) to form the a,b-unsaturated acrolein.

<p>
insert reaction

<p>
(2) Acrolein undergoes a nucleophilic addition in the
presence of aniline to form a b-(phenylamino)propionaldehyde

<p>
insert reaction

<p>
(3) Ring closing occurs via an EAS when the a proton
attaches to the carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde, givign a carbonium ion
character to the carbonyl carbon.  This substitutes ortho to the activated
anilium-substituted ring.  The intermediate is an alcohol which dehydrates in
the presence of the acid to form a 1,2-dihydroquinoline.

<p>
insert reaction

<p>
(4) Three of the 1,2-dihydroquinoline can be oxidized by
nitrobenzene in the acid environment to form quinoline (the other products: 
aniline and 2 H<sub>2</sub>O).

<p>
insert reaction

<p>
The ferrous sulfate is apparently there to moderate what
would otherwise be a very vigorous reaction.

<p>
The components of the basic synthesis can be modified to produce a wide variety
of quinoline derivatives.  Aniline and crotonaldehyde can make 2-methylquinoline
(quinaldine). 3-nitro-4-aminoanisole + glycerol can be used to make 6-methoxy-8-
nitroquinoline.  2-aminonaphthalene + glycerol can
be used to produce 5,6-benzoquinoline (1-azaphenanthrene).

<p>
The nitrobenzene can be replaced by arsenic acid, H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>,
which usually produces a less violent reaction.  Vanadium pentoxide is
sometimes added as a catalyst.  The sulfuric acid can be replaced by
phosphoric acid or other acids.

<h3>31.14 Isoquinoline.  The Bischler-Napieralski synthesis</h3>

<p>
Isoquinoline (pK<sub>a</sub> = 5.04) is a benzene ring and pyridine ring
fused in a different way.  Derivatives of isoquinoline can be made via the
<b>Bischler-Napieralski synthesis</b>.  Acyl derivatives of b-phenylethylamine
can be cyclized by treatment with acids (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)
to produce a dihydroisoquinoline, which can be aromatized.

<h1>Part III  Biomolecules</h1>

<h2>Chap. 33 Fats</h2>

<h3>33.1 The organic chemistry of biomolecules</h3>

<p class=MsoNormalIndent>The study of biology at the molecular level is called
biochemistry.  The study of biochemistry must be <i>built upon</i> a study of
the fundamentals of organic chemistry.  The principle classes of biomolecules: 
fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids.  Structures of these
molecules is complex on several levels:  sequence of functional groups,
configuration, and conformation.  It is the application of organic chemistry on
more complex substances.

<h3>33.2 Occurrence and composition of fats</h3>

<p>
Biochemists have defined <i>lipids</i> as a set of
biomolecules which are insoluble in water and extractable from cells with
organic solvents of low polarity (ether, chloroform).  This includes the
steroids and terpenes.

<p>
Fats are the main constituents of storage fat cells in
plants and animals, acting as an energy reserve.  Liquid fats are <i>oils</i>,
and many vegetable fats are liquid at room temperature.

<p>
Chemically fats are the carboxylic acid ester derived from a single polyalcohol,
<b>glycerol</b>, and are known as <i>glycerides</i>.  More specifically, they
are <i>triacylglycerols</i>.  The composition of different fats and oils is
given in the table below to demonstrate the complexity of
fats.

<p>
insert table 33.1 on p 1057

<p> A number of unsaturated acids exist and all the double bonds are invariably
in a <i>cis</i> configuration:  oleic acid,
CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)CH=CH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>7</sub>COOH;  linoleic
acid,
CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>CH=CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH=CH(CH<sub>2</sub
>)<sub>7</sub>COOH;  linolenic acid,
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH=CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH=CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH=CH(CH<sub>2
</sub>)<sub>7</sub>COOH.  The unsaturation of these molecules <i>with this
particular stereochemistry</i> is of vital biological importance:  it lowers the
m.p. of the fat.  The long-chain, non-branching nature of fatty acids allows
them to fit quite well in a lattice and form a solid phase;  the better they
fit, the stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the m.p.  With
unsaturation in the <i>trans</i>- configuration, there is no significant change
in the linear conformation assumed by the fat.  With a <i>cis</i> configuration,
a significant bend is obtained and the hinders the ability of the fat to settle
into a solid phase lattice.

<h3>33.3 Hydrolysis of fats.  Soap.  Micelles</h3>

<p> Making soap is one of the oldest chemical process, although not older than
producing alcohol.  German tribesmen in Caeser&prime;s time boiled goat tallow
in potash leached from the ashes of wood fires, and carried out a process done
by modern soap manufacturers:  hydrolysis of glycerides.  The alkaline
hydrolysis of fat yields glycerol and salts of fatty acids.  Soap made from
olive oil is called <i>Castile soap</i>.  Adding alcohol makes it transparent; 
beating air into makes it float.  If potassium salts of fatty acids are made, it
becomes a <i>soft soap</i>.

<p>
These fatty acid salts <q>dissolve</q> in water, but are not truly in solution
like most water soluble substances.  Rather, soap is dispersed into spherical
clusters called <b>micelles</b>, each containing perhaps hundreds of soap
molecules.  Fatty acid salts are <i>amphipathic</i>, with a polar end and a
nonpolar end.  These micelles form as a result of like molecules or components
of molecules seeking like.  Soap derives its cleansing properties from its
ability to emulsify the hydrophobic elements in dirt that are not dispersed
easily by water alone.

<p>
Hard water causes a bathtub ring because the high amount of
calcium and magnesium combine with the fatty carboxylates to form an insoluble
mass.

<h3>33.4 Fats as sources of pure acids and alcohols</h3>

<p>
Sodium soaps treated with mineral acids (or by hydrolysis of
fats under acidic conditions) liberate a mixture of free RCOOH.  Fractional
distillation of these mixtures on a commercial scale makes these acids
available at 90% purity.

<p>
Instead of hydrolysis, fats can be transesterified in
methanol to produce glycerol and a mixture of methyl fatty esters.  These fats
can be reduced to their alcohols or fractionally distilled to provide are ready
source of long straight-chain molecules for further manipulation.

<h3>33.5 Detergents</h3>

<p>
Straight-chain primary alcohols obtained from fats, particularly the
C<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>10</sub> members are used to produce high boiling esters
which serve as <i>plasticizers</i> (e.g., octyl phthalate).  The
C<sub>12</sub> to C<sub>18</sub> alcohols are used in large quantities in the
manufacture of <i>detergents</i> and
other cleansing agents.

<p>
All detergents share the same properties with soap:  they are amphipathic. 
Lauryl alcohol (the n-C<sub>12</sub>  alcohol) is converted to its hydrogen
sulfate with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and this acid treated with NaOH to
produce the sodium salt (SDS).

<p>
Fatty alcohols treated with
ethylene oxide yield <i>nonionic</i> detergents.  Lauryl alcohol can react with
8 ethylene oxide in alkaline medium to produce a polyether alcohol (ethoxylate). 
The many oxygens in the polyether end of the molecule make it water soluble.

<p>
The most widely used detergents are the Na salts of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids. 
Long-chain alkyl groups are attached to the benzene ring by a F-C catalyst with
an RX, alkene, or alcohol. Sulfonation and then neutralization produces the
final product.

<p>
Polypropylene was used to synthesize these alkylbenzenesulfonates, but it
resisted biological degradation.  Now <q>soft</q> (biodegradable) detergents are
prepared:  alkyl sulfates, polyether alcohols and their sulfates, and
alkylbenzenesulfonates in which the phenyl group is randomly attached to various
secondary positions of a long straight-chain (C<sub>12</sub> to
C<sub>18</sub> range).

<p>
Detergents like these act exactly as does soap, but some advantages they have
are that their sulfates and sulfonates remain soluble in hard water (the
magnesium and calcium salts being soluble) and, being salts of strong acids,
their solutions are neutral whereas soaps, being salts of weak acids, yield
slightly alkaline solutions.

<h3>33.6 Unsaturated fats.  Hardening of oils.  Drying oils</h3>

<p>
Hydrogenation of cheaply available unsaturated fats, viz., plant oils, used for
cooking (lard and butter are still preferred in the kitchen) is done under mild
conditions (Ni catalyst, 175-190&deg;, 20-40 psi) for <i>hardening</i> these
oils for commercial purposes.  This does not also subject the ester linkage
to hydrogenolysis.

<p>
Unsaturated fats are more prone to become <i>rancid</i> than hydrogenated fats. 
The rancidity is a result of the presence of volatile and bad-smelling acids and
aldehydes, which occur because of an attack by O<sub>2</sub> at the reactive
allylic positions in fat molecules.  By partial hydrogenation, the elimination
of these allylic positions is afforded.

<p>
Linseed oil and tung oil are important because of the high content of
unsaturated glycerides.  They are called <b>drying oils</b> and are used in the
manufacture of paints and varnishes.  The <q>drying</q> of paint is more than
evaporation of a solvent (such as turpentine), but is a chemical reaction in
which oxygen reacts with the fat to cross-link and polymerize via free radicals,
the fat with the components of the paint and
other chemicals to produce a tough organic film.

<h3>33.7 Phosphoglycerides.  Phosphate esters</h3>

<p>
Another class of lipids are the phosphoglycerides, in which two fatty acids are
esterified at the 1 and 2 position of glycerol, and a phosphoric acid is
esterified to the third position.  The esters are therefore carboxylic acid
esters and phosphate esters.  These lipids are responsible for
forming the membranes of cells.

<p>
Phosphoric acid can actually form up to three esters centered about the
phosphate group.  The acid and its monoesters exist as ions in solution.  Their
esters can be hydrolyzed to their component alcohols and the phosphoric acid. 
In examining the (hydro)lytic reactions of carboxylates and sulfonates, there
were found to be different cleavage sites.  For esters of carboxylates, the
nucleophile attack the acyl carbon, and the C-O bond of the RCOOR&prime; ester
was cleaved.  In esters of sulfonates, the O&dash;R bond in ArSO<sub>2</sub>OR
was cleaved.  With phosphate esters, cleavage can occur at either R&mdash;O or
O&mdash;P in the structure ROPO<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, but it depends upon
the nature of the ROH that will be formed.  In carboxylate esters,
RCOO<sup>&minus;</sup> is strongly basic and a poor leaving group from
R<sup>+</sup>, so O&dash;R bond cleavage in RCOOR&prime; is not anticipated.  In
sulfonates, the RSO<sub>2</sub>O<sup>&minus;</sup> is a good leaving group, and
cleaving of this O&dash;R bond is likely.  Phosphoric acids are intermediate in
their acidity, hence phosphate is a better leaving group than carboxylate
but poorer than sulfonate.

<p>
In acid solutions, all phosphate esters are readily cleaved
to phosphoric acid.  Hydrolysis in alkaline solutions is limited to trialkyl
phosphates, (RO)<sub>3</sub>PO,
in which one alkoxy group is removed.  The mono- and dialkyl esters are inert
in the alkaline solution, for the reason that the one -OH group on phosphate is
acidic and becomes ionized, repelling the approach of hydroxide anion in
substitution reactions.

<h3>33.8 Phospholipids and cell membranes</h3>

<p>
Like soaps, phospholipids are amphipathic.  For this reason,
one expects the formation of micelles in aqueous solutions.  In biological
processes, they tend to form a bilayer, with two rows of molecules stacked up
against each other.  This layer controls the flow of polar molecules into the
fatty layer.  (A simplistic summary of the action of phospholipid action in
biological life forms is given.)

<h2>Chap. 34 Carbohydrates.  Monosaccharides</h2>

<h3>34.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>
The sugar <b>(+)-glucose</b> is formed by plants from CO<sub>2</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>O in the process
of <i>photosynthesis</i>, in which radiant energy is incorporated by
chlorophyll into making the high energy bonds in this reductive process. 
Thousands of (+)-glucose molecules can form polymers of <b>cellulose</b> to
make the supporting framework of the plant, or can be formed into other
polymers of <b>starch</b> to be stored in seeds and used as food.

<p>
Animals consuming starch and some
consuming cellulose can break down the glucose polymers to individual
(+)-glucose units, then re-polymerize them to form <b>glycogen</b>, which is
namely animal starch.  The energy in (+)-glucose is obtained when glucose is
broken down into CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.  Some
glucose can be converted to fats, some can react with nitrogen-containing
substances to form amino acids.  All the sugars mentioned belong to the class
of organic compounds called <b>carbohydrates</b>.  Carbohydrates are
everywhere:  food, clothing (cotton, linen, rayon, and cellulose acetate),
shelter (the wood of a house is mostly cellulose).

<h3>34.2 Definition and classification</h3>

<p>
Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes, polyhydroxy
ketones, or the compounds that can be hydrolyzed to them.  A carbohydrate not
hydrolyzable to a simpler compound is a <b>monosaccharide</b>.  Any
carbohydrate hydrolyzable to two monosaccharides is a <b>disaccharide</b>. 
Any carbohydrate hydrolyzable to many monosaccharide subunits is a
<b>polysaccharide</b>.

<p>
Monosaccharides are subdivided into <b>aldoses</b> if they
contain aldehyde groups, <b>ketoses</b> if they contain keto groups.  They can
be considered <b>trisoses, tetroses, pentoses, hexoses, </b>etc., depending
upon carbon number.  An <b>aldohexose</b> is a six-carbon monosaccharide with
an aldehyde group.  Most naturally occurring monosaccharides are pentoses or
hexoses.

<p>
Carbohydrates which react with Fehling&prime;s (or
Benedict&prime;s) or Tollens' reagents are called <b>reducing sugars</b>. 
All monosaccharides, whether ketose or aldose, are reducing sugars.  Most
disaccharides are also; sucrose (common table sugar) is an exception.

<h3>34.3 (+)-Glucose:  an aldohexose</h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most important bioorganic molecule because of
its sheer abundance, (+)-glucose is typical of the chemistry of most
structures.  Its structure has been deduced using a variety of organic
reactions and physical methods used in organic chemistry.

<p> Elemental analysis and molecular weight determinations reveals a molecular
formula of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.  Reaction with
phenylhydrazine produces a glucose phenylhydrazone indicating the presence of a
carbonyl group, namely an aldehyde.  Reaction with Br<sub>2</sub> in water (the
bromoform reaction) produces gluconic acid.  Reaction with
HNO<sub>3</sub> produces the dicarboxylic acid, glucaric (or saccharic) acid,
HOOC(CHOH)<sub>4</sub>COOH.  Reaction with acetic anhydride  produces penta-O-
acetylglucose.  Reaction with H<sub>2</sub> with a Ni catalyst produces an
alcohol, glucitol (sorbitol).  When glucitol is treated with acetic anhydride,
hexa-O-acetylglucitol (hexa-O-acetylsorbitol) is the product;  or when glucitol
is treated with HI and heat, 2-iodohexane is the product.  When treated with
HCN, then hydrolyzed, then treated with HI and heat, heptanoic acid is
isolated.

<p> All of these reactions helped to define (+)-glucose as 6-carbon, straight-
chain, pentahydroxy aldehyde, namely an aldohexose.

<h3>34.4 (&minus;)-Fructose:  a 2-ketohexose</h3>

<p>
Second only to glucose in importance, this widely naturally
occurring sugar was established as a ketohexose by the following chemistry: 
fructose was treated with HCN to produce the cyanohydrin (two diastereomers)
possible, which was hydrolyzed to produce a hydroxy acid, then heated with HI
to produce racemic a-methylcaproic acid.

<h3>34.5 Stereoisomers of (+)-glucose.  Nomenclature of aldose derivatives</h3>

<p>
Four chiral centers are present in the glucose structure. 
The structure for glucose is typically represented by the cross formula, in
which lines cross (the point of intersection representing the chiral center)
and the horizontal lines represent groups projecting <i>toward</i> the viewer,
and vertical lines project <i>back</i> from the viewer.  (The book does not
call them Fischer projections, but Emil Fischer described their use.) 
The -CH<sub>2</sub>OH group is always
shown at the bottom, and the aldehyde or alternative group is shown at the
top.  This dissimilarity of the two ends of the aldohexose means that no
<i>meso</i>
compounds are possible.  Therefore 2<sup>4</sup> or 16 stereoisomers are
possible for
aldohexoses.  Certainly the enantiomer of (+)-glucose, (&minus;)-glucose, is
one of them.  The others are diastereomers of this structure with their own
particular names, with (+)-mannose and (+)-galactose being particularly
abundant.

<p>
Products of reactions on the aldohexoses take their
derivatives names as a root from the sugar (see table).

<p>
insert table 34.1 here

<h3>34.6 Oxidation.  Effect of alkali</h3>

<p>
Aldoses are oxidized in 4 different ways:  (i) with
Fehling's or Tollens' reagent; (ii) with bromine water; (iii) by
nitric acid; and (iv) with periodic acid, HIO<sub>4</sub>.

<p> Being aldehydes, the aldoses certainly reduce <b>Tollens</b>'
<b>reagent</b>.  They also reduce <b>Fehling's solution</b>, an alkaline
solution of cupric ion complexed with tartrate ion (or <b>Benedict's
solution</b>, where complexing is with citrate ion).  In the latter, a deep blue
color obtains, and red cuprous oxide precipitates.  A problem with these
reactions is that they do not distinguish between ketoses and aldoses, for this
reduction is a behavior of a-hydroxy ketoses.  Moreover, they are not used in
the preparation of aldonic (monocarboxylic) acids from aldoses, as the
alkalinity of the medium causes extensive isomerization of the sugars and
decomposition of the chain.  (The alkaline medium induces enediol tautomers
which are reactive.)

<p>
<b>Bromine water</b> does oxidize aldoses, but not
ketoses, since it is acidic in part and prevents isomerization of ketoses to
aldoses.  It is used to synthesize aldonic acids of aldoses.

<p>
<b>Nitric acid</b> is a more vigorous oxidizer of aldoses,
oxidizing the terminal carbons (the aldehyde and the -CH<sub>2</sub>OH groups),
forming the <i>aldaric</i> (dicarboxylic) acids.

<p> The reaction of compounds containing either &minus;OH or =O groups on
adjacent carbons to <b>periodic acid</b>, HIO<sub>4</sub>, has already been
discussed (a reaction shown by L. Malaprade in 1928), and is very useful in
analyzing carbohydrate structure.

<h3>34.7 Osazone formation.  Epimers</h3>

<p> Aldehydes react with phenylhydrazines to produce phenylhydrazones.  With
excess phenylhydrazine, the reaction proceeds even further to produce
<b>osazones</b>, which are sugars with <i>two</i> phenylhydrazine residues per
molecule.  A third phenylhydrazine produces aniline and ammonia.

<p class="center"> &mdash;CHOH-CHO + 3

<p> Osazones are not limited to carbohydrates, but are typical of a-hydroxy
aldehydes and ketones (e.g. benzoin,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHOHCOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>).  Removing the
phenylhydrazines by mixing acid with an aldehyde (like benzaldehyde) produce
dicarbonyls callled <b>osones</b>.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rarr; &mdash;C(=O)-CHO +

<p>
P. Griess (1858) had discovered
how to make diazonium salts.  E. Fischer (1875) found that reduction of
benzenediazonium chloride by SO<sub>2</sub> produces phenylhydrazine. 
Then in 1884, Fischer showed
what a powerful tool the phenylhydrazine was in studying carbohydrates.  One of
the useful aspects is that osazone formation destroys the configuration at
carbon C2.  Hence (+)-glucose and (+)-mannose yield the same osazone.  Since
mannose and glucose are <b>epimeric</b> at C2, the configuration at the other
carbons must be the same.

<h3>34.8 Lengthening of the carbon chain of aldoses.  The Killiani-Fischer
synthesis</h3>

<p>
H. Kiliani (1886) reported that an aldose can be converted
into two aldonic acids with one carbon more than the aldose by addition of HCN
followed by hydrolysis of the cyanohydrin.  Fischer (1890) reported that
reduction of an aldonic acid (in the form of its lactone) can be controlled to
yield the corresponding aldose.  Hence, combining the Kiliani-Fischer synthetic
reactions can convert an aldopentose into two aldohexoses.

<p>
Addition fo cyanide to the carbonyl generates a new chiral
center, giving two possible configurations.  The result is two new
diastereomeric cyanohydrins.  The diastereomers are generated in unequal
amounts because the aldehyde itself is chiral and is affected by neighboring
groups.

<p>
Hydrolysis of the cyanohydrin under acidic conditions is
likely to result in the formation of a &gamma;-
or &Delta;-lactone, with a &gamma;-lactone more likely.  The lactone is
reduced by sodium amalgam with CO<sub>2</sub> (the Fischer reduction);
today, the reducing agent NaBH<sub>4</sub> is used, a
reagent unknown to chemists during Fischer&prime;s time.  The diastereomers are
separable, having different physical properties; this is actually done with the
aldonic acids, as they are easier to separate than the epimeric sugars.

<h3>34.9 Shortening the carbon chain of aldoses.  The Ruff degradation</h3>

<p>
Aldosugars can be degraded as well to form an aldose of one
less carbon.  One method is the <b>Ruff degradation</b>.  First the aldose is
oxidized to the aldonic acid with bromine water.  The calcium salt of the acid
is made by mixing with CaCO<sub>3</sub>, then the calcium aldonate is treated
with hydrogen
peroxide in the presence of ferric salts.  The aldose (less one carbon)
and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> are produced as a result.

<h3>34.10 Conversion of an aldose into its epimer</h3>

<p>
Aldose sugars can be epimerized at one of the chiral carbons
by a reaction in which the aldose is oxidized to its aldonic acid with bromine
water, and then a 3&deg; amine (in particular, pyridine) is added which
specifically epimerizes the C2 carbon in an equilibrium reaction, the only
carbon epimerized.  The aldonic acid and its epimer are separated and their
lactones formed, which are then reduced.  The epimeric aldose is thus obtained.

<h3>34.11 Configuration of (+)-glucose.  The Fischer proof</h3>

<p>
In 1888, very few monosaccharides were known: (+)-glucose,
(&minus;)-fructose, (+)-arabinose.  (+)-Mannose was just synthesized.  Aldoses
were known to be reduced to alditols and oxidized to mono- (aldonic) and
dicarboxylic (aldaric) acids.  Theories of stereoisomerism and optical activity
had been proposed by van&prime;t Hoff and Le Bel (1874).  The structure of
(+)-glucose was known, but not its stereochemistry.  In 1891, Fischer reported
after 3 years what the stereochemical structure was of glucose (he received a
Nobel Prize for it in 1902).  Although the absolute configuration could not be
known, he could limit the 16 possibilities to a pair of enantiomers.

<p>
Fischer first rejected 8 of the 16 by placing the -OH group
which would be C5 carbon on the right of his projection, an arbitrary decision
which proved correct.  (+)-glucose was related to the aldopentose
(&minus;)-arabinose, which had to one of 4 structures.  He decided on one of
the four structures from the evidence known:

<p>
1. (&minus;)-arabinose treated with HNO<sub>3</sub> produces an
optically active dicarboxylic acid, which means that two of the four structures
could be eliminated as their oxidation would produce optically inactive <i>meso</i>
dicarboxylic acids.  The C2 carbon -OH group of (&minus;)-arabinose must be on
the left in the Fischer projection, which would mean the C3 carbon -OH group is
on the left, being one carbon removed.

<p>
2. (&minus;)-arabinose is converted to (+)-glucose and
(+)-mannose in the Kiliani-Fischer synthesis.  This is interpreted easily that
glucose and mannose are C2 epimers, with the same configuation at C3, C4 and C5
as (&minus;)-arabinose.  The possible structures for glucose and mannose are
limited to four, either I and II, or III and IV:

<p>
insert structures III, IV, and VII, and VIII top p. 1082.

<p>
3.  Oxidation of (+)-glucose and (+)-mannose by HNO<sub>3</sub> yields optically
active dicarboxylic acids.  This defines the configuration at C4 carbon, in
which the -OH group is shown on the right in the projection.  A left-sided -OH
group is certain to produce an optically inactive <i>meso</i> dicarboxylic acid
with either glucose or mannose during the oxidation.  The stereochemistry of
(&minus;)-arabinose, with its three chiral carbons at C3, C4, and C5, is now
entirely assigned at this point.  There are two structures left, one being
glucose, one being mannose.

<p>
insert structure of arabinose on p 1084, indicate C4 is also
as glucose or mannose

<p>
4. When another hexose, (+)-gulose, is oxidized with HNO<sub>3</sub>, optically
active
(+)-glucaric acid is produced, the same dicarboxylic acid produced by nitric
acid oxidation of (+)-glucose.  (+)-Glucaric acid might have two possible
configurations (V and VI), one of which is derived from two aldoses which are
diastereomers (structure I and VII), and one from what looks like another two
diastereomers (VIII), but which is just the same one rotated 180&deg;.  Since
structure I is projected in the right manner (CHO up and CH<sub>2</sub>OH down),
structure I is (+)-glucose.  (+)-Mannose must therefore be structure II.

<h3>34.12 Configuration of aldoses</h3>

<p>
The aldopentose <b>(&minus;)-ribose</b> forms the same
osazone as (&minus;)-arabinose.  This means that the ribose structure is a C2
epimer of arabinose, and ribose must have the structure shown.

<p>
insert ribose structure on p 1086

<p>
The two remaining aldopentoses, <b>(+)-xylose</b> and <b>(&minus;)-lyxose</b>,
must differ from arabinose and ribose in their C3 configuration.  The epimeric
positions of the C2 carbon were determined in that (+)-xylose oxidized by
HNO<sub>3</sub> forms an
optically inactive <i>meso</i> aldaric acid, suggesting the proper symmetry.

<p>
insert xylose and lyxose structures on p. 1086.
<p>
(&minus;)-Arabinose can be degraded to <b>(&minus;)-erythrose</b>, which must
have the structure shown. Proof of this structure obtains when (&minus;)-
erythrose is oxidized by HNO<sub>3</sub> to optically inactive <i>meso</i>-
tartartic acid.

<p>
Degradation of (+)-xylose produces the tetrose <b>(&minus;)-threose</b>. 
Its oxidation produces the expectedly optically active (&minus;)-tartaric acid.

<p>

<h3>34.13 Optical families.  <span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>
and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span></h3>

<p>
In many reactions, the <i>absolute</i> configuration is not
known and not even that important.  What is often important is the <i>relative</i>
configuration, and this is not especially easy.

<p>
In the salad days of carbohydrate chemistry, the simplest
optically active carbohydrate, the aldotriose<b> glyceraldehyde</b>, was used
as a standard of configurational reference.  The (+)-glyceraldehyde was
arbitrarily assigned a configuration (I) and designated as
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-glyceraldehyde; its enantiomer,
(&minus;)-glyceraldehyde,was called
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>-glyceraldehyde. 
The chance was 50:50 that the configurations assigned were correct (and it just
happened to be correct).  So long as no chiral center bonds were broken or the
stereochemistry involving the breaking of any chiral bonds accounted for,
molecules derived from this standard could be configurationally known.

<p>
The <span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span> and <span style=
'text-transform:uppercase'>l</span> designations do not indicate optical
rotation directions, but were designed to group <i>optical families</i> in
which preserved stereochemical configurations could be used to relate one
molecule to another.

<h3>34.14 Tartaric acid</h3>
<p>
The importance of (+)-tartaric acid in chemistry today can not be overestimated.
Pasteur formulated the theory of enantiomerism and explained optical activity
as a result of his work with tartaric acid, and 100 years later, Bijvoet
studied the sodium-rubidium salt of tartaric acid using x-ray diffraction to
establish its absolute configuration, and thereby established the absolute
configuration of all chiral molecules in the whole of organic chemistry. The
configurational link between d-(+)-glyceraldehyde and d-(&minus;)-tartaric acid
had been made in 1917, in which glyceraldehyde was extended with HCN to give
two diastereomers. The nitriles were hydrolyzed with Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>, then
oxidized with HNO<sub>3</sub>. One diastereomer produces the <i>meso</i>
-tartaric acid, the other d-(&minus;)-tartaric acid.

<p>
When Bijvoet had determined the absolute configuration of
the l-(+)-tartaric acid, he found that it, and therefore its enantiomer, and
its precursor glyceraldehyde, had the true and same absolute configurations
which had been arbitrarily assigned.

<p>
insert structures of d- and l-tartaric acids on p 1091

<h3>34.15 Families of aldoses.  Absolute configuration</h3>

<p>
With designation of d-(+)-glyceraldehyde as showing in a projection in which
the carbonyl is at the top, and the -OH group on the right of the chiral center,
 all larger carbohydrates related to the d-glyceraldehyde belong to either the
d or l families, with the letter designating the position of the lowest chiral
center. Had Bijvoet&prime;s data shown the opposite of what E. Fischer has
assumed as the absolute configuration of glucose, the D family might have the
-OH group on the left at the lowest chiral center.

<h3>34.16 Cyclic structure of
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-(+)-glucose. 
Formation of glucosides</h3>

<p>
Although there is a great deal of evidence showing glucose is a pentahydroxy
aldehyde with configurations well-established, there were some problems in
accounting for this structure.

<p>
(a) <b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-(+)-Glucose
fails to react with reagents which identify substances as aldehydes (carbonyls)</b>. 
Although glucose easily oxidizes, it gives a negative Schiff test and does not
form a bisulfite addition product.

<p>

(b) <b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-(+)-Glucose exists in two
isomeric forms which appear to undergo mutarotation.</b> Crystals of
d-(+)-glucose (m.p. 146&deg;) dissolved in water show a change in their specific
rotation from +112&deg; to 52.7&deg; over a gradual period. On the other when
crystals of d-(+)-glucose (m.p. 150&deg;), which are obtained by
crystallization at over 98&deg;, are dissolved in water, their specific
rotation gradually rises from +19&deg; to +52.7&deg;. The form of glucose with
the higher rotation is called <b>&alpha;-<span style="font-variant:small-caps">
d</span>-(+)- glucose</b>, the form with the lower rotation <b>&beta;-<span
style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-(+)-glucose</b>, and the change in
rotation which occurs during this equilibrium process is called mutarotation.

<p>
(c) <b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-(+)-Glucose forms two
isomeric methyl <span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-glucosides.</b> 
In the presence of anhydrous HCl, aldehydes react with alcohols to form acetals.
 First the hemiacetal is formed, addition to the carbonyl, then substitution of 
the remaining &minus;OH group to form the acetal in the acid- catalyzed process.
 With glucose, however, only <i>one</i> &minus;CH<sub>3</sub> group is present
instead of two. It does not spontaneously revert to the aldehyde and alcohol in
water, requiring hydrolysis by aqueous acids. Moreover, there are two different
monomethyl derivatives, one with m.p. 165&deg; and [&alpha;] = +158&deg;, which
is <b>methyl </b><b>&alpha;- <span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>
-glucoside</b>, and the other with m.p. 107&deg; and [&alpha;] = &minus;33&deg;,
 which is <b>methyl-</b><b>&beta;- <span style="font-variant:small-caps">
d</span>-glucoside.</b> These do not undergo mutarotation nor reduce Tollens'
or Fehling's reagent.

<p>
In 1895 glucose was given a cyclic structure (as a result of
work by Tollens, Tanret, and Fischer).  Its ring size was corrected in 1926,
and the preferred conformations now elucidated in recent years.

<p>
insert all of fig 34.8 here on p 1095

<p>
The hemiacetal form of glucose results simply because
alcohol is part of its ring structure.  It has two isomeric forms because it
now one more chiral center than in the open-chain form (at C1). 
a-d-(+)-glucose and b-d-(+)-glucose are diastereomers, with a different C1
configuration, and are given the special name <b>anomers</b>.  Being
hemiacetals, they are readily hydrolyzed in water to the open-chain form, which
exists as an equilibrium mixture with both anomers.  Reactions of aqueous
solutions of d-(+)-glucose to form osazones or to reduce Tollens' or
Fehling's reagent presumably result from what little open-chain form
exists, and as all of it is consumed, more is generated to continue to react. 
This concentration of open-chain form is much too low (&lt; 0.5%) for easily
reversible aldehyde reaction like bisulfite addition or the Schiff test.

<p>
The methyl <span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-glucosides
exist as cyclic structures.  They are full acetals, despite only one methanolic
group, because the sugar -OH serves as the other alcohol.  These glucosides do
not undergo mutarotation, being stable in water.  If they are heated in aqueous
acid, however, hydrolysis to the cyclic hemiacetal forms occurs.  In basic
solutions they are stable, as are typical of acetals.  They are non-reducing
sugars, not being able to revert to the open-chain aldehyde for reaction with
Tollens' or Fehling's reagent.

<h3>34.17 Configuration about C-1</h3>

<p>
With glucose being shown to be a cyclic structure, a
question about the configuration of C1 in anomeric structures was given an
answer in 1909 by C. S. Hudson who proposed that the <span style='text-transform:
uppercase'>d</span>-series of the more dextrorotatory member of &alpha;,&beta;
pair of anomers be called &alpha;-<span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-,
the other being named &beta;-<span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-. 
For the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>-series, the more
levorotatory was to be named &alpha;-<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>l</span>, while the other was to be
&beta;-<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>. 
Hence the enantiomer of
&alpha;-<span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-(+)-glucose is
&alpha;-<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>-(&minus;)-glucose. 
In projections, the -OH or -OCH<sub>3</sub> for the
&alpha;-<span style="font-variant:small-caps">d</span>-anomer would be
shown to the <i>right</i> of the chiral carbon (or <i>down</i>
in cyclic projections).

<p>
Hudson&prime;s proposals turned out to be correct, although
the assumptions about configuration and optical activity upon which they were
based were incorrect.  That a-d-glucose and a-d-glucosides have the same
configuration comes from evidence that enzymatic hydrolysis of methyl
a-d-glucoside yields highly rotating a-d-glucose, and for methyl b-d-glucoside
it liberates b-d-glucose.

<p>
C1 configuration is the same in all methyl a-glycosides of
all d-aldohexoses.  This was proved by HIO<sub>4</sub> oxidation, which does not
destroy the C1
configuration (or at C5), which give the same products.  This could not be true
if they had different configurations at C1.  And the proof of absolute
configuration putting -OH on the right of C1 in projections comes from x-ray
diffraction.

<h3>34.18 Methylation</h3>

<p>
While CH<sub>3</sub>OH and dry HCl produces methyl glucosides, converting the
sugar hemiacetal to the acetal, when methyl d-glucoside is treated with methyl
sulfate, (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and NaOH, the
four remaining -OH groups become methylated to form tetra-O-methyl-d-glucoside. 
This reaction is a modification of the Williamson ether synthesis, because of
the relatively high acidity of the &minus;OH groups.

<p>
Treatment of tetra-O-methyl-d-glucoside with dilute HCl
removes only the methoxy group at C1, forming tetra-O-methyl-d-glucose.  The
methoxy group at C1 is an acetal, whereas the other groups are true ethers and
are more stable.

<h3>34.19 Determination of ring size</h3>

<p>
Evidence of a ring structure comes from chemical degradation
experiments.  For example, methyl b-d-glucoside is treated with
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and NaOH, then
the product is hydrolyzed by dil. HCl to obtain tetra-O-methyl-d-glucose. 
Vigorous oxidation with HNO<sub>3</sub> follows.  The &minus;CHO and free
&minus;OH group which
ought to be present should be converted to yield a keto acid with continued
oxidation of the ketone group to yield a cleaved carbon-carbon bond on either
side of the keto group.

<p>
Oxidation in fact yields the trimethoxyglutaric acid,
HOOC(CHOCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>COOH, and
dimethoxysuccinic acid, HOOC(CHOCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>COOH. 
The first product results from cleavage of the C5-C6 bond, the second from the
C4-C5 bond.  The entire structure is predicted if the reactant oxidized is
2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-d-glucose.  These reactions are possible only if C1 and
C5 are joined via the C5 hydroxyl in a six-membered ring.  Hence, establishment
of ring structure, largely shown by Sir W. N. Haworth, has been shown by this
chemistry.  Other evidence comes from x-ray diffraction and enzymatic
hydrolysis.

<p>
Carbohydrates which have six-membered rings with an oxygen
one of the elements are called <b>pyranoses</b>, based on the structure of the
cyclic ether, <i>pyran</i>.  Five-membered carbohydrate rings are called
<b>furanoses</b>, after the aromatic ether, <i>furan</i>.

<h3>34.20 Conformation</h3>

<p>
In the six-membered ring structure of d-(+)-glucose, the
C&mdash;O&minus;C bond angle is about 111&deg;, near the tetrahedral angle of
109.5&deg;.  Being a six-membered ring, the puckered conformation of cyclohexane in
its chair structure is predicted, which provides minimal torsional and van der
Waals strain.  The x-ray data shows this to be correct.

<p>
However, two chair conformations are possible.  One is more
stable than the other, the reason being that the bulky groups, &minus;OH groups
on carbons 1-4 and &minus;CH<sub>2</sub>OH on C5, can all obtain
equatorial positions in
b-d-(+)-glucose, with &minus;H groups anti to each other.  With
a-d-(+)-glucose, this maximally stable arrangement is not possible.  R. E.
Reeves working with Cu complexes of carbohydrates has found that the first
requirement is to place the &minus;CH<sub>2</sub>OH group in the
equatorial position, since it is
the most bulky.  Then proceeding from C4 to C3 to C2 and so on, the other
groups are placed equatorially or axially to prevent the strain.  This places
the C1 &minus;OH group in the axial position in a-d-(+)-glucose.  In some
sugars, such as a-d-idopyranose, there would be too many &minus;OH groups in
the axial position in order to accomodate &minus;CH<sub>2</sub>OH in the
equatorial position;  therefore,
the more stable conformer is to place the &minus;OH groups equatorially and
force the &minus;CH<sub>2</sub>OH
into the axial position.

<p>
Of all the d-aldohexoses, it is b-d-(+)-glucose that can
assume a conformation in which every bulky group occupies the equatorial
position, and so it should not be surprising that this molecule is the most
widely occurring in nature.

<p>
In methylated and acetylated pyranoses, bulky groups occupy
the equatorial positions with one general exception:  a methoxy or acetoxy
group on C1 tends to be axial.  This <i>anomeric effect</i> is believed to
result from a dipole repulsion between the dipoles of C1-oxygen and the ring
oxygen.

<h2>Chap. 35 Carbohydrates.  Disaccharides and polysaccharides</h2>

<h3>35.1 Disaccharides</h3>

<p>
Four disaccharides are considered here:  <b>(+)-maltose</b>
(malt sugar), <b>(+)-cellobiose</b>, <b>(+)-lactose</b> (milk sugar),
<b>(+)-sucrose</b> (cane or beet sugar).

<h3>35.2 (+)-Maltose</h3>

<p> (+)-Maltose is obtained by partial acid hydrolysis of starch, but can also
be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis with <i>diastase</i>.  It molecular formula
is C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>.  It reduces Tollens' and
Fehling's reagents.  It reacts with phenylhydrazine to form an osazone,
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>9</sub>(=NNHC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.  It is oxidized in bromine water to form a monocarboxylic acid,
<i>maltobionic acid</i>.  It exists in <i>alpha</i> ([a] = +168&deg;) and
<i>beta</i> ([&alpha;] = +112&deg;) forms which undergo mutarotation in solution
(equilibrium [&alpha;] = +136&deg;).

<p> All these facts indicate that (+)-maltose has a C=O group existing in a
reactive hemiacetal form.  It has only one such free C=O as show by the osazone
formation and bromine water oxidation.

<p>
Hydrolyzed in aqueous acid or treated with <i>maltase</i>,
chemical analysis show the product to be completely d-(+)-glucose.  Hence
maltose consist of two d-(+)-glucose units formed by a condensation reaction. 
While hydrolysis by acid is characteristic of all glycosides, hydrolysis by
maltase is characteristic only of <i>alpha</i>-glucosides.

<p>
The question of linkage of which &minus;OH groups on the
sugar was addressed by the sequence of oxidation, methylation, and hydrolysis
of maltose.  First bromine water converts maltose to maltobionic acid, the acid
is treated with methyl sulfate and NaOH to form octa-O-methyl-d-maltobionic
acid, which is then hydrolyzed in acidic solution.  The products are
2,3,5,6-tetra-O-methyl-d-gluconic acid and 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-d-glucose. 
Hence the C4 of the reducing glucose is connected to the C1 of another via an
oxygen.  Maltose is therefore
4-O-(&alpha;-<span class="smcap">d</span>-glucopyranosyl)-<span
class="smcap">d</span>-glucopyranoside.

<h3>35.3 (+)-Cellobiose</h3>

<p>
Celluose (cotton fibers) treated for several days in
sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride yield products which are acetylated and
hydrolyzed.  The octaacetate of (+)-cellobiose is obtained.  Alkaline
hydrolysis yields the octaacetate itself.  It has the same molecular formular
as maltose, is a reducing sugar, forms an osazone, and exists in &alpha; and &beta;
anomeric forms capable of mutarotation.  It produces the same products with the
sequence of oxidation, methylation, and hydrolysis, so the linkage must be the
same as well.

<p>
However, it cannot be hydrolyzed by maltase.  It is
hydrolyzed by an enzyme in bitter almonds, <i>emulsin</i>, which is known to
hydrolyzed &beta;-linkages.  Hence cellobiose is like maltose except that the C1 to
C4 linkage is &beta; about the C1 carbon.

<h3>35.4 (+)-Lactose</h3>

<p>
This sugar makes up about 5% of human and cow milk.  It is a
by-product of cheese manufacture, being found in <i>whey</i>, the aqueous
solution remaining after milk proteins have coagulated.  The sourness of milk
results from lactose metabolism (by <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</i>) to lactic
acid.

<p> (+)-Lactose is has same formula as the first two disaccharides, is a
reducing sugar, forms and osazone, exists in &alpha; and &beta; forms.  Acidic
hydrolysis or emulsin treatment converts lactose to 
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">d</span>-(+)-galactose and 
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">d</span>-(+)-glucose.  Lactose must be a &beta;-linked disaccharide.

<p> The question remains as to whether lactose is a galactoside or a glucoside. 
Hydrolysis of the lactosazone produces <span style="font-variant:small-
caps;">d</span>-(+)-galactose and <span style="font-variant:small-
caps;">d</span>-glucosazone.  Hydrolysis of <i>lactobionic acid</i> forms <span
class="smcap">d</span>-gluconic acid and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">d</span>-(+)-galactose.  
Clearly <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">d</span>-(+)-glucose contains the <q>free</q> aldehyde
necessary for osazone and acid formation.  Hence it is a substituted d-glucose
with a <span class="smcap">d</span>-galactosyl group at one
of the hydroxyl positions;  it is a galactoside.

<p>
The oxidation, methylation, and hydrolysis sequence shows it
to be galactose C1-glucose C4 linked.

<h3>35.5 (+)-Sucrose</h3>

<p> Although its structure is identical with all three disaccharides discussed
up to now, it does not reduce Tollens' or Fehling's reagent.  It
does not form an osazone, does not exist in anomeric forms, and shows no
mutarotation.  Therefore, (+)-sucrose has no free aldehyde or ketone group.

<p> Hydrolyzed by dil. aqueous acid or by action of enzyme yeast
<i>invertase</i>, equal amounts of <span style="font-variant:small-
caps;">d</span>-(+)-glucose and <span class="smcap">d</span>-
(&minus;)-fructose are obtained.  Acid hydrolysis actually produces a solution
which now rotates light in the negative direction, which has been termed
<i>inversion</i>;  sucrose is therefore called <i>invert sugar</i>.  This is
because the large negative rotation by the formed (&minus;)-fructose overwhelms
the positive rotation of (+)-glucose.

<p>
Because there is no free aldehyde, (+)-sucrose can be
considered a <span class="smcap">d</span>-glucoside and
<span class="smcap">d</span>-fructoside. 
The linkage is logical:  since there
is no free aldehyde or keto group, the glucose C1 must link to fructose C2. 
The stereochemistry at the linkage is difficult to assess when both linkages
are hydrolyzed with equal opportunity.  X-ray data and finally synthesis of
(+)-sucrose (by R. U. Lemieux in 1953) confirmed that the glucose is the
&alpha;-anomer and fructose the &beta;-anomer.

<h3>35.6 Polysaccharides</h3>

<p>
Polysaccharides are polymers formed by condensation
monomeric sugars.  The most important ones are <b>starch</b> and <b>cellulose</b>,
both compose of <span class="smcap">d</span>-(+)-glucose units. 
Cellulose is the least water soluble,
being mainly a structural sugar.  Starch is found in the reserve food supply of
plants and is mostly in seeds.  It is more water soluble and more easily
hydrolyzed.

<h3>35.7 Starch</h3>

<p>
Starch occurs as granules whose size and shape are
characteristic of the plant where they came from.  The intact granules are
insoluble in cold water, but if the outer membrane is disrupted by grinding,
the granules swell in cold water to form a gel.  In warm water, the soluble
portion of starch diffuses through the granule wall.  In hot water the granules
swell so much that they burst.  20% of starch is a water-soluble fraction
called <b>amylose</b>, the other 80% being an insoluble <b>amylopectin</b>. 
The amylopection insolubility results apparently from a molecular weight
difference.  When treated with acid or by enzymes, these starch components
hydrolyze progressively to dextrin (a mixture of low MW polysaccharides), then
to maltose, then to glucose.

<h3>35.8 Structure of amylose.  End group analysis</h3>

<p>
Hydrolysis of amylose ultimately produces (+)-maltose as the
only disaccharide, and eventually
<span class="smcap">d</span>-(+)-glucose. 
The linkages in amylose of
the individual glucose units must therefore be all C1 to C4 in the <i>alpha</i>
linkage.

<p>
Methylation of amylose followed by hydrolysis yields
2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-<span class="smcap">d</span>-glucose,
which is expected from a large number of glucose
units connected C1,C4 in a polysaccharide.  About 0.2-0.4% of the product is
also 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-d-glucose as well, which is perfectly reasonable
considering that one glucose in a polymer must be an <b>end group</b>. 
Furthermore, at the other end, a glucose with a <q>free</q> aldehyde
must be present (the reducing end).

<p>
The relative yield of tetramethylated glucose (representing
an end group) to trimethylated glucose can provide an idea of chain length in
the polymer.  For example a 0.25% tetra-O-methyl glucose yield means that 1 end
group exists for every 400 chain units.  Physical methods actually demonstrate
that MW ranging from 150,000 to 600,000 are usual;  this suggests that chain
degradation is occurring during the methylation step, predictable since a
relatively alkaline medium is required.  Amylose is therefore thought to be
glucose polymers of 1000 or more units with little or no branching in the
chain.

<p>
Amylose is the fraction of starch producing the blue color
in reaction with iodine.  X-ray data indicated that chains are coiled in the
form of a helix, wherein the iodine becomes trapped and produces the observed
blue color.

<h3>35.9 Structure of amylopectin</h3>

<p>
Like amylose, amylopectin is hydrolyzed to a single
disaccharide, (+)-maltose.  Methylation and hydrolysis produce mostly
2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-<span class="smcap">d</span>-glucose,
suggesting a similar structure to amylose.  MW
estimations from physical methods put amylopectin as having millions of glucose
units per molecule, but 5% of the hydrolyzed methylated product is
2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-<span class="smcap">d</span>-glucose,
suggesting only 20 units per chain.

<p>
The answer to the confusion is that
2,3-di-O-methyl-<span class="smcap">d</span>-glucose
is produced after methylation hydrolysis in amounts
nearly equal to the tetramethyl derivative.  This suggests a C1,C6 linkage
about every 20-25 glucose units, showing it to be a highly branched structure.

<p>
<b>Glycogen</b> in animals is much like amylopectin, but is
more highly branched with shorter chains at 12-18 glucose units each.

<h3>35.10 Structure of cellulose</h3>

<p>
Cellulose is insoluble in water and tasteless; it is also
non-reducing.  All of these properties may derive in part from its very high
molecular weight.  Acid hydrolysis produces only
<span class="smcap">d</span>-(+)-glucose as the
monosaccharide.  And hydrolysis of methylated cellulose give the
2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-<span class="smcap">d</span>-glucose,
showing it to be C1,C4 linked.

<p>
Physical methods show MW ranging from 250,000 to 1,000,000
or more, with at least 1500 glucose units per molecule.  End group analysis by
methylation and periodic acid oxidation indicated chain lengths of at least
1000 units or more.  X-ray data and electron microscopy show long chains laying
side by side, held together by hydrogen bonds in bundles, each bundle twisted
together to form rope-like structures.

<h3>35.11-.13 Reactions of cellulose.  Cellulose nitrate.  Cellulose acetate</h3>

<p>
Being a very tough polymer, cellulose has been derivatized
to advantage as its derivatives are made cheaply.  Since it is an alcohol,
cellulose can form esters.  Treated with HNO<sub>3</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, cellulose forms <b>cellulose nitrate</b>,
the properties of which depend upon the extent of nitration.  <i>Gun cotton</i>
is used in making smokeless powder and is very nearly completely nitrated
cellulose; it is often called <i>cellulose trinitrate</i> (since it
would have three nitrate groups per glucose unit in the fully nitrated
molecule).  <i>Pyroxylin</i> is less highly nitrated, being between 2-3 nitrate
groups per glucose;  it is used in manufacture of plastics like celluloid and
colloidin, in photographic film and in lacquers.  It is unfortunately flammable
and forms very toxic nitrogen oxides when burned.

<p>
Cellulose can be converted to its triacetate in the presence
of acetic anhydride, acetic acid, and a little sulfuric acid.  Partial
hydrolysis removes some of the acetate groups, degrades the chain to smaller
fragments (200-300 units each).  The result is a commercial cellulose acetate
(roughly <i>di</i>acetate).  It is less flammable than cellulose nitrate,
replacing the latter for use in safety-type photographic film.  Solutions of
cellulose acetate in acetone forced through the fine holes of a spinnerette
cause solvent evaporation and leave solid filaments.  The thread from these
filaments make up a material called <i>acetate rayon</i>.

<h3>35.14 Rayon. Cellophane</h3>
<p>
Alcohols treated with CS<sub>2</sub> and aqueous NaOH form a compound called a
<i>xanthate</i>.  Acid treatment reforms the alcohol and carbon disulfide.

<p>
  H<<sup>+</sup>
  
<p class="center">
RONa + S=C=S &mdash;&rarr; RO&minus;C(=S)&minus;SNa &mdash;&rarr; ROH +
CS<sub>2</sub>

<p>
Cellulose undergoes a similar reaction to form cellulose
xanthate, which then dissolves in teh alkali to form a viscous colloidal
dispersion called <i>viscose</i>.  Viscose forced through a spinnerette into an
acid bath caused regeneration of cellulose in the form of fine filaments making
threads called <i>rayon</i>.  Although other processes for making rayon exist,
this is the principal one in the U.S.

<p>
When viscose is forced through a narrow slit, the cellulose
is regenerated as thin sheets.  When softened with glycerol, they are used as
protective films (Cellophane).  Rayon and Cellophane are often considered to be
<q>regenerated cellulose</q> but differ in that they are shorter
polymers as a result of fragmentation resulting from alkali exposure.

<h3>35.15 Cellulose ethers</h3>

<p>
Cellulose can be alkylated by treating with alkali and then
exposing to alkyl chlorides (which are cheaper than alkyl sulfates).  Because
of the intense alkalinity, considerable chain fragmentation is unavoidable. 
The methyl, ethyl, and benzyl ethers of cellulose are important in textiles,
films, and various plastic objects.

<h2>Chap. 36 Amino acids and proteins</h2>

<h3>36.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>
The name <b>protein </b>is taken from the Greek <i>proteios</i>,
which means <i>first</i>.  A name well chosen, since proteins are the principle
biomolecules of life.

<h3>36.2 Structure of amino acids</h3>

<p>
26 different amino acids have been found in proteins.  For
animals, certain amino acids are essential (i.e., they are obtained in the
diet).  The table shows the 26 amino acids and their structures.  All but
proline and hydroxyproline, which form a pyrrolidine ring, are alpha-amino
carboxylic acids.

<p>
insert table 36.1 in parts

<h3>36.3 Amino acids as dipolar ions</h3>

<p>
The physical properties of amino acids differ from amines
and carboxylic acids when their functional groups occur singly.

<p>
(a) Amino acids are nonvolatile crystalline solids which
melt with decomposition at fairly high temperatures.

<p>
(b) They are insoluble in nonpolar solvents like petroleum
ether, benzene, or ether, but are appreciably water soluble.

<p>
(c) Their aqueous solutions behave like solutions of
substances of high dipole moment.

<p>
(d) Acidity and basicity constants are ridiculously low for
&minus;COOH and &minus;NH<sub>2</sub> groups.  Glycine has a
<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of 1.6 &times; 10<sup>&minus;10</sup> and <i>K</i><sub>b</sub> =
2.5 &times; 10<sup>&minus;12</sup>.

<p>
All of these properties are consistent with amino acids
existing as dipolar ions in solution.  The <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> 
in this case, is the <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> for a
&minus;NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group and the K <sub>b</sub> for the
&minus;COO<sup>&minus;</sup> group.

<h3>36.4 Isoelectric point of amino acids</h3>

<p>
When placed in an electric field, amino acids being charged
molecules can migrate to one electrode or the other.  The direction depends
upon the net charge of the molecule.  In a more alkaline medium, the amino acid
becomes negatively charged.  In a mored acidic medium, the charge is positive. 
At a particular pH, the net charge on the molecule is zero, its <b>isoelectric
point</b>.

<h3>36.5 Configuration of natural amino acids</h3>

<p> Every amino acid but glycine has at least one chiral center.  Being chiral,
they are of course optically active.  Stereochemical studies show that the
configuration of naturally occurring a-amino acids is similar to the
configuration of l-(&minus;)-glyceraldehyde, and they are l-amino acids.

<h3>36.6 Preparation of amino acids</h3>

<p>
Many methods for preparing amino acids exists, but one
principal reaction is the <b>amination of a-halo acids</b>.

<p>
<b>Direct ammonolysis</b> of a-chloro or a-bromo acid with
the use of excess concentrated ammonia is done (the excess ammonia presence
prevents the newly formed amino acid amine group from undergoing further
reaction to form a complex secondary or tertiary amine).

the malonic ester synthesis.

Better yields are obtained with the <b>Gabriel phthalimide
synthesis</b>, in which the a-halo esters are used instead of
&alpha;-halo acids as the potassium phthalimide salt might
react with the acid to re-form the phthalimide.

<p>
Preparation in this way produces the optically inactive
amino acid of course.

<h3>36.7 Reactions of amino acids</h3>

<p>
Any reactions typical of amino acids are typical of amines
and carboxylic acids.  Any other functional groups present undergo their
typical reactions as well.

<h3>36.8 Peptides.  Geometry of peptide linkage</h3>

<p>
A peptide linkage is a condensation reaction producing the
amide bond between successive amino acids.

<p>
X-ray studies show that the entire amide group is flat with
a carbonyl carbon, nitrogen, and four atoms attached to them all lie in a
plane.  The short C&minus;N bond (1.32 A compared with the usual 1.47 A
C&minus;N bond) shows considerable double bond character in the bond (~50%). 
For this reason, the nitrogen bond angles are not tetrahedral but approximate
trigonal carbon.

<p>
insert fig 36.1 on p 1142

<p>
Peptides are usually the fragments of proteins. But some have biological power
in their own right. Glutathione (g-glutamylcysteinylglycine), oxytocin (a
cyclic nonapeptide (Gly-Leu-Pro-Cys-Asn-Gln-Ile-Tyr-Cys; the Cys are &minus;
S&minus;S&minus; linked), and a-corticotropin are but a few (sheep protein:
SYSMEHFRWGKPVGKKRRPVKVYPAGEDDEASEAFPFEF).

<h3>36.9 Determination of structure of peptides.  Terminal residue analysis. 
Partial hydrolysis</h3>

<p>
Structures of protein are determined by (a) knowing what
amino acids there are and in what amount and (b) knowing the sequence they
follow each other in a chain.

<p>
Hydrolysis of peptides is done in acidic solution since
alkaline solutions cause racemization.  Gas chromatography can be used to
separate and analyze the methyl esters of these amino acids.  The relative
abundance of each amino acid is assessed in these mixtures.  The molecular
formula can be determined only from knowing the molecular weight.

<p>
Knowing the sequence is in itself quite difficult. Terminal residue analysis
and hydrolysis is one way. One method was reported by F. Sanger in 1945, in
which 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) undergoes nucleophilic substitution to
give the N-dinitrophenyl (DNP) derivative. The substituted peptide is
hydrolyzed to component amino acids, then the N-terminal residue identified as
having a 2,4-dinitrophenyl group.

<p>
P. Edman in 1950 found that phenyl isothiocyanate
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NCS) reacted with free amino groups in alkaline
medium to form a substituted thiourea, which could then be hydrolyzed with
aqueous HCl to form a phenylthiohydantoin. The beauty is that the rest of the
peptide is left intact.

<p>
For C-terminal residue analysis, the most successful method is enzymatic rather
than chemical. Pancreatic carboxypeptidase is typically used for this. As
fragments are produced, the enzyme can reveal which amino acid is next.
<p>
The sequence of glutathione was determined by partial acid hydrolysis. It
became clear that Cys was in the middle when g-GluCys and CysGly were isolated
as products. Using similar techniques, F. Sanger and coworkers determined the
structure of insulin.

<h3>36.10 Synthesis of peptides</h3>
<p>
Conformation of peptide sequence can come from its synthesis as well to show
identical physical and chemical properties. Fischer demonstrated that an amide
linkage was involved in proteins by preparing peptides.
<p>
The first problem involved in the synthesis is one involved with <i>protecting
the amino group</i>. In protecting functional groups, one prevents the reaction
of an added molecule with itself, so that it can react with a growing polymer.
One example is the benzoylation of glycine to protect its amino group, form its
acid chloride, allow the acid chloride to react with alanine, and thereby
obtain benzoylglycylalanine. But then removing the benzoyl group is not that
easy: its hydrolysis would hydrolyze the amide bond being made. Of the numerous
methods developed, one involves <b>acylation of benzyl chlorocarbonate,</b>
also called <b>carbobenzoxy chloride</b>. (M. Bergamann and L. Zervas
introduced this method involving an ester and acid chloride of carbonic acid in
1932.) The carbobenzoxy reagent is made by mixing phosgene (CO + Cl<sub>2</sub>
with activated charcoal) with benzyl alcohol; the alcohol should be added to
phosgene so that the dibenzoxy carbonate is not formed. The acid chloride
portion reacts with primary amines to form an amide. Removal of the
carbobenzoxy group is under conditions which do not affect peptide linkages:
either by catalytic hydrogenation of with HBr in cold acetic acid.

<p>
The method is fully illustrated with synthesis of
glycylalanine (Gly-Ala):

<p>
1. Carbobenzoxy chloride + glycine &minus;&minus;&rarr; carbobenzoxyglycine

<p>
2. Carbobenzoxyglycine + SOCl<sub>2</sub> &minus;&minus;&rarr; acid chloride of
carbobenzoxyglycine

<p>
3. acid chloride of carbobenzoxyglycine + alanine
&minus;&minus;&rarr;
carbobenzoxyglycylalanine 

<p>
4. carbobenzoxyglycylalanine + H<sub>2</sub>/Pd &minus;&minus;&rarr; Gly-Ala +
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>

<p>
Vincent du Vigneaud synthesized oxytocin using this method.

<p>
R. B. Merrifield has developed in automated peptide synthesizer (1969) in which
he synthesized the enzyme ribonuclease (124 residues) in 6 weeks. The chemistry
involves a <i>solid-phase</i> synthesis allowing attachment of the growing
peptide to solid substrate and repeated synthesis.

<h3>36.11 Proteins.  Classification and function.  Denaturation</h3>

<p>
Proteins are divided into two broad classes: <b>fibrous</b> and <b>globular</b>,
 the former being insoluble, the latter soluble. The solutions are actually
colloidal because of the large size of protein molecules.

<p>
Fibrous proteins are elongated in shape and thread-like,
lying side by side to form fibers generally held together by numerous hydrogen
bonds.  Solvents overcoming this intermolecular forces to dissolve the protein
must be very strong.  They are typically structural proteins, their
insolubility and fiber-forming tendency suiting their function.  <i>Keratin</i>
in skin, hair, nails, wool, horn, and feathers; <i>collagen</i> in
tendons; <i>myosin</i> in muscle; <i>fibroin</i> in silk.
<p>
Globular proteins are folded compact units which approach spheroidal shapes.
Hydrophobic surfaces turn inward, toward each other and away from water.
Hydrogen bonding is generally intramolecular, and areas of contact between
molecules small. Globular proteins are typically enzymes or hormones.

<h3>36.12-.13 Structure of proteins.  Peptide chain</h3>
<p>
Protein structure can be analyzed at many levels. The <i>primary</i> structure
is the way in which the atoms of protein molecules are joined to one another by
covalent bonds to form chains. The <i>secondary structure</i> is the way the
chains are arranged in space to form coils, sheets, compact spheroids, other
arrangements. Even higher order structures obtain.
<p>
The first level of structure is the peptide chain, wherein residues are linked
by amide bonds. The existence of amide chain linkages comes from hydrolysis of
proteins by acids, bases, and enzymes to produce peptides and amino acids. Ir
spectra demonstrate a characteristic amide group. X-ray data show secondary
structures which fit an amide linkage.

<h3>36.14 Side chains. Isoelectric point. Electrophoresis</h3>
<p>
On every 3rd atom of the chain is a side chain R group. In some groups, the
side chain is electrically charged, permitting the protein molecule to move in
an electric field. That a protein may have numerous charges permits its motion
in an electric field. This is <b>electrophoresis</b>.

<h3>36.15 Conjugated proteins.  Prosthetic groups.  Coenzymes</h3>

<p>
Some proteins contain a nonpeptide portion called a <b>prosthetic group</b>,
which is intimately concerned with the specific biological action of the
protein. <i>Heme</i> in hemoglobin is a good example, with an iron centered
about a pyrrole system known as a <i>porphin</i>. The forces holding heme to
the apoprotein include coordination of Fe by His nitrogen in the protein,
hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces between hydrophobic parts of the two
molecules.

<p>
Enzymes also require <i>cofactors</i> for catalysis: metal ions are one example.
 Organic factors are called <b>coenzymes</b>; if covalently attached to the
protein, they are also prosthetic groups. NAD is an example of a coenzyme.

<h3>36.16 Secondary structure of proteins</h3>

<p>
X-ray analysis has given much of what is understood about a protein's
secondary structure. This has come from observation of a structure with a
regular periodicity. Silk fibroin shows <i>repeat distances</i> of 7.0 A. The
&alpha;-keratin in unstretched wool shows a regular periodicity of 1.5 A and 5.1 A.

<p> Part of this work of solving secondary structure questions involves using
the known structures of amino acids and peptides and arranging models which have
the lowest free energy conformational states.  If the extended peptide chain is
considered as one possible conformation, the distance between <i>every other</i>
&alpha;-carbon will be 7.2 A.  These chains may lie side by side with one another
to form a <i>flat sheet</i>.  However, in arranging this sheet, the R groups,
except perhaps for polyglycine, would crowd each other.

<p>
Room can be made by contracting the chain to reduce the
every-other-residue distance to less than 7.2 A.  These chains lie side by
side, held together by hydrogen bonds, the contraction resulting in a <i>pleated
sheet</i>.  This structure is considered a <b>beta</b> arrangement and has been
proposed for silk fibroin, which has a repeat distance of 7.0 A.  Although 15
different kinds of amino acids are present in silk fibroin, 46% of them are
glycine, another 38% alanine and serine.  This makes sense since large R groups
should make it difficult to form this structure.

<p>
Larger side chains are best accommodated by a <i>helical</i> structure.
Hydrogen bonding occurs <i>within</i> the chain rather than between chains.
Linus Pauling (with R. B. Corey) has proposed that each helix has 3.6 amino
acid residues per turn. The pitch of each helix is 1.5 A, accounting for the
1.5 A repeat distances observed in &alpha;-keratin. (The 5.1 A repeat distance is a
tertiary structure difference, a helical helix, superhelix, or coiled coil,
with one turn for every 35 &alpha; helical turns.)
<p>
Sometimes &alpha;-keratin is stretched to a &beta;-keratin, resulting in
changes in its x-ray diffraction periodicity data. Uncoiled helixes form sheet
structures of a &beta; type, with intrachain H bonds now forming interchain H
bonds. The larger side chains present do not permit much extension (repeat
distance 6.4 A instead of 7.0 A).
<p>
Another structural type is represented by collagen. At the primary level, a
high proportion of proline and hydroxyproline are present, usually with
frequent repetitions of the sequence Gly-Pro-HOPro. Proline and h
ydroproline&prime;s amido nitrogen carries no hydrogen for H-bonding, nor does
the ring structure flatness nor amide group flatness permit extension in &beta;
sheeting nor helical formation in the &alpha; helix. The structure combines
beta-type bonding in sheets with alpha-type helical coiling: each chain twists
to a left-handed helix, and then binds intermolecularly (a Gly at every third
position permits placement) to two others to form a right-handed superhelix.

<h2>Chap. 37 Biochemical processes.  Molecular biology</h2>

<h3>37.1 Biochemistry, molecular biology, and organic chemistry</h3>

<h3>37.2 Mechanism of enzyme action.  Chymotrypsin</h3>

<p>
The sequence of chymotrypsin 245 amino acid residues is known, and x-ray
diffraction data has revealed molecular conformation.
<p>
The catalytic activity of the enzyme is similar to all chemical reactions
studied to this point. Chymotrypsin acts in two stages: in stage 1, an alcohol
function within the enzyme attacks the carbonyl group of the substrate amide in
a nucleophilic acyl substitution to form an ester and an amine, resulting in
fragmentation of the protein. In stage 2, the ester becomes hydrolyzed to
generate the carboxylic acid in the substrate, freeing the other fragment, and
regenerating the enzyme for the next catalytic cycle.
<p>
The alcohol function of the enzyme has been determined in studies saturating
the enzyme with substrate to build up a steady-state concentration of
intermediate ester, then quenching the reaction with acid to isolate the
intermediate. This intermediate has been found to be serine-195.
<p>
Other amino acids are vital, too. The rate of hydrolysis appears to depend upon
the pH of the solution. The fastest rate is at an optimal pH of 7.4, and
changing the pH to either side affects the activity. Hydrolysis requires the
presence of a free base with a p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of 7.0 and a protonated
base with p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of 9.5. The more acidic residue would be the
p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of a histidine imidazole, which fits with studies showing
imidazole being a catalyst itself. In the x-ray structure, a histidine-57 is
situated very closely to serine-195.
<p>
The stronger base with p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of 9.5 fits that for the
&alpha;-amino group of most amino acids. Acetylation of amino groups necessary for
catalysis eliminate or significantly reduce activity. Except for acetylation of
one residue, acetylation does not result in complete loss of activity. The
exception is isoleucine-16. When the pH is increased which reduces the
protonation on Ile-16, the optical rotation parameters of chymotrypsin changes,
suggesting conformational changes. Hence, Ile-16 is believed to hold the
protein into proper shape which supports catalysis.

<p>
The role of His-57 appears to be in a base-assisted hydrolysis or esterolysis.
While the Ser-195 alcohol group is nucleophilic in itself, it becomes more
nucleophilic when the proton is pulled from it to make a partial alkoxy group.

<h3>37.3 The source of biological energy.  The role of ATP</h3>
<p>
A philosophical discussion of how energy is ultimately obtained from the
sun, produced and consumed in a cycle of CO<sub>2</sub>  and H<sub>2</sub>O to
energy-rich substances and O<sub>2</sub>.  In all living forms, the energy is
harnessed with simple reductions in the level of energy in one molecule to the
other.  The ultimate currency of that energy is ATP.
<p>
The energy in ATP is contained in its readiness to phosphorylate. For example,
ATP reacts with alcohols (on proteins or nonprotein organic substrates) to form
ADP and a phosphate ester. It is highly reactive for the reason that it is an
anhydride and places phosphates more easily than does acetic acid compared to
acetic anhydride.

<h3>37.4 Biological oxidation of carbohydrates</h3>
<p>
Starting with glycogen and proceeding to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O in
the oxidation process is a long multi-step process. The trip is broken down to
three stages: (a) breaking glycogen into its component glucose molecules; (b)
breaking the glucose into three-carbon molecules, called <i>glycolysis</i>; (c)
converting these three-carbon compounds to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O in
a process called <i>respiration</i>. Oxygen consumption is required in the
third stage.
<p>
The first stage is cleavage of glycogen [indicated as hydrolysis in the book,
but actually phosphorolysis]. Glycolysis in the second stage requires 11
reactions and 11 enzymes, forming 2 lactate, 2 water molecules, and 2 ATP
molecules from a single glucose. The third stage is a complex, in which
glycolysis is diverted at the pyruvate stage, oxidized to acetic acid in a
highly energized form, acetyl-coenzyme A, which is fed into the Krebs cycle.
