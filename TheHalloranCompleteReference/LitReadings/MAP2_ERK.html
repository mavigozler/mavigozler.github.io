Purification and characterization of a protein kinase from <i>Xenopus</i>
eggs highly specific for ribosomal protein S6
<p class="1stP">
S6 from oocytes is almost all in unphosphorylated form; from unfertilized
eggs, it is maximally phosphorylated.  Hence the substrate was
obtained by purification of 40S subunits from oocytes, whereas S6 kinase was
obtained from unfertilized eggs.  The
20-40% ammonium sulfate fraction of extracts contained much of the S6 kinase
activity, with specific activity 2- to 2.5-fold higher than in the 0-20% and
40-50% fractions.  There was no sensitivity to the PK-A peptide inhibitor.
Gradient elution off DEAE-cellulose indicated two peaks eluting at 90
and 160 mM NaCl, with equal amounts of activity in both.
After dialysis in a buffer for loading on to Mono S, peak II
from DEAE was loaded on to the FPLC column and eluted in a
gradient using KCl at 200 mM.  Subsequent Sephacryl S-200
purification was done with a single peak eluting.  (Re-chromatography
using internal stds shows elution at 70-80 kDa.)  Mono Q purification
was done resulting at least a 20-fold purification, eluting
at 235 mM NaCl.  Afterward a heparin-Sepharose column was used
in a 0 to 1 M NaCl gradient, with activity eluting at 0.5 M NaCl.
A final purification of 500-fold of DEAE peak II is achieved with
a 10% recovery of original activity.  Only fractions of
the highest specific activity from Mono S, Mono Q, and heparin-Sepharose were
pooled.  The assay system involved use
of a 0.4 &mu;M 40S subunit concentration, about 1/10 of the K<sub>m</sub>
of the enzyme.  On SDS gels, a single silver-stained band in the final step
(heparin column) showed a protein at M<sub>r</sub> 92,000.
<p>
It has been previously shown that the S6 kinase
autophosphorylates when labeled ATP is added alone, with a 0.4 mol
P/mol enzyme final stoichiometry.  The rate of this
autophosphorylation is rapid.  Another very
good substrate in Kemptide, and results of phosphorylation of the pure S6 show
good activity.  In the presence of heat-stable PK-A inhibitor, activity
to Kemptide was actually 2-fold greater and not inhibited.  By comparison,
a 70 nmol/min/mg S6 kinase activity is found with 100 &mu;M Kemptide,
which shows a 10,500 nmol/min/mg PK-A catalytic subunit activity.
<p>
The Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence was observed to be optimal between
10 and 30 mM (the range of 1.2 to 50 mM was tested).  Mn<sup>2+</sup>
dependence indicated an optimal range of 1.5 to 3 mM (1 to 5 mM tested),
although 0.6 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> was present in all tests because they
were present in substrates and enzymes added.  Addition of Mn<sup>2+</sup> to
reactions already containing 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> did not enhance activity,
but instead resulted in inhibition:  at 2.5 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup>, there
was 20% inhibition; at 5 mM, 40%.  K<sub>m</sub>
determinations for the S6 kinase show 28 &mu;M for ATP and 5 &mu;M for the 40S
subunit, although the 40S K<sub>m</sub> is
estimated since it was not possible to achieve saturable concentrations of 40S
subunit for the kinase.  Specific
activities of 300 nmol/min/mg after Mono Q (where S6 kinase ~33% of the total
protein) are achievable with 330 &mu;M ATP (saturable) and 5.6 &mu;M 40S
subunit (at K<sub>m</sub>).
<p>
Inhibitor studies indicated inhibition by &beta;-glycerophosphate,
NaF, and KP<sub>i</sub>, which were very potent with K<sub>i</sub>
about 15-30 mM.  Heparin also inhibited (IC<sub>50</sub>=30 &mu;g/ml).
In addition, ADP, quercetin, and spermine inhibited 50% of activity at
200, 10, and 500 &mu;M, resp.  No effect was observed with CaCl<sub>2</sub>,
ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, sodium vanadate, or trifluoperazine (all at 0.1 mM),
nor with cAMP, cGMP, EGTA, or calmodulin.

Rapid stimulation by insulin of a serine/threonine kinase in 3T3-L1
adipocytes that phosphorylates microtubule associated protein-2 <i>in vitro</i>
<p class="1stP">
3T3-L1 cells are treated for 10 min with 80 nM insulin resulting
in a 1.5- to 3-fold stimulation of a kinase which phosphorylates in vitro a
bovine brain MAP-2.  The stimulation was
concentration-dependent (half-maximal at 5 nM).
EGTA inclusion at all concentrations indicated no calcium
dependence.  Extracts of control and
treated cells centrifuged at 150,000 &times; <i>g</i> for 60 min separated the activity into
the supernatant, revealing the kinase's soluble nature.
The same activity results were true,
however, for lower speed spins (30,000 &times; <i>g</i> for 5 min) using MAP-2 as
substrate.  Extract supntnts gel-filtered on G-25 generally demonstrated
no loss or major increase in activity, indicating that low MW factors
are not necessary for activity other than MgATP.
<p>
Phosphoamino acid analysis of the substrate MAP-2 showed
serine to be phosphorylated primarily, with threonine to a lesser extent.
Since phosphotyrosine is degraded to some
extent by acid hydrolysis, MAP-2 phosphorylated by membrane fractions of
EGF-induced A431 cells showed a phosphotyrosine content on the same figure.
<p>
An insulin-induced kinase phosphorylating ribosomal
protein S6 has been described and a time course of MAP-2 and S6 kinase activity
is compared.  Increased MAP-2 kinase
activity is found in 3T3-L1 extracts within 5 min, is maximal at the 10 min
point, and declines toward basal levels in the 20-40 min range since insulin
treatment.  The S6 kinase activity
developed more slowly, lagging the MAP-2 kinase activity, was maximal at the
20 min time point, and never declined to only 80% of the maximal after 40 min.
<p>
The stability of the kinases were tested in extracts
treated at 30&deg; for a 10-30 min period.
Homogenates were done in &beta;-glycerol
phosphate, previously shown to protect an S6 kinase from Swiss 3T3 cells.
While the S6 kinase never lost more than half of its activity after 30 min.,
the MAP-2 kinase activity virtually disappeared.
<p>
Biochemical differences in MAP-2 and S6 kinase activity
were found in phosphocellulose chromatography, in which the S6 kinase was bound
with the buffer used and which was eluted with 0.5 M NaCl.
MAP-2 kinase did not adsorb.
Chromatography of extracts which had been
treated with insulin or diluent for 5 or 40 min were run on phosphocellulose as
well.  The MAP-2 kinase activity elutes
in a very broad peak in the unbound phases (effluent and wash) for the
insulin-treated 5 min activity, and in a narrower peak from the wash with the
other treatments and times.  S6 kinase
activity always comes off at 0.5 M salt, and the activity was much higher in
the 40 min extract than the 5 min extract.
<p>
Phosphatase inhibitors were tried to determine which
phosphatases might be at work de-activating the MAP-2 kinase activity.
40 mM <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl phosphate addition allowed
81% and 50% of the activity to remain after 10 and 30 min at 30&deg;, whereas
controls showed 12% remaining after 10 min.  Phosphotyrosine at 40 mM was
as effective as &beta;-glycerol phosphate at 80 mM, preserving 44% and 17%
after 10 and 30 min.  Phosphoserine was without effect.

Insulin-stimulated microtubule-associated protein kinase is
phosphorylated on tyrosine and threonine <i>in vivo</i>
<p class="1stP">
3T3-L1 cells were pre-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> and
then insulin-treated or not treated for a 10 min period.
Extracts were applied to DEAE-cellulose, step-eluted
with 0.35 M NaCl, and taken to phenyl-Superose FPLC as in the previous
method.  Kinase activity to a MAP-2 substrate was measured against
control and insulin-treated extracts, and peak eluting from the
insulin-treated extracts was found (not in the control material).
Proteins were analyzed by autoradiography on SDS gels.  A 38- to
42-kDa phosphoprotein was found to appear as a co-elute with the MAP kinase
activity.  Densitometric quantitation of
the radioactivity indicated a correlation of the activity in fractions from
insulin-treated material with MAP kinase activity.
<p>
Characterization of phenyl-Superose-purified material on
Superose 12 column indicated a similar correlation between phosphorylation of
this pp40 and MAP kinase activity when fractions were analyzed.
The activity eluted from Superose with an
apparent MW of 35 kDa.  When gels of
phenyl-Superose fractions were incubated in 1 M KOH (which dephosphorylates Ser
and Thr residues but not alkali-stable phosphoTyr), all other proteins had dramatically
reduced phosphate content as judged by the autorad, while labeling of the pp40
was only slightly reduced.  An
additional phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed the presence of phosphoTyr.
The plate also shows a relatively less
amount of P-Thr present as well.
<p>
Phenyl-Superose purified-MAP kinase was additionally
purified by gel filtration (to remove the presence of
<i>p</i>-nitrophenyl phosphate).  The peak fractions
from the column were pooled and incubated with
anti-P-Y antibodies pre-adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads.
After incubation for 4 h at 4&deg; in a buffer
containing 1 mg/ml BSA, leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, the reaction was
centrifuged.  From 3 experiments, 14% &plusmn;
2% of the total kinase activity was removed by immunoadsorption.
Incubation of the pelleted beads with buffer
containing 10 mM <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl phosphate released
70% &plusmn; 13% of the kinase activity which had been
adsorbed.  When kinase activity was incubated in immuno
beads in the presence of 10 mM pNPP, only 1% of the activity
was immunoadsorbed.  (None of this data on immunoadsorption is shown.)

Insulin-stimulated MAP-2 kinase phosphorylates and activates
ribosomal protein S6 kinase II
<p class="1stP">
INTRO. In every report investigating mitogen-stimulated cells,
S6 kinase activity is shown to be elevated.
Direct tyrosine phosphorylation of S6 kinase has not been shown in vitro
however, since purified S6 kinase II in not an in vitro substrate for the
insulin receptor kinase, pp60<i><sup>v-src</sup></i>, or the Abelson
murine leukemia virus tyrosine kinase.  Immunoprecipitates
of extracts of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled
insulin-treated oocytes in which an antiserum to the kinase fail to reveal the
presence of phosphotyrosine.  Moreover,
serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases de-activate the S6 kinase II.
Extracts of all mitogen-stimulated cells
studied so far contain elevated S6 kinase activity, especially
insulin-stimulated oocytes and other cells.
Direct activation of S6 kinase is possible, but the S6 K II is not a
substrate in vitro for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase nor
pp60<i><sup>y-src</sup></i>
nor the Abelson MLV-associated tyrosine kinase.
Immunoprecipitates of S6 K II show no presence of phosphoTyr
after insulin stimulation.  S6 K II is
deactivated by treatment with protein phosphatase 1 and 2A in vitro, however,
showing an indirect mechanism.  PK-C and
PK-A are not able to reactivate S6 K II after phosphatase treatment;
that the MAP-2 kinase is activated by
insulin and cannot phosphorylate histones, casein, S6, or of a number of
substrates with insulin-stimulated increased phosphate content indicates an
indirect effect.
<p>
Partially purified MAP kinase is shown to reactivate the
S6 K II which had been deactivated by prior incubation with phosphatase 1 and
2A.  The phosphatase 2A treatment
reduced S6 K II activity 98%, according to the amount of S6 protein able to
incorporate <sup>32</sup>P-ATP, according
to a quantitation method by Erikson &amp; Maller (<i>JBC</i> <b>261</b>: 350,
1986).  Phosphatase 1 treatment has been
previously shown to reduce activity by 60%.
MAP kinase used after phosphatase treatment (NaF was brought to 10 mM or
240 U of inhibitor-2 was added to inhibit the phosphatases at least 90% by use
of a phosphorylase <i>a</i> standard)
restored activity 30 to 60% of the control value.
S6 K II which had not been phosphatase-treated was activated
2-fold by MAP kinase.  Activation was
fully dependent upon addition of MAP kinase, and was not observed when the MAP
kinase had been heated to 80&deg; for 2 min.
<p>
The amount of activation was directly correlated with the
amount of phosphorylation of S6 kinase.
With maximal reactivation, there was ~0.5 mol P/mol S6 kinase.
The activation was much greater than that
activation occurring with autophosphorylation.
Phosphopeptides mapped by TLE/C cellulose indicated that MAP kinase
created two new phosphopeptides in the S6 kinase.
The same pattern was seen regardless of whether the S6 kinase was
phosphatase 1-treated.  Similar results
were seen with phosphatase 2A-deactivated S6 kinase treated with the MAP
kinase, indicating that at least one phosphorylation site for MAP kinase is
distinct from autophosphorylation sites and that MAP kinase merely does not
stimulate autophosphorylation.
Phosphoamino acid analysis of these peptides from MAP-treated S6 kinase
with or without prior phosphatase treatment indicated that only threonine was
present.  Since the autophosphorylation
sites are serine, then the MAP kinase phosphorylates threonine as one of its
residues.
<p>
MAP kinase prepared from insulin-treated 3T3-L1 cell
extracts, in which insulin is known to induce a 20-fold activation of MAP
kinase in these cells, was shown to reactivate the S6 kinase which had been
deactivated by phosphatase 1 or 2A.
This proves that the activity capable of S6 kinase reactivation is
stimulated by insulin and is associated with elevated MAP kinase activity.
The greater degree of reactivation of
ph&#146;tase 2A-treated S6 kinase compared to ph&#146;tase 1-treated kinase merely
reflects the ability of ph&#146;tase 2A to inhibit S6 kinase to a greater degree
than ph&#146;tase 1, and the ability of MAP kinase to restore the activation.
A subsequent ph&#146;tase treatment after MAP
kinase activation was able to deactivate the S6 kinase once again.
<p>
The partially purified MAP kinase was subjected to
Superose 12 chromatography (in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1
mM DTT) to achieve additional purification of the MAP kinase; it was the major
protein in its fraction.  MAP kinase
activity, S6 phosphorylating activity, and S6 re-activating activity all
co-eluted from the column.
<p>
The MAP kinase is known to become active in insulin-treated
3T3-L1 cells just prior to S6 kinase activation.
Previous work shows that phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine are
the phosphorylated amino acids.  We now
show that ph&#146;tase 2A treatment of the MAP kinase results in its time-dependent
inactivation.  Ph&#146;tase 1 had no
effect.  It is known that ph&#146;tase 1 is
absolutely specific for P-Ser and P-Thr, but ph&#146;tase 2 can dephosphorylate
P-Tyr.  We have been unable to
reactivate the MAP kinase with any tyrosine kinases in vitro so far, including
the insulin receptor kinase.

Characterization of insulin-stimulated microtubule-associated
protein kinase:  rapid isolation and stabilization of a novel
serine/threonine kinase from 3T3-L1 cells
<p class="1stP">
3T3-L1 cells are treated with insulin (80 nM, 10 min) and found
to have 1.5- to 3-fold MAP kinase which persists after DEAE-cellulose
chromatography.  Elution of a single-peak at 0.25 M NaCl is shown
(the extraction buffer contains p-NO<sub>2</sub> phenyl phosphate
and PMSF as the only inhibitors).  Some MAP kinase elutes
during washing of the column.
<p>
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography was successful with
either phenyl-Sepharose or -Superose.
Low salt buffers allowed adsorption while high concentrations of
ethylene glycol were necessary for elution.
A simultaneous gradient of NaCl (250 to 25 mM) and ethylene glycol
(0-60%) was employed over 12 column volumes of phenyl-Superose.
A large amount of the activity did not
adsorb to the column and was eluted during washing.
However, the insulin-treated extracts did yield an adsorbed MAP
kinase peak eluting at 30% ethylene glycol
<p>
Gel filtration on Superose 12 of cellular extracts had
shown the MAP kinase to elute just ahead of carbonic anhydrase
(apparent MW of 35,000).  Gel filtration of
phenyl-Superose eluted activity also demonstrated the 35,000 apparent MW.
Peak fractions from phenyl-Superose were concentrated and then centrifuged
in glycerol gradients with a kinase activity at M<sub>r</sub> 37,000.
The activity was found to be unstable as reported previously, but
phenyl-Superose peak fractions stored at -70&deg; in 1 mg/ml BSA
maintained activity suitably.  In further preparations of the
kinase, extracts were applied to DEAE, step-eluted with 0.35 M
NaCl, purified as above on phenyl-Superose, then
activity concentrated in presence of BSA.
<p>
Protein purification of extracts which had been
pre-incubated with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>
i</sub> allowed following additional
purification from phenyl-Superose on to gel filtration.
BSA was added as a carrier during these
steps.  Silver-stained SDS gel analysis
of fractions from Superose 12 showed a 40 kDa which correlated with the MAP
kinase activity in the fractions, which is the only phosphoprotein detectable.
It was previously reported that
phosphotyrosine and -threonine are present.
<p>
Ultra high-speed spins have shown the kinase to be
cytosolic.  Particulates were
resuspended and catalyze MAP-2 phosphorylation only 11% of the
supernatant.  Mixing of the supernatant
and pellet roughly catalyzed the same rate as the supernatant alone,
demonstrating that no ATPases were responsible for inability of pellet to cause
MAP-2 phosphorylation.
<p>
Kinetic studies on the enzyme showed that ATP was the
preferred phosphate donor, with GTP phosphate transfer being negligible.
MAP-2 as a substrate was analyzed from 60 to
1000 &mu;g/ml.  An apparent K<sub>
m</sub> range of 4-12 &mu;M is determined by linear
regression analysis.  Substrate
specificity found that MAP-2 was preferential.
Casein phosphorylation, while detected, was &lt;10% of MAP-2 levels.
Phosvitin, protamine, histones, ribosomal
protein S6, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and ATP-citrate lyase were phosphorylated
poorly, if at all.  The pH optimum range
was determined using extract supernatants, with optimal activity found in a
broad range about a peak of pH 8.
Potassium fluoride was found to inhibit the kinase, reduced 50% with 60
mM KF present.  Half-maximal inhibition
was observed with 45 mM &beta;-glycerophosphate,
and heparin in the range of 0.5-5.0 &mu;g/ml had no effect, but higher concentrations
slightly stimulated incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P
into MAP-2.
<p>
<u>Discussion</u>.  The MAP-2 kinase has now been identified in 3T3-L1 cells,
BC3-H1 and 23A2 myocytes, H4 hepatocytes, and freshly isolated rat
adipocytes and hepatocytes.  The MAP-2 kinase isolated
from TIG-3 human lung fibroblastic cells by Hoshi et al. (1988), which is
activated by insulin and other growth factors, and which does not adsorb to
phosphocellulose (like MAP kinase), is probably not the same MAP-2 kinase here
since that kinase is inhibited by low Ca<sup>2+</sup>
concentrations.  This MAP-2 kinase has
been shown to phosphorylate the S6 kinase II recently isolated by Maller&#146;s
group.  Other kinases (various tyrosine
kinases, PK-C, PK-A catalytic subunit, casein kinases I and II) fail to
activate this kinase.  The soluble Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent serine
kinase isolated from insulin-stimulated rat adipocytes is not the
MAP-2 kinase, since it activity fell with high Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels
(the levels used for MAP-2 kinase), gel filtration analysis estimated a
M<sub>r</sub> of 50,000 to 60,000, 60 mM fluoride was
tested and did not inhibit, and the kinase preferred histones and ATP-citrate
lyase, which are hardly touched by MAP-2 kinase.
A recently reported membrane-bound serine/threonine kinase from
rat adipocytes preferring histone and stimulated by insulin may be distinct
from the MAP-2 kinase since the MAP-2 kinase is soluble and does poorly on
histones.  Casein kinase I, known to
phosphorylate MAP-2, and casein kinase II, known to be stimulated by insulin,
and both of which have in whole or in subunit similar sizes to MAP-2 kinase,
may nonetheless be distinct; MAP-2
kinase does poorly with casein, cannot utilize GTP (casein kinase II does
equally well with GTP or ATP), is not inhibited by heparin (a strong inhibitor
of casein kinase II), and does not adsorb to phosphocellulose (shown for casein
kinase I under the same buffer conditions).
Furthermore, MAP-2 kinase is not likely to be protein kinase C, whose
proteolytically cleaved form, protein kinase M, is larger than MAP-2 kinase and
easily phosphorylates protamine.  Also
distinguished from the protease-activated kinase II, which is slightly larger,
adsorbs to P-cellulose, and readily phosphorylates ribosomal S6 subunit.

Phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein-2 by MAP
kinase primarily involves the projection domain
<p class="1stP">
<u>Intro</u>.  MAP-2 is a phosphoprotein shown to stimulate
tubulin assembly in vitro and to mediate
interaction between microtubules and other subcellular components.
Chymotrypsinolysis of MAP-2 results in
cleavage into two domains: (1) a small 32-39 kDa fragment able to bind tubulin
and (2) a large 240 kDa projection domain.
PK-A phosphorylates both domains, and phosphorylation of the tubulin
binding domain inhibits MAP-2-assisted assembly, presumably by interfering
with ionic interactions of the basic amino acid repeats with the acidic
region in the tubulin COOH terminus.)
<p>
MAP-2 is phosphorylated in the presence of labeled ATP by
the MAP kinase or by PK-A and then digested by chymotrypsin over a time course
(from 0.5 to 16 min) and run on SDS gels.
Both Coomassie stains and autorads reveal the emergence of two bands at
39 and 31 kDa along with a 240 kDa band which represent the tubulin-binding
domain fragments and projection domain, resp.
The results show that the projection domain is the only labeled fragment
from MAP kinase phosphorylation while both domains are labeled as a result of
PK-A phosphorylation.  Note that
previous work has shown protein kinase C to be distinct from the MAP kinase as
it phosphorylates MAP in the tubulin-binding domain.

Evidence that pp42, a major tyrosine kinase target protein, is a
mitogen-activated serine/threonine protein kinase
<p class="1stP">
The pp42 characterized by Kazlauskas and Cooper (1988) was
compared to the adipocyte MAP kinase on 2-D polyacrylamide gels.
pp42A is more acidic than pp42B, and the
relative abundance of the two seems to depend upon the method of lysate
preparation.  pp42A is the principal
form observed in the EGF-stimulated 3T3 fibroblasts, is alkali-resistant
with a pI 6.8, and 42 kDa and is not present in controls.
<sup>32</sup>P-MAP kinase was partially purified by DEAE-cellulose
and phenyl-Superose and then run on 2-D gel:  it was also alkali-resistant
with similar pI and MW.  Superimposition
of autorads verified this co-migration, and mixtures of the labeled MAP-kinase
and <sup>32</sup>P-labeled EGF-treated cell lysates did not show resolution
into two spots, indicating identity in pI and MW.
<p>
The pp42A and MAP-kinase spots from separate 2-D gels were
removed and subjected to V8 protease for Cleveland peptide mapping.
Both spots produced a major labeled band of
M<sub>r</sub> 29,000, although the pp42
digest revealed smaller bands which may be the result of its impurity.
A tryptic digest of both spots also revealed
similar maps nonetheless.
<p>
Swiss 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with EGF and extracts
analyzed by SDS gel resolved immunoblots using an anti P-Y probe demonstrated a
phosphotyrosine-containing protein at 42 kDa.
This was also found in cells stimulated with insulin and PMA.
The MAP kinase and 42 kDa protein were
purified on DEAE-cellulose and phenyl-Superose.
Fractions which phosphorylate MAP (a single peak in 3 fractions
at ca. 0.1 M NaCl/37% ethylene glycol) were run on SDS gels and immunoblotted
with anti P-Y.  A 42 kDa band
corresponding to the peak of activity is revealed.
Control cells showed neither activity nor the 42 kDa band.
The same is true for the EGF-stimulated
fibroblasts containing pp42A.
Additional purification through Superose 12 verifies co-elution of
activity and immunoblottable 42 kDa band for the respective kinases.
A biochemical identity is established.
<p>
All effluents, washes, and elutions were thoroughly
characterized with anti P-Y immunoblots.
Large volumes of fractions were precipitated with TCA/deoxycholate to
ensure that low protein concentrations were not affecting the appearance
of the 42 kDa protein.  Except for the
phenyl-Superose wash, in which the detected 42 kDa band could be pp42B,
the 42 kDa band is found only where MAP kinase activity is found.
This firmly suggests that the pp42 protein is MAP-2 kinase.

Requirement for integration of signals from two distinct
phosphorylation pathways for activation of MAP kinase
<p class="1stP">
MAP kinase was purified from fibroblasts treated with EGF (30 nM, 10 min)
and shown to be active.  The protein was incubated over a time course of
0, 15, 45 and 60 min with protein phosphatase 2A and the membrane
glycoprotein protein tyrosine phosphatase, CD45.  (The reaction for protein
phosphatase 2A is stopped with 10 mM NaF + 1 mM EDTA; 0.2 mM sodium
vanadate for CD45).  MAP kinase activity is assessed with MBP.
Both phosphatases inactivate the MAP kinase,
although phosphatase 2A is a little faster than CD45.
Since the reaction was done in the presence of protease inhibitors,
and there was no shift in mobility of labeled phosphoprotein from relative
M<sub>r</sub> of 42,000, and incubation of the kinase
with inclusion of the above phosphatase inhibitors with phosphatase addition
for periods longer than 60 min still left sufficient kinase activity, it is
apparent that loss of kinase activity does not result from degradation or
thermal denaturation.
<p>
The CD45 was prepared using immunoaffinity chromatography
and lacked Ser/Thr phosphatase activity.
1 &mu;M okadaic acid did not affect the ability of CD45 to inactivate MAP
kinase.  Since okadaic acid at this
concentration inhibits phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B, phosphorylation of tyrosine
on MAP kinase is therefore regulatory.
<p>
Phosphoamino acid analysis verifies these results as
well.  Phosphotyrosine and -threonine
are the only phosphorylated residues present in active MAP kinase.
When incubated with inactivated CD45 and
phosphatase 2A, there is no apparent change in the spot size.
Incubation with active phosphatase 2A
inactivates the enzyme and eliminates the P-Thr spot while not changing the
P-Tyr spot.  On the other hand, CD45
incubation for a period serving to partially or completely de-activate MAP
kinase also correlated with partial spot reduction or complete spot elimination
of the P-Tyr spot without affecting the P-Thr spot.
Both phosphatases are necessary to remove phosphate from either
residues completely.
<p>
From the work, it can be concluded that phosphorylation of
both threonine and tyrosine residues is necessary to activate the MAP kinase.
This is the first time that phosphorylation
of different species of amino acids is required.
With MPF, p34<i><sup>cdc2</sup></i> subunit must be de-phosphorylated
on both tyrosines and threonines during interphase in order for activation to
occur, which permits transition in the G1-S and G2-M phases.
Placental tyrosine phosphatase 1B, which has
some homology with CD45 was less effective in de-activating and
de-phosphorylating MAP kinase, although it is much more effective than CD45
toward labeled phosphotyrosyl-lysozyme, suggesting some substrate specificity
of these phosphatases.
<p>
A model in which integration of serine/threonine kinases
and tyrosine kinases to activate a common cascade intermediate
is suggested by the requirement for double phosphorylation needed
for activation of MAP-2 kinase.

Nerve growth factor stimulates a protein kinase in PC-12 cells
that phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein-2
<p class="1stP">
NGF has been shown to increase the phosphorylation of a number
of proteins in PC12 cells, including some MAPs.
These changes also shown with EGF.  PC12 extracts either
stimulated with NGF or EGF were assayed for MAP-2 kinase activity,
incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P being assessed by autoradiographs
of SDS-PAGE gels.  The lysates of the NGF-treated cells consistently
showed a 2-4-fold increase compared to controls, which the EGF-treated
cell lysates show a 1.5- to 2.5-fold enhancement.
<p>
When 100 nM staurosporine is added to the NGF-treated
cells, the MAP-2 phosphorylation increases are abolished.
Phosphorylation activity in controls remain
unaffected however.  Staurosporine
failed to inhibit EGF-induced MAP kinase activity, indicating that EGF works
through another mechanism than does NGF.
In contrast, addition of 100 nM K252a or 25 &mu;M H-7 to cells caused a
2-fold increase in MAP kinase activity of both the NGF- and EGF-treated cells,
but they had no effect by themselves on the MAP kinase increases.
K252a and staurosporine are thought to be
potent inhibitors of PK-C, but there is a possibility that they may inhibit
other kinases as well.
<p>
The kinases which might possibly be involved were analyzed.
The PK-A (Walsh) peptide inhibitor added to the assay had no
effect on any reaction, showing the PK-A independence of the
activity.  Direct addition of K252a and staurosporine (100 nM both)
also had no effect, showing they work in situ.  In addition, there
was no Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement for the kinase activity, so it
was possible to exclude both PK-C and a CaM-sensitive kinase.
Addition of 0.5 &mu;M heparin activated the kinase 58%, which shows
that casein kinase is not involved as it is very sensitive to heparin.
The NGF-stimulated extract kinase activity could be reduced to basal
levels by addition of 50 mM NaF, showing that it is
the insulin-sensitive MAP kinase from 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
<p>
The NGF dose dependence studies indicated that 0.3 nM NGF
was the half-maximal dose, 1 nM the dose at which maximal activity was
obtained.  Data from the steady state binding
analysis at 37&deg; done previously (Schechter &amp; Bothwell,
<i>Cell</i> <b>24</b>: 867, 1981) with a equilibrium dissociation
constant of 0.2 nM matches close with the EC<sub>50</sub> measure.
Time course data seemed to indicate two phases of activation.  The
first phase is marked by a rapid MAP kinase activation holding a
maximum between 5-10 min, then declining (but not reaching basal)
to a point at 20-25 min.  The second phase is marked by another
activation to a maximum at 30 min (about 40% of the first maximum),
followed by a slow decline that still had not reached basal at the
last time point (120 min); the activity at the 60 min and
120 min time point were the same.  If the PK-C activator PMA
had been added 10 min prior to NGF addition, the first
maximum was unaffected but the second (delayed onset) maximum
of MAP kinase activity was potentiated (about double the maximum
without PMA).  It is interesting to not that these kinetics
are identical with the kinetics of EGF-induced activation of S6
kinase activity in Swiss 3T3 cells (Susa et al., Cell 57:
817, 1989), in which the authors attributed the second phase of
activation to effects of PK-C.
<p>
PC12 cells preincubated instead with staurosporine, K252a,
or H7 10 min prior to NGF addition were assessed in a time course.
Staurosporine completely abolished the first
phase, while K252a had a stimulating effect.
Neither staurosporine or K252a affected the late phase.
H7 slightly enhanced both the first and
second phase of activation.  These
results taken together provide no evidence for a role for PK-C in mediating
these effects.
<p>
Biochemical characterization was done using FPLC Mono Q in
which both control and NGF-treated cell extracts were partially purified.
A major species of kinase activity was
eluted at 0.25 M NaCl, in which the NGF-treated was more than 3-fold greater
than control cells.  A minor MAP kinase
(which had the same specific activity in NGF-treated and controls) eluted just
ahead at 0.16 M NaCl.  Both gel
filtration (Superose 12) and sucrose density gradient centrifugation of cell
lysates fixed the apparent MW at 36,000 and 41,000, resp.
The NGF-treated extracts always had
significantly greater specific activity.
Elution profile comparison with standards on the Superose 12 column show
a Stokes radius of 31 Å.  Mono
Q-purified material eluted at the same point.
The peak fractions from the Mono Q column were used to load the 5-20%
sucrose density gradient, which were centrifuged to sedimentation equilibrium.
The sedimentation coefficient was 3.6 S.  A frictional rate was calculated to
be 1.16, suggesting a globular protein of symmetrical aspect.
<p>
Mono Q-purified enzyme was assessed for several
properties.  Product vs. time functions
showed linearity up to and beyond 15 min.
With 0.2 mg/ml MAP-2 and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, ATP is the preferred
substrate.  Unlabeled. GTP added 5-fold
in excess of labeled ATP did not affecting substrate labeling, showing it to be
a poor donor.  K<sub>m</sub> for ATP was
12 &mu;M while V<sub>max</sub> was 2.9 pmol min<sup>-1</sup>.
Both Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>
could support activity, although Mg<sup>2+</sup> is preferred.
Addition of 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to the Mg<sup>2+</sup>
preparation caused 60% inhibition.
Addition of Zn<sup>2+</sup> also
markedly reduced activity, possibly by catalyzing reduction of a sulfhydryl.
<p>
NGF-treated extracts were also incubated 60 min with calf
intestinal alkaline phosphatase.  Both
control and phosphatase-treated extracts were purified on Mono Q.
The phosphatase-treated extracts showed a
substantial reduction in activity compared to controls.
The peak of activity appeared to elute
somewhat early, consistent with the loss of a negatively charged group.
Lysates which were first purified on Mono Q
then treated with phosphatase showed similar results.
Taken together, there is a likelihood the MAP kinase is itself
affected by phosphorylation.

A 42-kD tyrosine kinase substrate linked to chromaffin cell
secretion exhibits an associated MAP kinase activity and is highly related
to a 42 kD mitogen-stimulated protein in fibroblasts
<p class="1stP">
Cultured chromaffin cells were treated for various periods with
nicotine, carbachol, and K<sup>+</sup>.
Detergent extracts prepared in the presence
of sodium vanadate were run on SDS gels and immunoblotted with anti-PY
polyclonal.  PY-containing proteins are
normally present in quiescent cells, and proteins at 120, 80, 65,45, and 42 kDa
increase in PY content with stimulation.
The pp42 and pp45 bands increased their phosphate content within 1
min.  By densitometry of autorads, a
30-fold maximum was reached for pp42 and 15-fold maximum for pp45 in 3
min.  These returned to unstimulated
levels in 0.5 to 3 h.
<p>
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence
of phosphorylation was assessed by including Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the
medium with either K<sup>+</sup> or nicotine stimulation over a time course.
Tritiated norepinephrine release was assayed as well.  Phosphorylation
of pp42 and pp45 was tested using anti-PY on immunoblots and doing
densitometry on autorads.  Tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of
pp42 is rapid, the maximum occurring within 1-2 min and preceding
the maximal release time of neurotransmitter.  2 mM EGTA is shown
to inhibit this process.  A role for pp42 in neurotransmitter
release is suggested.
<p>
Nicotine-stimulated and control chromaffin cells and extracts
are centrifuged into cytosolic and crude membrane fractions.
Both PY-containing p42 and p45 are found in
the cytosol.  Addition of 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> or 2 mM EGTA did
not alter the localization; association of pp60<sup>c-src</sup>
to membranes has been shown to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent.
<p>
Immunoblots prepared for extracts of (a) K<sup>+</sup>-depolarized
PC12 cells, (b)insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes,
(c) EGF-stimulated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, and (d) chromaffin cells
and CEFs stimulated with EGF and TPA.
Blots probed with anti-PY showed a band for
potassium-depolarized PC12 cell in which the kinetics of phosphorylation and
de-phosphorylation were the same as for chromaffin cells.
Three additional proteins at M<sub>r</sub>=~50, 48, and 35 kDa
were seen in PC12 not seen in chromaffin.  The possible
contribution of fibroblasts--known contaminants of
chromaffin cell cultures--to PY-containing p42 and p45 was
minimal because (1) p42 and p45 in murine
fibroblast cultures (Swiss 3T3 and C3H10T1/2) are not tyrosine phosphorylated,
(2) the intensity of p42/p45 labeling of EGF- or TPA-stimulated chromaffin
cells was comparable to secretagogue-stimulated cells, (3) p42 and p45 tyrosine
phosphorylation in EGF- or TPA-treated pure fibroblast cultures was nearly
equal to p42 and p45 labeling in nicotine, EGF, or TPA-treated chromaffin
cells, and (4) chromaffin cell cultures had a low neutral red staining
(&lt;15%).  EGF- and TPA-stimulated
chromaffin cells showed a p42/p45 tyrosine phosphorylation which was not
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent.  The kinetics of phosphorylation and
subcellular localization remain unchanged.
<p>
As was done for mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts for pp42 in
Rossomando et al. (1989), the chromaffin cell proteins were
run over Mono Q and phenyl-Superose.  Elution of pp42 and
pp45 from Mono Q occurred between 0.2--0.3 M salt.
The proteins were pooled and applied directly to
phenyl-Superose.  The pp45 did not bind
as well as pp42: it was only slightly retained and eluted at 5-10% ethylene
glycol along with other PY-proteins, while pp42 eluted at 37% ethylene glycol.
<p>
MAP-2 phosphorylation for fractions of Mono Q and
phenyl-Superose containing pp42 were tested.
Unstimulated controls were tested as well.
MAP kinase activity was generally 1.5- to 3-fold greater in all
fractions from stimulated cells compared to unstimulated controls.
pp42 from EGF-treated Swiss 3T3 cells and
from nicotine-stimulated chromaffin cells was purified through phenyl-Superose
and applied to 2 D gels to assess whether the chromaffin pp42 was similar to
fibroblast pp42:  indeed both are the
same with two 42 kDa spots appearing at pI 6.5 and 7.3.
Phosphoamino acid analysis of the fibroblast
and the chromaffin pp42 obtained from phenyl-Superose pools fractionated on SDS
gels shows mostly tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation, with some serine
phosphorylated.  Partially acid
hydrolyzed forms show peptides with similar results.
CNBr-digested pp42 excised from SDS gels of phenyl-Superose purified
material from either fibroblasts or chromaffin cells show the same results.

Identification by mass spectrometry of threonine 97 in bovine
myelin basic protein as a specific phosphorylation site for mitogen-activated
protein kinase
<p class="1stP">
MAP kinase obtained from extracts of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled then
EGF-stimulated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts or phorbol ester-stimulated
EL4 thymoma cells and then purified
through the phenyl-Superose step were followed for their activities toward
myelin basic protein (MBP) and MAP-2.
From phenyl-Superose the MBP and MAP-2 activities co-eluted.
Subsequent purification through Superose 12
also showed co-elution of activities, which was found in a 42 kDa protein which
phosphoamino acid analysis revealed to have P-Tyr and P-Thr.
A &quot;minor&quot; peak of MAP-2 kinase
elutes just after the main MAP kinase activity.
K<sub>m</sub> for MBP is 50 &mu;M, and the kinase does not
phosphorylate histone, protamine, casein, or phosvitin.
<p>
Extensive incubation of MBP with MAP kinase (ca. 0.4 mol
P/mol MBP) produced only P-Thr according to phosphoamino acid analysis.
Other kinases phosphorylating MBP were found
to phosphorylate Ser exclusively.  A
table is presented showing the sequence of MBP with the six predicted tryptic
peptides which contain threonine and their predicted weights by mass
spectrometry.  2-D mapping using
thin-layer electrophoresis/chromatography was used to produce a single
spot.  Other kinases (PK-A catalytic
subunit, PK-C, and CaM MPK) were employed with MBP used as substrate, then
trypsinized, and 2-D mapped.  The
resulting tryptic phosphopeptides were different than the spot from MAP-2
kinase phosphorylation, indicating a distinct and novel phosphorylation site.
<p>
Edman sequencing of the 2-D prepped phosphopeptide was
done. 100 pmol of the peptide was the estimated input.
The table shows that the 1st cycle produces
no residue but does show radioactivity.
The 2nd cycle shows 87 pmol Pro, followed by 90 pmol Pro, then 85 pmol
Pro, then 16 pmol Ser (significant dehydroalanine is seen as well, an expected
byproduct), then 54 pmol Gln, then 40 pmol Gly, then 32 pmol Lys.
None were detected.
This corresponds to the XPPPSQGK sequence
within MBP, starting at P-98 and ending at K-104, a predicted trypsin cutting
site.  The X is presumably Thr-97, a
potential phosphorylation site.
<p>
2-D prepped phosphopeptide was refined on reversed phase
HPLC.  1500 pmol (3500 cpm Cerenkov) was
applied and a gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA over 40 min at a flow
rate of 0.2 mL/min.  98% of the
radioactivity was recovered in two peaks.
The primary peak eluted first at 10% acetonitrile, followed by a peak at
14-15%.  The peaks were submitted
directly to liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry, but the hydrophilic nature
of the peptide did not afford abundance of ions in the spectrum.
Methyl esterification reduced negative
charges and hydrophilicity.  For the
primary HPLC peak, (M+H)<sup>+</sup> ions
at <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 906 matched the value expected
for the tryptic peptide methyl ester:
Thr(p)-Pro-Pro-Pro-Ser-Gln-Gly-Lys(OMe).
The unphosphorylated peptide is 811.9, the phosphate ester would be 80,
and the methyl ester on the -COOH terminus would be 14, all of which add to
906.  The secondary HPLC peak produced a
weak <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 921, which for the (M+H)<sup>+</sup>
ion would correspond to the methyl ester of a de-amidated Gln-102.
De-amidation of Gln-102 contributes to the
microheterogeneity of MBP, which has been shown.
<p>
In another attempt to verify T-97 as the phosphorylated
site, endoproteinase Lys-C was used in the desire to generate hydrophobic
fragments more suitable to mass spectrum analysis.
The peptide from 91-104 is predicted with a calculated mass of
1571.8.  MBP digested by endoproteinase
Lys-C was applied to an OD-300 HPLC microbore column where 9 peaks detectable
by 214 nm were identified.  Only peak 4
was a phosphopeptide.  However, all 9
peaks were analyzed by mass spectra.
(M+H)<sup>+</sup> ions representing
10 of the 13 possible fragments were found in the various HPLC peaks, and the
predicted <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> value was observed. The peak 4 spectrum
produced an unpredicted <i>m</i>/<i>z</i>
1572.5 which was close to the predicted <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 1571.8 for
the esterified phospho 91-104 peptide.  It is interesting to
note that the amidated and de-amidated phosphopeptides had the same retention
time on HPLC, since the mass spectrum showed a minor <i>m</i>/<i>z</i>
1601.2, close to the predicted <i>m/z</i> 1600.8.
<p>
<u>Collision-activated dissociation</u> is a new technology in
peptide sequencing.  The method is such: (1) the first mass filter
of the triple quadrupole instrument, quadrupole 1, is set to pass
all ions within a 6-mass unit window centered around the
(M+H)<sup>+</sup> ions for the amidated and de-amidated
forms of the phosphopeptide at <i>m/z</i> 1571.8 and 1572.8, resp.
(2) Transmission to the collision chamber of the (M+H)<sup>+</sup>
ions causes them to suffer 10-100 low energy (15-40 eV) collisions
with argon present at 3 mtorr.
The kinetic energy change is converted to
bond vibrational energy, resulting in fragmentation in the amide bonds along
the peptide chain backbone.  Water,
ammonia, and phosphoric acid are small molecules which are eliminated from side
chains, with a collection of neutrals and ions produced.
(3) Neutrals are pumped out by the vacuum
system, while the ion fragments are transmitted to a third mass filter,
quadrupole 3 which separates according to mass.
Quadrupole 3 is operated at less than unit resolution to maximize
ion transmission.
<p>
Spectra are generated by scanning the mass range 100-1600
Da for 16 times, with data acquired in the centroid mode, and the resulting
spectra summed.  Total instrument time
to acquire data is 64 s.  The signal
peaks are generated in clusters because the data system resolves at more than 1
unit wide, there is sensitivity to the contributions of isotopic forms
(<sup>13</sup>C) of atoms, and the mixture of amidated
and de-amidated forms contributes.
<p>
Sequence information is obtained by subtracting <i>m/z</i> values
for peaks that occupy the same relative positions within two cluster
patterns and are separated by &gt;57 and &lt;186 mass units, which
are the residue masses of the heaviest and lightest amino acids.
Type y ions are the fragments which contain the esterified -COOH
terminus plus 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.  additional residues.  Predicted
<i>m/z</i> values are correlated with observed <i>m/z</i> values:
9 of the 13 are observed from <i>m/z</i> 516.3 to 1457.8.  Subtraction
of the <i>m/z</i> values between type y ions helps
determine the sequence of the first nine residues (the differences are
the mass of the amino acid).  Type b ions (which
start from the amino terminus) are also observed in the spectrum, and used to
confirm those results of the type y ion data.
<p>
Additional peptide substrate studies.
4 peptides were used as substrates to
determine their ability to be phosphorylated by the MAP kinase.
Peptide from pepsin digest of purified
rabbit MBP, synthetic peptide from MBP, a synthetic histone H1 peptide active
to p34<i><sup>cdc2</sup></i>,
and TH peptide were tested.  The results
in the table do not really shed too much light on the true nature of the
recognition sequence of MAP kinase.

Microtubule-associated protein 1A is the fibroblast HMW MAP
undergoing mitogen-activated serine phosphorylation
<p class="1stP">
T4 IgG was obtained by repeated immunization of rabbits with
recycled bovine tubulin containing several cycling MAPs as potential
immunogens.  Hence T4 antiserum contains
antibodies to MAP-1, MAP-2, and tau.  <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 3T3-L1
fibroblasts were stimulated with fetal calf serum for 20 min after
2 h incubation in KRH bicarb buffer + glucose.  SDS gels of
immunoprecipitates with T4 antiserum of cell extracts show a large
increase in labeled phosphate seen in a polypeptide with a band larger
than MAP2 (which runs at 300 kDa) from extracts of serum-treated cells.
This 350 kDa band was reliably phosphorylated when other factors were
included (EGF, insulin) and the increase was measured by Cerenkov
counting and autorad densitometry.  With increasing phosphorylation,
a lowered mobility is observed.  Phosphoamino acid
analysis shows serine to be the phosphorylated product.
<p>
Sato et al. had previously reported a 350 kDa MAP which
was phosphorylated upon mitogen stimulation.
Their experiments with rat embryo fibroblasts and normal rat kidney
cells also showed 80 and 300 kDa proteins, which are not observed here.
The T4 antiserum may not recognize the 80
kDa protein.  It may be the case that
the 80 and 300 kDa proteins are degradation products of the larger 350 kDa
protein, since the 300 kDa is not likely to be MAP-2, as MAP-2 mRNA expression
is detectable in brain and absent in non-neuronal tissues.
Peptide mapping of all three proteins
reveals some similarity.
<p>
When adipocytes, which have 10- to 20-fold more insulin
receptors are used instead of the fibroblasts, insulin-stimulated
phosphorylation in the 350 kDa protein is maximal 2-fold after a 20 min
incubation (detectable after 10 min).  The apparent activation constant,
<i>K</i><sub>act</sub>, is 8 nM, which is close to the 5 nM necessary
to stimulate glucose transport into the cells.
<p>
Monoclonal antibodies MAb 1A-1 and MAb 1B-4, which
specifically immunoprecipitate MAP-1A and MAP-1B, resp., and do not recognize
MAP-1C or MAP-2, were used to determine the nature of the 350 kDa protein.
In both fibroblasts and adipocytes, the 350
kDa protein is showed to be MAP-1A.  In
4% SDS-urea gels, the 350 kDa protein migrates to the same position with bovine
brain MAP-1A.
<p>
<u>Discussion</u>.  The major conclusion is that the HMW MAP is MAP-1A.
The significance of serine phosphorylation of MAP-1A stimulated by
growth factors is not known, but Sato and others have hypothesized
that growth factors stimulate translocation of MAP1 from cytoplasm
to the nucleus to participate in transcriptional activation or processing
and transport of mRNAs.  Studies using
immunofluorescence with anti-MAP-1 and anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies show
nuclear dot-shaped areas after 2 h of stimulation with mitogens;
quantitative immunoprecipitation of isolated
nuclei extracts of mitogen-stimulated and transformed cells show a high
<sup>32</sup>P-MAP-1 content relative to cytoplasm.  The kinase responsible
for MAP-1A phosphorylation is under study, and peptide mapping suggests
that MAP kinase itself is not responsible.  A form of pp42 is probably
the kinase, although pp42 is probably not the kinase since it is only
0.002% of the protein and a more abundant kinase (protein kinase C?)
is likely for the very abundant substrate.

Identification of the sites in myelin basic protein that are
phosphorylated by meiosis-activated protein kinase p44<i><sup>mpk</sup></i>
<p class="1stP">
The p44<i><sup>mpk</sup></i> was purified from sea star oocytes
and used with labeled ATP in an <i>in vitro</i>
reaction to phosphorylate MBP (obtained from Sigma).
MBP was phosphorylated to a stoichiometry of 0.8 mol P/mol MBP
and then trypsin-treated (type IX, porcine pancreas, urea present).
The peptides were resolved on HPLC C<sub>4</sub> column in which
three (peaks 7, 8 and 9) contained label.  Two-dimensional
mapping on thin-layer cellulose using TLE/C revealed an identical
pattern with one dominant peptide.  Small amounts of
the peptide collected from HPLC was acid hydrolyzed and
characterized on silica TLC for phosphoamino acids:  &gt;90% was
phosphothreonine (no P-Tyr was found).
Amino acid composition analysis followed by comparison to deduced
sequence known for MBP, the data corresponded to residues 91-104.
Peptide sequence analysis confirmed and
extended this data (used HPLC peak no. 8 as the sequenced peptide),
although it was not pure as 3 different PTH species were eluted.
Nonetheless the major product would correspond to the 91-104
sequence.  Since there are Thr at both
94 and 97 in the peptide, it was necessary to collect the degradation products
for radioactivity determination:  using this method, the label is
 found to by at Thr-97.

Purification and properties of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1, an insulin-stimulated microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase
<p class="1stP">
Normal rat 1 cells and rat 1 overexpressing human insulin
receptor (rat 1 HIRc B cells) were treated with insulin to assess effect on
MAP2 kinase activity.  Doses from 0.1 to
100 nM insulin had no effect in the normal rat 1, while a maximal 5-fold
increase MAP-2 kinase and 4-fold maximum in S6 kinase activities are seen
with 10 nM insulin.  Ten to twenty 150 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks/dishes of
rat 1 HIRc B cells, either untreated or insulin-treated were extracted.
High speed supernatants are applied to a 1 x 4 cm Q-Sepharose,
washed with 40 &mu;M cAMP to remove PK-A C subunit and then eluted with a
gradient.  Activity is pooled
(corresponding fractions of untreated cells are pooled despite no activity) and
applied to a 0.7 x 10 cm phenyl-Sepharose column.
Elution was with combined 0.25 M to 0.025 M NaCl/0 to 65%
ethylene glycol gradients.  Activity
from these fractions was applied to 1 x 2.5 cm S-Sepharose and the unbound
material and wash was collected, concentrated and purified over a 1 x 40 cm Ultrogel
AcA44 column.  Activity elutes between
the alkaline phosphatase (87 kDa) and cytochrome c (134 kDa) standards.
Some proteolysis may have occurred here as
the activity elutes in two poorly resolved peaks.
<p>
In a scale-up purification, 150-200 150 cm<sup>2</sup> dishes of cells
were insulin-treated and extract supernatants combined and applied to
Q-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose.  Specific protein is
measured by excising labeled MAP-2 from SDS gels to distinguish its
phosphorylation from that of other substrates.  Activity
from phenyl-Sepharose was additionally worked up with S-Sepharose and then
through phosphocellulose, in which the MAP-2 kinase activity passes through
both but which removes other kinases able to phosphorylate MAP-2.
The effluent is loaded on to QAE-Sepharose
and eluted in a gradient, the pool of activity of which is applied to Ultrogel
AcA54 to remove high MW contaminants better than AcA44, except that the
protease inhibitors had been increased:
a single peak eluted this time.
The gel filtration pool was applied to DEAE-cellulose and eluted.
After these steps, some other contaminating
major bands still remain.  If a very
conservative pooling is made at each step, these proteins are eliminated.
<p>
When digested with trypsin, two peptides A and B are recovered by
HPLC separation and sequenced.  Peptide A contains the canonical
sequence for ATP binding sites in kinases (GEGAYG) while peptide B
contains a conserved DLKPSN found in serine/threonine kinases.  The final
specific activity was 800 nmol/min/mg with 6000-fold purification
(4% yield).  With myelin basic protein, specific activity measured
3000 nmol/min/mg and virtually all of the amino acid(s) phosphorylated
was threonine.  The kinase can use Mn<sup>2+</sup> but it is not as
active as Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and it prefers ATP to GTP as the phosphate donor.
1 &mu;M IBMX slightly stimulated kinase activity and 10 &mu;M
2-amino-6-mercaptopurine increased activity by 40% (200 &mu;M of this chemical did
not differ from control however), which distinguishes ERK1 from an
NGF-stimulated kinase described elsewhere.
Other proteins (Rb S6, ATP-citrate lyase, histones, casein, phosvitin,
and protamine) did not serve as good substrates.
Some phosphorylation occurred with cardiac myosin light
chains.  MAP-2 phosphorylation in the presence of PK-A inhibitor,
Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the polyanion heparin, had no effect on
phosphorylation, although protamine had a minor stimulatory effect.
Established kinase inhibitors quercetin, chloroquine, and staurosporine
could only inhibit the kinase at concentrations higher than
for effectiveness on other kinases.

Phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein-2 in GH3 cells
<p class="1stP">
It had been shown earlier by another group that GH3 cells
contain MAP-2 which cycles with appearance of microtubules
and is recognized on Western by anti-brain MAP-2, with the
estimate of MAP-2 in pituitary cells being 10% to that in brain.
Affinity-purified bovine MAP-2 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate
cytosolic extracts of <sup>32</sup>P labeled GH3 cells, and SDS gels
showed a phosphoprotein doublet which co-migrated with rat and bovine
MAP-2, both of which had been labeled with cAMP kinase.  It was also
shown that GH3 MAP-2 is phosphorylated by PK-A, CaM kinase, and
weakly by PK-C in vitro, results similar to that shown for brain
MAP-2. One-dimensional peptide mapping using <i>S. aureus</i> V8
protease on both GH3 and rat brain MAP-2 after treating with the
three kinases shows distinct patterns between kinases, but practically
the same pattern for both MAP-2
proteins, Based upon this proteins
ability to associate with tubulin and the similar phosphopeptide patterns,
it appears that the GH3 protein is MAP-2.
<p>
<sup>32</sup>P-labeled GH3 cells were treated with 2 mM Bt<sub>2</sub>-cAMP
for 20 min to evaluate in situ phosphorylation of MAP-2.  The
total content of phosphate in MAP-2 is not altered a great deal because the
basal phosphorylation state of MAP-2 is already high.
However, each phosphorylation site might be altered, so bands of
MAP-2 are excised from SDS gels, trypsinized, then tryptic phosphopeptides
separated by 2D phosphopeptide mapping
(see Lou &amp; Schulman (1989) <i>J. Neurosci.</i> <b>9,</b> 2020).
Autorads revealed a change in 8 tryptic peptides with a &gt;500%
increase in phosphorylation.  An in vitro analysis
of GH3 MAP-2 with PK-A treatment showed 6 of the 8 phosphopeptides had
increased phosphorylation and there were no other spots that appeared that
varied with the in situ results (so only two spots were missing).
<p>
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation was assessed in situ as
well since PK-C and CaM kinase have been shown to increase MAP-2
phosphorylation.  GH3 cells were exposed to label and depolarized
with K<sup>+</sup> in presence of added Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
One dimensional peptide mapping showed an increase in phosphorylation of
peptides labeled B and F, which was not seen when 0.1 mM EGTA or 10 &mu;M
nitrendipine (which blocks Ca<sup>2+</sup> L channels) was included.
Measurement for changes in cAMP showed no changes in cyclic nucleotide
content, so PK-A was not responsible for changes in phosphorylation state.
<p>
To correlate the in situ Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced phosphorylation with
action by expected kinases, purified CaM kinase and PK-C were used.
First the in situ 2D tryptic map of K<sup>+</sup>-depolarized
GH3 cells was generated.  At least 5 spots (two major and three
minor) reflected changes between depolarized and control cells.
GH3 MAP-2 is an excellent substrate for CaM kinase in vitro with
four major spots and numerous minor sites, with all five of the
in situ spots accounted for in the CaM kinase in vitro map.
Mixing the in situ and CaM kinase in vitro peptides for co-migrational
analysis revealed that three of the four major spots are coincident,
while the two minor in situ sites are coincident with two of the
minor spots in the in vitro analysis.  PK-C from a rat and bovine
brain source only very weakly phosphorylated MAP-2, and then the
tryptic maps were always different between experiments and variable
even with maps generated by phorbol ester treatment, suggesting that
MAP-2 may be indirectly phosphorylated through the PK-C pathway.
<p>
Agents known to elevate cAMP levels were used on GH3 cells
and cAMP content was measured by radioimmunoassay using antibody prepared to
succinyl-cAMP.  1 and 100 &mu;M IBMX for 20 min (a known phosphodiesterase
inhibitor), 0.1 &mu;M vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (whose receptor
couples to adenyl cyclase) for 5 min, 1 &mu;G/mL cholera toxin
for 1 hr, and 1 &mu;M forskolin for 30 sec, 1 min, and 5 min were the tested
treatments.  Only the lower IBMX concentration did not vary significantly
from controls in increasing cAMP content.  Immunoprecipitated MAP-2 from
extracts of labeled and treated GH3 cells was analyzed by one-dimensional
V8 mapping.  DiBu-cAMP treatment clearly shows distinct and increased
phosphorylation in regions of bands (region E) which PK-A also increased
in vitro.  The majority of total phosphate is in regions found in both
control and treated cells, so total phosphate does not differ significantly.
Other cAMP analogues&#8209;8-thiomethyl-cAMP,
8-bromo-cAMP, and 8-isopropylthio-cAMP&#8209;were as effective as DiBu-cAMP in
stimulating phosphorylation of MAP-2 in region E.
This same pattern of increase in region E and inconsistent
phosphorylation in regions B, D, and F were found in the IBMX, VIP, forskolin,
and cholera toxin treatments.  Addition
of Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not change the
appearance of these patterns, demonstrating no Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence.
Quantitation of phosphorylation in region E relative to region C (which
does not change from basal phosphate content) shows a significant increase of
75% (1.75-fold) for VIP, forskolin, and DiBu-cAMP treatments.
<p>
The time dependence of increased phosphorylation in MAP-2 was measured
using 1 &mu;M forskolin in cells pre-treated 20 min with 1 &mu;M IBMX.
Phosphorylation approached a maximal increase of 75% after 5 min, with
a significant 25% increase after 30 sec.  Sphingosine is known to
inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated kinase activation events,
such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent
kinase and PK-C in situ or in vitro, without inhibiting PK-A.
Pretreatment of GH3 cells with sphingosine did not affect
forskolin-induced phosphorylation in region E of the peptide map of MAP-2.

Evidence for involvement of glycoprotein-CD45 phosphatase in
reversing glycoprotein-CD3-induced microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase
activity in Jurkat T-cells
<p class="1stP">
MAP-2 kinase (MAP-2K) is shown to be activated transiently (its
peak at 5 min) with a rapid decline after ligation of the CD3/Ti receptor
complex.  Anti-CD3 in the presence of
sodium vanadate (to inhibit tyrosine phosphatases) produced the same activation
but the decline in activity was prolonged for over 1 h.
Soluble extracts were applied to SDS gels
and immunoblots prepared and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody:
a pp43 which proved to have MAP-2 kinase
activity upon enrichment was labeled.
The signal on the immunoblot was maximal for the 43 kDa band at the 5
min point (as in the assay) and declined over the time course.
Moreover, the signal increased and did not
decline in lanes in which sodium vanadate had been present.
<p>
CD45 glycoprotein is a tyrosine phosphatase which can
couple CD3 and interfere with its signaling, stopping the characteristic
increase in intracellular calcium.  CD45
in Jurkat cells is specifically recognized by monoclonal Ab 9.4 and when biotinylated
9.4 and avidin are added, there is no effect on MAP-2K activity.
Addition of biotinylated anti-CD3 MAb and
avidin activated MAP-2K, but co-aggregation by CD45 abolished this response.
Addition of just anti-CD3 or anti-CD45
(which would not produce an aggregation without added avidin) did not interfere
with activation.  Of interest is CD4
effects:  CD4 usually neutralizes CD45
effects (such as inhibition of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> flux),
but it failed when to affect this when co-aggregated with CD3 and CD45.
Alone with CD3 aggregation, it enhanced MAP-2K activity and calcium flux.
When anti-CD45 was added after anti-CD3
activation of MAP-2K, there was a &quot;blunted&quot; response in MAP-2K
activity, suggesting that CD45 acts on the primary activation and the
post-activated state.
<p>
SDS gels followed by preparation of immunoblots with
anti-PY and <sup>125</sup>I-Protein A
indicates that pp43 is dephosphorylated when procedures to ligate CD45 are
used.  Partially purified MAP-2K (from a
peak fraction off DEAE) which had been replenished with CD45 showed a relative
loss of total tyrosine phosphate on autoradiographs of immunoblots
demonstrating reaction with pp43.

pp54 Microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase requires both
tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation for activity
<p class="1stP">
A high affinity polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antiserum is
shown to immunoprecipitate purified pp54 MAP-2 kinase.
When phosphotyrosine is pre-incubated, SDS
gels and activity assays show no immunoprecipitate but rather the protein and
activity are in the supernatant.
Phosphoserine pre-incubation controls show the protein and its activity
can be found in immunoprecipitate, indicating the antiserum's high
specificity.  Immunoblot analysis with
the antiserum shows a band at 54,000 which does not occur if antibody has been
pre-treated with phosphotyrosine.
<p>
A highly purified recombinant, truncated rrbP tyrosine
phosphatase-1 is incubated with pp54 MAP-2 kinase, resulting in its thorough
deactivation.  Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>,
a well-known tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, prevents this deactivation at 1
mM.  pp54 MAP-2 kinase is able to
autophosphorylate on certain Ser and Thr residues, but autophosphorylation
results in no activation.  Treatment of
pp54 MAP-2 kinase with a serine/threonine phosphatase to remove serine and
threonine phosphates did not affect immunoprecipitation reaction results of the
rrbP tyrosine phosphatase-1 treatments, showing that phosphorylation of those residues
does not affect immunoreactivity of phosphotyrosines.
There is a possibility that this kinase is regulated by growth
factor transduction pathways involving receptor-based tyrosine kinases and is
involved in cell growth control as are the other Ser/Thr kinases pp42 MAP-2
kinase and cdc2/MPF.

ERKs:  a family of protein-serine/threonine kinases that are activated
and tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin and NGF
<p class="1stP">
<u>Molecular cloning of two novel ERKs</u>.  Using low-normal stringency,
a rat brain cDNA library was probed with ERK1 cDNA which resulted in
discovery of ERK2 and ERK3.  These kinases show much
relatedness to yeast kinases FUS3 and KSS1, with less relatedness to the
cdc2 family of kinases.  The open-reading
frame (using Kozak consensus for translation initiation) predicts a 41.2 kDa
protein for ERK2 which is smaller than ERK1 and fewer residues at the N
terminus preceding the catalytic domain.
A second in-frame methionine aligns with the initiator Mets found in
KSS1 and FUS3.  ERK3 shows a predicted
62.6 kDa, with the initiator Met located downstream of that predicted for ERK2
and a carboxyl terminal extension of 180 amino acids.
In certain subdomains, especially with the
putative catalytic domains, amino acid identity exceeds 50% and is near
85%.  Sequencing of two independent cDNA
clones confirmed that ERK3 contains SPR rather than APE in subdomain VIII.
The glutamic acid is not conserved in ERK3
although it is invariant among 15 residues in protein kinases.
Previous mutagenesis studies show that Lys
substitution of this Glu reduces kinase activity;
replacement of the Glu with Ala in PK-A causes a decrease in
<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> and in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the
peptide substrate without affecting the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for ATP.
In subdomain VI, ERK3 contains DLKPAN which is found in both
tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases.
<p>
<u>Evidence for additional ERKs</u>.  Probes from the least conserved
parts of the ERK and specific for each ERK (each probe did not
cross-hybridize with other ERKs) were used to identify other
possible members of a family. Rat genomic EcoRI digests showed one
strongly hybridizing fragment with the ERK1 probe.
The ERK2 probe hybridized with two fragments from rat genomic and
four from human genomic.  The ERK3 probe
identified two in rat genomic and four in human genomic as well.
The probes did not span restriction sites
nor introns, suggesting that true coding regions for ERKs and possible grouping
into subfamilies.  However, this is not
always reliable, as partial sequencing of the ERK1 positive member revealed a
pseudo-gene designated ERK1psi.
<p>
<u>Tissue distribution</u>.  Tissues were taken from animals at various
developmental stages and a Northern analysis performed with specific probes.
In adult rat, mRNA expression was highest in
nervous system tissue, but detectable in all tissues.
ERK3 was highest in the hindbrain regions while ERK2 was just the
opposite, highest in the forebrain.
ERK1 expression was more uniform in the neuronal tissues.
Outside the nervous system, ERK1 was found
in intestine, placenta, and to a lesser degree in the lung.
ERK2 was high in the heart, thymus, and
muscle.  ERK2 mRNAs were found in 3
different transcripts, which could represent various stages of processing
of one gene or represent transcripts of a multigene subfamily.
ERK3 was highest in skeletal muscle.
ERK3 expression was highest of the three
early in development while ERK1 and ERK2 increased with growth of the
organism. In liver and heart all three ERKs decrease
expression in the adult.  In sciatic nerve, contains only neuronal
axons and glial tissue, ERK2 and ERK3 were very low while ERK1 was
quite high, as was also demonstrated in neuron-free glial cultures
of newborn brains.
<p>
<u>Expression of ERK in induced carcinoma cell line</u>.
P19 cells are embryonic carcinoma with an
undifferentiated phenotype which can be induced to differentiate neuronally
or muscularly following treatment with retinoic acid or
Me<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, resp.  ERK1 transcripts were shown to
fall during induction while ERK2 transcripts notably increased during neuronal
induction (parallel to the pattern for low affinity NGF receptor).
ERK3 increased during induction to either
type.  In parallel with the in vivo tissue
distribution studies, P19 would appear to be a good model for study of the ERK
kinases.  MAP2 is apparently required
for P19 neuronal differentiation such as neurite extension and cessation of
proliferation, as is a physiological substrate for the ERKs.
<p>
<u>Recombinant ERK2</u>. <i>E coli</i> served as a host for
recombinant ERK2, and purified product was found to phosphorylate itself,
MAP-2 and MBP in both time- and concentration-dependent manner,
with specific activities of two different preparations approaching
600 and 1000 pmol/min/mg for either MBP or MAP-2.  MAP-2 activity
of 300,000 pmol/min/mg for highly purified ERK1 from insulin-treated rat
1 fibroblasts and 4000 pmol/min/mg for the same ERK1, this time treated
with protein phosphatase 2A, suggests that the recombinant ERK2 is thoroughly
dephosphorylated and therefore de-activated.
<p>
Antisera to ERK1 and ERK2 were prepared against synthetic
C terminal peptide of 16 residues of ERK1 (of which 10 are
conserved in ERK2) and were used to check protein expression in tissues.
Antiserum 837 recognized the purified ERK1 and recombinant ERK2
and also two proteins of similar sizes in adult brain and PC12 cells.
Antiserum 956 recognized purified ERK1 but
not the recombinant ERK2.  It also
recognized proteins similar in size to ERK1 in adult brain and PC12 cells, and
a novel 45 kDa protein.  Immunoblotting
studies in adult and embryonic brain parallel the Northern analyses, that is,
that a 41 kDa protein corresponding to recombinant ERK2 and a 43 kDa protein
corresponding to ERK1 are increased in the brain.
The 45 kDa protein is called ERK4.
<p>
<u>Insulin- and NGF-induced phosphorylation of ERKs</u>.
Ray and Sturgill (1988) have reported a
MAP-2 kinase which was phosphorylated on both tyrosine and threonine residues
in response to insulin.  Rat 1 HIRc B
fibroblasts and PC12 cells were pre-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>
before and after treatment with insulin and NGF, resp.
Antiserum 837 recognizes ERK1, ERK2 and ERK4 (weakly) under the
denaturing conditions of immunoblotting, but it immunoprecipitates the 43 kDa
ERK1 and a small amount of the 45 kDa ERK4, but not ERK2, from crude
extracts.  In untreated cells, there are
no radiolabeled bands, but in insulin- and NGF-treated cells, labeled bands at
43 kDa and a small amount of 45 kDa (ERK1 and ERK4) are
immunoprecipitated.  However, with
denatured extracts, a 41 kDa labeled band appears, revealing that ERK2 is also
phosphorylated.  Phosphotyrosine content
was examined using both phosphoamino acid analysis of immunoprecipitated band
and immunoblotting with anti P-Y.  In
both cases, phosphotyrosine was found in hormone-induced phosphoproteins and
not in proteins from untreated sources.
ERK4 had no P-Y, but this might also result from an inability to detect
it with the low levels of blotted protein.
<p>
Chromatography on Mono Q showed altered elution profiles
of ERK1 and ERK2 when extracted from untreated PC12 cells or
from NGF-treated cells.  Fractions were analyzed with the
956 and 837 antisera to correlate with activity profiles,
and the shift was noted in the activated proteins with ERK2
coming off first and overlapping with ERK1 activity following it.
Anti P-Y immunoblots showed the phosphotyrosine content to be
located solely within the activated proteins.

Electroconvulsive treatment induces a rapid and transient
increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 40-kilodalton
protein associated with microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase activity
<p class="1stP">
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-300 g) were set up with ear clip
electrodes and give electroconvulsive shock with a constant-current pulse
generator set at 100 Hz, 0.5-ms pulse, 1-s duration at either 10, 35, 85 mA.
Rats are decapitated and hippocampi dissected from brains.  0.4 mm
transverse slices are cut with a chopper and slices kept in humidified chamber
with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> on top of filter paper covering a small dish of a
Ringer&#146;s-like saline (w/ glucose).
After waiting an hour for the slices to adjust, they are treated
accordingly and treatment is stopped by placement in a stop
(SDS + vanadate + BME) buffer, sonicated, then boiled 2 min.
<p>
A time course of tyrosine phosphorylation was followed
using 8% SDS-PAGE and phosphoTyr-specific antibodies.
Blots show an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 40 kDa
protein reaching maxial the 1-2 min period, then declining by 4 min, reaching
basal at 8 min.  A 2<sup>nd</sup> shock 15 or 30 min after the first induces
phosphorylation of the 40 kDa protein in the same way.  This was done for
3 consecutive days before sacrifice after 2 min on the last day.
<p>
Current setting (stimulus intensity) was adjusted to
determine the level of shock to induce the effect.
At 10 mA there is no increase in phosphorylation.
At 35 mA which causes brief tonic seizure
without hind limb extension, there is significant rise in phosphorylation,
but smaller than at 85 mA, whose response is maximal.
The anticonvulsant diphenylhydantoin (25 mg/kg i.p.) blocks the
seizsure, but not the phosphorylation.
<p>
The tissue distribution of this response was evaluated looking at
neocortex, brainstem, and cerebellum in additiont the hippocampus.
There was no effect in the brainstem or cerebellum, but a similar
though smaller response was seen in the neocortex.
<p>
In previous experiments a 40 kDa protein also responded to
muscarinic agonists and phorbol esters.  Soluble and particulate
fractions were prepared from phorbol 12,13-diacetate-treated slices
and from slices of shocked animals.  The 40 kDa proteins were mostly
soluble and migrated identical in electrophoresis.
<p>
The chromatographic properties of the 40 kDa protein were
then determined and compared to the MAP2K from insulin-stimulated
adipocytes.  The 40 kDa protein elutes
with 0.3 M NaCl and its appearance as a phosphoTyr protein on gels coincides
with a MAP2K activity.  The 40 kDa protein also appears identically on gels
with a bovine chromaffin cell MAP2K protein on immunoblots.  The
fraction-to-fraction changes in MAP2K and p42 densitometry are also
paralleled.

Identification of the regulatory phosphorylation sites in
pp42/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)
<p class="1stP">
MAP kinase was purified from <sup>32</sup>P-labeled
and PDB-stimulated EL4 thymoma cells.  The kinase contained
P-Tyr and P-Thr species as shown by phosphoamino
acid analysis, with no detectable P-Ser, the same as MAP kinase from
insulin-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells (Ray &amp; Sturgill (1988)).
Tryptic peptides of the kinase were
separated by 2-D thin-layer electrophoresis and chromatography, producing only
one phosphopeptide.  Phosphoamino acid
analysis of this peptide revealed both P-Tyr and P-Thr.
<p>
Since pp42 is not abundant and inactive in quiescent
cells, is easily inactivated by phosphatases and prone to severe handling loss,
purification leading to sequencing of phosphopeptide required a strategy
involving large-scale cell culture.
25,000 &times; <i>g</i> EL4 lysates stimulated by PDB were batch-purified on
phenyl-Sepharose, MonoQ-purified using a salt gradient, applied to
phenyl-Superose and eluted using a gradient, and then prepared using
SDS-PAGE.  Specific activities in the
earlier stages of purification are difficult to analyze since a number of
kinases phosphorylate the substrates used.
Labeled MAP kinase is added or continually run through each step to
allow correlation of the phosphoprotein with activity.
Recovery at the phenyl-Superose step was 65%.
Additional purification results in activity
loss when a carrier (e.g. BSA) or detergent is not included.
Five such large-scale preparations from 13
billion EL4 cells were pooled and separated on preparative SDS-PAGE.
After excision of the band, the slice was
crushed and extracted in N-ethylmorpholine, adjusted to pH 7.7 with TFA, dried
in a Speed Vac, resuspended in ammonium bicarbonate, precipitated with TCA
after addition of poly(Glu/Tyr) as a carrier.
<p>
The purified protein was trypsinized, and tryptic peptides
resolved on preparative 2-D thin-layer electrophoresis and chromatography.
The single phosphopeptide was recovered the
plates, and further refined by reversed phase HPLC.
The peptide recovered is estimated to be 30-50 pmol based upon UV
absorbance properties of standard peptides synthesized after MAP peptide
sequence was determined.
<p>
<u>Sequencing by mass spectrometry</u>.
Sequence analysis by particle bombardment or
electrospray ionization and collision-activated dissociation have been
described previously (see Hunt et al. <i>PNAS USA</i> <b>83</b>,
6233 (1986); Hunt et al. in Current Res. in Protein Chem.
Techniques, Structure, and Function, Villafranca (ed.) (1991)
in press; Griffin et al. <i>JBC</i> <b>264</b>, 19066 (1989);
Erickson et al. <i>JBC</i> <b>265</b>, 19728 (1990)).  Firstly
molecular mass was determined using microcapillary HPLC/electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry.  Fragmentation of the
predominant (M+nH)<sup>n+</sup> ion in the spectrum was
done by collision-activated dissociation.
<p>
One tenth of the purified peptide (3-5 pmol) is desorbed
from a thioglycerol matrix under bombardment with 6 keV Cs<sup>+</sup> ions.
The resulting low resolution spectrum produces an unresolved isotope
cluster for the (M+H)<sup>+</sup> ion centered at <i>m/z</i> 2304.7.
Electrospray ionization mass spectrum of the phosphopeptide (ca. 10 pmol)
recorded on the triple quadrupole instrument shows (M+2H)<sup>2+</sup>,
(M+3H)<sup>3+</sup>, and (M+4H)<sup>4+</sup> ions centered at
<i>m/z</i> 1153.0, 769.0, and 577.0, resp., which when calculated
for the (M+H)<sup>+</sup> ion is 2305.0.  The ethyl ester derivatized
MAP phosphopeptide produced the corresponding (M+nH)<sup>n+</sup> ions
at <i>m/z</i> 1222.9, 815.6, 612.0, resp, for n=2, 3, and 4, with an
<i>m/z</i> for the univalent ion calculated at 2444.7.
Since ethyl esterification produces a 28 dalton increase per ester, and
the difference in the derivative is 140 daltons, five COOH (the C-terminus and
4 acidic groups) must be present.
<p>
The (M+3H)<sup>3+</sup> ions (<i>m/z</i> 769.0) in the electrospray
spectrum were sampled and subjected to collision-activated dissociation.
The resulting spectrum is used to make
sequence deductions.  The predicted
monoisotopic masses for fragment ions of type b and type y are shown above and
below the sequence, while those observed are in the spectrum.
Assigning the charge to an ion in the CAD
spectrum of a multiply charged parent ion is facilitated by recording the CAD
spectrum of the corresponding ethyl ester-derivatized peptide.
Conversion of the peptide to its ethyl ester
increases the mass of a particular fragment by 28, 14, and 9.3 daltons per COOH
group for ions having a +1, +2, and +3 charge, resp.
Partial elimination of small neutral molecules such as ammonia,
water, and phosphoric acid (MW 98) facilitates assignment of charge to a
fragment:  daughter ions of phosphoric
acid from parent ions are 98, 49, and 32.7 d for the +1, +2, and +3 parent
ions, resp.
<p>
Type y fragments carrying up to three + charges dominate
the CAD spectrum.  These ions contain
the -COOH terminus plus 1, 2, 3, etc. additional residues.
Subtraction of the <i>m/z</i> values for any two fragments
that differ by a residue and which
have the same charge allows calculation of the mass and therefore the identity
of the residue.  Residues 12-19 were
deduced from type y fragments that carry a +1 charge.
Leu and Ile cannot be distinguished since they have the same
mass.  Phosphorylation sites were found
to be Thr-13 and Tyr-15.  From all other
analyses of various ion species and <i>m/z</i>
ratios, the sequence VADPDHDHTGFXT(p)EY(p)VATR is found where X is either Leu
or Ile and the phosphate (p) is attached to the preceding amino acid.
<p>
<u>Discussion</u>.  We have isolated the single tryptic phosphopeptide.
A Thr and Tyr separated by only one amino
acid is found to be the phosphorylation site.
The peptide was aligned to the deduced sequences from cDNA found for the
ERK1 and KSS1 sequences.  KSS1 overexpression
allows yeast variants permanently arrested by pheromones to escape arrest and
re-enter the cell cycle.  The
differences in the ERK1 and MAP kinase may be species (ERK1 is from rat;
the MAP peptide from mouse).
Note that the sequence TEYVATR is perfectly
conserved in all 3 proteins.

Recent progress in characterization of protein kinase cascades
for phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6
<p class="1stP">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  The S6 kinases identified so far are a mitogen-activated
70 kDa and 90 kDa species, which are themselves activated by Ser/Thr
kinases.  The S6 kinases have been
cloned, and the 90 kDa is activated more rapidly.
The 70 kDa kinase is specific for the 40S subunits and its kinases
have not been identified.  The 90 kDa
protein is activated in vitro by 42 kDa and 44 kDa MAP kinases.
<p>
<u>S6 phosphorylation</u>.  The complete sequence of S6 is known
and so are its phosphorylated sites.  Beginning at
position R-232, the sites phosphorylated are clustered in the -COOH
terminus:  RRLS(p)S(p)LRAS(p)TSKS(p)ESS(p)QK was obtained from
cycloheximide-treated rat cells.  Electron microscopic examination
using S6-specific antisera reveals the
phosphorylated epitope to lie in the cleft where mRNA binds.
Unfortunately, S6 phosphorylation effects on
translation are ambiguous, since Ala substitution of sites on S6 which are Ser
phosphorylated by PK-A sites (S-235 and S-236) did not effect growth rate in
yeast whether PK-A was stimulated in wild-type or mutant.
<p>
<u>The 70 and 90 kDa S6 kinases</u>. With 40S ribosomal subunits used as
substrate, identification of the two S6 kinases has led to their purification
and cloning.  Both are activated with phosphorylation of Ser/Thr and
inactivated by protein phosphatases 1 and 2A.  Autophosphorylation
occurs readily as shown in the Xenopus S6 kinase II, which occurs
on Ser residues.  There is no P-Tyr.
<p>
In general the 70 kDa kinase is relatively specific for 40S ribosome
S6 subunit, while on the other hand, Xenopus S6 kinase II, the
best characterized 90 kDa enzyme, phosphorylates several substrates with
consensus R-X-X-Ser.  Laminin C may be a
substrate for S6 kinase II, contributing to nuclear envelope disassembly.
Members of the 90 kDa S6 kinase family,
collectively termed <i>rsk</i>, have been cloned and are unusual in that
they contain two nonidentical domains which are
complete sets of the motifs conserved in protein kinases, but it is
not known whether both domains are active and, if so, regulated
independently.  Both kinases are expressed in several
tissues and are activated by growth factors in common cell lines.

Identification of multiple extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs)
with antipeptide antibodies
<p class="1stP">
<u>Immunoreactivity of anti-ERKs.</u>  Antibodies to three
synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted sequences of ERK1
were made in rabbits.
1) the 16-amino acids of the C terminus 2) a 23-long portion of kinase
subdomain XI and 3) a 16-long site in the N terminus coming before the
conserved GXGXXG of subdomain I.  Two
idiotypic antisera were generated against the C terminus (sera 956 and 837) in
which 956 recognized a 43 kDa band in extracts and partially pure preparations.
837 recognized recombinant ERK2 and 41 and
43 kDa bands in tissue extracts (ERK1 and ERK2 probably).
Anti-subdomain XI and anti-N terminus
reacted with 41 and 43 kDa bands in cell extracts as well.
<p>
Immunoprecipitation of ERK1 with 837 was achieved under
nondenaturing conditions, but not for ERK2 since immunoprecipitates showed no
ERK2 activity, a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 41
kDa band could not be found on gels, and on failure to show a 41 kDa band on
immunoblots of immunoprecipitated material.
The 956 anti-C terminus and the anti-subdomain XI found a third ERK at
M<sub>r</sub>=45,000, whose immunoreactivity is
blocked by pre-incubation with peptide antigens.
This third ERK is probably novel since some but not all of the
anti-ERK1 peptide antibodies were immunoreactive.
<p>
<u>Cell line and tissue distribution studies.</u>
Tissue distribution and relative abundance
of the ERK1 and ERK2 proteins were determined with immunoblots of
extracts.  Tissues and cell lines are
extracted and centrifuged at 100,000 &times; <i>g</i> to produce particulate and soluble
fractions which are separated on SDS gels.
Equal protein is loaded and only two antisera (anti-C terminus 956 and
837, the latter recognizing both ERK1 and ERK2).
ERK1 is found in highest quantities in neural tissues (cerebrum
and cerebellum of brain and in spinal cord) followed by lung and testes.
Particulate ERK1 was found in spinal cord,
brain, lung and testes but is found as soluble form where any is found.
Faint bands running between 39-42 kDa were
seen on immunoblots of kidney and intestinal extract, but this may reflect proteolysis
of the main band in this tissue (proteolysis at the N terminus by the way since
this antibody is anti-C terminus).  All
immunoreactivity is blocked by preincubation with peptide antigens.
<p>
837 antiserum recognizes both the 41 and 43 kDa bands in
neural tissues mostly.  ERK2 is barely
detectable in lung, liver, muscle, and intestine, and all ERK2 is
predominantly soluble, except for notable amounts in testes, where
it was considerable for ERK1.  Northern blot analysis shows no
difference in protein and mRNA expression, revealing no overriding
translational controls;  messages are
present in all tissues.  Intestinal ERK1
mRNA content was very high even though the protein is weakly expressed, while
muscle ERK2 mRNA was higher than its protein expression would indicate so some
correlations are not rigorous.
<p>
Cell lines from human, mouse, and rat sources, some known
to express high amounts of MAP-2 kinase, were evaluated with the
antibodies.  Rat 1 fibroblasts and a
insulin receptor-transfected cell line, Rat 1 HIRc B, have the same amount of
ERK1; note that the activation of ERK1
by growth factors has been shown for the transfected cell line.
ERK1 is also present in equal amounts in CHO
cells and cells transfected with IR and an IR-ros hybrid.
Because there is a difference in activation
between transfected and untransfected cells and the relative ERK1 content is
the same, then the difference must be accounted for in the receptor-transduced
activation mechanism.  ERK1 and ERK2 are
also present in PC12 cells, where ERK1 is greater in PC12 cells than in any
other cell line examined.  The rat
osteosarcoma line has detectable amounts of both, but the least of other rat
lines.  The 45 kDa band is found only in
the rat cell lines tested, with the greatest amount found in the PC12 soluble
fraction.  Although indications that the
mouse ERKs are very low, it may be the fact that cross-reactivity using the
anti-rat ERKs may have high specificity for rat; the hamster and rat cell lines
showed very good reactions, while the generically distinct human and mouse cell
lines were weak.
<p>
Immunoreaction with human ERKs, in which anti-subdomain XI
reacted more effectively than did anti-C terminus, suggests
strong conservation of the kinase in certain regions (confirmed
by unpublished sequencing of human ERK1 cDNA).  Only the 837 anti-C
terminus serum cross reacts with soluble extracts of chicken embryo
fibroblasts, which is slightly larger than ERK2 from mouse, rat, and hamster,
and with dog kidney cells, which is the same size as rodent ERK2.
Some weak cross-reactivity is seen with yeast extracts as well.
<p>
Cell lines used to express heterologous proteins (COS, 293, and Sf9)
revealed ERK1 and ERK2 presence in 293 cells, and ERK2 in COS.
The antibodies may not recognize
insect ERK, but they were able to detect frog oocyte kinase (837 anti-C
terminus only), suggesting ERK2 relatedness.
Cloning of the Xenopus pp42 shows ERK2 homology over ERK1.
<p>
<u>Subcellular re-distribution during activation phenomena</u>.
Activation of MAP-2 kinase is followed by
decay of activity 5 min later in the Rat 1 HIRc B cells.
Soluble and particulate fractions from
extracts of cells treated with insulin over a time course are probed with 837
antiserum to follow any re-distribution of ERK1 and ERK2 during the activation
changes.  MAP-2 kinase activity
increases 8-fold in the soluble fraction after 5 min insulin treatment,
while a small (50%) increase is seen in the particulate.
Immunoblotting on the other hand, shows no changes in blottable
mass of either ERK1 or ERK2 during the treatment duration, although both
proteins appear to increase slightly in the particulate fraction after 15 min
treatment.  The particulate fraction contains more ERK1 than ERK2.
<p>
<u>Biochemical characterization of ERKs using immunochemical detection</u>.
ERKs from Rat 1 HIRc B cells were chromatographed over Mono Q using a
shallow gradient (60 mL from 0 to 225 mM NaCl), collected in 1 mL
fractions, then TCA-precipitated for immunoblotting.
Activity is resolved into two peaks collected in fractions 33-38 and in
fractions 45-51 from extracts of insulin-treated cells but not in unstimulated
cells.  Immunochemical analysis with a mixture of 837 and 956 anti-C terminus
shows a 43 kDa band, or ERK1, eluting as two peaks in fractions 30-34 and
44-52: its elution in the 2nd peak coincides with the activity, but it
elutes slightly ahead of the first peak of activity, in the same way as
ERK1 in unstimulated cells.  In unstimulated cells, all of the ERK1 is
in fractions 30-36, suggesting activation of ERK1 produces a tighter
binding Mono Q species.
<p>
ERK2 elutes as one peak just ahead of ERK1 in unstimulated
cells in fraction 22-32 (the intensity of fractions 28-30 being greatest),
while stimulation altered chromatography producing a later eluting peak
collected in fractions 26-36 (the intensity greatest in 32-34), which
coincided with a majority of the MBP kinase activity of the first peak.
ERK2 makes no apparent contribution to activity in the second peak.
<p>
Additional immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine probes
shows that a 43 kDa band in fractions 46-50 and in a 43 and 41 kDa band in
fraction 32-35, indicating that modification results in retarded elution from
Mono Q.  A P-Y containing 43 kDa band is
also found in unstimulated cells, suggesting a basal tyrosine phosphorylation
which may have resulted from a general over-expression of transfected receptor.
<p>
Fractions containing activity were immunoprecipitated with 837
(immunoprecipitates only ERK1 but blots both) and with anti-whole
recombinant ERK2. to see what was responsible for the activity.
Immunoprecipitates of 837 recovers very
little peak 1 activity but a great deal from peak 2, which was verified by
supernatant activity analysis.  The anti-ERK2 precipitate recovered
a small amount of MBP kinase activity from peak 1 and none from peak 2,
but the efficiency of immunoprecipitation tested with autophosphorylated
recombinant ERK2 is poor in general.
<p>
<u>Additional characterization</u>.  Both Mono Q peaks were compared as
far as ability to phosphorylate MBP and MAP-2 as substrates.
In general, MBP is better by 2- to 3-fold than MAP-2.
ERK1 is also known to be able to use both Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>
as sources of divalent cation.  Both peak 1 and 2 showed increases in
activity dependent on the concentrations of either cation.
<p>
Treatment with protein phosphatase 2A resulted in
inactivation (&gt;85%) of both Mono Q peaks, while to a lesser extent
(70%), CD45 tyrosine phosphatase treatment inactivated both as well.

Microtubule-associated protein 2 kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, undergo
autophosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine residues:
implications for their mechanism of activation
<p class="1stP">
Recombinant ERK2 expressed in and purified from an <i>E. coli</i>
host to 90% purity possessed a barely detectable MBP kinase activity
6000-fold less active than to the best purified MAP kinase preparations.
Incubation of ERK2 with <sup>32</sup>P-ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>
caused incorporation of label, which ran on SDS gels at 39 kDa.
Phosphoamino acid analysis showed this to be on both threonine
and tyrosine residues.  Incubation with CD45 tyrosine phosphatase
removed &gt;85% of the label, suggesting mostly phosphotyrosine.
Prior heat inactivation of ERK2 prevented incorporation, which
eliminates the possibility of nonenzymatic phosphorylation.
Immunoblots using anti P-Y labeled a band at 39 kDa in purified
and lysate preparations, which could be blocked if P-Y was included
in the incubation or reduced with prior treatment with CD45.

Raf-1 is a potential substrate for mitogen-activated protein kinase <i>in vivo</i>
<p class="1stP">
Raf-1 kinase is serine/threonine phosphorylated in response to
growth factor activation.  This suggests an intermediate kinase
which is itself phosphorylated in response.
<p>
Raf-1 was expressed in baculovirus (bRaf-1).  Extracts of Sf9 cells
infected with virus containing bRaf-1 were immunoprecipitated with
anti-Raf-1 and the precipitates incubated with purified MAP kinase.
SDS gels show phosphorylation of 74 kDa protein, whereas controls
(extracts of cells infected with wild-type virus) show no such band.
Protein phosphatase 2A-treated MAP kinase, which is inactive,
also produced no band.
<p>
Since Raf-1 autophosphorylates, a mutant was expressed in
baculovirus (bRaf-1a) which lacked autophosphorylating ability and immune
complexes treated with MAP kinase still resulted in a 74 kDa band.
The phosphorylation bands between mutant and normal Raf-1 appeared
quantitatively equal, so it is probable that some or all
of the phosphorylation seen in Raf-1 is attributable to MAP kinase.
<p>
MAP kinase has been shown to phosphorylated MBP at a
Thr-Pro-Arg-Thr<sup>*</sup>-Pro-Pro-Pro
site and Rosner and co-workers have shown the EGF receptor is phosphorylated at
Thr-669, with Pro-Leu-Thr-Pro site.  One
such sequence has been shown and another sequence, PKTPVP, is also likely.

Biochemical characterization of a family of serine/threonine
protein kinases regulated by tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylations
<p class="1stP">
Mitogen-treated cells were extracted using previously described
conditions and purified on DE-52 cellulose and phenyl-Superose.
The p42<sup>mapk</sup> from murine fibroblasts and the p44<sup>mpk</sup>
from sea star were compared for their relative abilities to phosphorylate various
protein substrates in vitro.  Both protein kinases did, in fact,
phosphorylate with similar or identical efficiencies MAP-2 , MBP,
histone H1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, histone 2A,
casein, alpha-tubulin, phosvitin, protamine, ribosomal protein S6 (MAP-2 and
MBP, and histone 2A and casein had relatively equal reactivities to the
kinases).  Phosphopeptide mapping
indicates that both kinases phosphorylate the same site in MBP, Thr-97; while
MAP-2 phosphopeptide maps were complex but indistinguishable for the kinases.
<p>
Both kinases were tested for their response to potential
inhibitors of the MBP phosphorylation (&beta;-glycerol phosphate, EGTA, NaCl, NaF,
MnCl<sub>2</sub>,CaCl<sub>2</sub>, heparin, spermine, and DTT).
The concentration of these compounds at
which 50% inhibition was achieved for both kinases was virtually
identical.  The manganese and calcium
salt were the most effective inhibitors of this group tested (at 3 to 4 mM),
but the concentration necessary were nowhere near physiological.
<p>
The purified protein kinases were run on SDS gels and
transferred to NC for immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoTyr
antibodies and affinity-purified anti-p44<sup>mpk</sup>.
The anti-P-Y blot indicated a reaction with
both the p42<sup>mapk</sup> and the p44<sup>mpk</sup>, that is,
pp42 in PDB-treated EL4 thymoma lysates and in phenyl-Superose-purified
p42<sup>mapk</sup> and a pp44 band in purified p44<sup>mpk</sup>
preparation were indicated.  With anti-p44<sup>mpk</sup>,
there was a very strong reaction with the purified p44<sup>mpk</sup>
preparation and a weaker reaction with a band at 42,000 in the treated
lysate and purified p42<sup>mapk</sup>.
<p>
An interesting find was the reaction of a p44 phosphoprotein in
the mitogen-stimulated mouse thymoma cell lysates which
reacted with both anti-PY and anti-p44<sup>mpk</sup>.
No pp44 band could be detected in anti-PY
blots in the lane of lysate not treated with phorbol ester,
indicating that p44 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response
to phorbol esters.  Treated lysates purified on DE-52 cellulose
and phenyl-Superose and assayed using MBP.
The p42<sup>mapk</sup> eluted ~37% ethylene glycol and 0.1 M NaCl,
as before.  The isocratic wash revealed a broad peak of MBP activity.
When pools of the respective activities were
run on gels and blotted with anti-PY, the gradient peak was found to be pp42
and the wash peak pp44.  When p44<sup>mpk</sup> which had been partially
purified through hydroxylapatite was chromatographed as well on
phenyl-Superose, it eluted unbound in the wash, showing no activity
in the gradient.  Blots with anti-PY of gradient and wash
fractions showed presence of a pp44 in the wash.
Hence p44<sup>mpk</sup> and the murine pp44 were
similar chromatographically while p42<sup>mapk</sup> was not.
We excluded the possibility that factors in the hydroxylapatite
eluate could have interfered with pp44 binding to phenyl-Superose
so we mixed phenyl-Superose wash containing the p44 with
phenyl-Superose-purified p42<sup>mapk</sup>.  The results were
effectively the same.
<p>
Partially purified pp44 from PDBu-treated EL4 cells was
further purified on polylysine-agarose, Mono Q, and Superose 12.
Analysis of fractions from each purification
showed a perfect correlation between the presence of 44 kDa phosphoprotein
(with anti-PY blots) and MBP kinase activity.
When MBP phosphopeptide mapping was done using a two-dimensional method
(HVE/TLC), the single spot phosphorylated by the 44 kDa kinase migrated to the
same location as the spot resulting from p42<sup>mapk</sup> and
p44<sup>mpk</sup>.  When the digests were mixed, there was still
only one spot.  This spot corresponds to the peptide containing Thr-97.
<p>
When the EL4 cells were incubated with <sup>32</sup>P (50 mCi, 1.5 h)
and stimulated with PDB, they were homogenized and purified on DE52
and phenyl-Superose.  MBP activity was found in the wash and
gradient elution of phenyl-Superose as expected.
Chromatography on polylysine and MonoQ (used to purify the sea
star p44 kinase) followed by precipitation with TCA/DOC and then SDS-PAGE
revealed a pp44 by autoradiography, which, when eluted from the gel revealed
the presence of all three phosphoamino acids by phosphoamino acid analysis,
with threonine and tyrosine being more relatively abundant than serine.
2-D separation using HVE/TLC indicated that
the tryptic phosphopeptides of pp42<sup>mapk</sup> were distinct
from the tryptic phosphopeptide from [<sup>32</sup>P]pp44.
<p>
Both proteins were partially purified (the pp42<sup>mapk</sup> through
phenyl-Superose) and submitted to 2-D PAGE.  pp44 migrated to a higher
MW and had a more acidic pI, results confirmed both externally and
with mixing of the samples.  The pp44 may in fact be the same kinase
as the 45 kDa tyrosine kinase substrate identified by Cooper et al.
<p>
Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts treated with EGF for 10 min and the extracts
purified through DE52 and phenyl-Superose.  MAP-2 activity determinations
showed that p42<sup>mapk</sup> was eluted with ethylene glycol and
NaCl as usual (shown by anti-PY blotting), and MAP-2 activity
corresponding to wash material containing p44 (also visible on the blot).
With Mono Q purification, two peaks of MAP-2 activity, I and II,
with peak I containing the largest activity, were eluted from the column.
The peak I eluting at 80 mM contained the p42<sup>mapk</sup>
(shown by anti-PY blotting) while peak II eluting closely behind
at 100 mM was p44.

Activation of a microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase by
insulin-like growth factor-I in bovine chromaffin cells
<p class="1stP">
Bovine chromaffin cells were isolated by collagenase digestion
and treated with IGF-I for 10 min at 37&deg;.  Treatment of cells
was either in EBSS, EBSS containing 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>,
10 nM IGF-I, or IGF-I + Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>.
The cells were extracted and the crude homogenate used in an incubation
of MAP-2 and hot ATP.  MAP-2 was analyzed for phosphorylation on 6% SDS
gels and the band was visualized and then Cerenkov counted for
incorporation.  The results indicate that when the vanadate inhibitor
was present in the IGF-treated sample, the effects of the kinase are
potentiated.  The inhibitor added to untreated cells causes
only a small increase in phosphorylation.  With IGF-I alone,
the phosphorylation was greater than with the vanadate inhibitor
alone.  The control (untreated and no vanadate inhibitor) had the
least phosphorylation of all.
<p>
A time course of MAP-2 kinase activity with 10 nM IGF-I
treatment indicates maximal activation is achieved between 10-15 min.
The 30 min time point does indicate a
decline and that the activation is not stable.
Note that the time course is done in the presence of
0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>.  An increase in activation is
observed even after 2 min.  The concentration dependence of MAP-2
kinase activity on [IGF-I] shows that 10 nM IGF-I is the dose
necessary to achieve maximal activation, with higher concentrations having
no effect.  This curve also done in presence of vanadate inhibitor.
<p>
Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were isolated by
passing extracts of IGF-I-treated cells over a BSA-Sepharose to remove proteins
tending to bind nonspecifically and then over a 1G2 monoclonal antibody
affinity column generated from activated Sepharose 4B.
This monoclonal was grown in the ascites of
BALB/c mice, 50% ammonium sulfate precipitated and purified over a
phosphotyrosine-Sepharose 4B column.
Eluates from 1G2-Sepharose beads (elution is with phenyl phosphate) were
found to have MAP-2 kinase activity in both control and IGF-I-treated
cells.  The activity was increased with
both IGF-I and Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>.
Extract loads spiked with phenyl phosphate did not elute a MAP-2 kinase
activity from the beads.  An SDS gel on MAP-2
incubated in presence of labeled ATP and extracts shows MAP-2 to incorporate
the phosphate.
<p>
The pattern of phosphotyrosine proteins was examined on
SDS gels in which cells were pre-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>,
stimulated with IGF-I with vanadate present, adsorbed to 1G2-Sepharose
beads, and then specific eluates. The unstimulated cells showed prominent
PTyr protein bands at 116, 92, and 50 kDa.
IGF-I enhanced phosphorylation into all of these bands and caused the
appearance of a 42 kDa protein.  The 92
kDa band may be the &beta;-subunit of IGF-I receptor.
<p>
The divalent cation specificity of the MAP-2 kinase
activity in extracts and Ig 2-Sepharose
eluates was examined and 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>
was necessary and sufficient for activity. 2 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup>
does not support MAP-2 kinase activity and appears to be
inhibitory since activity was not increased/normally present in unstimulated
cells with 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> present
as well.  This was assumed since the
activation was much greater/more apparent with IGF-I treatment.
<p>
The MAP-2 kinase was distinguished from other kinases in
that the assays of crude extracts carried out in the presence
of EDTA (absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and found to be
active, which necessarily eliminates protein kinase C or
Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin as being involved in the
phosphorylation.  Addition of the
heat-stable inhibitor of PK-A did not affect activity.
The insulin-stimulated MAP-2 kinase of 3T3
fibroblasts is inhibited by 80 mM NaF; so is the IGF-I stimulated kinase
in crude extracts or Ig 2-Sepharose eluates.  The MAP-2 was analyzed for
phosphoamino acids and shown to contain PSer, some PThr, but no PTyr.
The MAP-2 is not therefore directly phosphorylated by receptor.
<p>
Alternative substrate analysis using Lys-rich histones,
mixed histones, and ribosomal S6 protein indicate that these were all poor
substrates for IGF-I activated protein kinase.
MBP was a good substrate however.
The kinase activity for MAP-2 and MBP co-chromatographed on
DEAE-cellulose.  The activity was nearly
all in the cytosol, with 10% found in the particulate fraction.
<p>
Commercial alkaline phosphatase was used to pre-treat samples of
kinase from crude extracts and 1G2-Sepharose eluates of control and
stimulated cells.  These were in some cases prepared in buffers
lacking vanadate.  MBP activity was reduced 75% in crude extracts
from control and stimulated cells treated with APase, and the
effect of APase was blocked by inhibitors used:  vanadate, EDTA,
Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and phenyl phosphate.
This indicates that dephosphorylation by phosphatases is the cause
of loss of activation (and not to proteolysis or other undefinable
activation mechanism).  The same was true for APase and inhibitor
effects in Ig 2-Sepharose eluates.
<p>
Other agonists working on chromaffin cells were
tested.  Insulin also increased MAP-2
kinase activity but was much less effective at 10 nM than IGF-I.
EGF, phorbol esters (PDBu), and nicotinic
agonists (DMPP) increase the PTyr content of the
pp42<sup>mapk</sup> (see Ely et al., 1990), and in this
case increased MAP-2 kinase activity.  FGF was reported
to increase MAP-2 kinase activity in PC12 cells and did so
in chromaffin cells.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinases: ERKs in progress
<p class="1stP">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Hormones or other agents with receptors that
signal through known heterotrimeric G proteins control the
production and release of second messengers.  The action of
these messengers in part involves the activation of
messenger-dependent serine/threonine protein kinases.
Growth factors and cytokines also activate
these kinases as well, which tend to activate tyrosine
kinases which are often membrane-bound.  The identification of
proteins which are tyrosine-phosphorylated which induce serine/threonine
phosphorylation remains undeveloped.  It
has been shown that insulin and growth factors induce the phosphorylation of
serine residues on ribosomal S6, although the effect of serine phosphorylation
of S6 is not known.  In attempting to
elucidate the identity of the kinases involved in S6 phosphorylation, a second protein
kinase cascade independent of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase cascade has
been found.  This cascade ends with <i>rsk</i>, which is the
<u>r</u>ibosomal <u>S</u>6 <u>k</u>inase, then a kinase which
phosphorylates the S6 kinase, called S6 kinase kinase, then an
&#147;activator&#148; of the S6 kinase kinase.  The S6 kinase kinase group
has essentially two enzymes with a third related kinase all having been cloned and
corresponding to ERK1, ERK2, and ERK3.
The MAP-2, MBP, and mitogen- or maturation-activated protein (MAP)
kinases are essentially the same.
<p>
Ray and Sturgill (1987) described a MAP-2 kinase from
insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes distinct from other insulin- or growth
factor-sensitive kinases including the S6 kinase.
Several others have reported the presence of MAP-2 or MBP
activity present in a vast range of cells activated by different stimuli, all
probably attributable to ERKs, i.e. kinases are related or identical (see
table).  An MBP kinase became activated
in maturing Xenopus oocytes, after germinal vesicle breakdown in the sea star,
and after fertilization in sea urchin eggs.
Hoshi et al (1988) reported a MAP-2 kinase stimulated in 3Y1 cells by
EGF, phorbol esters, PDGF, and FGF; the
kinase was inhibited by low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but this effect was
reduced when the enzyme was further purified (Ca-activated phosphatases?).
Mitogens appear to be the chief stimulus, but other nonmitogenic agents
also appear to influence activity: okadaic acid, bradykinin.
In terminally differentiated cells, the effects of NGF and insulin
stimulate activity without altering proliferation.

<p>
The pp42 earlier identified by Kazlauskas and Cooper in growth
factor-stimulated and virally transformed cells
now appears to be identical to the 3T3-L1 MAP-2 kinase found by Ray and
Sturgill.  It was 10 years earlier that
this protein was identified as potential target of tyrosine kinases, but
because of difficulties with purification, it was not identified.
<p>
Near homogeneous purification by three different groups
(Sanghera et al. 1990, Boulton et al. 1991, Gotoh et al 1991) allowed obtaining
protein sequences for cloning.  Sanghera
et al purified pp44 from sea star, Boulton et al the ERK1 MAP-2 kinase from
mutant Rat 1, and Gotoh et al a MAP-2 kinase from Xenopus oocytes.
<p>
Sequence from ERK1 was used to probe a rat brain cDNA
library to obtain the ERK1, later two related ERKs, ERK2 (83% identity with
ERK1) and ERK3 (42% identity).  Certain
&#147;subdomains&#148; show much higher rates of identity, indicating conserved coding
regions.  The ERKs are highly related to
yeast cell cycle control kinases KSS1 and FUS3, less so to cdc2.
The ERK1 clone is not full length, the 5&#146;
end being very difficult to isolate.  An
ERK4 has been identified by cross-reactivity with antibodies to other
ERKs.  Southern analysis suggests even
more related kinases.  ERKs have been
identified in clones from Xenopus, human T cells, mouse, Drosophila, and
alfalfa.

Identification of substrate recognition determinants for human
ERK1 and ERK2 protein kinases
<p class="1stP">
Human A431 cells grown to confluence and treated with EGF as
reported by Northwood et al (JBC 266: 15266).
ERK1 kinase was purified by Mono-Q and Mono-P chromatography, and ERK2
purified by Mono-Q and phenyl-Superose.
The assay employed a synthetic peptide in a pH 7.4 HEPES buffer.
<p>
It is known that ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylate EGF receptor at Thr-669
(see Northwood et al). ERK1 also phosphorylates both Myc and Jun
(see Alvarez et al., JBC 266: 15277).
Synthetic peptides to sites containing the Ser-62 phosphorylation site
of Myc and Ser-246 of Jun were constructed.

<p>
ERK2 is known to phosphorylate MBP at Thr-97 and the kinase
itself at Thr-183 and Tyr-185.  Both
kinases phosphorylated the MBP synthetic peptide, but neither was able to
phosphorylate the corresponding T_Y site in autophosphorylation sequence.
A consensus -Pro-Leu-Ser/Thr-Pro- site had
been earlier identified in our previous report.
Since MBR has a -Pro-Arg-Thr-Pro- sequence, the substrate specificity
was examined further.
<p>
The KRELVEP<u>L</u>TPSGEA peptide was used as a model substrate
with the Leu residue underlined substituted.
Substitution with Arg or Lys still produced rapid phosphorylation by
both protein kinases as efficient and slightly more efficient than Leu.
Substitution with Glu however resulted in a
diminished phosphorylation, with ERK2/MAP-2 kinase only 40% as efficient at
phosphorylation and the ERT-K/ERK1 even less efficient (at 15%).
Rather than substitution, but instead
deletion of Leu altogether, reduced phosphorylation to &lt;10% for both
kinases.
<p>
The effect of substitution of the Pro residues was also
examined.  Substitution of -<b>P</b>LTP- to -ALTP- markedly reduced
phosphorylation by 85% for both kinases.  Substitution of -PLT<b>P</b>-
to -PLTA- showed phosphorylation which was even half of the other
substitution.  Substitution of both (from -<b>P</b>LT<b>P</b>- to -ALTA-)
did not reduce phosphorylation to zero, but it was apparent that
phosphorylation was occurring merely because the threonine was there.
<p>
Other effects examining the location of the necessary
proline residues were examined.  Transposition of -P<b>LT</b>P- to
-PTLP- resulted in virtually zero incorporation for both kinases, strongly
indicating that a C-terminal proline is necessary (compare even to the deleted
Leu results where at least 10% phosphorylation was observed over controls).
Insertion of a Leu between -Thr-Pro- shows this as well at least for the
ERK1 kinase: -PLTP- was altered to -PLTLP- and while ERK2 kinase
phosphorylated &gt;5%, the ERK1 incorporation results were virtually 0%.
The position of the N-terminal-side Pro was not as critical however:
for ERK2 it was more sensitive (35% rate of phosphorylation) while
for ERK1 it was 67%.  Hence the <i>N</i>-side Pro requires at least
one amino acid separation to the Thr, but could tolerate a 2-amino
acid separation.
<p>
Analysis of the amino acid sequences of Myc, Jun, and the
EGF receptor indicated no other conservation of residues in these proteins,
making it unlikely that other elements of (primary) structure contribute
to the substrate specificity of the kinases.
The only other feature found was a series of several glutamic acid
residues near the -PLTP-motif. Therefore, the
KR<b>E</b>LV<b>E</b>PLTPSG<b>E</b>A (the EFG sequence) underwent
substitutions (to Ala) for each of the Glu residues indicated; peptides
reflected single substitutions as well as permutations of peptides from doubly
and triply substituted residues.  The lowest incorporation was slightly
&lt;20% (for the ERK1 kinase; 30-40% for the ERK2 kinase) involving
doubly substituted Glu, but that was lower than for the
triply substituted peptide, which restored phosphorylation very well.
Such substitution effects could not be said
to involve very specific substrate recognition patterns, so the -PLTP- motif
seems to be the minimally necessary substrate.
<p>
Kinetic data was obtained for the synthetic sequences of
the natural substrates and the variously substituted.
The results largely reflect was what observed in the
incorporation data.  Changes in the
observed maximum rate of phosphorylation appears in the majority of
differences, while the K<sub>m(app)</sub> reflects
peptides that are very poorly phosphorylated.

Interleukin-1 represents a new modality for the activation of
extracellular signal-regulated kinases/microtubule-associated protein-2 kinases
<p class="1stP">
A protein kinase which seems to have preference for the motif
XS/TPY, where X is hydrophobic and Y is often aspartic or glutamic acid is the
basis of this study.  Databases were searched with this limitation:  LSPE
occurs in L-plastin and HSP27, stathmin has two LSPY motifs, rat talin has
ten XS/TPY motifs, and the cytoplasmic domain of the EGF-R contains PLTP
(T-669).  A T669 peptide (ELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR) was synthesized as a substrate.
<p>
KB epidermoid carcinoma cell were stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-1 alpha.
After 5 min, an increase in T669 kinase activity is detectable, reaching
a 12.9-fold maximum over basal between 15 and 30 min.  A rapid decline
in activity was returned to basal by 2 h.  All radioactivity was
incorporated into threonine according to phosphoamino acid analysis,
despite a serine at 671.  The degree of activation of the kinase by
IL-1 alpha was dose-dependent as determined after a 15 min time period.
<p>
Other cultured cell lines known to express IL-1 receptor,
although at different levels, were investigated to determine their T669 kinase
activity response to IL-1 alpha treatment.
HepG2 hepatoma, WI-38 lung fibroblast, MRC-5 lung fibroblast, EL4 6.1
murine thymoma, EL4<sup>3+</sup> cells (an
IL-1R-ve mutant), HGF gingival fibroblast, CB23 B lymphocyte, 3T3-L1 murine
preadipocyte, RPMI 1788 B lymphocyte, and 70Z/3 murine pre-B cells were treated
with 20 ng/ml IL-1, 100 ng/ml PMA, or 50 ng/ml EGF.
Results show that some of the cells increased T699 kinase activity
after 15 min; this response observed in
connective tissue-derived cell lines and in EL4 (a T cell line), all cells of
which express the 80-kDa IL-1 receptor except in the receptor-negative variant
of EL4.  There is no clear correlation
between receptor expression and T669 kinase activation.
Cells not responding (CB23, RPMI 1788,
70Z/3) express the 67-kDa &quot;type II&quot; IL-1R.
In the case of HepG2, which had the greatest activation, both
IL-1R types are expressed.

Insulin and 12-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
activation of two immunologically distinct myelin basic protein/microtubule-associated
protein 2 (MBP/MAP-2) kinases via <i>de novo</i>
phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues
<p class="1stP">
Peptides corresponding to predicted amino acid sequences from
the ERK1 cDNA were synthesized and used as antigens to produce
polyclonal antibodies.  Specifically peptide Y91 corresponds
to residues 307-327 (ITVEEALAHPYLEQYYDPTDE) and peptide C92 corresponds to
residues 350-367 (ELIFQETARFQPGAPEAP).  These were coupled to KLH
(Walter et al., PNAS 77: 5197, 1980) before injection.
<p>
CHO cells which overexpress the human insulin receptor
(CHO-HIR) were lysed in a buffer containing 1 mM vanadate,
10 mM NaF, 10 mM PP<sub>i</sub>, and 10 nM okadaic acid.
This was immunoprecipitated with anti-Y91 and -C92 in the
presence or absence of 0.15% SDS.  Immunoblotting with
anti-Y91 after SDS-PAGE showed that there was
no immunoppt if SDS was not included in the immunopptn buffer; with SDS
present, a 42 and 44 kDa protein could be detected..
Immunoblotting with anti-C92 and SDS present revealed both a
small fraction of the 42 kDa protein and the entire 44 kDa protein, but with
SDS absent only the 44 kDa protein was present.
Control serum in either the presence or absence of SDS recognized
no protein.
<p>
The CHO-HIR cells were treated with 0.1 &mu;M insulin for 5
min or 100 ng/ml TPA for 10 min, lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Y92
(+SDS) or anti-C92 (-SDS), and then run on SDS polyacrylamide gels which
containing 0.5 mg/ml MBP.  The excess
SDS is removed from the gel first with isopropanol in Tris.
Gels are treated with guanidine HCl and then
renaturing buffer is added.  Gels are
presoaked in an activity assay buffer and labeled ATP is added and after a time
removed with TCA and PP<sub>i</sub> until
the radioactivity is removed.  The
autoradiograph revealed that the anti-Y91 material contains little MBP activity
for basal state cells, but both insulin- and TPA-treated cells show 10- to
15-fold increases in MBP activity in both a 42 and 44 kDa band.
The anti-C92 showed both insulin- and TPA-induced
increases in MBP activity, but only in a 44 kDa band.
<p>
CHO-HIR cells were <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>-labeled and either
treated with insulin or TPA, lysed, and immunoprecipitated as before.
For untreated (basal state) cells, anti-Y91 precipitates reveal a
44 kDa band on the immunoblot.  With insulin and TPA treatment
this immunoprecipitate shows phosphorylation of the 42 kDa band
and increased phosphorylation of the 44 kDa band.  It is noted
that the anti-Y91 action against pp42 is specific since
(i) preincubation of affinity-purified antibody with Y91 peptide
does not precipitate pp42 from lysates and (ii) control serum does not
recognize pp42.  The same was true for the pp44 protein.
<p>
Immunoprecipitation with anti-C92 peptide for the
untreated cells shows a pp40 present in the basal state.
Insulin or TPA stimulation caused the
appearance of phosphorylation in pp44 without change in pp40
phosphorylation.  This
immunoprecipitation was specific for the same reasons as given above:
it was prevented with preincubation with C92
peptide and control serum did not recognize pp44.
<p>
Western blots were done simultaneously with the
autoradiography.  Anti-Y91 generally
recognized bands at 42 and 44 kDa in SDS gel separated lysates of the CHO-HIR
cells.  Anti-C92 recognized the 44 kDa
protein but the 42 kDa protein more weakly.
More stringent washing of the NC blot (with 1 M NaCl and 0.1% SDS)
produced an even weaker signal with anti-C92 recognition of the 42 kDa
protein.  When anti-C92 immunoprecipitates
(done in the absence of SDS) were probed with both anti-Y91 and -C92 on Western
blots, only the 44 kDa protein was observed in both.
Anti-Y91 immunoprecipitation (in the presence of SDS) followed by
Western blotting with either of the antibodies indicated that anti-Y91
recognized both 42 and 44 kDa proteins with equal intensity, but the anti-C92
recognized the 44 kDa with greater intensity than the 42 kDa.
<p>
Anti-Y91 immunoprecipitation was used to follow the
insulin-stimulated phosphorylation in pre-labeled CHO-HIR cells.
Increased phosphorylation of pp42 was
evident as early as 2 min and was maximal at 5 min.
Phosphorylation was decreased thereafter up to 20 min.
Maximal phosphorylation was also observed
after 5 min in pp44.  The renaturable in
situ MBP kinase assay for polyacrylamide gels was performed and indicated that
kinase activity also reached a maximum after 5 min with 12-fold stimulation in
the bands.  The time course of
stimulated kinase activity in the renaturable system reflected the changes in
phosphorylation state of pp42 and pp44.
The results with anti-C92 immunoprecipitation were practically the same
as the anti-Y91 immunoprecipitates insofar as the kinetics of activation.
The immunoprecipitated lysates were also
tested for kinase activity toward MAP-2, and the results were similar to the
MBP kinase results.

Autophosphorylation in vitro of recombinant 42-kilodalton
mitogen-activated protein kinase on tyrosine
<p class="1stP">
The plasmid pET-MK was constructed using a p42<sup>mapk</sup> cDNA
(excised from the pA4 plasmid described by Boulton et al) of 1.25 kb
and this was ligated to a 5639-bp fragment which contains a blunt
end corresponding to the ATG start codon of the phage T7 phi10 gene.
<i>E. coli</i> HB101 was transformed and the p42<sup>mapk</sup>
is unfused and under the transcriptional and translational control of T7.
A kinase-defective mutant (Lys-52 to Arg) was generated using the
Promega &quot;Altered Sites&quot; in vitro mutagenesis kit.
Expression of the p42<sup>mapk</sup> is induced by IPTG.
<p>
Bacterial extracts demonstrated the presence of a 42 kDa
protein not seen in extracts of bacteria transformed with pET plasmid absent
the p42<sup>mapk</sup> insert.  Antibody 1798 is an antipeptide antibody
which recognizes p42<sup>mapk</sup> and immunoblotting of gels indicated
the same result the stained gels.  Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine
(anti-PY) revealed that a portion of p42 was phosphorylated on tyrosine as
well.
<p>
Tyrosine kinases in <i>E. coli</i> are unknown and the regulatory
phosphorylation known in p42<sup>mapk</sup> occurs in a region where
autophosphorylation is known to occur in other kinases, so it is
possible that the phosphorylation is by autophosphorylation.
A kinase-defective mutant (Lys52&rarr;Arg) with an altered ATP-binding
site was found to be expressed as a protein on stained gels, but
showed no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation.
<p>
The soluble portion of the extract was purified over
phenyl-Superose resolved the recombinant protein into two highly purified
forms, in which one form eluted in a broad peak in the wash of
the column with the other form was removed
in an ethylene glycol gradient.  Another
form in small quantities was found in the flow-through but was not
characterized.  Silver staining of SDS
gels of the peaks from the column reveals a band at 42,000 which is
p42<sup>mapk</sup>, a finding verified by immunoblots
with antibody 1798, and anti-p42<sup>mapk</sup>.
The first form from the washed column represented 25-45% of the protein.
Anti-PY immunoblots showed that the first form contained PY but the
second form off the column did not have PY.
Bacteria were grown in <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>,
then their extracts purified the same way to recover the 42 kDa protein:
phosphoamino acid analysis shows only P-Tyr in the first form,
no radioactivity was found in the second form.
<p>
Purified p42<sup>mapk</sup> was incubated with [g-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP
and found to incorporate label into the wild-type form (as shown earlier by
Boulton), but not in the mutant (kinase-defective) form.
This shows that p42<sup>mapk</sup> is truly an autophosphorylating kinase.
This activity was found in both of the
phenyl-Superose resolved forms of p42<sup>mapk</sup>.
Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that both
P-Thr and P-Tyr were present.  Indeed, a
time course done for both forms shows that the second form, Tyr phosphorylation
occurred rapidly while the Thr phosphorylation was lagging.
This Thr phosphorylation lag was not found
for the first form, which phosphorylated Thr rapidly and which already contains
P-Tyr (as shown above).  Together,
autophosphorylation of Tyr appears to facilitate the ability of
p42<sup>mapk</sup> to phosphorylate Thr.
<p>
The amount of phosphate incorporated into tyrosine was
determined dependent upon the enzyme concentration, using the second form of
the enzyme.  The enzyme is incubated
with labeled MgATP for only 8 min, then the Tyr phosphorylated per min per mol
MAP kinase vs the enzyme added is plotted.
(It was done for 8 min since tyrosine phosphorylation occurs within this
time and virtually no Thr phosphorylation can occur.)
The line-fitted plot across enzyme concentration from 0.25 &mu;g
enzyme to 3.0 &mu;g is straight and flat at 1 mmol P-Tyr/min/mmol MAP kinase,
indicating that it is independent of enzyme concentration.
This shows that phosphorylation is
apparently <i>intra</i>molecular and not <i>inter</i>molecular.
<p>
The first form of in vitro autophosphorylated enzyme had
four tryptic phosphopeptides on TLE/C maps (pH 1.9 in the electrophoretic
mode).  The second form had only 1
phosphopeptide, one comigrating with one of the phosphopeptides in the first
form.  This second form Ppeptide also
migrates with a synthetic peptide which is the regulatory peptide labeled at
Tyr-185 by pp60<sup>src</sup> phosphorylation.  One important
observation is that no phosphopeptide comigrates with a regulatory peptide
phosphorylated on both Thr-183 and Tyr-185, in either form phosphorylated in
vitro.  Hence, the recombinant p42<sup>mapk</sup> is capable only of intramolecular
autophosphorylation of only one (Tyr-185) of the two regulatory sites.
<p>
The first form which was already Tyr-autophosphorylated
was 10-20 times more active than the second form toward MBP as substrate.
If the purified second form was incubated
with ATP under autokinase conditions for various times, there could be found a
direct correlation between autophosphorylation and increasing activation toward
MBP.  With the first form of the enzyme,
already containing P-Tyr, no increasing activation or incorporated phosphate
was found.  This was true despite a
showing of increased phosphorylation of one or more unidentified Thr residues
in the first form.

<u>Discussion</u>. The p42<sup>mapk</sup> has been
described as a Ser/Thr protein kinase, but is now shown to be capable of Tyr
autophosphorylation.  A class of protein
kinases capable of both Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphorylation is emerging.
In a region of the catalytic domain called
subdomain VIII, p42<sup>mapk</sup> shares
sequence similarities with KSS1, FUS3, and ERK1 kinases.
On the amino terminal side of the conserved
APE sequence is and RXYR sequence (where X is a hydrophobic, planar side
group).  Note that while Tyr phosphorylation is shown by the enzyme
for its own sequence, there is no data showing it phosphorylates
the Tyr of other substrates.  The autophosphorylation was undetected
before because the cultured cells used produce small amounts of enzyme;
re-examination of these cells using CD45 Tyr phosphatase as well as
vanadate seem to show now this Tyr autophosphorylation ability.

Activation of microtubule-associated protein kinase in PC12D
cells in response to both fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor
and concomitant stimulation of the outgrowth of neurites
<p class="1stP">
PC12D cells are shown to extend neurites very quickly (in 6 h)
with 100 ng/ml NGF treatment.  This is
true even in the presence of 5 &mu;M actinomycin D (preincubated for 2 h).
For conventional PC12 cells, no neurite outgrowth was observable.
Continued presence of the inhibitor for more than 48 h severely
affected cell survival of both lines.
<p>
Incubation with 1 &mu;g/ml bovine FGF, neurites could be seen
to extend after 24 h, similar to the response seen with NGF or
0.5 mM Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP.  Only a few processes were observed
with 5 ng/ml EGF or 10 &mu;M dexamethasone addition.  These
treatments were also done for 24 h with these compounds alone
or in combination with saturating NGF before % neurite-bearing
cells were scored:  NGF + Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP showed an additivity
in their effects, suggesting a separate mechanism of induction
in these processes.  The dexamethasone appeared to inhibit neurite
formation caused by NGF compared to the score of NGF alone.  Since the
effects of NGF in combination with either bovine FGF or EGF were not additive,
it may be the case they work through the same mechanism.
Addition of anti-NGF serum to culture treated with NGF
(at 5 and 30 ng/ml) or FGF definitely inhibited the NGF-induced
neurite outgrowth but had little effect on FGF-induced neurites, indicating
that any effect of FGF was not due to the presence of contaminating NGF.
<p>
MT proteins (MAP-1 and MAP-2) were incubated with PC12
cell extracts in the presence of labeled ATP.
These cell extracts were obtained from cells which had been treated with
NGF, FGF, or EGF.  The enzyme assays are
stopped with SDS sample buffer, the reactions run out on SDS gels, and the
stained protein bands excised for counting.
Plots of kinase activity for both substrates and % neurite-bearing cells
versus log of [growth factor] added indicate that and increased phosphorylation
is seen with MAP-1 and -2.  NGF-treated
cells incubated in the presence of anti-NGF serum showed no increased
phosphorylation (no kinase activation);
the antiserum was without effect on the FGF-induced activation.
A close correlation between kinase
activation for both substrates and the changes in %age of neurite-bearing cells
is found.  Synthetic human bFGF was also
used in these studies and found to activate kinases and induce neurites at
lower concentrations than FGF or even NGF, although these latter two ultimately
produce greater maximal effects.  Of interest is the fact that EGF
induced kinase activation similarly to synthetic human bFGF (i.e.,
similar curves), indicating that they might be acting at the same
receptor (yet EGF did not induce neurites much at all compared to s. h. bFGF).
<p>
MAP-2 phosphorylating activity was also shown to be additive
with NGF added in combo with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP.
PMA treatment (at 0.1 &mu;M, time not given)
also stimulated MAP-1 and MAP-2 phosphorylation significantly.
We believe that NGF and FGF (or EGF) may act
through the same enzyme in the in vitro phosphorylation of MAP-1 and -2.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of
microtubule-associated proteins, microtubule-associated protein 2 and
microtubule-associated protein 4, induces an alteration in their function
<p class="1stP">
Porcine brain MAP-2 and MAP-4 from bovine adrenal cortex are
used in these studies.  The MAP kinase
is from extracts of EGF-treated rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells (by DEAE-cellulose,
phenyl-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, heparin-Sepharose, and polyLys-agarose).
<p>
The MAPK preparation was free of non-MAPK activity as
judged by results of the polyacrylamide gel kinase renaturation assay using
MAP-2, MBP, casein, and histone as the substrate proteins:
two bands on autorads are seen with MAP-2
but not casein and histone.  MAPK
treated with protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit, known to inactivate
MAPK, shows no bands.  Previous work
also shows this MAPK does not phosphorylate tau, actin, phosphorylase
<i>b</i>, or protamine.  Its activity toward MAP-2 was unaffected by
the presence of PK-A inhibitor (30 &mu;g/ml), cAMP (10 &mu;M),
Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM), Mn<sup>2+</sup> (3 mM), or heparin (5 &mu;M)
which inhibits CK-II.  50% inhibition observed with 0.1 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup>.
<p>
MAP-2 was treated in the presence of labeled ATP with
MAPK, PK-A, CK-II, or EGF receptor-rich A431 membranes.
Bands of MAP-2 purified on SDS gels were excised and digested
via the one-dimensional peptide mapping using V8 protease.
Autorads show different patterns for these
kinases.  An autorad of an SDS gel in
which a time course of chymotryptic digestion of MAPK- and
PK-A-phosphorylated MAP-2 is performed also reveals differences
in the phosphorylation sites.  Specific activity of MAPK was 2100
pmol/min/mg.  MAP-2 isolated from many
cycles contains endogenous phosphate, so phosphate incorporation was tested on
MAP-2 with (13 mol P/mol MAP-2) and without (7 mol P/mol MAP-2) acid
phosphatase treatment.  The (K<sub>m</sub>)<sub>app</sub> for MAP-2
is 3.5 &mu;M.
<p>
The effect of phosphorylation of MAP-2 by MAPK was
measured by its ability polymerize tubulin (50 &mu;g/ml MAP-2 added to 1 mg/ml
tubulin).  The change in OD 350 nm was
measured against time and revealed that unphosphorylated (acid
phosphatase-treated MAP-2 + MAPK but no ATP) induced turbidity increases while
the MAPK-phosphorylated (ph&#146;tase MAP-2 + MAP + ATP) showed no changes in
turbidity.  If the % inhibition of
polymerization were plotted against the mol P incorporated/mol MAP-2, a direct
linear relationship is shown (points used are 0, 2, 5, 9, and 13 mol P/mol
MAP-2).  Increasing MAP-2 concentrations
were added to taxol-stabilized tubulin (1.5 mg/ml tubulin + 0.5 mM GTP + 20 &mu;M
taxol) and the polymerized tubulin reached a plateau level.
A Scatchard plot of revealed that phosphate-free MAP-2 and
MAPK-phosphorylated MAP-2 had respective K<sub>d</sub>
for tubulin binding of 0.4 and 1.2 &mu;M, indicating that phosphorylation
reduces MAP-2 affinity for MTs.
<p>
Chymotryptic fragments containing the tubulin-binding
domain of MAP-2 (32-39 kDa in length) were purified.
Silliman and Sturgill had previously reported that MAP-2 was
phosphorylated in the projection domain, yet we show that purified acid
phosphatase-treated, chymotryptic fragments containing the MT-binding domain
are also phosphorylated by MAPK.  Phosphatase
2A-treated MAPK did not phosphorylate these fragments.
Nor did the peptide inhibitor for PK-A
inhibit phosphorylation, indicating MAPK was responsible for the
phosphorylation.  1.8 mol P/mol
MT-binding fragments were incorporated (assuming a 36 kDa average mass) when 80
&mu;g/ml fragments were phosphorylated by MAPK for 2 h at 0.5 mM ATP.
9 &mu;g/ml unphosphorylated fragments induced
tubulin polymerization while the same concentration of MAPK-phosphorylated
material did not.  Tubulin
polymerization efficiency was linear with the fragment concentration.
Nearly three times the phosphorylated
fragment concentration was necessary to induce the same polymerization as
unphosphorylated fragment (this was true for the minimum needed as well).
<p>
Determination of the region of phosphate incorporation by
MAPK into MAP-2 was assessed for the MT-binding and projection domain:
16% of the label was found in the MT-binding
region.  With 9 mol phosphate/mol intact
MAP-2 causing 70% inhibition of ability to induce tubulin polymerization, 1.4
mol P must be in the MT-binding domain.
In a separate phosphorylation study of the fragments, if they had
incorporated about 1.8 mol P/mol fragment, they lost about 70% of the
tubulin-polymerizing ability, agreeing with the result by the other authors.
<p>
The 190 kDa major heat-stable MAP of adrenal gland (MAP-4)
was also tested at 0.3 mg/ml against MAPK.
1.7 mol P/mol MAP-4 incorporation was indicated with a K<sub>m</sub>
of 1.2 &mu;M (one-third that for MAP-2) and a V<sub>max</sub> about
25% of that for MAP-2.  There was no difference with
phosphatase-treated MAP-4.  36 &mu;g/ml of
the MAPK-phosphorylated MAP-4 added to 1 mg/ml tubulin had little ability to
induce polymerization.  Decreases in tubulin polymerization were linear
with the # of phosphates incorporated, in which 1 mol P/mol MAP-4 was
sufficient to abolish polymerization induction by MAP-4.
<p>
Purified centrosomes were prepared and incubated with purified
tubulin in the presence of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated MAP-2 or -4.
With 1.3 mg/ml tubulin, centrosome-independent assembly of MTs did not
occur, while even centrosome-organized assembly was minimal (mean length
measured by immunofluorescence of fixed MTs detected by labeled commercial
anti-tubulin).  Unphosphorylated MAP-2 induced very long MTs emanating
from centrosomes with spontaneous assembly also apparent.
With MAPK-phosphorylated MAP-2 only centrosome-organized MTs could be
observed.  Over a time course of observation, the nonphosphoMAP-2
always produced longer MTs than phospoMAP-2.  The variance about the
mean length was always larger for the phosphoMAP-2 than for nonphosphoMAP-2,
indicating many short MTs; this is interpretable as phosphoMAP-2 producing
a greater dynamic change in MT assembly and disassembly than the
nonphosphoMAP-2.  The MT number/centrosome was also measured:
centrosome-dependent MTs numbered 33.7/centrosome for
nonphosphoMAP-2 while phosphoMAP-2 showed ~7 MTs/centrosome, indicating that
MAPK affects MAP-2 ability to help organize MTs on centrosomes.
This same effect could also be observed for MAP-4.

Identification of an activator of the microtubule-associated
protein 2 kinases ERK1 and ERK2 in PC12 cells stimulated with nerve growth
factor or bradykinin
<p class="1stP">
PC12 cells were previously shown to respond to NGF with a rapid
increase in MAP kinase activity resolvable as two peaks on anion-exchange
chromatography.  These two peaks seen in EGF-stimulated 3T3 Swiss cells
and in okadaic acid-treated adipocytes and are two isoforms of MAP kinase,
ERK1 (1st peak) and ERK2 (2nd peak).  Bradykinin treatment of the cells
shown in these experiments also increases activity in both isoforms,
more than does NGF.
<p>
Extracts of untreated 3T3 and PC12 cells show that the <i>inactive</i>
forms of ERK1 and ERK2 elute from columns at ~0.1 M NaCl (see Ahn et al,
JBC 266: 4220, 1991; Boulton et al, Cell 65: 663, 1991).
These ERKs are activated by purified fractions
from the MonoQ column in the presence of MgATP, one fraction being the unbound
portion and one eluting early from the column (0.05 M NaCl).
These MAP kinases activators have been found
also in extracts of EGF-treated A431 cells.
<p>
Untreated PC12 extracts were fractionated on Mono Q and
EGF-treated A431 extracts containing MAP kinase activator
incubated with each of the fractions.  This revealed a
latent MAP kinase activity in fractions eluting prior to normally active
forms.  NGF- and bradykinin-treated PC12
extracts which had been resolved on MonoQ themselves were also tested on these
untreated PC12 MonoQ-fractionated extracts.
Hence the showing of a MAP kinase activator resolved in the flow-through
and early elution peak profiles.
Untreated PC12 cells showed no MAP kinase activator.
The activity of this MAP kinase activator
was greater in bradykinin-treated cells than for NGF-treated, consistent with
results showing a greater MAP kinase activity with bradykinin than with NGF.
<p>
The Mono Q-resolved PC12 cell MAP kinase activator was
then pooled and pre-incubated along with MgATP with the fractions containing
inactive MAP kinase revealed by the A431 MAP kinase activator.
(MBP was used as a substrate for MAP kinase
activity.) The same elution position revealed.
Gel filtration analysis of the NGF- or
bradykinin-stimulated MAP kinase activator showed it to be a 60-70 kDa protein,
a finding shown for the activator in EGF-treated Swiss 3T3 cells.
<p>
The in vitro activated MAP kinases by the NGF- or
bradykinin-enhanced MAP kinase activity were resolved on Mono Q into two peaks,
at positions shown for ERK1 and ERK2 resolution in stimulated intact
cells.  Use of labeled ATP in the
activation reaction of each Mono Q fraction, followed by SDS-PAGE and
autoradiography show that the Mono Q-resolved 1st and 2nd peaks are 42 and 44
kDa, resp, a finding consistent with phosphoprotein sizes of polyclonals
recognizing ERK1 and ERK2 in Swiss 3T3 cells.
Transfer of these 42 and 44 kDa proteins to PVDF membranes followed by phosphoamino
acid analysis show that both contain P-Tyr and P-Thr, with some P-Ser.
This is reproducible with results from ERK1
and ERK2 from several different cell types treated with various growth factors.
<p>
Trypsinolysis of the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled
42- and 44-kDa proteins activated in vitro with MAP kinase activator (proteins
were electroeluted from wet gels) was done followed by TLE/C (electrophoresis
pH 8.9).  The peptide maps compared to
tryptic maps of immunoprecipitated ERK1 and ERK2 obtained from P-labeled and
NGF-treated intact PC12 cells.  The ERK1
and ERK2 references revealed 6 phosphopeptides, and the distribution of
<sup>32</sup>P clearly differed between the two isozymes.  In contrast,
the in vitro-activated ERK1 and ERK2 each had only a single phosphopeptide,
identical for both enzymes.  Hence, phosphorylation of a single
phosphopeptide appears adequate for activation (when the
in vitro-activated ERK1 and ERK2 tryptic digests were mixed,
the peptide co-migrated).  Mixing the in vitro-activated and
in situ-activated peptides showed that peptide 6 of the intact
cell activated ERKs was the peptide.  [Following are my observations:
It is likely to be multiply phosphorylated since it migrated faster
in the electrophoretic direction than 3 other phosphopeptides, was
equal to phosphopeptide 3 and slower than peptide 4.
It also migrated less in the chromatographic direction than other
peptides, so is likely to be more hydrophilic in character.]

MAP kinases:  charting the regulatory pathways
<p class="1stP">
Of the many intracellular signaling networks in the cell, the
elements of one complete pathway have not been fully shown,
but now one major mitogenic family is coming into focus.
Growth factor receptors have long been suspected of phosphorylating such
proteins as ribosomal protein S6. Extracellular mitogens activating PDGF, EGF,
and NGF induce autophosphorylation of their own domains, then phosphorylate and
activate serine/threonine protein kinases.
<p>
The S6 protein is a good starting point.  The <i>rsk</i>
gene family codes for a 70 kDa and a 90 kDa S6 kinase.
Activation of these S6 kinases requires Ser and Thr phosphorylation.
The MAP kinases (also called ERKs) phosphorylate many sites in
p90<i><sup>rsk</sup></i> sufficient to activate the kinase.
Since both kinases are activated by the same stimuli, the
MAP kinases are probably the physiological activators of the S6 kinase.
<p>
The MAP kinases are composed of 40 kDa-46 kDa isoforms
which phosphorylate a Thr residue of myelin basic protein in vitro.
Two isoforms, p42<i><sup>mapk</sup></i> and p44<i><sup>erk1</sup></i>,
require both threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation for maximal
activation.  For mouse p42<i><sup>mapk</sup></i> these sites have
been identified as Thr-183 and Tyr-185, which are conserved in
p44<i><sup>erk1</sup></i>.  Both forms also autophosphorylate
their tyrosine residues to become slightly activated, but the
kinetics of this autophosphorylation and autoactivation are
too slow to account for in vivo response.
<p>
The rapid stoichiometric Thr and Tyr phosphorylation of
the MAPKs requires two &quot;activating factors.&quot;
These have been observed in EGF-stimulated
Swiss mouse 3T3 cells, later in NGF-treated PC12 cells and maturing
<i>Xenopus</i> oocytes.  These are true kinases, since Thr and Tyr
phosphorylation occurs in p42<i><sup>mapk</sup></i> which has lost its
autophosphorylating ability because of mutagenesis (Posada, J.,
Cooper, J.A. <i>Science</i> <b>255</b>: 212, 1992; Nakielny, S.,
Cohen, P., Wu, J., Sturgill, T., <i>EMBO</i> <i>J</i>. <b>11</b>: 2123,
1992; Rossomando, A., Wu, J., Weber, M. J., Sturgill, T. W., <i>Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA</i> <b>89</b>: 5221, 1992).
<p>
Two human A431 MAPK kinases, murine and rabbit cognates,
and the Xenopus MAPK kinase migrate to 45 kDa by SDS-PAGE.
Antiserum to the <i>Xenopus</i> MAPK kinase cross-reacts with
a 45 kDa MAPK kinase in rat 3Y1 cells treated with EGF, PDGF,
insulin, and phorbol esters, and in PC12 stimulated with NGF.
Protein sequences have already been obtained of the 45 kDa
protein in mammals (Crew and Erikson, <i>PNAS USA</i>,
in press; Wu et al., <i>Biochem. J</i>. <b>285</b>: 701, 1992) and
in <i>Xenopus</i> (Kosako et al, <i>EMBO</i> J. 11: 2309, 1992).
In studies of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> mating, it has been shown that
p55<i><sup>ste7</sup></i> is an intermediary in the alpha
pheromone-induced activation of p40<i><sup>fus3</sup></i>,
a MAP kinase homolog.  Many other yeast kinases related to
p38<i><sup>byr1</sup></i> and p55<i><sup>ste7</sup></i> exist:

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf
in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro
<p class="1stP">
MAP kinase kinase is a 45-46 kDa dual specificity protein
tyrosine and threonine kinase now reported by several groups.
This kinase itself is necessarily activated
by serine-threonine kinases which have not yet been identified.
<p>
The c-Raf-1 protein kinase belongs to a family of serine-threonine
protein kinases encoded by three known genes in mammals called
<i>A-raf</i>-1, <i>B-raf</i>, and <i>c-raf</i>-1.
These Raf protein kinase show similarity to
protein kinase C family both in the conserved catalytic domain and in the
regulatory amino-terminal domain (the regulatory domain is truncated in v-Raf,
the transforming product of mouse sarcoma virus 3611).
c-Raf-1 kinase is a 74 kDa protein found in all mammalian tissues.
<p>
Of interest is that MAP kinase phosphorylates c-Raf-1 in
vitro, and the phosphopeptide recovered is identical to the phosphopeptide of
c-Raf-1 recovered from insulin-stimulated cells.

Chromatographic resolution and characterization of a nerve
growth factor-dependent kinase that phosphorylates microtubule-associated
proteins 1 and 2 in PC12 cells
<p class="1stP">
PC12D cells stimulated with NGF (50 ng/ml) demonstrated presence
of a MAP-1 and -2 kinase activity in 100,000 g supernatants of cell
homogenates.  The distribution of activity was measured in 10000 g
supernatants and the 100,000 g pellets.  There was no significant
differences with 0.5% Lubrol PX included in the extraction buffer.
Previous results show that NGF- or dibutyryl cAMP-treated cells
produce two distinct kinase activities.
Control, NGF-treated, and Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP-treated
cell supernatants were passed over a DEAE-Sepharose (1.3 x 12 cm; 2 ml
fractions collected) column, subsequently eluted with a 0.1 to 0.6 M NaCl
gradient.  Three separate kinase
activities could be identified using both MAP-1 and -2 as substrates, each eluting
late into the gradient.
<p>
Peak 1 showed a greater relative activation with Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP
treatment compared to control and to the NGF-treated cells.  MAP-2
served as the substrate for this kinase, while MAP-1 was hardly
phosphorylated.  Peak 3 activity was practically nonexistent
in controls or in Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP-treated
cells, but was very significant in NGF-treated cells, phosphorylating both
MAP-1 and -2, with MAP-2 incorporating 2.5-fold more phosphate.
Hence the NGF-stimulated kinase would appear
to be quite different from the cAMP-mediated kinase.

<p>Gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA44 of each of the three
peaks gave some idea of molecular size.
Peak 1 showed a relative mass of 40 kDa, whereas peaks 2 and 3 indicated
a slightly higher mass of 45-50 kDa.
Since the MAP-1 and -2 kinase activities were coincident in peak 3, it
is likely that a single kinase is responsible for phosphorylating both
substrates.
<p>
Plot of activity vs. incubation time showed that
phosphorylation of MAP-1 and -2 were linear at 30&deg;
for about 10 min for both substrates, and plot of activity
vs. substrate concentration was also linear (?).
Additionally a plot of kinase activity vs. [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]
demonstrated absolute metal dependence for both substrates
(maximal at 10 mM), while double reciprocal plots (1/V vs.
1/[ATP]) indicate that K<sub>m</sub> for ATP is 35 &mu;M
for either substrate.
<p>
The DEAE eluate fractions were re-analyzed for MAP kinase
activities but this time using Mn<sup>2+</sup>
to test for metal dependence.  Control
and NGF-treated cell extracts were examined, and it could be observed that some
kinase activity eluting much earlier than peaks 1-3 and active to both
substrates was present in both control and NGF-treated material, although it
was slightly more activated in the NGF cells.
This Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent
activity was quite labile and could not be stored at &minus;80&deg;.
In NGF-treated cells, a Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activity was
observed where
peak 3 elutes.
<p>
DEAE eluate fractions from cells treated similarly with
EGF and bFGF indicate a MAP-1 and -2 profile for phosphorylation similar to the
NGF profile.  Peak 3 had the highest
relative activity in these preparations to both substrates.
<p>
Cells treated with NGF or bFGF demonstrate the formation
of long neurites, while EGF-treated cells show only a few processes.
K252a is a known protein kinase inhibitor,
and co-incubation of K252a with each hormone altered only the NGF-stimulated
process formation, completely inhibiting it.
bFGF-promoted neurite outgrowth was not affected, and EGF-promoted
growth appeared to be actually stimulated.
Treatment of PC12D cells alone results in formation of short processes,
but in high concentrations is very toxic to cells.
Cell homogenates obtained from hormone-stimulated co-incubated
with K252a were analyzed for MAP kinase activity:
NGF-induced activation of MAP kinase was blocked by K252a.
In contrast bFGF- and EGF-mediated
activation was not blocked but instead stimulated, which correlates well with
the morphological changes observed.

p42 MAP kinase phosphorylation sites in microtubule-associated

kinase treatment was done with several antibodies:  the anti-PHF
tau-specific antiserum T3P and the antibody AT8 were shown
to react with phosphorylated tau.  This suggests phosphorylation of
serine-396 and serines-199 and/or -202.
The immunoblot shows that immunoreactivity only occurs with prolonged
MAP kinase incubation. Phosphoamino acid analysis of tau labeled up
to 7 mol P/mol protein shows similar amounts of P-Ser and P-Thr,
with no P-Tyr.
<p>
Using [<sup>32</sup>P]phosphorylase as a substrate, protein
phosphatase 1, 2A, 2B and 2C activities were assessed.  PP2B and
PP2C require Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>,
resp., to be active, while PP1 and PP2A are active without these divalent
ions.  PP2A is inhibited by okadaic acid in nM concentrations,
with PP1 is inhibited by inhibitor-2.  In brain extracts highly diluted,
phosphorylase dephosphorylation was assessed in the presence of various
inhibitors to measure the contribution of each phosphatase to the process.
Inclusion of okadaic acid or inhibitor-2 inhibited dephosphorylation
by 56% and 41%, resp. Hence PP1 contributed 43% and PP2A contributed
57% of the brain extract phosphatase activity.  With <sup>32</sup>P-labeled
tau, okadaic acid inhibited activity by 98%, inhibitor-2 only 4%.
Hence in the absence of divalent ions, PP2A accounts for all tau
phosphatase activity.
<p>
When 10 nM okadaic acid was added (to inhibit PP2A; PP2B
can be inhibited by okadaic acid at &gt;500 nM) with 0.1 mM
Ca<sup>2+</sup> or 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> present, neither
PP2B or PP2C could be observed as significant phosphatases for tau.
<p>
PP2A exists as a heterodimer composed of a catalytic
subunit (PP2A<sub>c</sub>) and a 60 kDa A subunit (the holoenzyme
is called PP2A<sub>2</sub>).  This can complex with an additional 55 kDa B
subunit (holoenzyme = PP2A<sub>1</sub>),
with the B subunit itself having different isoforms.
The alpha form of B subunit is highest in brain mRNAs examined,
although a specific beta mRNA is also present.
Tau phosphatase:phosphorylase phosphatase activity ratios were
calculated for each holoenzyme:  PP2A<sub>1</sub> was 7- to 8-fold
higher than PP2A<sub>2</sub> and 40-fold higher than PP2A<sub>c</sub>
catalytic subunit.

Nicotinic agonists, phorbol esters, and growth factors activate two
extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, in bovine
chromaffin cells
<p class="1stP">
Chromaffin cells were cultured, extracted, and fractionated on
8% SDS-PAGE in which MBP at 0.1 mg/ml was added prior to polymerization.
After running the gel, SDS is removed with
20% isopropanol, and the proteins denatured in 6 M guanidine and then
re-natured after removing the salt.
Protein kinase assay is done by incubating gels for 60 min at 30&deg; in 50
mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 &mu;M ATP (1.2 Ci/mmol).
Gels are washed in 5% TCA with 10 mM NaPP<sub>i</sub> until radioactivity
is negligible. Autoradiography is done.
When done in gels without co-polymerization
with MBP, a band at 80,000 relative molecular mass and several minor bands are
observed, indicating which proteins are capable of autophosphorylation or
phosphorylating adjacent proteins.  When
observed in MBP-co-polymerized gels, the intensity of the major band at 80,000
did not change, but those at 116K, 60K, 53K, 46K, and 42K did change.
In other gels co-polymerized with protamine,
mixed histones, Lys-rich histones, or casein, the spectrum was completely
different.  Although these are all MBP
kinases, the presence of MBP in chromaffin cells, or the presence of these
kinase in cells where MBP is found, is unknown.
<p>
The dependence of these kinases for Mg<sup> 2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>
was analyzed:  PK116 required Mg<sup>2+</sup>, while PK60 and PK53 were
Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent.  PK46 and PK42 were active with either cation,
but were more active with Mn<sup>2+</sup>.
Prior to cell extraction, chromaffin cells
were treated with IGF-I (10 nM), PDBu (1 &mu;M), diacylglycerols
OAG or DOG (100 &mu;M), nicotinic agonists (carbachol at 100 &mu;M;
DMPP at 30 &mu;M), muscarine (100 &mu;M), bradykinin (10 &mu;M),
and 55 mM K<sup>+</sup>.  All of the reagents caused a 2-fold increase
in MBP phosphorylating ability of PK42 and PK46.
