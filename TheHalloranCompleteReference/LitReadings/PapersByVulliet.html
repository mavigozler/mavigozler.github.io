Tyrosine hydroxylase: a substrate of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
TH from rat pheochromocytoma was purified from extracts which
had been centrifuged at 100,000 <i>g</i>.  Supernatants were subjected
to 30-42% AmSO<sub>4</sub> precipitation, DEAE-cellulose, 0-44%
AmSO<sub>4</sub>, hydroxylapatite, 0-50% AmSO<sub>4</sub>,
and then 5-20% sucrose gradients.
<p>
TH was assayed at subsaturating cofactor concentrations under
conditions optimal for protein phosphorylation.  Activated enzyme
showed a decreased <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for the cofactor
6-methyltetrahydropteridine (from 480 &mu;M to 120 &mu;M) with
no change in the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine (74 &mu;M) or
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>.  Crude TH could be activated in the same
manner under the same phosphorylating conditions.  Crude and
purified TH exhibited linearity on double reciprocal plots with
tyrosine as the varied substrate in the absence of ATP, cAMP,
and protein kinase.  When cofactor was varied, there was a deviation
from linearity however.  This nonlinearity with respect to cofactor
was changed when TH was phosphorylated however.
<p>
Purified preparations of PK-A catalytic subunit was incubated
with purified TH and the activation was absolutely dependent upon
Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ATP, and catalytic subunit concentrations.
Activation was proportional to the amount of subunit present
up to 3 &mu;g under the conditions of this assay.
<p>
Activation of TH was correlated to <sup>32</sup>P incorporation
into TCA-precipitable protein when preincubation of TH was done
in varying amounts of C subunit, labeled ATP, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.
After 15 min incubation at 30�, phosphate incorporation continues
but TH activity falls to basal levels, in contrast to a linear
increase before the 15 min time period.  Without C subunit,
no P incorporation is observed.  Use of alpha-labeled P in ATP instead of
gamma-labeled P produces the same result.  Stoichiometric measurement
indicates 0.7 mol P/mol 60,000 M<sub>r</sub> subunit of TH.
10 min or less incubation times show specific phosphorylation to
TH.  If allowed to proceed to 20 min at 30�, phosphorylation of
a 40 kDa band becomes evident, which may be the phosphorylation
of the C subunit observed after it suffers thermal denaturation.
The reason for loss of TH activity after 15 min of phosphorylation
is unclear, since the control TH demonstrated no such deactivation:
phosphorylation may create an instability in the enzyme.
<p>
TH was compared to histone H1 as a substrate for PK-A.  The rate
of TH phosphorylation was found to be 2 to 2.5 times that of
the rate of histone H1 phosphorylation.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase by calmodulin-dependent
multiprotein kinase
<p class="Para1">
Several ubiquitous and well known protein kinases were tested
for their ability to phosphorylate TH.  Since all of these kinases
also phosphorylate glycogen synthase, this substrate was used as a
reference.  The results show that casein kinases I and II, glycogen
synthase kinases 3 and 4, and phosphorylase kinase did not
phosphorylate TH at a significant rate (1% or much less than
1% of the rate at which GS was phosphorylated).  In contrast
cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated TH at 32% and
calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase at 18% of the rate
GS was phosphorylated (calcium and calmodulin were required for CaM
MPK).  TH which had been incubated in the presence of 4 milliunits/ml
PK-A or 4 milliunits/ml CaM kinase or both.  PK-A phosphorylated to 0.5 mol
P/mol TH subunit and caused a 2-fold activation.
Phosphorylation by CaM kinase reached 0.3 mol P/mol subunit and
no activation was observed.  Phosphorylation by combined kinases
indicated an additive incorporation, with activation similar to
that produced by PK-A alone.
<p>
Increasing the kinase concentration did have a changed
effect in the incorporation stoichiometry, with 16 mU/ml
(4-fold higher) PK-A producing a 0.9 mol P/mol subunit
modification accompanied by 3-fold activation.  16 mU/ml
CaM kinase phosphorylation reached 1.0 mol P/mol subunit,
still with no activation.
<p>
TH phosphorylated by PK-A was digested with trypsin and
analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC.  Peptide A eluted at 12.5% acetonitrile.
The CaM MPK-treated TH produced a major radiolabeled phosphopeptide (C)
eluting at 2-4% acetonitrile.  Two minor peptides eluting at 5.5% and
12.5% acetonitrile were also present, where the latter peak was peptide A.
IEF gels showed that both peaks migrated to the same pI, effectively
proving their identity.  CNBr digestion of TH phosphorylated by
either kinase produced a single phosphopeptide of apparent MW
of 37 kDa on SDS gels.
<p>
Rat pheochromocytoma cells were extracted and purified
over phosphocellulose and calmodulin-Sepharose using a
procedure used to purify skeletal muscle CaM MPK.
Characterization of the eluate from the CaM-Sepharose
column indicated that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin-dependent
kinase activity possessed an identical substrate specificity with
the skeletal muscle enzyme:  CaM kinases from both tissues
phosphorylate synapsin I, glycogen synthase, TH, and other
proteins at the same relative rates.  The pheochromocytoma CaM kinase
preferentially phosphorylated site C in TH and site 2 of glycogen
synthase as expected.  From 30 g of tumor tissue, 5.5 mU of kinase
was isolated (0.18 mU/g tissue).  1600 mU obtained from 4800
&times; <i>g</i> rabbit skeletal muscle (0.33 mU/g) shows a
comparability between the tumor and the muscle tissue.

Characterization of the sites phosphorylated on tyrosine hydroxylase by 
Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, calmodulin-dependent 
multiprotein kinase and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
It was previously reported that TH purified from rat pheochromocytoma could be 
phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calmodulin-dependent 
multiprotein kinase.  We now report that pheochromocytoma TH is phosphorylated 
by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PK-C) 
purified from rat brain or sheep brain sources.  In the presence of 
Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphatidylserine, phosphorylation was increased 14-fold 
over controls, with a 0.7 mol P/mol stoichiometry in the subunit.  Using two 
different TH preparations, initial phosphorylation rates at 0.5 mg/ml TH were 
95-100% of those for 0.2 mg/ml histone H1, one of the best PK-C substrates.
<p>
TH incubated with each of the three kinases in the presence of labeled ATP and 
the phosphoprotein was digested with trypsin and analyzed on reversed-phase 
HPLC.  Chromatograms of PK-A- and PK-C-treated TH produced a common 
phosphopeptide (A) which came off at 50 min (~21-22% acetonitrile) into the 
program. The CaM kinase chromatogram produced both peptide A and a peptide C (32 
min; 14% acetonitrile), but peptide C is the apparent primary site of 
phosphorylation for this kinase, since it truly predominates relative to A at 
lower kinase concentrations. When TH was phosphorylated by the three kinases 
individually or in combination, digested with trypsin, and peptide A isolated on 
HPLC, subsequent thin-layer polyacrylamide IEF always produced a single peptide 
of pI~4.  Various phosphorylated forms of a single protein species should be 
resolved in this two-dimensional separation, so it is apparent the kinases 
phosphorylate the same amino acid in the peptide.  Edman degradation into the 
third cycle of peptide A produced a <q>burst</q> of radioactivity no matter 
which of the three kinases were used.
<p>
IEF of HPLC peptide C indicated that it was more acidic than A (pI~3).  Edman 
degradation of this peptide also produced a burst of radioactivity on the third 
cycle.  Partial acid hydrolysis followed by thin-layer electrophoresis at pH 1.9 
reveal that the only phosphoamino acids present are serine.

Identification of four phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal
region of tyrosine hydroxylase
<p class="Para1">
TH preparations from rat pheochromocytoma were reported by
Vulliet et al. (1985) to be contaminated with traces amounts
of a protein kinase phosphorylating TH.  If &gamma;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP
is added, followed by trypsinolysis and HPLC analysis, peak E is
identified as the only eluting peptide.  PK-A catalytic subunit
incubation produces the E peak as well, plus additional peaks A1
and A2 where A1 was the major peak.  Incubation with CaM MPK
results in the appearance of E, A1, and A2 as minor peaks compared to
two additional peaks, C1 (major) and C2 (equal to A1 in amplitude).
<p>
Highly purified TH was phosphorylated in vitro by the kinases and the HPLC 
phosphopeptides submitted to amino acid analysis and Edman sequencing.  From the 
data it is apparent that A1 and A2 contain the Ser<sup>40</sup> site (there is 
only one Ser in the peptide) phosphorylated by PK-A and less so by CaM MPK. 
Peptide C1 and C2 reflect alternate cleavage sites which result in a 
Ser<sup>19</sup>-containing peptide.  Peptide E corresponds to Pro<sup>2</sup> 
to Lys<sup>12</sup>, which means that Met is removed from the protein, as has 
been shown by Flinta et al. (1986) for 19 eukaryotic proteins in which Pro 
follows Met.  Counting of the amino acids during sequencing cycles was done for 
all cycles, and this revealed that Ser<sup>8</sup> was the phosphorylated site.

A simplified <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>-trapping microassay for tyrosine
hydroxylase activity
<p class="Para1">
TH activity is measured in a variety of ways.  The most common
isotopic methods involve release of <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O
from the 3,5-tritium labeled tyrosine (used first in 1964).
Waymire et al.  (1971) discussed release of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>
from the 1-labeled compound.  The <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O release
method is subject to high backgrounds and is time-consuming.
The <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>-trapping method requires special,
cumbersome equipment:  generally a large stoppered vessel with an
inserted plastic well holding a paper strip wetted with alkaline
solution to trap the gas.  The published results are of this assay used
to characterize TH from freshly extracted rat striata with respect to protein
(enzyme) added, presence of aromatic acid decarboxylase, reaction time, and
variations in the substrates (for kinetic analysis), and of pH and iron salts
(FeSO<sub>4</sub>).

Altered reactivity of the rat adrenal medulla following periods
of chronic stress
<p class="Para1">
INTRO.  Chromaffin cells derived embryonically from neural
crest cells which have biochemically functional similarities
with adrenergic neurons.  Primary physiological role of
chromaffin cells are to release epinephrine and norepinephrine
in response to cholinergic stimulation by splanchnic nerve neurons.
Insulin-induced hypoglycemia (Weiner &amp; Mosimann, 1970),
immobilization (Kvetnansky et al, 1970), cold exposure (Chuang &amp; Costa,
1974), and drug-induced hypotension (Theonen et al, 1969) all induce
physiological perturbations in the adrenal medulla.
Long term stress is known to cause increases in the weight of the
adrenal medulla, increased TH activity, and increases in stores of
catecholamines.  Insulin treatment and treatments producing
physiological pain can cause increases in TH protein phosphorylation.
<p>
It has been shown that forced immobilization of animals
causes increases in epinephrine and norepinephrine in the plasma,
and that previously stressed animals show a greater rise in levels
than animals which had not been stressed.  Hence adrenal responsiveness
is conditioned.  But where does the conditioning occur:
at the level of the CNS, the splanchnic nerves, or in the
chromaffin cells themselves?
<p>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were house two per
cage on a 12 hr light-dark cycle, food and water available ad libitum.
Each cage has a control and treated rat.  Controls get 0.9% saline
equal in volume to treated rats.  Surgical manipulations were on
anesthetized animals using Na pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, I.P.).
Left-side glands are removed and perfused using ligated catheter
in veinous port; perfusion medium is Krebs-bicarb with syringe
pump at 360 &mu;l/min rate.  The cortex is slit to permit effusion
of perfusate and the gland is rested on a chamber of plexiglas
maintained 38�.  Perfusion is for 30 min prior to treatment.
50 &mu;g acetylcholine in 100 &mu;l of buffer is used to initiate
agonist-mediated action, and perfusates are collected for 5 min
afterward and measure for catecholamines.  Epinephrine content
of adrenals is assayed by gland homogenization in
0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> with 40 ng/ml 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine
internal standard;  homogenate is diluted 1:1000 then filtered
through 0.45 &mu; NC filter.  Epinephrine in perfusate is
analyzed first by mixing 1:1 perfusate:0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> then using
alumina to concentrate catecholamines.  Analysis is on a
C<sub>18</sub> reversed-phase column equilibrated in 0.1 M citric acid,
3% acetonitrile, 0.5 mM EDTA, 25 mg/l Na octyl sulfate, pH
3.0 with an electrochemical detector (BAS LC 4B). Two-tailed
Student t test is calculated using linear correlation coefficient
as test statistic:

<p>
RESULTS.  Rats were subjected to immobilization to induce chronic
stress, and the left-side adrenal gland was removed from anesthetized
animals and set up for perfusion with acetylcholine treatment.
Firstly, an overall 60% increase (statistically significant to
<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005) in the storage of epinephrine of stressed
animals was ascertained relative to controls.  Release into
perfusate was also with that range, 50-60% greater in previously
stressed animals compared to controls.  Rats which had not been
stressed by immobilization but which had been given dexamethasone
were also measured for epinephrine storage and release:
results indicate a contrast with more than 20% decrease in
tissue epinephrine and 30% decrease in release.
<p>
Chronic hypoglycemia artificially induced by insulin also
similarly affect the medulla.  The 4-day protocol used by
Fluharty et al (1985) was employed here with protamine-zinc
insulin.  Both tissue epinephrine levels and TH activity were
measured subsequent to the last injection over an 8-day
time course.  One day after injection, epinephrine content is
only 50% of control animals, but on the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and
8th days, the respective content increases were 90%, 140%, 190%, 160%
and 150% of controls.  Notice the leveling off at day 5.  TH activity
was always elevated above controls, but the rise in TH activity and
its subsequent leveling off matched the pattern seen for changes in
epinephrine content.  TH activity on day 1 was 2.75-fold greater
than controls rising to 4-fold greater on day 5.
<p>
Plasma glucose and epinephrine release in medulla was similarly
measured in protamine-zinc insulin-treated rats (release assessed
using perfusion system in glands harverted 1, 3 and 5 days
post-injection).  Plasma glucose is very much lowered on day
1, &lt; 20% of controls, but returns to normal by days 3 (80�17%) and 5
(112�10%).  Tissue epinephrine content is similarly lowered on day 1
(38�5%) but climbs during day 3 (~75�10%) and
significantly exceeds control animals on day 5 (~120%).
Epinephrine release studies show a reduced responsiveness on day 1
(45%) which increases on day 3 (still significantly below
controls) and is not signficantly different from controls on day 5.
<p>
Decreases in tissue epinephrine and epinephrine release
appeared to be correlated for days 1 and 3.  To assess
statistical correlation, plots of Epi release (secretion) vs.
Epi content were made in which control, and the PZI-treated
glands for all animals were plotted.  A line was fit and the
regression result was 0.61 (correlation coefficient), which was found
statistically significant to <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0005.
<p>
DISCUSSION.  Data show that at level of chromaffin cells,
adaptation to long-term stress (by immobilization, insulin-induced
hypoglycemia) occurs at least here.  This study cannot rule out changes in
response sensitivity in other tissues.  Glucocorticoids are not the
mechanism by which adrenal tissue changes are effected.  Indeed, as
glucocorticoids depress ACTH levels and this hormone is known to
influence changes in the adrenal medulla inasmuch as it effects the cortex,
glucocorticoid <q>stress</q> was in contrast to stresses imposed here.
<p>
(Norepinephrine is also another major catecholamine; are
the changes affecting epinephrine similarly translated to changes in
NorEpi?  Is it possible that NorEpi component may increase a great
deal and its effect compensate?)

Altered reactivity of the rat adrenal medulla
<p class="Para1">
Chronic hypoglycemia was induced in rats by subcutaneous
injection of long acting insulin, protamine zinc insulin (PZI),
at 10 U/day/rat for 4 d.  Epinephrine levels (determined
from homogenized glands) were found to drop and remain reduced
after day 1 of recovery, showing substantial recovery by day 3
and days 4-8 showing values greater than controls.  Perfused glands
which were challenged with acetylcholine show a decreased rate
of epinephrine release on days 1 and 3 after the last insulin
injection, with recovery occurring by day 5.  It appeared that
the long acting insulin was selective for its effects on epinephrine,
since release and content of norepinephrine was not significantly
diminished.
<p>
Chromaffin cell morphology was examined ultrastructurally.
In addition to the usual organelles present (mitochondria,
ribosomes, ER, Golgi complexes, lysosomes), there were also
dense core vesicles (chromaffin granules).  With chronic
insulin-induced hypoglycemia, degranulation and vacuolization
were found in a large proportion of chromaffin cells.  An
enlargement of the cisternae of the ER was evident, with
depletion of the core vesicles, relative increase in polyribosomes,
an increase in the number of multivesicular bodies, and
apparent enlargement of the mitochondria were all present.
This was observed during the treatment period and on day 1
of recovery, when plasma glucose is quite low. Other cells
which were characteristically norepinephrine-containing type
cells showed no marked changes. By day 3 of recovery the
dense core vesicles had increased in relative number.  By
day 5 the number of vesicles appeared to be near control numbers,
and the mitochondria were less swollen, although vacuolization
and swelling of the ER was evident but lessened.
<p>
Precision-cut 300 &mu;m adrenal medulla slices were perfused
in a nonrecirculating system to measure catecholamine release.
After a 30 min preincubation period, acetylcholine is injected
into the perfusion stream. With no Ca<sup>2+</sup> and
5 mM EGTA present, no catecholamine release is measured
(showing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence).  In another experiment,
successively increased concentrations (1, 10, 100, 1000 &mu;M)
of ACh are administered and CA release determined: with
successively increased concentrations to the same slice,
the CA release is always reduced from the previous value after 10 &mu;M.
On the other hand when administered as single doses to unique slices,
the amount of CA released is always increased, almost in proportion
to the dose (logarithmically).  Tissues from these slices were examined
ultrastructurally:  the perfused gland showed cellular morphology
indistinct from normal adrenal medulla, where the perfused and
stimulated medulla slices showed an increase in the number of
vesicles associated the membrane.

Identification of a novel proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase
in rat pheochromocytoma
<p class="Para1">
Purification of this endogenous kinase tightly associated with
TH was achieved through use of synthetic peptides which included
serine 8.  Protein kinase activity cannot be detected in crude homogenates,
supernatants, ammonium sulfate precipitates, and only marginally detected
in unconcentrated DEAE-cellulose eluates.  Both the kinase and TH elute
with the same KCl concentration on heparin-agarose.  Phosphocellulose
chromatography results in a significant separation of kinase and TH,
but TH still remains in the preparation.
<p>
Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation (5-20% for 12 h at 234,000
&times; <i>g</i>) on pooled fractions from heparin-agarose resulted in
elution of a broad peak of PDPK activity overlapping with a tight TH
activity (sedimenting at 9.2 S).  Inclusion of 0.2 M KCl to the buffered
sucrose gradient results in a nonoverlapping separation with PDPK
sedimenting symmetrically at 3.6 S, an estimated molecular mass of
45-55 kDa. Superose 12 chromatography showed this kinase to elute
very close to that of ovalbumin (44 kDa), making the estimate
reliable.
<p>
Partially purified kinase was incubated with highly purified TH,
and labeled phosphoproteins were separated on SDS gels.  The band
with the greatest amount of label co-migrated with the TH subunit,
with an additional high affinity band observed at 25 kDa.
Histone H1, synapsin I, and glycogen synthase were also found
to be substrates of PDPK.
<p>
TH phosphorylated by PDPK was analyzed on reversed-phase
HPLC after digestion with TPCK-treated trypsin.
A major peak at 39 min corresponding to 14.5% MeCN elution
matches the elution of a synthetic TH<sup>2-12</sup>
peptide as well as TH<sup>2-16</sup> which had been
phosphorylated by PDPK and then trypsinized prior to HPLC analysis.
The tryptic phosphopeptide containing serine 40 elutes later at
19% acetonitrile, while the serine 19 peptide elutes earlier at
10% acetonitrile.  To identify whether serine or threonine and
which were phosphorylated in the TH<sup>2-12</sup> peptide,
TH<sup>2-19</sup> was phosphorylated, trypsinized, HPLC
purified, then radiosequenced using Edman chemistry.
Serine 8 was found to be the phosphorylated residue, and this was
confirmed with substitution of Thr-3 and Ser-5 with alanine.

<p>Kinetic analysis of PDPK using the synthetic substrate TH<sup>
2-19</sup> shows a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 50 &mu;M and for ATP a
<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 40 &mu;M.  GTP could also be used, but
measured activity was 1/3 that of the ATP substrate.
Mg<sup>2+</sup> was shown, while Ca<sup>2+</sup> with and without
phospholipids, or cAMP was without effect.  There was no effect
on kinase activity by use of NaF up to 25 mM or Triton X-100 up to 2%.

<p>Substrate specificity was assessed using the following peptides/proteins
at 50 &mu;M:  TH<sup>2-16</sup>, 3,5-alanine substituted TH<sup>2-16</sup>,
histone H1, 7-glycine substituted histone H1 peptide (proline is substituted),
bradykinin and lysine-bradykinin and 7-phenylalanine bradykinin (Pro-7 is
substituted), and glycogen synthase.  From the results,
a proline-dependence on phosphorylation is clearly observed:
where proline is substituted after a threonine or serine,
phosphorylation is abolished.  The
synthetic peptide containing glycogen synthase sites 3a, b, and c was tested
against glycogen synthase kinase 3, which will not phosphorylate these sites
unless a prior phosphorylation on a downstream site has occurred.
PDPK phosphorylates this peptide, however,
and site 3b does contain a -X-Ser-Pro-X- context.
Since PDPK did not phosphorylated Kemptide (RRASLG) nor was
inhibited by heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor which reduced PK-A catalytic
subunit activity, it is distinct from known kinases.

<p>In prior reports, in situ phosphorylation of a TH tryptic
fragment obtained from NGF-stimulated labeled PC12 cells had been
observed.  PC12 cells cultured at
500,000/cm<sup>2</sup> were treated with
and w/o NGF and lysed in TX-100-containing buffers.
Assays of concentrated DEAE pools revealed that maximal
activation of a TH<sup>2-16</sup> kinase
occurred in 1 min, falling off at the next time point (5 min) and halfway to
initial specific activity after 10 min.
Dose dependence showed half-maximal activation at 1-3 ng/ml NGF and
maximal activation (75% over initial) at 10-30 ng/ml.

Phosphorylation of synapsin I at a novel site by proline-directed protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
Synapsin I has been shown to be phosphorylated by PK-A, CaM MPK I
and CaM MPK II.  Bovine brain synapsin I was phosphorylated by PDPK
and the amount of phosphate incorporated was directly proportional
to enzyme added, reaching a plateau of 0.65 mol P/mol synapsin I.
Phosphate incorporation reached a maximum with regard to time as well.
SDS gels were run and two proteins at 86 and 80 kDa, corresponding to
synapsin Ia and Ib, resp., were shown to be labeled (synapsin Ia is
706 amino acids long while synapsin Ib has been truncated by 36 amino
acids at the C-terminus to 670 amino acids).  Phosphoamino acid
analysis showed only phosphoserine was present.  Tryptic peptides
were separated on HPLC, with a single peak eluting at 17% acetonitrile
(50 min into the program).  Isoelectric focusing of these HPLC separated
peptides revealed only one spot, which was gas-phase sequenced to produce a
QSRPVAGGPGAPPATRPPA<b><u>S</u></b>PSPQR for the first 25 cycles (no more
could be obtained).  This maps to positions 532-556 in synapsin I,
located in the collagenase-sensitive tail region, and therefore serine-551
is phosphorylated.  A pair of established CaM MPK II sites are
located just downstream at serines-568 and -605, while an established
PK-A and CaM MPK I site is found at the beginning of the polypeptide,
at serine-9. As each cycle product was collected for counting
radioactivity, it was determined that the 20th cycle, corresponding to
the highlighted serine, was labeled.  It cannot be ruled out, however,
that the Serine in the 22nd position might also be a site, although
IEF data showed only 1 spot and maximal incorporation did not
exceed 1 mol P/mol protein.
<p>
Physiologically dephosphorylated synapsin I is known to bind tightly
to synpaptic vesicles.  Phosphorylation of site 1 (Ser-9) by either
PK-A or CaM MPK I does not change binding affinity, but site 2 and 3
phosphorylation by CaM MPK II reduces binding affinity to the vesicle.
Previous studies using NGF-treated PC12 cells show that synapsin I is
phosphorylated at a unique site in <q>peptide N</q>, which was not
sequenced.  However, peptide N may well contain the serine-551 site.

Site-specific phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase after KCl
depolarization and nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 cells
<p>
<u>TH activation.</u>  TH activity from 13000 x g supernatant
extracts of PC12 which had been treated with 56 mM KCl or
50 ng/ml NGF was measured, with KCl depolarization showing
2.09- and 3.58-fold increase in activity when assayed at
1 and 0.1 mM MPH<sub>4</sub>, resp. (Control values= 2.28 and 0.48
nmol DOPA/min/mg protein.  NGF enhanced spec. activity 1.49-

<p>
<u>TH phosphorylation and phosphopeptide analysis.</u>
PC12 cells are pre-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub>
and then treated with KCl or NGF.  Cells are then extracted
with Triton X-100, run on SDS-PAGE, and subsequent autoradiography
reveals increased incorporation into a 60 kd band in the
treated vs. the controls (roughly 150% for both treatments).
Bands excised were exhaustively trypsinized and analyzed on HPLC,
with 5 peaks (C1 @ 20', C2 @ 23', H25 @ 25', E @ 29', A1 @ 37')
and H25 being the most phosphorylated relative to the others, especially
in the NGF-treated TH.
<p>
Identification of the phosphopeptides was done using known
kinases in vitro.  PK-A phosphorylation produced phosphopeptides
A1 and A2 (A2 @ 40'), which are alternate tryptic cleavage sites;
CaM MPK phosphorylation yields A1, A2, and C1, C2, indicating A1/A2
contains the Ser-19 peptide, with E peptide also being found.
Partially purified PDPK phosphorylation shows greatest incorporation
into peptide E (Ser-8).  Similar maps had been generated with pTH
precipitated with MAb to rat pheochromocytoma TH.
<p>
<u>Identification of H25 peptide.</u>  Phosphoamino acid analysis
shows Ser is amino acid which is phosphorylated.  Edman sequencing
shows radioactivity at the 7th cycle.  Gas phase sequencing did not allow
conclusive results since more than one peptide was found.  Synthesis
of peptides corresponding to tryptic fragments (TH<sub>2-12</sub>
TH<sub>25-33,</sub> and TH<sub>152-160</sub>), followed by
phophorylation by PDPK then HPLC would allow identification.
TH<sub>2-12</sub> was eliminated from consideration since it was
known to correspond to peptide E.  TH<sub>23-38</sub> peptide was
phosphorylated by PDPK, trypsinized, then run on HPLC and did
co-migrate with peak H25.  The peak was verified by amino acid
analysis. TH<sub>152-163</sub>was not phosphorylated although
its sequence has two potential phosphorylation sites at serine-153
and serine-158.
<p>
In summary, both KCl depolarization and NGF action increase
serine-31 phosphorylation 3-fold.  Serine-19 and serine-40
are also increased by KCl treatment. NGF also influences serine-40
phosphorylation--perhaps indirectly--but changes nothing in serine-19.

Proline-directed protein kinase activity in HER2-transfected NIH 3T3 cells
<p class="Para1">
INTRO.  Cell growth and proliferation is typically density-dependent.
</span>Cells transformed by oncogenic viruses, carcinogens, irradiation,
or other genetic manipulation lose ability to cease growth due to contact
inhibition.
<p>
Human EGF receptor-2 (HER2) gene encodes a 1255 amino acid glycoprotein
that is extensively homologous to, but distinct from, human EGF receptor
(Mol. Cell. Biol. 9(3):1165).  The HER2 and EGF receptors belong to
subclass I growth factor receptors:  cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains,
single hydrophobic transmembrane spanning region, and Cys-rich
extracellular ligand binding domain.
<p>
HER2 may also be related to rat neu oncogene.  It is expressed at
30% above normal in breast tumors, with its expression correlating
with poor prognosis.  Transfection of the full length HER2 cDNA
into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts does not cause transformation but makes cells
tumorigenic in nude mice.  Over-expressing HER2 cells exhibit loss of
contact inhibition phenomenon, form colonies in soft agar, and grow
under suboptimal conditions.
<p>
PDPK may be associated with cell proliferation phenomenon
(Braun, Hall, Vulliet (1989) Proc. West. Pharmacol. 32:15).
PDPK is stimulated in PC12 cells by NGF treatment (Vulliet, Hall,
Mitchell, Hardie (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 264(27): 16292)
and in A431 cells by EGF.
<p>
RESULTS.  Growth rate and relative content of the HER2-transfected
3T3 cells were compared to control cells.  Comparison of doubling
times shows that there is no difference between the transfected
and control cells.  Phase contrast microscopy showed an average
smaller size in the transfected cells although the measured protein
content was not significantly different.  The growth curves were similar.
HER-2 cells do not undergo contact inhibition like the uninfected 3T3
cells, but they do show a plateau of the growth when they reach
a saturation density in culture.  This saturation density is higher.
<p>
PDPK activities were found to be much greater in HER-2 than
control cells.  In log phase growth, PDPK was &gt;2-fold in
HER-2 than control.  With confluence, PDPK dropped to barely
detectable levels in both.  A plot of PDPK activity vs. cell
density (based upon recoverable soluble cell protein which was
proportional to cell number) shows the strong relationship
between expression and this property.

Phosphorylation of RII subunit and attenuation of cAMP-dependent
protein kinase activity by proline-directed protein kinase
<p class="Para1">
Highly purified RII subunit was incubated with labeled ATP.
The RII subunit migrates as a doublet on SDS polyacrylamide gels,
with the upper band presumably the phosphorylated form of
RII.  In fact RII is known to be phosphorylated by its own
catalytic subunit.  The appearance of a labeled band coincident
with the upper band only shows the presence of a contaminating
kinase (the catalytic subunit) in the purified preparation.
<p>
PDPK was added to RII with labeled ATP and phosphorylated
the RII to a stoichiometry of 0.5 to 0.65 mol P/mol RII.
In this case phosphate is incorporated into the upper and
lower bands, indicating a distinct site from its own PK-A
catalytic subunit (known to be serine 95).  Extent of incorporated
phosphate is proportional to both time of incubation and amount of
PDPK present (maximum stoichiometry here is 0.7 mol P/mol protein).
Tryptic digestion followed by HPLC purification of the digest
indicates a peak of major phosphopeptide eluting at 26% acetonitrile
(57 min under these conditions).  Another peak at 12%
acetonitrile (29 min) is consistently observed as well.
Other peaks were observed as well, but their quantity always
varied with the extent of the digestion.  PAA analysis of the
major phosphopeptide indicates threonine.
<p>
Comparison to the deduced amino acid sequence for RII to
potential PDPK phosphorylation sites indicated two sites
with a sequence of -XTPX- minimally necessary for PDPK
phosphorylation, one at Thr-4 and Thr-211.  Thr-211 is
in the cAMP binding domain.
<p>
The peptide off the HPLC column was approx. 100 pmol in
quantity and sufficiently for for Edman analysis on a gas phase
sequenator.  Each of the 12 cycles
produced a single amino acid with a sequence of TVKVDEHVIDQG.
No amino acid was found with cycle 13 (predictably an Asp),
but an Asp residue was found with cycle 14 (also predicted to be Asp).
This matches a sequence beginning at residue 155.  It is not
known how far the peptide had been degraded, although there may clearly
be much more since this region of RII is known to be trypsin-resistant.
This suggests as well that the major labeled phosphopeptide does
not contain the Thr at position 4, but rather that the Thr
is likely to be an element of the cAMP-binding domain.
<p>
The functional effect of PDPK phosphorylation was assessed
using purified catalytic (C) subunit and RII subunit.
These components were first titrated to determine the IC<sub>50</sub>
for RII and determine a range where PDPK might be most sensitive to
the assay.  50 &mu;M Kemptide was used as the phosphoacceptor and
is known not to be phosphorylated by PDPK.  Plots of kinase
activity vs RII added (dephospho and PDPK-phospho forms) show
that phospho-RII causes a shift of the curve to the left,
indicating that phosphorylated RII has a greater inhibitory effect
on C subunit compared to the nonphosphorylated, meaning the
reassociation of the RII<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> complex is
more likely to occur with prior phosphorylation of RII.  The fact
that RII was specifically inhibiting and that decreases in
activity were not occurring due to ATP depletion or C subunit
thermal denaturation were evident in that addition of cAMP
produced a stable PK-A activity.  The effect of decreased
PK-A activity was also dependent upon the time that RII had
been incubated with (phosphorylated by) PDPK.
<p>
The RII<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> holoenzyme was also
incubated whole with PDPK and labeled ATP.  The effect of the
assembled enzyme on phosphorylation of RII can be assessed as well as
determining the effect of PK-A activation by titration with cAMP.
The holoenzyme was incubated for 15 min in labeled ATP + PDPK
prior to addition of cAMP.  A slight effect on activation was
observed with the physiological range of cAMP present (0.1 to 1 &mu;M),
but full activity could be restored with higher cAMP concentrations
(to 10 &mu;M).  Consistent and statistically significant inhibition
could be achieved with PDPK phosphorylation of RII.

Proline-directed protein phosphorylation and cell cycle regulation
<p class="Para1">
The <q>growth-associated</q> M-phase-specific histone H1
kinase discovered nearly 20 years ago is now found to be a cell cycle
regulator.  In general the receptor-based growth factor-stimulated
tyrosine kinases are the first elements in a transduction pathway
leading to activation of cytosolic serine/threonine kinases.
Interaction between the protein kinase C/phosphoinositols pathway
and tyrosine kinases is now being shown.  The 42 kDa substrate for the
receptor tyrosine kinases is a Ser/Thr kinase with MAP-2 as a substrate.
Cloning and sequencing of this protein (also called ERK1) shows a
similarity to the yeast kinases FUS3 and KSS1 which mediate responses
to yeast mating factors.  Similar activation pathways involving
Ser/Thr kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases include PDGF receptor
activation of the cytoplasmic oncogenic kinase Raf1, which in turn
phosphorylates transcription factors inducing synthesis of c-fos
and �-actin.  The catalytic subunit of growth-associated H1K,
p34<i><sup>cdc2</sup></i>, is phosphorylated in the ATP-binding
domain by tyrosine kinases which deactivates it;  it is later
dephosphorylated and activated with M phase onset.
<p>
Certain kinases responsible for altering cells from a
quiescent, nonmitotic state (G1 in the cell cycle) into
S phase have been found.  Use of immunodepletion and
antisense oligodeoxynucleotide strategies have shown the
essential role of p34<i><sup>cdc2</sup></i> in this matter.
The cdc13/cyclin B protein is not essential to <q>Start.</q>
The discovery of the Rb tumor suppressor has been critical as well;
Rb is found to be highly phosphorylated in late G1 just as
expression of p34<i><sup>cdc2</sup></i> is on the rise.
In vitro studies show increased phosphorylation of purified Rb
by purified p34<i><sup>cdc2</sup></i>.  The role of cyclins
is not left out:  G1-specific cyclins, probably cyclin A
itself (refer to studies done with Drosophila embryos), may
combine with p34<i><sup>cdc2</sup></i> subunit in the cytoplasm
of partially differentiated to translocate to the nucleus and
signal the cell to begin cell division activity with a renewed
vigor.
