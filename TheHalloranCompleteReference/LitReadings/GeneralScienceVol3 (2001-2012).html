Principal Component Analysis for Clustering Gene Expression Data
<p class="Para1">
A large number of genes and the complexity of biological networks makes
clustering a necessity.  Eisen et al (1998) have proposed the use of
a variant of the hierarchical average-link clustering algorithm, and
Ben-Dor and Yakhini (1999) used their CAST algorithm.  Principal
component analysis (Jolliffe, 1986) is a classical technique to
reduce dimensionality by creating a new set of variables (principal
components, PC).  The components are uncorrelated but ordered so that the
<i>k</i>th PC has the <i>k</i>th largest variance among all PCs.
The <i>k</i>th PC can be interpreted as the direction that maximizes
the variation of the projections of the data points such that it is
orthogonal to the first <i>k</i> &minus; 1 PCs.  The first few PCs are
used traditionally since they represent most of the variation in the
original dataset.  The last few PCs are thought to represent residual
&lsquo;noise&rsquo; in the data.  The technique is closely related to
<i>singular value decomposition</i>, in that PCA is equivalent to applying
SVD on the covariance matrix of the data.
<p>
Consider the example of 477 genes representing a subset of sporulation
expression.  These were classified into 7 temporal patterns.  The first
two PCs contain 86% of the total variation.  A plot of PC2 vs. PC1 shows
patterns represented by different color or shape, and they overlap aorund
the origin.  If the subspace of the first 3 PCs are included then, the
patter of the 7 clusters seem more separated.  This suggests that
proper preprocessing of PCs helps to maximize cluster identification.
<p>
The adjusted Rand index is a measure of the degree of agreement between
two partitions of the same set of objects, and has been recommended
for comparing partitions having different numbers of clusters.
Given a set of <i>n</i> objects <i>S</i> = {<i>O</i><sub>1</sub>,...,
<i>O<sub>n</sub></i>}, suppose <i>U</i> = {<i>u</i><sub>1</sub>,...,
<i>u<sub>R</sub></i>} and  <i>V</i> = {<i>v</i><sub>1</sub>,...,
<i>v<sub>C</sub></i>} represent two different partitions of objects
in <i>S</i> such that &cup;<i><sup>R</sup></i><sub><i>i</i>=1</sub>
<i>u<sub>i</sub>=S</i>=&cup;<sup><i>C</i></sup><sub><i>j</i>=1</sub>
<i>v<sub>j</sub></i> and <i>u<sub>i</sub></i> &cap; <i>u<sub>i&prime;</sub></i>
= &empty; = <i>v<sub>j</sub></i> &cap; <i>v<sub>j&prime;</sub></i>
for 1 &le; <i>i</i> &ne; <i>i&prime;</i> &le; <i>R</i> and 1 &le; <i>j</i>
&ne; <i>j&prime;</i> &le; <i>C</i>.   One of the partitions is an
external criterion and one is a clustering result.  If <i>a</i> is the
number of pairs of objects placed in the same element in partition <i>U</i>
and in the same element in partition <i>V</i>, and <i>d</i> is the
number of pairs of objects in different elements in partitions <i>U</i>
and <i>V</i>, the Rand index is the fraction of agreement between the
two:  <i>a + d</i> / (<sup><i>n</i></sup> <sub style="margin-left:-0.75em;
vertical align:-0.5em;">2</sub>).  When the two partitions are identical,
the index is 1.  A problem with the Rand index is that the expected value
of the index of two random partitions does not take a constant value.
An adjusted index is then computed as (index &minus; expected index) /
(maximum index &minus; expected index).  The maximum index is 1 and the
expected index in the case of random clusters is 0.
<p>
The <i>greedy</i> approach is a simple heuristic similar to the forward
sequential search algorithm.  Let <i>m</i><sub>0</sub> be the minimum
number of PCs to be clustered, and <i>p</i> the number of experimental
conditions in the data.
<ul>
<li>A search is started for the set of <i>m<sub>0</sub></i>
PC with the maximum adjusted Rand index.  The optimum set of PCs
is designated <i>S</i><sub><i>m</i><sub>0</sub></sub>.
<li>For each <i>m</i> = (<i>m</i><sub>0</sub> + 1),..., <i>p</i>,
 <ul>
 <li>for each component <i>currPC</i> not in <i>S</i><sub><i>m</i>&minus;1</sub>,
  <ul>
  <li>the data with all the genes projected on to components
<i>S</i><sub><i>m</i>&minus;1</sub>&cup;{<i>currPC</i>} is clustered, and the
adjusted Rand index computed.
  <li>The maximum adjusted Rand index over all possible <i>currPC</i>
  is recorded.
  </ul>
 <li><i>S<sub>m</sub></i> is the union of the compoment with the max
 adjusted Rand index and <i>S</i><sub><i>m</i>&minus;1</sub>.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Two gene expression dataset with external criteria and three sets of synthetic
data are used to evaluate the process.  A <i>class</i> is a group in the
external criterion used for assessing clustering results. A <i>cluster</i> is a
cluster obtained by a clustering algorithm. Both are partitions of data, and
every gene is assigned to exactly one class and one cluster.  An ovary dataset
was produced by hybridizing to a membrane array containing a randomly selected
cDNA library. The subset has 235 clones and 24 tissue samples, 7 from normal, 4
from blood, and the balance of the 13 from ovarian cancers in different stages
of malignancy.  The tissue samples are the experimental conditions. The 235
clones were sequenced, and found to be in four different genes. The count of
clones in the genes was 58, 88, 57, and 32.  The four genes should separate in a
clustering algorithm; they form the four class external criterion for this data
set.  Different clones could have different hybridization intensities, so data
for each clone is normalized across 24  experiments to have mean 0 and variance
1.
<p>
The other dataset is of the yeast cell cycle, with 6000 genes observed to
flucuate in expression over two cell cycles seen in 17 time points. In the
previous report, 420 genes were identified to peak at different time points, and
these were categorized into five phases of the cycle. In addition to the yeast
and ovary datasets, synthetic datasets were used to test cases where partitions
were clear and which can be used as benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness
of algorithms.
<p>
Three clustering algorithms were used.  The <i>Cluster Affinity Search
Technique</i> (CAST), the hierarchical <i>average-link</i> algorithm, and the
<i>k-means</i> algorithm (with average-link initialization). The details of the
clustering algorithms can be found at a <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kayee/pca">supplementary web site</a>.
The effectiveness of PCA on clustering analysis with both Euclidean distance and
correlation coefficient, namely CAST with correlation coefficient, and both
average-link and k-means with both correlation and distance, were evaluated.  If
Euclidean distance is used as a similarity metric, the minimum number of
components in sets of PCs (<i>m</i><sub>0</sub>) considered is 2.  The minimum
is 3  when correlation is used because there are at most 2 clusters if 2
components are used, and when there are 2, the correlation coefficient is either
1 or &minus;1.
<p>
As to the results, the following overall conclusions can be drawn:
<ul>
<li>the quality of clustering as measured by the adjusted Rand index
with external criterion on data processed by PCA is not necessarily higher
than that of the original data on both the real and benchmark datasets.
<li>in most cases the first <i>m</i> PCs (where <i>m = m</i><sub>0</sub>,...,
<i>p</i>) do not provide the highest adjusted Rand index, i.e. there exists
another set of <i>m</i> components that achieves a higher adjusted Rand
index than the first <i>m</i> components.
<li>No clear trends regarding choice of the optimal number of PCs over
all the data sets and over all clustering algorithms and over different
similarity metrics can be found.  And no obvious relationship between
cluster quality and number of set of PCs used is apparent.
<li>On average, cluster quality obtained by clustering random sets of PCs
tend to be slightly lower than those obtained by clustering random sets
of orthogonal projections, especially when component number is small.
</ul>
<p>
Results will show plots of the adjusted Rand index against the number of
components.  Four plots will be shown: those of the index without use of PCA,
those of the index of the first <i>m</i> components, and the index using the
greedy and modified greedy approaches.

Integration of PCR Fragments at Any Specific Site within Cloning Vectors
without the Use of Restriction Enzymes and DNA Ligase
<p class="Para1">
<b>Short Technical Report</b>.  Insertion of expression cassettes into vectors
might not always be possible if restriction sites are missing.  Restriction
enyzme- and ligase-independent methods are useful.  The Life Technologies
Gateway, Invitrogen Echo, and Clontech Laboratories Creator DNA cloning
systems are among such technologies.  The Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed
Mutagenesis systme allows and easy way to make plasmid mutants using two
complementary mutagenic oligonucleotide primers:  primers of lengths 25 and
45 nt are provided.  When longer primers are used for mutagenesis there is
a decreased efficiency (longest was 73-mer with 31 nt insertion).  This report
uses the QuikChange to allow longer primers.
<p>
5-10 ng template DNA is mixed with HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and
amplified according to directions.  5&prime;-end of oligos used for PCR
is formed by at least 20 nt which are exactly upstream of the insertion
point in the vector, followed by first 20 nt of DNA to be amplified.
5&prime; end of 2nd oligo is at least 20 nt exactly downstream from insertion
point, followed by last 20 nt (i.e., 3&prime; end) of the complement of the
insertion DNA.  The amplicon is then gel-purified (a QIAquick PCR purification
kit also works).  For mutagenesis using Stratagene protocol, 50-100 ng
of plasmid is mixed with 200-300 ng PCR fragment (no ratio optimization was done
since mutants were possible in this system).  In a final 50 &micro;l volume,
cycling is done with 95&deg; for 30 s initial denaturation, then 18 cycles of
30 s at 95&deg;, 30 s at 55&deg;, then 2 min/kb template at 68&deg;.  The primers
are elongated with 2.5 U <i>PfuTurbo</i> DNA polymerase.  After the reaction
10 U <i>Dpn</i>I is added for 3 h to degrade wild-type methylated template DNA.
After purification, an aliquot is used to transform <i>E coli</i> XL1-Blue cells.
Some clones are tested to verify mutagenesis using restriction analysis, PCR,
and DNA sequencing.  For the latter a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit is used to
clean up plasmid from extracted cells, and this used as template for ABi Prism
377 DNA Sequencer using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit.

All the short homology regions up to 27 nucleotides were directly added at the
5' end of the nucleotide primers used for the PCR shown in Figure 1A. The 
longer homology regions were generated during the PCR with a conventional 
oligonucleotide defined by the recipient DNA and a longer oligonucleotide 
encoding the DNA sequence to be inserted, which is embedded between the 
downstream and upstream 20 nucleotides defining the site of insertion. The Tm 
values given for the homology regions were calculated with the formula
T<sub>m</sub> = 4&deg;C per C or G + 2&deg;C per A or T. For the two cases in
which the homology is longer than 27 nucleotides, we used the formula
T<sub>m</sub> = 81.5 + 0.41(% GC) - 675/N. N is the length of the homology
region. In the given examples, the size of the PCR fragments is given in bp.
In all of the examples, the insertion sites and the DNA inserts are different
and unrelated.
</table>
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  Oligos of length 20 nt or more that are homologous to
and are at the integration site of the vector are added to the 5&prime; site
of the standard primer set (forward and reverse) of the insert to be amplified.
After reaction, the fragment is added to methylated templated plasmid.  When
denaturation occurs, the homologous sequences of the amplicon will hybridize
to the plasmid, and these fragments are elongated with <i>PfuTurbo</i> polymerase.
New strands (elongated/modified) will not be methylated.  After <i>n</i> = 18
cycles, the reaction mixture is treated to digest methylated template, and the
amplicon is used to transform <i>E coli</i>.  The table above shows attempts to
create insertion mutagenesis in several experiments.   The length of regions
homologous to recipient DNA depends on size of the insert.  Fragments of greater
than 100 bp were sought because of constraints with purification kits.  Note
in experiments 1 and 3 that homologous regions as large as 68 and 371 nt were
used as primers.  In these constructions, only small insertions are needed,
so one of the primers encoded by DNA to be inserted and the two homologous regions
of 20 bp required for integration.  The largest fragment (1117 bp, experiment 7)
had only short regions of homology covering the insertion point.  There was
surprising high rate of integration in this experiment.  Correct clones were
present for each insertion mutagenesis and results independent of PCR fragment
size.  In the insertion, fragments can be integrated (experiments 1, 3, 6, and 7
in Table 1) or used to exchange segments (experiments 2, 4, and 5 in Table 1)
in the vector.  Deletion mutants can be made in the vector.
<p>
As they have 100% homology, long PCR fragments might first self-anneal before
recognizing the homologous regions in the template plasmid DNA.  Self-annealing
decreases the effective concentration of primers in the reaction, and so a lower
rate of success is expected with long fragments.  Enough fragments annealed to
template will produce correct annealing.  Use of ultra-competent <i>E coli</i>
will improve chance of success; length of overlapping segments on insertion will
produce good results as well.  The upper limit for the size of the insertion
has not been rigorously tested

Molecular Mechanisms of Translation Initiation in Mammals Studied
by <i>In Vitro</i> Reconstruction of Initiation Complexes
<p class="Para1">
Control of eukaryotic translation is largely achieved by regulation
of the initiation of protein synthesis.  The complexity of this process
is most likely to be understood only by <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution
experiments by addition of individual components.  Even among eukaryotes
there are significant differences between yeast and mammals, and so
experiments among classes of eukaryotes are also necessary.  Most
intiation factors were identified and purified more than 25 years ago.
At that time, 48S and 80S complexes were assembled in vitro and used
with rabbit reticulocyte globin mRNA.
<p>
The scanning initiation model proposed that the small ribosomal complex
(40S) was bound to all intiation factors and this permitted binding of
the 5&prime; end of the template at the cap.  This is mediated by the
eIF4F complex, which binds to the cap and directs the end to the ribosome.
The ribosome moves along the mRNA and unwinds secondary
structure in an energy- (ATP-)dependent manner using RNA helicase
(eIF4A).  When it encounters the initiation codon (AUG in most cases),
translation starts.
<p>
The scanning model however fails for picoraviral RNAs which are long
(~1000 bp), structured and with noncapped 5'-UTRs.  Proof that the
ribosome bound to an internal sequence was seen when a bicistronic message
was used containing the viral sequence and translation was initiated
from second cistron; a second cistron without the sequence did not
initiate.  This sequences is now called <i>internal ribosome entry site</i>
(IRES).
<p>
Study of the IRES showed it to be about 400 bp overall, but it probably
was composed of more than one element.

Functional Interactions in Internal Translation Initiation Directed
By Viral and Cellular IRES Elements
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Initiation of translation in eukaryotes is controlled
strictly.  One mechanism is the binding of eIF4F complex (composed of
subunits the E, G, and A units of eIF4) to the methyl-7-G(5')pppN cap
of the 5' end of mRNA.  eIF2 binds to tRNA-Met<sup>i</sup>
in a GTP-mediated process, and this eIF2-GTP-tRNA-Met<sup>i</sup> complex
is required to bind to the codon.  eIF3 is also required for interaction
with the 40S ribosomal subunit with the preinitiation complex.
<p>
In a second mechanism, trans-acting factors are involved in initiation
mediated by a cis-acting element called the <b>internal ribosome entry
site</b> (IRES).  Viral infections tend to alter phosphorylation states

Recent developments in detection methods for microfabricated analytical devices
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Spectroscopic detection methods.  Flourescence is usually
carried out with 488 nm emission line of Ar-ion laser using microscope lens
to collect the flourescecne and PMT for detection.  LIF continues to be used.
The optics to minimize background intensity and noise are being optimized:
fluorescein at 1 pM can be detected with some setups.  Use of a compact 635 nm
red laser diode produces a compact system: diodes are smaller than argon lasers
so can be miniaturized and made portable.  But semiconductor lasers only in
infrared and red regions.  A violet laser is being used for convential 
capillary electrophoresis, but has high cost and short lifetime.  A blue LED
and silicon photodiode instead of laser + PMT can be used with fluorescein.
<p>
To improve detection with LIF, photon counting is used.  Detection of individual
Rhodamine B and 6G molecules is reported, with their flow patterns in small 
channels.  Postcolumn derivitization makes advances.  Protein determination
with noncovalent dye and fast reaction kinetics is reported.  Uranium bound to
selective calixarene ligand conjugated to rhodamine for fluorescence allows
inorganic species detection.
<p>
Indirect fluorescence and UV detection require that the analyte and fluorophore
have the same ionic charge in the buffer to cause displacment and negative
peak formation.  Amino acids have been determined without derivitization, with
less sensitivity.  Other substances include phenols, TNT, and substances
detected with 750 nm semiconductor laser.  Light source stability is a must
with indirect detection.  Indirect LIF is still a problem because of stability
in available lasers.
<p>
Detection by absorbance is complicated by short pathlengths.  FIA to determine
phosphate, nitrite, and nitrate has been done with on-chip absorbance detection.
Transition metals complexed to 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) have been detected
to 1 ppm with green LED.  Absorbance detectors in a linear photodiode array 
have been used to image an entire separation channel:  the dynamics/mechanism
of IEF and other separation processes can be directly visualized.  Multireflection
cells can increase optical pathlength:  one flow cell in glass has an effective
pathlength enhancement of 5-10.  Higher sensitivity in absorbance might be
achieved using thermoopticla methods (thermal lens):  this detects refractive
index change in cell volume when it absorbs light and is heated by it, and a
probe beam reflection is changed.
<p>
Chemiluminescence has been used in micro-machined flow-through devices to detect
codeine and Cr.  Amino acids and transition metals electrophoretically separated
have also been detected this way.  No light source is used but rather
electrochemiluminescence.  Refractive index detection employs interference
pattern created by interacting laser beam with separation channel and
detection of model substances (see Swinney et al, 2000).  Optical imaging 
with Fourier transformation allows determination of solutes and particle
motion in microchannel.  Even NMR detection is in its early stages.
<p>
Electrochemical detection is quite amenable to a compact and miniaturized scale.
But all conventional CE use UV absorption and fluorescence.  This is because the
high voltage separation might conflict with use of sensitive electrodes in 
detection.  Discoveries in design make it possible however.  Amperometric 
detection uses a working electrode to measure redox reactions in analytes with
good detection restricted to electroactive species.  To eliminate interference
in applied electrical fields a decoupler might be used:  a porous material in
contact with the solution separates the ground electrode from the channel.
Another simpler scheme is to suppress the separation voltage without band
broadening by using a cell geometry with drastic enlargement of channel 
cross section in front of detector electrode.  This causes a low resistance 
in solution volume between working and electrophoretic ground and thus to
a small residual voltage at detector electrode.  Other systems:  neurotransmitter
and DNA fragment by electrophoresis using Pt electrodes.  Dopamine and 
hydroquinone on Au electrode with study of dynamic wall coating in electrophoretic
microchip.  Use of C electrodes to look at many class of biochemichally relevant
species is reported.  Carbon as an electrode has wide anodic potential but
microfabrication techniques need to be improved.  A different system has been
designed to separate the electrode detector from the separation system:  the
separation channel is extended to the edge of the device and an external detector
cell aligned in a right angle to the distal end, requiring alignment by the user
but allowing replacemnt of short lifetime electrodes without tossing the separation
device.  Prederivatized amino acids were detectable on a Au working electrode 
using fixed potential amperometric detection and also a voltammetric mode.
Conductimetry is good for small (inorganic) ions on chip. PMMA devices for
isotachophoresis with conductivity detection have been micromachined.  Another
system uses isotachophoresis with potential gradient technqiue, an indirect
conductometric method.  Potentiometry is based on miniaturized ion-selective
electrode in micromachined flow-channel to detect Ba<sup>2+</sup>.  Special 
membranes are used to achieve detection of a range of ions rather than for 
desired selectivity of single ion.  Potentiometry is not widely used in standard
CE.
<p>
A microwave-induced plasma (MIP) source has been made based on micromachined
fused silica substrate.  MIP is used for atomic emssion spectroscopy and used
in element-specific detection in GC.  Hg detected by cold vapor technique
and chloroform vapour (from emission line for Cl)  have been demonstrated.  Such
a device is not compatible with aerosols (unlike ICP-AES).  One group showed
that a capactively-coupled plasma sustained by 10 W radiofrequency power at 13 MHz
in a quartz microchannel can be done.

Rapid fabrication of microfluidic devices in poly(dimethylsiloxane) by 
photocopying
<p class="Para1">
PDMS is attractive as a material for microfluidic devices.  Soft lithography
is used in several micro- and nanofabrication methods.  Microchip electrophoresis
with LIF and amperometric detection uses PDMS.  Process starts with a master
and then the PDMS prepolymer mixture is cast over the master and cured.  
Fabrication of master is time-consuming.  Photoresist and mask aligner equipment,
and silicon etching facilities not widely available.  To reduce need for 
specialized equipment, and office printer and photographic reduction are reported.
This reports making a master on transparency using photocopying machine to 
&lt; 1.5 h.  Results are assessed using SEM and tested in FIA mode with on-chip
condutimetry without high voltage or other pumping methods.
<p>
Materials: used as obtained:  Dow Corning Sylgard 184 Silicon Elastomer,
Fluka Victoria Blue B, NaCl, EtOH.

Microfluidic channels were drawn using computer package, printing out and
transferring to transparency.  A 10:1 PDMS prepolymer:curing agent mix is case
over the master with frame to hold solution then cured 65&deg; 1 h.  The PDMS
replica is peeled from master and holes punched to make reservoirs in replica,
the whole process from design to replica taking less than 90 min.  The replica
is sealed to Pyrex glass plate by adhesion to make device.  Channels are 55 mm
L &times; 200 &micro;m W &times; 12 &micro;m D.  On glass plate two Pt electrodes
are micromachined by photolithography and rf plasma sputtering  (see cite).
Ablebond 967-1 conductive epoxy glue (Ablestick UK) glues electrical wires to
Pt electrodes and these are connected to PED-1 pulsed electrochemical detector
(Dionex) for conductometric detection.
<p>
SEM imaging of the &micro;-channel cross section on the PDMS replica shows it
is trapezoidal (similar to that on glass by isotropic etching).  This shape
results from carbon particles having a tendency to form round curves at edges.
Channel depth depends on how thickly carbon particles are deposited on a
transparency while photocopying.  Channel depth might be controlled by setting
the brightness on the photocopying machine.  To make channels deeper a higher
darkness setting might be used.  Channel intersection was checked as well, since
it is used in fluid switching  or sample injection.  Since master is based on
relief pattern by carbon particles deposited on transparency, walls of the molded
polymer are not as smooth as those with photoresist or silicon-based masters.
Finer carbon particles can be used to reduce channel roughness, although channel
roughness does not significantly impact performance in electroosmotic or 
electrophoretic systems.  Master silanization is not needed and master can be
used repeatedly.
<p>
This method is quite useful for rapid testing of a revised design and consideration
of new principles to be tested in microfluidics.  PDMS is a good polymer with
high optical qualify, transparent above 230 nm, high electrical bulk resistivity,
good chemical stability, support for EOF after plasma oxidation, and good adhesion
to clean and flat substrates.  Besides CE with LIF or amperometric systems, 
compatible MS detection is possible.  PDMS is used in making cross or double-T
shaped channels.  As a test, a small droplet of 10 mM NaCl with 5 mM Victoria
Bue B was placed at inlet for capillary action drawing of  a 1-2 mm length 
(2-4 nl).  As mobile phase, a larger volume of EtOH was placed which propelled
the aqueous sample to the Pt electrodes, forming a sharp FIA peak

Construction of High-Complexity Combinatorial Phage Display Peptide Libraries
<p class="Para1">
Ph.D. is <q>phage display</q> based in M13 phage vector to display peptides
as N-terminal fusions to pIII minor coat protein.  pIII binds to F-pilus of
bacterial cell to be infective.  Five pIII copies are present clustered at
one end of mature M13 virion.  Use of major pVIII coat protein would produce
100 copies or more of displayed peptides, maximum valency of pIII is 5
per virion.  These are better suited for high affinity reactions
(<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> 10 &micro;M or better).  If peptide &lt; 100 residues
pIII infectivity not adversely affected.  For larger proteins, it is
probably better to fuse to phagemid to gene VIII (codes pVIII protein) and
then infect with helper phage that has no fused gVIII.
<p>
Ph.D. uses M13KE vector, a derivative of M13mp19 propagated by standard M13
techniques.  No antibiotic selection or helper phage superinfection.  There is
little sequence bias apart from selection against unpaired Cys residues and
expected reduced levels of Arg (not Lys) residues.  Reduced Arg levels likely
caused by <i>secY</i>-dependent secretion of pIII, and can be overcome using
<i>prlA</i> suppressor strain in library amplification.  Ph.D. used in many
applications (epitope mapping, functional testing, peptide ligands binding
GroEL and HIV gp120.  The dodecapeptide libary (Ph.D.-12) was constructed in
M13KE and panned against taxol, and sequences compared with protein database
to identify its natural target, Bcl-2.  Thus short peptides can mimic
3D ligand-binding site.
<p>The M13KE vector (7223 bp) carries no plasmid replicon or antibiotic
resistance sequence since it is supposed to produce viable phage.  This
simplifies intermediate amplification during panning, since no resistance gene
must be expressed before plating or to use a helper phage during amplification.
It includes <i>lacZ&alpha;</i> gene to produce blue plaques when plated with a
complementing strain of bacteria (ER2738, DH5&alpha;F', XL1-Blue, etc) on X-gal
medium.
<p>
When preparing synthetic oligo libary, note that there is a VPFYSHS preceding
the leader peptidase cleavage site.  This sequence is part of pIII signal
and must remain intact or the pIII fusion may not be secreted or the phage
may not be infectious.  First residue must following this is the displayed
portion.  In randomizing the oligo limit the 3rd postion of each codon to
G or T (which is A or C in the synthetic library oligonucleotide)  This
prevnets TGA and TAA stop (not suppressible) in the randomized segment.
As to length, there are 1.28 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> possible 7-long amino
acid residues, and these can be coded for the phage.  But this is only a
fraction of all possible 12-mers (4 &times; 10<sup>15</sup>).  Consider the
possibility of adding Cys residues at either end of a short peptide to get
it to fold as a folded presentation might interact better than a linear
or random conformation; this would be especially useful if the target is
native ligand in the context of a known surface loop (antibodies with
structural epitopes).
<p>
A short spacer between randomized segment and first native pIII residue is
suggested to improve target accessiblity to displayed peptide.  Generally a
triple G (GGG) sequence.  The spacer might include a protease cleavage site
to elute bound phage by digestion rather than other means.
<p><b>Library Construction</b>.<br>
The following materials are obtained:
<ul>
<li>M13KE cloning vector (NEB)
<li>insert extension primer: 5'-CATGCCCGGGTACCTTTCTATTCTC-3'
<li><i>E coli</i> ER2738
<li>DNA polymerase I Klenow
<li><i>Acc</i>65I enzyme
<li><i>Eag</i>I enzyme
<li>T4 DNA ligase
<li>pBR322 <i>Msp</i>I digest
<li>&lambda; <i>Hin</i>dIII digest
<li>Electroporation cuvettes (2-mm gap) (BTX/Genetronics)
</ul>
<p><b>Notes</b>.<br>
<ol>
<li>Use aerosol-resistant pipet tips and plugged serological (prevents
contamination from opportunstic filamentous phage) for all transfer steps.
Library phage are at a disadvantage.  For blue colony plaques, prepare
LB medium with 0.1 mM Xgal / 0.2 mM IPTG.  Any <i>E coli</i> complementing
strain can be used (ER2738, NEB; DH5&alpha;F', Life Tech; XL1-Blue, Stratagene).
Environmental phage will usually show colorless plaques.
<li>Libary oligonucleotides at a minimum 200 nmol scale should be prepared,
purified by PAGE, then quantiated by OD<sub>260</sub> (1 AU @ 260 nm = 20
&micro;g/ml ss DNA).
<li>Anneal 5 &micro;g library oligo to 3 molar excess of the universal
extension primer (dephosphorylate the 5' end!, this is 4 &micro;g for a 90-nt
libary oligonucleotide):  In 50 &micro;l TE (10 mM Tris pH 8.0/1 mM EDTA)
with 0.1 M NaCl, heat to 95&deg; and cool 15-30 min to 37&deg; or less in
thermal cycler or water bath.
<li>To this add in this order: 119 &micro;l water, 20 &micro;l 10X
EcoPol buffer (0.1 M TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 75 mM DTT),
50 &micro;l annealing reaction, 8 &micro;l 10 mM dNTPs, 3 &micro;l (30 U)
Klenow fragment.  Incubate 37&deg; 10 min, then 65&deg; for 15 min.  Set as
4 &micro;l for later analysis.
<li>Digest the extended strands with 50 U each of <i>Eag</i>I and <i>Acc</i>65I
in 400 &micro;l final of NEBuffer 3 (50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.9, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM
MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT).  <i>Kpn</i>I is the isoschizomer as <i>Acc</i>65I
but cannot be digested in the same buffer conditions with <i>Eag</i>I.
Leave 37&deg; for 3 h.  Purify by phenol/chloroform, then chloroform, then
EtOH pptn.
<li>Gel purify in 8% native PAGE (see reference) and include MW markers as
follows:  the 4 &micro;l undigested duplex, pBR322 DNA <i>Msp</i>I digest.
Use EtBr staining to identify band.  Excise desired band and elute the minced
gel by shaking overnight in several volumes of 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.5,
1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 37&deg;.
<li>Recover the supernatant from microfuged material and do phenol/chloroform,
chloroform, EtOH pptn.  Resuspend in 50 &micro;l TE and quantitate material
in PAGE using known amounts of pBR322 <i>Msp</i> digest.  Compute the mass of the
insert from staining intensity comparisons.  1 &micro;g insert will be more
than sufficient to produce a library of complexity 10<sup>9</sup>.
<li>Digest 10-20 &micro;g M13KE vector with 10 U/&micro;g <i>Eag</i>I and
<i>Acc</i>65I in 40 &micro;l NEBuffer 3 per &micro;g DNA (total vol 400-800 &micro;l).
Use &beta;-agarase (NEB) or QIAquick (Qiagen) to gel-purify.  Use known amounts
of &lambda; DNA <i>Hin</i>dIII digest in agarose gel to quantitate the digested
vector.
<li>Since quantiation has been done by using staining intensities which are
error-prone, the vector and insert concentrations need to be optimized for the
ligation reaction.  For each 20 &micro;l ligation, use 40 and 100 ng of
cut vector, and then use 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 molar excess of the duplex digest.
2 &micro;l of the 10&times; ligase buffer and 3 Weiss U of ligase are used.
It is done overnight at 16&deg;.  Include a control of vector alone (at each
concentration) to see if the vector is actually cut.
<li><b>Electroporation</b>.  Heat the ligation to 65&deg; for 15 min.  Take
1 &micro;l of each reaction into 100 &micro;l of electrocompetent <i>E coli</i>
with complementation activity (see reference to prepare electrocompetent cells).
Efficiences of 10<sup>10</sup> transformants/&micro;g are expected.  1 ng
M13KE DNA is used in 100 &micro;l of cells.  For electroporation, use 25 &micro;F,
200 &Omega; and 2500 V.  Add 1 ml SOC medium (2% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast
extract, 8 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM glucose (see
reference to prepare) to each cuvette after electroporation, then transfer to
culture tube, incubate 30-45 min 37&deg; while shaking.
<li>Titer the culture for PFU.  Combine 200 &micro;l of midlog culture of E coli
used for electroporation with 3 ml LB medium + 0.7% agar preincubated in 45&deg;,
add 1 &micro;l of 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of electroporation outgrowth, vortex
briefly, pour on to prewarmed (37&deg;) LB agar plates with 0.2 mM IPTG and
0.1 mM Xgal.  let harden for 5 min, invert and incubate ON at 37&deg;.
<li>Count blue plaques and determine ratio plaques to &micro;g cut vector
(= input mass of vector to electroporation events).  There should be
&gt;100-fold more plaques than insertless ligation plates.  Now scale-up the
ligation based on library complexity using the plaque/&micro;g ratio.  Suppose
a library complexity of 10<sup>9</sup> requires 5 &micro;g if test ligations
produce 2 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> plaques/&micro;g vector.  Use no more than
500 &micro;l ligation reaction per tube, and use multiple tubes if necessary.
<li>Purify the large-scale ligation using phenol/chlorofom, chloroform, and EtOH
pptn.  Wash well with 70% EtOH.  Now electroporate:  use as many cuvettes as
convenient to prevent cells picking up more than one DNA sequence:  for a
10- to 20-&micro;g scale ligation, 100 electroporations using 3 &micro;l of
resuspended ligated DNA per 100 &micro;l electrocompetent cells.
<li>After electroporation 1 ml SOC medium is added to each cuvette immediately.
It might be convenient to pool the medium outgrowth in groups of five.
Each outgrowth pool is incubated 30-45 min at 37&deg; with vigorous shaking.
Do not exceed this time.  Titer the outgrowths as in the above step.
<li><b>Amplification</b>.  Add each 5 ml of pooled SOC medium outgrowth
to 1 L early-log cells in LB medium  Incubate with vigorous aeration (250 rpm)
at 37&deg; for 4.5-5 h.  Spin 5000 <i>g</i> for 20 min 4&deg;.  Transfer supntnt
to clean bottle and re-spin to remove residual cells.
<li>Precipitate the phage by adding one-sixth volume of 20% PEG-8000 in 2.5
M sodium chloride and incubate overnight at 4&deg;.  Spin 5000 <i>g</i> for
20 min @ 4&deg;.
<li>Resuspend the pellet in 100 ml TBS (50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl).
Again remove any residual cells by spinning 5000 <i>g</i> for 10 min at 4&deg;.
<li>Re-precipitate the phage:  add the PEG/NaCl in one-sixth volume as above,
leave 60 min at 4&deg;, spin 5000 <i>g</i> 20 min.  Then resuspend phage pellet
in 10-40 ml TBS using gentle rocking for 24-48 h at 4&deg;.  Store the solution
in the cold.  For long term storage, add an equal volume of sterile glycerol
and store at &minus;20&deg;.
<li>For titering the amplified library, prepare 10<sup>9</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>,
and 10<sup>11</sup> dilutions, and add 10 &micro;l from these dilutions to
200 &micro;l of midlog culture of strain used for the library, incubate RT for
1-5 min.  Transfer to 3 ml LB medium with 0.7% agar at 45&deg;, vortex, and
pour on to prewarmed LB plates wtih 0.2 mM IPTG + 0.1 mM Xgal.  let harden,
invert and incubate ON at 37&deg;.  All plaques should be blue (white plaques
mean contaminiation by wild type).  At &minus;20&deg; the titer should be constant
over several years.  Additional amplification might cause sequence biases and
is not recommended.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Libary Characterization</b>.  50-100 clones can be recovered for sequencing.
Each sequence is translated and compared to observed frequency for each
amino acid with that expected from randomization scheme used to construct the
library.  Suppose NNK (K = G or T) was used in the randomization.  Expected
frequency = # of codons for an amino acid divided by 32 codons (NNK: 4 &times;
4 &times; 2 = 32) &times; 100%.  This would be 9.4% for Arg, Leu, and Ser;
6.2% for Ala, Gly, Pro, Thr, Val, and Gln (assuming use of a <i>supE</i> strain
where TAG is suppressed by Gln).  It is 3.1% for each remaining residue.
Note that Arg and Cys are usually underrepresented while Pro and Thr are
overrepresented.  The rapid sequencing template purification protocol is as
follows:
<ol>
<li>Titer the library as above, timing it so plates are incubated 37&deg;
for 16 h or less: this miminizes chances of deletions of the peptide coding
sequence.  Prepare 10 ml starter of each strain used to propagate libary in
LB and incubate overnight 37&deg;.
<li>Dilute the culture in 1:100 in LB.  Place 1 ml of diluted culture into
tubes, one for each clone to be sequenced.
<li>Using sterile wooden stick or pipet tip, stab a blue plaque and transfer
to tube with diluted culture.  Pick well-separated plaques from plates which
have no more than 100 plaques.
<li>Incubate 37&deg; with shaking for 4.5-5 h.
<li>Transfer to microcentrifuge tubes and spin 30 s.  Transfer 500 &micro;l
phage in supernatant to new tubes.  Add 200 &micro;l 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl, invert
several times, let stand 10-20 min at RT.
<li>Spin high speed for 10 min at 4&deg;.  Discard supernatant.  Respin
briefly and remove any further supernatant carefully.
<li>Suspend in 100 &micro;l of 4 M NaI, 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA.
Vigorously tap tube.  Add 250 &micro;l EtOH and incubate 10-20 min RT.
Generally the ss DNA will precipitate and most phage protein stays in solution.
<li>Aftter spinning in microfuge 10 min 4&deg;, discard supernatant and
wash pellet with 500 &micro;l 70% EtOH.  dry pellet under vacuum.
<li>Suspend in 30 &micro;l TE buffer and quantitate by agarose gel electrophoresis
(use 5 &micro;l); should give a band of comparable intensity to 0.5 &micro;g
purified ss M13mp18 DNA.  Then use 5 &micro;l to do manual dideoxy sequencing
with <sup>35</sup>S or <sup>32</sup>P, or automated cycle sequencing with
dye-labeled ddnts.  For manual sequencing use the -28 gIII
5'-GTATGGGATTTTGCTAAACAAC-3' primer.  For automated sequencing use the -96
gIII primer (5'-CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG-3', unphosphorylated 5' end).

Phenylboronic acid-salicylhydroxamic acid bioconjugates. 2. Polyvalent 
immobilization of protein ligands for affinity chromatography
<p class="Para1">
In the first part of this report, phenylboronic acid-modified alkaline phosphatase
conjugate (PBA-AP) was immobilized on a salicylhydroxamic acid-modified Sepharose,
and this medium was then used to purify anti-AP antibodies.  The results were
promising, but it may be necessary to modify the antigen protein with PBA
at a higher stoichiometry of PBA than 1:1.  In practice, for each site of
potential conjugation, a 2:1 PBA:conj site ratio should be used in derivitization.
Reagents used in conjugation will be described.
<p>

Synthesis of the conjugating agents <b>PDBA-X-NHS</b> and 
<b>cyanomethyl-SA-X-NHS</b> are described.  Related agents are PBA-XX-NHS and 
methyl-SA-X-amine.  The scheme involves replacing the Br atom positions in 
3,5-dibromobenzoic acid with dihydroxyboryl [-B(OH)<sub>2</sub>] groups: this is 
done by serial addition of methyllithium (CH<sub>3</sub>and then 
<i>tert</i>butyllithium [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Li] to 3,5-DBA dissolved in 
THF and super-chilled, followed by adding triisopropylborate 
{[(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHO]B}. The acid is reformed and crystallized by 
adjust to pH for with HCl. The groups on the benzene ring, both boronic and COOH 
group are protected by heating to near-reflux in 1,3-propanediol and 
1,4-dioxane.  Several cycles of rotary evaporation and heating in 1,4-dioxane
were done.  N-hydroxysuccinimide was then added with an equimolar presence of
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC).  The white precipitate is formed in which the boron
groups are protected by the propanediol forming a diester of boron, and
the benzoic acid is an NBS-ester form.  6-aminohexanoic acid is then added to
this intermediate with diisopropylethylamine/methanol.  Sodium hydroxide is
added after reaction and concentration:  this deprotects the boron groups
and dissolves and solubilizes the material for filtering.  The filtrate is
collected and re-acidified and cooled and allowed to precipitate.  After a water
wash it is vacuum-dried.  Proton NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry
(electrspray positive) show that it is the desired product.  The NBS-ester form
is produced by again protected the boronic acid groups (propanediol in dioxane)
and then NBS + DCC.  Note that the X part of is the linker or spacer part,
which can be 6-aminohexanoic acid or whatever is desired.  Synthesis of 
a cyanomethyl SA-X-NHS starts with methyl 4-aminomethylsalicylate hydrochloride
in anhydrous MeOH, di-<i>tert</i>-butyl dicarbonate and triethylamine to
protect the amino group with tert-butoxycarbonyl group.  Solid from this is
dissolved in dry THF with potassium trimethylsilanoate (90% pure) and heated
by refluxing:  this changes the methyl ester to acid form.  Chloroacetonitrile
and TEA are then used to protect the opened acid form as a cyanomethyl ester.
Next the tert-butoxycarbonyl protection is removed with anhydrous HCl gas in
THF.  A glutaryl group is now added using glutaric anhydride with TEA in
dichloromethane.  Finally the NBS-ester form on the extension of glutaryl
is produced to make the cyanomethyl SA-X-NHS.
<p>
To prepare the media, EAH Sepharose 4B is suspendded in pH 9.8 bicarbonate and 
cyanomethyl SA-X-NHS is added:  amine groups on the activated Sepharose displace 
the NHS-ester to form an amide link with the glutaryl moiety. Excess 
hydroxylamine at pH 10.0 is added to produce SHA-X-Sepharose.  As much as 
3.5-7.0 &micro;mol of SHA per ml gel should be incorporated.  The protein
to become the ligand is then mixed with PDBA-X-NHS:  Presumably a free amino
group reacts with the NHS ester.  This is now mixed with hydroxylaminated
SA-X-Sepharose.  One of the boronic acid groups of PDBA then reacts with the 
hydroxyaminoacyl salicyl group on SA.
<p>
There is a question of whether to create 1:1 PDBA:protein conjugates, or to 
try to conjugate larger numbers of PDBA on the protein.  To see if there is
a negative effect on enzymatic/protein activity, PBA-X-NHS and PDBA-X-NHS
were mixed at ratios of 5:1, 10:1, and 50:1 of conjugate:protein, and the actual
incorporation determined and enzymatic activity assessed.  For AP, the
5:1 yielded 3:1 (54%), 10:1 yielded 4.5:1 (44%), and 50:1 yielded 11.5:1 (29%) 
incorporations (enzyme activities as a percent of original in parentheses).
This shows that conjugation is rather inefficient.
<p>
With respect to immobilization of PBA- or PDBA-X-protein conjugates on 
SA-X-Sepharose, it has been determined that at least six PBA moieties should
be fixed to the protein to create efficient mobilization and to stabilize it
against alkaline or acidic washes.  With PDBA-X-protein however, as little
as 3 PDBA groups stabilize the attachment of the ligand.

The splice variants of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and their 
receptors
<p class="Para1">
Angiogenesis is brought about by the appearance of many soluble growth factors
including aFGF, bFGF, and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), whcih are directly angiogenic.
TGF-&beta; and TNF-&alpha; act indirectly.  VEGF correlates all the time with
angiogenesis, and is a mitogen for endothelial cells.  It also appears to be a
mitogen for lymphocytes, retinal pigment epithelial cells, and Schwann cells.
[This paper describes activities of VEGF already reported in other notes:
look for tag VEGF.]  VEGF also induces endothelial cells to express proteases:
interstitial collagenases and urokinase- and tissue-type plasminogen activators
(uPA, tPA).  These proteases ultimately release cells from their anchorage,
and allow migration.  VEGF induces plasma permeability, giving the ECM access
to plasma to break it down and also hexose transport, so that energetic processes
related to angiogenesis occur.  A small level of VEGF is also necessary to prevent
apoptosis.  With respect to tumors, their cells express very high levels of VEGF
and also VEGF receptors; these are associated with metastasis and a poor prognosis.
<p>
A VEGF fragment (8-109) has been crystallized and resolved to 1.9 &Aring; which
reveals that VEGF is a dimeric cysteine-knot growth factor superfamily member.
Each monomer has an intrachain disulfide knot motif at one of a four-stranded
&beta; sheet.  VEGF belongs to the PDGF growth factor family within the superfamily,
where monomers exist in a side-by-side orientation, the two &beta; sheets perpendicular
to the 2-fold axis of symmetry.  NMR was used to solve the 111-165 fragment of 
VEGF-165 and shows the heparin-binding domain.
<p>
VEGF subunit monomers associate by two to form the homodimer via hydrophobic
interactions, which are then stabilized by C51 and C61 disulfides on two chains.
All of exon 1 and first four residues of exon 2 form a signal peptide, an 
amphipathic &alpha;-helix (pos 12-19) required for dimerization, and cleaved 
during secretion.  The N74 glycosylation site is required for efficient secretion
but not for receptor binding.  Mutagenesis studies of D63, E64, and E67 in exon 3
or R82, K84, H86 of exon 4  show that they are essential for VEGFR-1 and -2 binding
respectively.  Three flexible loops are clustered at each pole of VEGF of dimer
interface.  Loop II contains VEGFR-1 binding determinants and is close to loop III
of the other monomer, which has the VEGFR-2-binding determinants.  Thus the dimer
will bind either two VEGFR-1 or two VEGFR-2 proteins, creating dimerization and
then transphosphorylation.  In fact, mutant dimers with the ability to bind only
one receptor antagonize the VEGF activity.
<p>
<b>Regulation of VEGF expression.</b>  Cytokines and growth factors inducing
VEGF transcription and release include PDGF, TNF&alpha;, TFG-&alpha;, TGF-&beta;,
FGF-4, KGF/FGF-7, EGF, IL-1&alpha;, IL-1&beta;, IL-6, and IGF-I.  Most of these
factors thus exert angiogenesis indirectly via VEGF.  Hypoxia is an inducer of 
VEGF, and this is seen particularly in necrotic areas of tumors.  VEGF
is also induced by adenosine from hypoxic cells, which bind adenosine A<sub>2</sub>
receptors which act via the cAMP-PKA pathway.  The hypoxia response element
(HRE) upstream of <i>VEGF</i> gene is an enhancer element binding the hypoxia inducible
factor 1 (HIF-1), a heterodimer by the &beta;helix-loop-helix type transcription
factors.
<p>
The von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) tumor suppressor negatively regulates hypoxia-induced
genes: it sequesters protein kinase C &zeta; and &delta; forms, preventing
translocation to plasma membrane, downregulating MAPK activation which induces
VEGF.  Various cells altering their differentiation may control VEGF expression 
through PKC or cAMP/PKA pathways.  VEGF possesses Sp1, AP-1 and AP-2 sites through
which it might act through PKC and PKA.  Hypoxia increases transcript stability
via binding of a hypoxia-induced stability factor (HuR) to three elements
in the 5&prime; and 3&prime; UTR of VEGF mRNA.  Inactivation of the vHL gene
can lead to highly increased VEGF expression, as well as mutations in p53.  
<p>
<b>Six isoforms of VEGF</b>.  Six isoforms of VEGF have been identified.
Murine immortalized fibroblasts have been shown to encode a 115-aa form with 
novel C-terminus of 37 residues; there is no human homolog.  The predominantly
expressed forms are the 121, 165, and 189 forms.  The finding of a 183 form
in many tissues may have not been detected earlier because it may have been 
confused as a breakdown product of 189 or not resolved from it.  Forms 145
and 206 are rare, probably restricted to placental tissues.  Human skin mast
cells normally expressed 121, 165, and 189, but when stimulated with phorbol
myristate acetate will make form 206.  [Exon differences and the basic
amino acid segments in 165, 189, and 206 have been discussed elsewhere, including
how these forms do bind or not bind cell surface or heparan sulfate and ECM.]
VEGF<sub>145</sub> includes exon 6a which features a heparin affinity sequence
similar to the exon 7 sequence that makes up 165.  It mediates binding to 
ECM components that are not heparin or heparan sulfate.  It has bioactivity
(mitogenicity).  The 24 residues from exon 6 have 12 basic amino acids, including
a hexapeptide stretch KRKRKK from positions 126 to 131, which retains VEGF on the
cell surface (CRS: cell surface retention consensus sequence).  Proteins with
these CRS-binding sequences which are 60-72 kDa in size appear to be derived
from same gene product CRS-BP1.
<p>
It might be assumed that the VEGF forms trapped in ECM are a reservoir that is
slowly released in presence of heparin, heparan sulfate, and heparinases.
Or an active form of VEGF is released when proteases such as plasmin and 
urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) cleave a site that frees VEGF
from its ECM-binding segments.  The presence of these enzymes contributes to 
angiogenesis by breaking down ECM polymers.  Recombinant 189 and 206 forms 
do not stimulate mitogenesis because their folded forms conceal the receptor
binding domains.  The 189 binds VEGFR-1 but should be processed by uPA or plasmin
in order to bind VEGFR-2 in order to have mitogenic effect.  The uPA-treated 
VEGF<sub>189</sub> has activity equivalent to VEGF<sub>165</sub>.  All VEGF
isoforms can be cleaved by plasmin to a 110 form (VEGF<sub>110</sub>) which
has a 50-fold reduced mitogenic effect; similar to that observed for VEGF<sub>121</sub>.
Thus the exon 6 and 7 sequences are not just about sequestering VEGF to the ECM
or cell surface but contain sequences essential for mitogenic signalling.
<p>
<b>Related Proteins</b>.  VEGF shares 20% identity at protein level with PDGF. 
There are 8 conserved Cys residues folding to provide similar receptor binding 
domains and dimerization to another monomer.  Placental growth factor (PlGF) has 
53% protein level identity and it generates three forms PlGF-1 
(PlGF<sub>131</sub>), PlGF-2 (PlGF<sub>152</sub>) and PlGF-3 
(PlGF<sub>183</sub>).  Exon 6 features a very basic 21-aa sequence unique to 
PlGF-2, binding both heparin and neuropilin-1 receptor.  PlGF-1 binds to 
VEGFR-1. VEGF-PlGF heterodimers have been identified and have weaker mitogenic 
activity than the VEGF homodimers; it may be a way to modulate VEGF activity. 
VEGF-B is like PlGF, with wide distribution particularly in cardiac and skeletal 
muscle. The alternative splice acceptor sites within exon 6 create two different 
reading frames to produce two isoforms:  a VEGF-B<sub>167</sub> has homology to 
VEGF in C-terminus and binds to ECM and heparan sulfate proteoglycans.  A 
VEGF-B<sub>186</sub> has novel hydrophobic sequence, is Pro-, Ser-, and Thr-rich 
and O-glycosylated making it quite soluble.  Both will bind and activate VEGFR-1 
and neuropilin-1 receptor.  VEGF does form heterodimers with VEGF-B isoforms. 
VEGF-C shares 30% protein level identify with the 165 form, but is more closely 
related to the VEGF-D/c-<i>fos</i>-induced growth factor; both these 
proteins/complexes bind to VEGFR-3 (Flt-4, which does not recgonize VEGF) and to 
VEGFR-2, the latter with which it stimulates mitogenesis.  Precursor 
polypeptides are translated and then processed to reveal VEGF homology domain: 
VEGF-C precursor does bind VEGFR-3 (lower affinity) and not VEGFR-2 at all, so 
processing may serve an alternate purpose.  VEGF-C is suspected of promoting 
both vascular and lymphatic development and may be a paracrine factor in 
lymphangiogenesis and lymph vessel maintenance. VEGF-D is suspected of have 
important role in lung development based on mouse studies.  VEGF-E refers 
colletively to group of proteins with homology to VEGF coded for by strains of 
the <i>orf</i> virus that is pathogenic to sheep and goats and occasionally to 
humans.  This probably represents an adaptation of the virus in its infective
cycle; it binds VEGFR-2 with significant activity, causing acute microvascular
proliferation and dilatation and it has no activity to VEGFR-1 or -3.
<p>
<b>The Receptors</b>.  All three receptors belong to the <i>flt</i> subfamily
of receptor tyrosine kinases, with VEGFR-1 and -2 being high affinity binders
to VEGF. [Their basic structure addressed in other reviews on VEGF and its 
receptors.]  VEGFR-1 is a 180 kDa glycoprotein which is Flt-1, an <i>fms</i>-like
RTK with the highest affinity for VEGF (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 10-30 pM) and ability
to bind PlGF and VEGF-B as well.  It is expressed in adult and embryonic endothelial
cells (from mice studies) and to neovasculature in healing wounds.  It is found
in endothelial cells that have inactive and active cell cycles, so it is probably
a receptor necessary for maintenance.  Knockout in transgenic mice show lethality
by day 8.5 of embryogenesis:  endothelial cells are present (differentiate) but
cannot organize into vessels.  Studies of tyrosine phosphorylation by VEGR-1 RTK
have not revealed molecular level changes intracellularly (being hard to detect),
but upregulation of tissue factor, uPA, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1
are thought to be the consequence, since they help in endothelial cell migration.
VEGFR-1 in monocytes appears to induce tissue factor and chemotaxis, and in 
vascular smooth muscle enhances matrix metalloproteinase expression.  VEGFR-2
(called <b>k</b>inase-insert-<b>d</b>omain-containing <b>r</b>eceptor, KDR) 
is a 200-230 kDa high affinity receptor for VEGF as well (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>
= 75-760 pM) and binds also to VEGF-C and -D found in a screen of endothelial
cDNA library for RTKs.  It has 85% protein level identity with mouse fetal 
liver kinase 1 (Flk-1).  Its knockout is lethal in embryogenesis by day 9.5
with defects in development of endothelial and hematopoietic precursors.  
In the adult vasculature, VEGFR-2 mRNA is downregulated compared to VEGFR-1;
it gets phosphorylated more efficiently than VEGFR-1 and it is responsible for
mitogenesis, chemotaxis and cell morphology changes.  Both the 2nd and 3rd Ig-like
domains in the extracellar sequence provide high affinity ligand binding:
2nd Ig-like domain deletion in VEGFR-1 eliminates VEGF binding, while the 3rd
domain in VEGFR-2 is critical.  It is established that the 4th Ig-like domain
is required for receptor dimerization in VEGFR-1 (probably for VEGFR-2 also).
The 5th and 6th Ig-like domains in VEGFR-2 are required to retain VEGF after
binding, and the 1st Ig-like domain could regulate binding as its removal increases
VEGF affinity.  Glycosylation of VEGFR-2 is required for trans/autophosphorylation,
while not so for VEGFR-1.   A HUVEC cDNA library screeening found a soluble form
of VEGFR-1 (sFlt-1) which has only six Ig-like domains and lacks the C-terminal
RTK function.  It has VEGFR-1 binding strength and probably sequesters VEGF
and could also heterodimerize with EGFR-2 to be non-signalling.   Truncated form
of VEGFR-2 lacking RTK C-terminus is also expressed in rat retina.  VEGFR-3
(Flt-4) shows expression restricted to lymphatic endothelium and binds VEGF-C
and -D, not VEGF.
<p>
<b>Receptor gene expression</b>.  As it regulates VEGF release, hypoxia also 
stimulates <i>VEGFR-1</i> and <i>-2</i> in vivo expression.  <i>VEGFR-1</i> 
promoter region shows an HIF-1 consensus binding site.  However <i>VEGFR-2</i> 
has no sequence, and its transcription may be downregulated;  the effect of 
hypoxia may be attributed to increased <i>VEGFR-2</i> transcript stability 
through bunding factors on the 5&prime; and 3&prime; UTR.  VEGF and other growth 
factors induce <i>VEGFR-2</i> gene expression.  bFGF is synergistic with VEGF. 
In addition, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions might signal VEGFR 
expression.  VEGFR-2 is believed to be the true receptor for all the effects
created by VEGF, while VEGFR-1 could possibly be a decoy, as VEGFR-1 engineered
not to have a RTK will still show normal development and angiogenesis.  Nonetheless
other mutagenesis studies reveal that VEGFR-1 still has phosphorylated residues
interacting with SH2 domains.
<p>
<b>Other receptors/binding molecules for VEGF</b>.  Radiolabeled VEGF studies
with crosslinking chemicals show VEGF binds to other proteins that are not the
VEGF receptors.  Binding is with the VEGF-165 and not -121 form, indicating
interaction with exon 7 segments.  Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a 120-130 kDa glycoprotein
known to be neuronal receptor that is one such protein.  NRP1 is found in endothelium
and tumor-derived cells.  Under control of semaphorins it is involved in neuronal
axon guidance and growth. Overexpressed NRP1 causes lethal arrest of embryogenesis
at day 17.5 and knockouts are lethal at day 10.5-12.5 with cardiovascular anomalies.
NRP1 enhances VEGF-165 binding to VEGFR-2 as coreceptor.
<p>
Heparin is a sulfated linear polysaccharide released by mast cells with procoagulant
activity.  Heparan sulfate is related but has lesVs sulfate and is part of the
cell surface; it becomes part of proteoglycans.  VEGF-165 binding to receptors
is dependent on cell surface-associated heparin-like molecules, with 0.1-10 &micro;g/ml
potentiating binding, and higher concentrations being inhibitory.   Heparinase 
treatment to reduce heparin/HSPG reduces binding but exogenous heparin restores
it.  VEGF-121 interaction is independent of heparin.  It is thought that the 
heparin might have an unmasking effect on the receptor.  This holds for VEGFR-2
but not VEGFR-1, where heparin inhibits binding of 121 and 165 at concentrations
lower than those required for VEGFR-2/VEGF-165 binding; nontheless lower heparin
concentrations are required for binding.  Why VEGF-121 is affected although there
is no heparin binding could be due to heparin interacting with heparin-binding
receptors which affect VEGF receptors.  VEGFR-2 might interact with these receptors
on the RKTKKR sequence between the 6th and 7th Ig-like domains.

Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Histidine-Tagged preS Domains of 
Hepatitis B Virus
<p class="Para1">
The small (S), medium (M), and large (L) proteins making up the HBV envelope
are all translated from a single open reading frame (ORF).  They differ because
of three in-frame start sites, but have the same termination site.  PreS 
domains are potential binding regions for virus receptor.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>.  Restriction enzymes, ligase, DNA polymerase and molbiol reagents
were purchased from NEB, Promega, or BRL.  Chemicals are from Fisher, Sigma, or
Pierce.  The preS-adw fragment is amplified using adw subtype HBV DNA as template.
His codons (six of them) are introduced on 3&prime; end of preS gene through
the reverse primer.  The NEB Vent polymerase was used for PCR, with following
set up: 5 cycle at 94, 42, 72&deg; for 1 min, then 25 cycles at 94, 56, 72&deg;, for
1 min, followed by 5 min last step at 72&deg; to fill in.  Products are separated
on 1% agarose gel and these cut from gel using Qiaex DNA kit (Qiagen).

</ul>
<p>
Lowercase letters are the His tag codons, <i>Nde</i>I and <i>Bgl</i>II sites are 
underlined.  Products are digested with those enzymes and cloned into pT7-7 
double-digested with <i>Nde</i>I and <i>Bam</i>HI.  Ligation done with 50 ng 
plasmid + 50 ng insert + 200 U T4-DNA ligase (NEB in 20 &micro;l for 15 
h/16&deg;. Positive clones of mini-prep DNA using NdeI/HindIII digest and then 
sequencing. Plasmid is pT7-7-preS-his-adw.  The preS-his-adw form was made by 
taking previously reported pET-3A/pre-S1S2 and using this with forward and 
reverse primers [sequences not given here] with a built-in His tag in reverse 
primer.  <i>E coli</i> BL21 (DE3) and HMS174 (DE3) were transformed with both 
plasmid constructs and selected on LB agar with 50 &micro;g/ml ampicillin.  The 
cells have &lambda;DE3 as a lysogen and T7 RNA polymerase is under control of a 
lacUV5 promoter induced by IPTG. 50 ml of M9 medium with 0.17% glucose, 1.06 mM 
MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 53 &micro;M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 100 &micro;g/ml ampicillin 
was inoculated with single colony, incubated overnight at 37&deg;, then used to 
inoculate 1 L medium.  Growth was to A<sub>600</sub> = 0.6, then IPTG added to 
0.5 mM and cultured 4 h more.  Cells harvested at 4000 <i>g</i> for 10 min. 
Cell pellet resuspended in 30 ml of either 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0 + 6 M urea for 
pT7-7-preS-his-adw, or ice-cold 0.5 M citrate pH 2.5 for pET-3d-preS-his-ayw. 
Cells were lysed by tip sonication.  Lysate was clarified at 89,500 <i>g</i> 30 
min in Beckman SW28 rotor.
<p>
The HMS 174 cells transformed with preS-his-ayw induced with IPTG produceed a 
19.9 kDa band on 1D gels.  Lysates produced in pH 2.5 citrate caused 
precipitation of bacterial proteins except for the target protein.  Supernatant 
is adjusted to pH 8.0 and passed over Ni-NTA column.  Bound His-tagged protein 
is eluted in 6 M urea; urea is necessary since preS domains precipitate when 
concentrations &gt; 1 mg/ml.  Eluted material was adjusted to about 1 mg/ml 
protein then dialyzed to remove urea.  Anti-preS rabbit serum confirmed that the 
band on western was preS.  The BL21 cells were induced (0.5 mM IPTG) and this 
produced a 22.1 kDa band.  Unlike the other preS construct, the preS-his-adw 
precipitated with proteins in pH 2.5 citrate.  Moreover, the expressed protein 
was degraded despite use of protease-deficient cells.  Thus cells are lysed in 6 
M urea, cleared supernatants adjusted to pH 8.0 and then put on the Ni-NTA 
column.  Elution is with 0.2 imidazole and 6 M urea.  Immunoblotting confirmed 
band identity.  Yields from 1 L culture were 20-25 mg preS-his-ayw and 35-40 mg 
preS-his-adw. SDS-PAGE was on 15% gels: the <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> was higher that 
predicted, but this has been reported for His-tagged gels. When urea was 
dialyzed away the preS domain products were soluble snd storable at 
&minus;20&deg;.  Both amino acid analysis and peptide sequencing from N-terminal 
were performed and the expressed sequence verified.  Removal of the Met residue 
was observed because this is a characteristic of using E coli host. Far UV 
circular dichroism spectra between 190-250 nm with protein at 0.1 mg/ml shows a 
huge minimum at 200 nm with concave up shift (shoulder) at 230 nm, which is 
characteristic of unordered secondary structure.  Differences of ellipticity 
(&minus;14,900 deg cm<sup>2</sup> / dmol for preS-his-adw vs. &minus;18,800 deg 
cm<sup>2</sup> / dmol for preS-his-ayw) are not significant. Running algorithm 
CCA indicates extended &beta;-sheet with &beta;-turn and no &alpha;-helix, with 
41-47% unordered structure. Near UV CD in the range 290-450 nm shows noisy 
spectra, but since protein concentration could not be higher than 1 mg/ml, it 
was not possible to get hiqher quality spectra. The suggestion is that aromatic 
residues are in asymmetric environment, and that one or more Trp residues are in 
adw subtype despite similarity of spectra. A fluorescence spectrum of the same 
region (excitation at both 275  and 295 nm, plotting emision from 290 to 450 nm) 
shows a large peak centered at 344 nm for both recombinants, using both 
excitation wavelengths.  preS-his-adw has 4 Trp and 1 Tyr residue, while 
preS-his-ayw and 5 Trp and 2 Tyr.  This maximum is close to that of free Trp in 
solution (348-350 nm), and indicating that all Trp residues are solvent-exposed.
<p>
Polymerized HSA was prepared according to Okamoto et al (1885).  Both 
recombinants interact with adw or ayw subtypes using an enzyme immunoassay, 
which is done according to Delos et al (1991):  microwell plates are coated with 
50 &micro;l of 5 &micro;g/ml pHSA in pH 9.8 carbonate for 18 h at RT, washed, 
the treated with 50 &micro;l of preS domains or just BSA at 10 or 0.5 
&micro;g/ml in pH 7.4 PBS + 3% BSA.  After washing, 1:1000 rabbit anti-preS in 
PBS + BSA, then color development.

Risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in Turkey
<p class="Para1">
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is 5th most comomon cancer in world among men,
eighth among women.  HBV and HCV infections, and aflatoxin exposure are most
relevant.  Turkey is endemic for HBV with carrier rates of 5-10%, and HCV
seropositivity is 0.5-1%, with community incidence of 1.5%.  HBV carrier
rate higher in east, southeast, and south of Turkey, with a concomitant delta
virus rate.  A multicenter study involving 207 patients with HCC was done.
180 (87%) were clinically and/or histologically diagnosed with cirrhosis.
16 other cases showed evidence of chronic liver disease but cirrhosis workup
was not done to establish;  this makes 196 (95%) of patients with some evidence
of chronic liver disease.  Of the 180 patients, 161 were classed by Child-Pugh
criteria:  class A = 49, class B = 66, class C = 46.
<p>
The etiology of HCC was as follows (n = 207):  116 (56%) from HBV, 38 (23.2%)
from HCV, and 33 (15.9%) from excessive alcohol consumption of long (15 year or more)
period.  30 (14.5%) could not be assigned.  Suspicions in one case were 
hemochromatosis and in another aflatoxin exposure.
<p>
In 29 cases, 16 (55%) of patients were positive for anti-HBs/anti-HBc, and the
others negative.  Confounding factors were determined:  no history of prolonged
oral contraceptive or androgen steroid use; Wilson's disease; autoimmune liver
disease' primary biliary cirrhosis; other etiologis of chronic liver disease.
<p>
Of 116 patients with HBV, anti-HDV as positive in 13 (19%).  8 (4%) patients also
were HCV positive.
<p>
80% of HCC individuals were male.  In all cases, range in age was 22-84 y (median
57), with clustering in the sixth and seventh decades.  HBV-associated HCC typically
presents at a younger age than HCV-associated disease mean 56.2 vs 61.0 years
(p &lt; 0.01).  Males were overrepresented in HBV-assoc. HCC too (85%) compared
to HCC-assoc HCC.

Conjugation of Enzymes to Antibodies
<p class="Para1">
<b>LABORATORY MANUAL</b>.
Conjugation of enzyme (horseradish peroxidase [HRPO], urease, alkaline 
phosphatase) to an antibody must not alter the function of either protein, 
either the active site of the enzyme, or the antigen(Ag)-binding site.
HRPO is a 44 kDa glycoprotein which contains four lysine residues.
To conjugate IgG to HRPO is a three-step method utilizing principles
of organic chemistry:
<ol>
<li><b>Sodium periodate treatment of HRPO</b>.  NaIO<sub>4</sub> is a powerful 
oxidizer of carbohydrates, forming dialdehydes in monosaccharides rings of 
oligosaccharides from the <i>cis</i> vicinal diols.  HRPO, which is a 
glycoprotein, and thus has accessible oligosaccharide groups, is treated with 
periodate to oxidize its some of the monosaccharides on its oligosaccharide. 
This oxidation does not cause any detachment of a part of the oligosaccharide 
that contains reactive aldehyde, nor does this oxidation appear to cause a loss 
of peroxidase activity; if it did, this chemistry would not be useful.
<li><b>Schiff base formation</b>.  Aldehyde groups (R-CH=O) will react 
particularly with primary amine (R&prime;-NH<sub>2</sub>) groups to form what it 
called a Schiff's base (R-CH=N-R&prime;).  Note that a product of the formation 
is water (H<sub>2</sub>O).  This reaction works better if the solution is 
slightly alkaline to keep the primary amine unprotonated (as the reaction 
proceeds, more primary amine is formed because of the laws of chemical 
equilibrium, which includes acid-base chemistry). The Schiff's base formation is 
the actual chemical covalent binding&mdash;and therfore 
conjugation&mdash;between HRPO and the IgG antibody.  How?  The N-terminus 
(which is a primary amine -NH<sub>2</sub>) of the IgG antibody heavy chain is 
located in the F<sub>c</sub> portion of the molecule, and not in the 
antigen-binding (F<sub>ab</sub>) region.  This means that the IgG actually forms 
a bond with the oligosaccharide of the HRPO enzyme which should not affect 
either the Ag-binding ability of IgG or the catalytic site of HRPO.  Thus the 
conjugation.
<li><b>Reduction with borohydride</b>.  The Schiff base R-CH=N-R&prime; is not 
actually stable.  In fact, it is reversible, with the product water molecule 
(H<sub>2</sub>O) just as easily hydrolyzing the bond to reform the primary amine 
and aldehyde.  Schiff base bond stabilization is achieved using reduction with 
sodium borohydride, a powerful reducing agent. The product is 
R-CH<sub>2</sub>-NH-R&prime;, which will not lead to reversible de-conjugation
of enzyme and Ig molecule.
</ol>
<p>
HRPO and IgG, being proteins, also have lysine amino acids, and the side chain 
of lysine residues is a primary amine too.  These too can be reactive.  In fact 
upon forming dialdehydes after periodate oxidation, HRPO can react with another 
HRPO, either on the N-terminus or lysine side chain, forming HRPO dimers or even 
trimers and more.  Except that before HRPO is periodate-treated, it is treated 
with Sanger's reagent, 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), which converts all 
primary amines to a non-reactive dinitroaniline form.  Thus self-reactive HRPO 
multimers are not formed.  To create a simple 1:1 HRPO-IgG conjugate then, a 
solution of IgG is added slowly to a stirring solution of HRPO.  HRPO always 
remains in excess of IgG, so a 1:n HRPO:IgG, where <i>n</i> &gt; 1, is not 
likely.

<li>Add 1 ml of dialyzed antibody to the pasteur pipet with glass wool plug
and blocked at the tip with Parafilm.  Follow this with 500 &micro;l with
HRPO.  Add 0.25 g Sephadex G-25 to the mixture.  [The Sephadex will adsorb
water and effectively increase the concentration of reactants, and increasing
conjugation.  It will also make the periodate unreactive somewhat.]
<li>Let sit 3 h at room temp in dark.
<li>Wash column with 750 &micro;l carbonate buffer which elutes conjugate.
Collect in a tube that has at least 3 ml volume.
<li>Add 38 &micro;l NaBH<sub>4</sub> freshly prepared and incubate 30 min

Spin 15 min at 10,000 <i>g</i> at 4&deg;.
<li>Decant and discard supernatant.  Resuspend pellet in 750 &micro;l TEN
buffer.
<li>Dialyze the pellet overnight at 4&deg; against 2 L TEN buffer.  Change
buffer in morning, and continue dialyzing for 4 h.

<p>
<b>Urease</b> conjugates are often used for ELISA (not for westerns).  But
urease is not a glycoprotein, so a periodate-based conjugation would not work.
It does have thiol groups (from cysteine residues) that are available for
binding.  To conjugate urease to the primary amines of IgG, a heterobifunctional
cross-linking molecule <i>m</i>-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide (MBS)
is used.  On one end of MBS is a N-hydroxysuccinimide group which reacts with
primary amines.  One the other end is a N-maleimidyl group which reacts with
thiols.  The first reaction is of IgG with MBS, and then this product is mixed
with urease.  Between the enzyme urease and the IgG molecule is bridge formed
from the MBS molecule.
<p>
The following materials are obtained:
<ul>
<li>20 mg/ml urease, Sigma Type VII (U0376) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
<li><i>m</i>-Maleimidobenzoyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester [CAS 58626-38-3] in 
dimethylformamide (DMF):  Add 2.3 mg MBS (Pierce 22310 or Sigma M2786) to
920 &micro;l DMF, use within 1 h
<li>0.143 M 2-mercaptoethanol, prepared from 14.3 M stock (basically 1% 
of stock).
<li>PBS
<li>12 &times; 75 mm glass tubes
<li>1.5 &times; 5 cm PD-10 columns
<li>nitrogen tank
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Prepare dialysis tubing and dialyze antibody in phosphate as for the 
periodate-based conjugation method
<li>Dialyze 250 &micro;l of 20 mg/ml urease in 0.1 M phosphate against 2 L
0.1 M phosphate overnight at 4&deg;.
<li>Replace the dialysate with fresh buffer and dialyze for another 2 h.
<li>Place antibody and urease in separate glass tubes.  Read the OD<sub>280</sub>
of antibody and dilute with phosphate buffer to 0.5 mg/ml.  (Note that 
1 mg/ml IgG has OD<sub>280</sub> = 1.44.)
<li>Add 75 &micro;l MBS/DMF to 1.5 ml of the 0.5 mg/ml dialyzed antibody.
This is 120:1 MBS:antibody.  A small magnetic bar should be placed in the
tube and gentle stirring done for 30 min
<li>Pre-equilibrate a PD-10 column with 100 ml (10-12 col vols) with
phosphate.  Load on MBS-IgG solution and collect 600 &micro;l fractions
while running in phosphate buffer.  Read each tube for OD<sub>280</sub>.
The first peak is IgG-MBS and the 2nd is unreacted MBS.
<li>Pool the 1st peak (usu. total of 2.5-3.0 ml volume) and add 150 &micro;l
of 20 mg/ml urease in 0.1 M phosphate.  The weight ratio of urease to
Ab is about 4:1.
<li>Stir at room temperature under nitrogen for 1.5 h or until solution becomes
cloudy.
<li>Add 0.143 M 2-mercaptoethanol until a final 2 mM concentration (this
is 14 &micro;l mercaptoethanol per ml urease-IgG conjugate), then stir at
room temp for 30 min.  (This should deactivate IgG-MBS that did not bind to
urease).
<li>Dialyze overnight at 4&deg; against 2 L PBS, replace in morning and dialyze
4 more hours.
<li>Add equal volume glycerol and divide into small aliquots and store at
&minus;20&deg; (should be stable for 1 y).
</ol>
<p>
<b>Conjugation of Alkaline Phosphatase</b>.  AP can be used in ELISA or
western blotting.
<ul>
<li>5 mg/ml affinity-purified polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies
<li>10 mg/ml alkaline phosphatase, enyzme immunoassay grade
<li>25% glutaraldehyde in water
<li>Tris/ovalbumin solution:  50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 5% ovalbumin,
5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% sodium azide, 0.5% merthiolate
<li>sodium azide
</ul>
<p>Perform the following:
<ol>
<li>Dialyze 5 mg/ml antibody solution in PBS (not just phosphate), as described 
in the periodate method.
<li>Adjust the dialyzed antibody to 3 mg/ml using OD<sub>280</sub> readings.
<li>Add 100 &micro;l antibody to 90 &micro;l of 10 mg/ml alkaline phosphatase
in a 1.5 ml conical tube.
<li>Add 5 &micro;l 25% glutaraldehyde and mix gently.  Let stand at room
temperature.
<li>At times 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, remove 25 &micro;l solution
to a new 1.5 ml conical tube and add 125 &micro;l PBS to each sample, then 
add 1.1 ml Tris/ovalbumin.  Put all samples on ice until reaction is complete.
<li>Dialyze all samples against PBS as described in step 1.  Use a direct
ELISA assay to test for AP activity to determine which conjugation time
gives the most active conjugate.
<li>Repeat steps 1-4, but in step 4, allow reaction to proceed according to
the optimal time as shown in step 6.
<li>Add sodium azide to 0.1% and store conjugate in dark at 4&deg; for up
to 1 y.  Or add equal volume glycerol and store &minus;20&deg; for 1 year.

Purification and Structural Analysis of the Hepatitis B Virus PreS1
Expressed from <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p class="Para1">
A DNA fragment coding the first 119 amino acids of the PreS1 (L) antigen that 
exclude PreS2 and S coding, from an <i>adr</i> subtype was cloned into the 
<i>Bam</i>HI sit of pGEX-2T which contains a GSTase fusion tag on the N-terminus 
under the control of a P<sub>tac</sub> promoter, then transfected into <i>E 
coli</i> DH5&alpha;, grown in 1 L LB with 100 &micro;g/ml ampicillin 37&deg;. 
When the OD<sub>600</sub> was about 0.5 to 0.7, 200 &micro;M IPTG was added a
for 2 h at 30&deg;.   Cell pellets were then resuspended in ~100 ml PBS pH 7.4
containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM PMSF.  It was processed immediately or stored 
&minus;20&deg;.  After sonication to disrupt cells, and centrifugation (JA-20
rotor at 12,000 rpm for 30 min), cell extracts are mixed with 2 ml glutathione-agarose
in 70% PBS slurry and incubated 4&deg; on rotator 30 min.  Mixtures were then 
packed into 1.5 &times; 5 cm (8 ml) and washed with PBS.  Bound materials was
eluted with 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0 + 10 mM reduced glutathione, with 1 ml fractions
collected.  Fractions found on 12.5% SDS-PAGE to contain recombinant were pooled.
Thrombin was then added, 1 U for every milligram fusion protein, for 1 h at 4&deg;.
Digest was filtered through 0.2 &micro;m syringe filter and loaded to FPLC with
Mono S HR 5/5 cation-exchange column in t 50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.0 buffer with 1 
mM EDTA and 1 mM PMSF.  Column was then washed with 20 ml of equilibration buffer,
then a 20 ml gradient with 0.3 M NaCl in equil buffer run. 0.5 ml fractions are
collected and tun on 17.5% SDS-PAGE.  Fractions with PreS1 bands are pooled,
dialyzed against 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5, then lyophilized.  In addition
westerns using an anti-PreS1 mAb clone KR-127 (recognizes positions 37-45 in PreS1)
was used.
<p>
The SDS gel and western reveal what happens in extracts (induced and uninduced) 
and at each step in the purification.  It was found that the fusion was being 
degraded during induction, so only the incubation conditions could control or 
limit the degradation.  Lowering the incubation temperature and time of 
induction was the best approach.  After the affinity purification, with an 11% 
yield (20 mg protein), a band at 38 kDa expected to be the fusion is obaserved 
and the largest in quantity.  A smaller band at 68 kDa is also seen as are 
several lower MW bands (western shows them as degradation products).  The 68 kDa 
band is not immunoreactive, but clearly has affinity for glutathione (and might 
be an E coli enzyme).  On high resolution cation exchange Mono S after thrombin 
digestion, the PreS1 fragment elutes at 0.13 M NaCl;  degradation products and 
the 68 kDa protein were unbound to the column.  The Mono S column was used 
because anion-exchange and gel filtration had been tried and failed.  17.5% 
SDS-PAGE reveals a band of 13.4 kDa.  MALDI-ToF MS showed a mass of 13,507.81 Da 
which is close to calculated mass of 13531.85 Da, the full-length PreS1 mass + 
10 additional amino acids from the vector.  An indirect ELISA in which purified
antigen was coated to plates and incubated with the mAb KR127 anti-preS1
shows a dose-dependent signal.  Far-UV circular dichroism with solute in different
concentrations (20, 30, 40% trifluoroethanol) show a spectrum of a largely 
unstructured peptide in PBS, with about 8% (11 residues) of the recombinant had 
an &alpha;-helix.  Since TFE is believed to stabilize or promote helical formation,
data show that negative molar ellipticity at 222 nm increases with increasing
TFE with a simultaneous decrease in the negative maxima at 200 nm and a shift to
204 nm.  In 50% TFE, the helical content is in 16% (21 residues) of the sequence,
estimated from ellipticity magnitude at 222 nm.  CD with SDS micelles present
also reveal this, indicating it is membrane mimetic.  No &beta;-sheet structure
was observed, based on a negative maximum at 215 nm both in aqueuous and in 20 mM SDS,
despite prediction software indicating it.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>.  Previous preS1 recombinants have used &beta;-galactosidase
fusion in which it was insoluble and required refolding.  In this study a 
1 mg pure yield from 1 L culture was obtained (0.6% yield).  Other polypeptides
similar to preS1 domain show unstructured or loosely folded structures.  The p53
transcriptional activation domain (TAD) has on secondary or tertiary structure
in aqueous solution be helices are induced when binding to target proteins.
The preS1 may have determinants that confer different or variable binding interactions.

Direct Real-Time Evaluation of Nitration with Green Fluorescent Protein
in Solution and Within Human Cells Reveals The Impact of Nitrogen Dioxide
vs. Peroxynitrite Mechanisms
<p class="Para1">
Peroxynitrite is made by
mixing 0.5 M NaNO<sub>2</sub> in 0.5 M HCl with 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,
with rapid quenching in 1 M NaOH.  Excess peroxide is removed with
MnO<sub>2</sub> and filtering.  This can be stored at &minus;20&deg; for
&lt;2 wk.  Concentration of PON can be determined by measuring absorbance
at 302 nm (&epsilon;= 1670 M<sup>&minus;1</sup> cm<sup>&minus;</sup>).
Reactions can be done by dilution of a 2-10 mM stock in 0.1 M phosphate
(pH 7.4) which contains 50 &mu;M diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA).
<p>
0.5 &mu;g/ml purified recombinant GFP in 0.1 M phosphate (pH 7.4) was
treated with peroxynitrite in stepwise additions as a bolus of
either 0.5 or 5 &mu;M per application.  Gel electrophoresis was done on
aliquots and Westerns were prepared for staining with antibodies to
3-nitrotyrosine or GFP.  With 0.5 &mu;M PON stepwise addition, there
is with 1 &mu;M PON a detectable level of nitration that progressively
increases up to 30 &mu;M.  The anti-GFP shows a 27 kDa band in which
the progressive increase was not due to changes in GFP itself.
The fluorescence of the GFP was found to fall in parallel to the
concentration of PON:  It was about 50% of relative fluorescence of
untreated with 5 &mu;M, and 25% by 10 &mu;M.  These changes in fluorescence
were not reversible with mercaptoethanol addition.  Excitation and
emission spectra taken in the 200-750 nm range indicated that changes
were not due to spectral shifts.  Decomposed PON, nitrite, or NaOH
did not exert this effect.
<p>
Human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells were transfected by electroporation
with pEGFP-N1 vector (10 &mu;g DNA for 5 million cells in 0.5 ml, with
plating in RPMI-1640/10% FBS, selected 48 h later with 0.4 mg/ml G418)
and stably changed cells isolated.  It was determined that 300,000
stably transfected cells produced the fluorescence equivalent
to 0.5 &mu;g GFP/ml in the same 0.1 M phosphate buffer.  PON was added
to intact cells, but the reduction in fluorescence was not the same
as for protein in vitro.  Concentrations of PON required to reduce
GFP fluorescence in situ exceeded the concentrations that produce cell
lysis.  Hence PON does not cross cell membranes, or is quickly inactivated.
<p>
A reaction vessel was combined with a syringe pump capable of delivering
a flow rate causing a change of 1 &mu;M/min.  This caused a steady increase
in dihydrorhodamine 123 oxidation, with a ~20-fold increase in product
formation after 1 h.  With only 20 min of infusion, equivalent to the
bolus addition of PON reducing GFP fluorescence by 50%, the fluorescence
had decreased by only 5%.  After 1 hour (three times the bolus amount
producing 50% reduction), fluorescence was down only 7%.  There were no
real differences in reduced fluorescence with controls in which vehicle
alone was infused slowly, or when infusing PON slowly into GFP in a different
buffer (bicarbonate, pH 7.4) with a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere in the
head space of the vessel.

SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION BY CELL ADHESION RECEPTORS AND THE CYTOSKELETON:
Functions of Integrins, Cadherins, Selectins, and

<p class="Para1">
Cell adhesion receptors are important in signalling related with
cell identity.  Integrins are cell surface glycoproteins which are
recepetors for extracellular matrix proteins including fibronectin,
laminin, and collagen.  The sites along the ECM that bind integrins
are called <i>focal contacts</i> or <i>focal adhesions</i>.  Integrins
are &alpha;&beta; heterodimers with large extracellular domain,

There are at least 18 unique &alpha; subunit sequences, and 8 &beta;.

DNAWorks: an automated method for designing oligonucleotides for PCR-based
gene synthesis
<p class="Para1">
Attempts to obtain the naturally occurring gene for living systems for cloning
may not always prove the best.  High G+C content, codon bias, complex intron/exon
structures can complicate the process.  Direct chemical synthesis of the gene
using methods such as <i>Fok</i>I and self-priming PCR may prove more useful.
Assembly PCR involves generating overlapping oligonucleotides which can be 
assembled to create the gene of interest.  The overlapping oligos are then 
extended using PCR for the full length gene in single step.
<p>
DNAWorks will take the amino acid (translated) sequence along with flanking 
sequence containing restriction sites for directional cloning and create oligos
that are optimized to match codon bias and giving melting/annealing temperatures
that are closely matched as well.  A two-step PCR protocol is then done to form
the synthetic gene.  This software was testing on 11 proteins with gene lengths
ranging from 139 to 1042 nt.  Inputs include setting parameters for melting 
temperature within a range of 58-70&deg;, codon optimization, a target genome
limited to <i>E coli</i> class II genes or those expressed at high levels during
exponential growth, and looking for secondary structure such as hairpins.
<p>
With the input of an amino acid sequence in simple text or FASTA format, a 
reverse translation leads to ordering of high frequency codons of organism 
chosen. Flanking sequences can be added for cloning: <i>attB1</i> and 
<i>attB2</i> for Gateway cloning or short flanking sequences with <i>Nde</i>I 
and <i>Bam</i>HI sites for pET vectors, both of which are presented automatically 
by the program. During processing the back-translated sequence is divided into 
<em>odd</em> count of contiguous section with nearly equal melting temperatures, 
these calculated according to nearest-neighbor model.  Each section is scored 
based on codon frequency, hairpin formation, and deviations from melting 
temperature and length.  A hairpin formation score is determined using number, 
length, G+C content, and relative position of matches.  Scores for deviations 
from melting temp and size of each section outside input tolerance is calculated 
using a parabolic function.  Total score is the sum of the score of individual 
sections.  The sequence in the translated region (non-flanking) is then 
optimized:  a stochastic method of optimization is done because of the high 
number of possible sequences (for example, a 100-residue protein with two highly 
probable codons per residue would generate 2<sup>100</sup> or 10<sup>30</sup> 
possible gene sequences).  This uses a simulated annealing method, rather than 
deterministic method with steep gradient.  The two primary benefits are 
robustness against premature termination as result of entrapment in local 
minima, and of time efficiency.  Residues are chosen for mutation by looking at 
the local sequence/section score, with residues located within high scoring 
individual sections more likely to be mutated compared to residues in low 
scoring sections. Section boundaries are redefined during optimization with concomitatnt
changes in section size and adjustments in temperatures.  Improvements in scores
are detected and allowed, whereas when a score does not improve, the computation
is stopped for the section.
<p>
To assemble the gene, oligonucleotide solutions each at concentration of 1 
&micro;g/&micro;l are brought together in a mix of 1 ng/&micro;l for each oligo, 
with water added.  PCR reagent mix is then added as 4 volumes; the final mix is 
then 0.2 ng/&micro;l, 20 mM TrisHCl pH 8.8, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM 
(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 6 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100,
0.1 &micro;g/&micro;l BSA, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 2.5 U <i>Pfu</i> polymerase.  It
starts with 5 min at 95&deg; and then polymerase is added (hot start PCR), then
25 cycles of 30 s at 95&deg;, annealing temp for 30 s, and 1.5 min at 72&deg;.
Final step is 10 min at 72&deg;.  1 &micro;l of the assembled amplicon is then
used as template with outermost oligos as primers.  The cycling program is pretty
much the same except that the annealing temperature is 62&deg;.  Purification is
in gel.
<p>
Gel purified product is integrated in pDONR201 vector with Gateway cloning or
digested with restriction enzymes and ligated into pAED4 then transformed into
DH5&alpha;, selected on LB+amp (for pAED4) or LB+kan (for pDONR201).  Screen for
positives is by restriction digest analysis or colony PCR with primers straddling
vector + synthetic gene ends.  Positives are sequenced in both directions.

Lipoprotein Lipase:  Genetics, Lipid Uptake, and Regulation
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.
LPL was first described as a factor in heparinized dogs which "cleared"
postprandial lipemia.  It was later found to be the factor responsible
for clearing chylomicrons (CMs).  In the 1970s, apolipoprotein CII was purified
from serum and found to be the factor activating LPL.  Defects in apoCII
lead to hyperchylomicronemia.  In contrast, other circulating
apolipoproteins, such as apoCI and apoCIII actually <em>inhibit</em> LPL.
It should be understood that LPL has a principal role in removing CMs and
very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) from the circulation.
Other activities done by LPL include anchoring atherogenic lipoproteins to
arterial wall matrix molecules (seen in vitro).
<p>
Human LPL gene is located on chromosome 8p22, is 30 kb long with 10 exons.
There is extensive sequence homology for all species studied.  The protein
is composed of 475 amino acids with a 27-residue long signal peptide.
The active site requires the function of Ser-132, Asp-156, and His-241.
<p>
Many mutations have been discovered in human LPL:  61 missense mutations,
most in exons 5 and 6; 12 nonsense mutations;  10 frameshift mutations
or small insertions or deletions; 3 gross mutations; 8 splicing mutations;
and 4 promoter variants.  A few of the mutations are discussed.
<p>
The S447stop mutation is a truncation of the last two amino acids, associated
with a <i>Hind</i>III polymorphism on intron 8.  Studies show reduced TGs,
increased HDL cholesterol, and a slightly reduced risk of ischemic heart
disease.
<p>
The N291Ser mutation is the most common in Caucasians, showing an increased
TG and lowered HDL, but slight to moderate; it does not increase coronary
artery disease (CAD) in general population, but CAD is increased 3-fold in
persons who have familial combined hyperlipidemia.  Women may be more affected
than men, seen as a 2-fold increased in cerebrovascular disease.
<p>
The D9N shows a 20% decrease in LPL activity in homozygotes, but causes no
chylomicronemia.  One patient who was heterozygous for both D9N and Y262H had
hyperchylomicronemia. D9N is linked to hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, small
dense LDL, FCHL, and increased CAD risk.  By the numbers the mutation causes
a 20% increase in TG, a decrease in HDL by 0.8 mmol/l (3.2 mg/dl), and a
1.4-fold increase in risk of ischemic heart disease, borderline significant.
One meta-analysis shows a combined D9N mutation with T93G point mutation in
the promoter as having a 2-fold increase of CAD.
<p>
The T93G mutation in the promoter of LPL gene occurs with high frequency in
South African blacks.  The ancestry is quite extensive given the conservation
of the allele, and that it arose in a D9N mutation.  Individuals homozygous
for G allele show slightly decreased serum TG compared to those homogyzous for
the T allele.  Others found in white populations that the -93T variant has a
lower promoter activity than the -93G variant.
<p>
The G188E (exon 5 single base change) mutation results in increased
triglycerides and lowered HDL levels, with significant increases
in coronary artery disease.  This mutation is seen most among French Canadians,
but it is nonetheless found widespread in other populations too.  This is the
most frequent cause of hyperchylomicronemia in the general population, as the
LPL does not function enzymatically, with an 80% increase in TGs, and a decrease
in HDL of 2.5 mmol/l (10 mg/dl).  The mutation increase CAD risk 5-fold.
<p>
Mutations in LPL gene are linked to other diseases.  N291S carriers show
an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.  Some studies correlated hypertension
to LPL gene.  Heterozygous LPL defiency, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and
pancreatitis can occur in pregnancy and diabetes.
<p>
With any chylomicronemia syndrome in which LPL activity is affected, probably
by multiple mutations, TG levels are extremely elevated (over 1000 mg/dl) and
HDL-cholesterol is quite low.  Patients manifest symptoms that include abdominal
pain, pancreatitis, memory loss, xanthomas, dyspnea.  Postheparin plasma LPL
activity is part of the diagnosis.  Specific LPL protein tests (ELISA, western)
might show a low, normal or increased LPL mass which is dependent upon the
mutation.  Patients may have compound heterozygous mutations (multiple mutations
at different points on one allele, but the other allele is normal) and do better
than patients with homozygous mutations.
<p>
Histologically a patient may show LPL deficiency but adipose tissue appears normal
despite the altered uptake of fats.  This could result from the ability of
adipose tissue to synthesize triglycerides itself;  analysis of the stored fats
in adipose tissue in LPL-deficient shows there is less of the essential fatty
acids such as linoleic acid than in persons not deficient for LPL.
<p>
Circulating plamsa lipoprotein levels are believed to be controlled mostly by
adipose tissue and muscle.  LPL is also expressed in the nervous system, heart,
liver, adrenals, macrophages, proximal tubule cells of kidneys, pancreatic
islet cells, and lungs.  The role of LPL in pancreatic islet cells may be to
regulate insulin secretion and lipotoxicity.  Cells in the lung use LPL to
obtain fats they need for surfactant production.
<p>
The role of LPL in the nervous system is not as obvious, since deficiency
of enzyme does not cause dramatic effects in these tissues; there may be
compensating mechanisms.  LPL is found in brain, spinal cord, and peripheral
nerves.  In brain, LPL mRNA has been found in dentate granule cells; CA1, CA2,
and CA4 cells of hippocampus, pyramidal cells of cortex, and PUrkinje cells of
cerebellum.  They are also present on endothelial surfaces of the brain.  In
spinal cord, LPL is localized to the tracts, and also in areas where motor and
sensory neurons are found.  Schwann cells can make LPL in vitro, and some
of the enzyme is made by glial cells and not just neurons.
<p>
In the peripheral nervous system whenever there is a crushing or lacerating
injury to a nerve, a Wallerian degeneration process occurs.  Myelin lipid
(phospholipids, cholesterol, glycolipids, sulfolipids) ceases in the portion
distal to the injury.  Lipids produced by degradation of the myelin in the
distal region are re-utlilized in the proximal region.  HMG-CoA reductase
activity is down-regulated as cholesterol is re-employed from degrading sheath
into production of a new sheath.  Axonal components degenerate, with Schwann
cells proliferating in response to axonal and myelin debris.  Macrophages
infiltrate the distal stump in order to scavenge myelin lipids.  The study of
reutilization of lipids in nerve injury led to the finding that macrophages
produce LPL and apoE, also true for other nonneuronal cells.  LDL receptors
have been found on neurites in vitro and regenerating axons in vivo,
indicating lipoprotein particles are taken in by receptors likely binding
to apoE.  It is not strictly true that apoE alone is responsible for repair
reutilization, since apoE -/- mice show no real defect in nerve damage repair;
even double knockouts in mice for apoE and apoA-I still show normal nerve
repair after crush injury.
<p>
In the central nervous system, there is intense expression of LPL mRNA in
CA1, CA2, and CA4 layers of the  hippocampus.  This area is important
for experiential learning through long-term potentiation, in which a series
of conditioned impulses potentiates the size of synpatic potentials.  The
hypothalamus also features LPL activity.  Injection of oleic acid into the
third ventricle signals the nutrient availability via ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup>
channels.
<p>
LPL activity in liver and peripheral tissues varies inversely, results from
an aging rat study two decades earlier.  It is normally made in newborn animals
but not in adult tissues;  as development progresses LPL activity falls off in
liver and increases in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue.  Liver LPL
will be induced in response to tumor necrosis factor and when tumors are
implanted (during cachexia).  In studies with mice in which LPL was forced to
be expressed solely in the liver, LPL knockout mice strains were rescued from
neonatal death, as severe hypoglycemia in total LPL-deficient mice was prevented.
Liver LPL brings TGs to the liver, which are catabolized to ketone bodies,
utilized as a critical alternative to glucose.  Nonetheless, pups end up dying
with thoroughly fatty livers.  Liver LPL is also induced with agonist drugs
that target the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR).  Drugs
which target PPAR&alpha; increase FA oxidation, and those targeting PPAR&gamma;
show animals with fatty livers.
<p>
Heart LPL synthesis represents a large fraction of the enzyme, but its role
in energy balance and plasma lipoprotein regulation remains uncertain.  Fatty
acids represent 70% of the fuel used by cardiac and skeletal muscle.  FAs can
circulate on lipoproteins or on albumin, but FAs transported by albumin
are about 10% those of TGs on lipoproteins.  It is suspected that the heart
converts a great amount of lipoprotein TGs to FAs based on its LPL synthesis.
However, mice without cardiac LPL expression continue to survive although details
of the effect on heart function are unknown.  Mice who ONLY have cardiac LPL
as their means of expression are able to maintain normal TG and HDL levels.
The heart and peripheral tissues internalize core lipids from CMs.  Retinyl
ester uptake correlates with LPL overexpression in the heart.  This indicates
that not all lipids are processed through the liver.  A mechanism is described
in which a large uptake of these lipids causes capillaries to become leaky,
and TG-rich lipoproteins enter the interstitium beyond the endothelium (it
is known that FAs disrupt endothelial monolayers in vitro, and LPL action on
VLDL makes arteries more permeable).  LPL will anchor lipoproteins to cell
surfaces and augment uptake by receptors or internalization of proteoglycans.
This happens even with inactivated LPL, which can capture lipoproteins and
present it to active LPL.
<p>
Transcription of human LPL occurs at a basal and ligand-activated level.
On the basal level, transcription factor TFIIB binds to a TATA box-like
octamer ATTTGCAT at position -46 in the promoter.  A downstream CCAAT box
at -65 would bind NF-Y.  Another CCAAT box (-505 to -501) and two Oct-1
sites are upstream (-186 to -179, -589 to -582).  Sterols regulate a
nonconsensu 10 bp SRE at -90.  Sites labeled LP-&alpha; and LP-&beta; are
at -702 to -666 and -468 to -430, respectively, and they bind adipose tissue
differentiation-dependent transcription factors HNF-3/fork head.  There is
a CRE-like sequence in reverse orientation (-372 to -367), a PPRE (-169 to -157),
two FSE-2-like sites (-362 to -355, -206 to -200), a TRE in reverse (+22 to +29),
five GREs with four in reverse (-1543 to -1538, -1272 to -1267, -881 to -876,
-777 to -772, -645 to -640), an AP-2 site (-790 to -783), two hepatmer sites
(-80 to -84, -57 to -51), a nonconsensus SRE (-90 to -81), GATA (-501 to -446),
IRS (-75 to -68, -367 to -360), Krox (-430 to -422), and VDRE (-408 to -403).
No other evidence indicates these sites are truly involved in LPL promoter
regulation.  The existence of LXRE sites (-274 to -279, +635 to +650) indicates
that cholesterol might regulate LPL in macrophages.  Downregulation of LPL is
found when Sp1 and Sp3 sites are occupied in the proximal promoter.  In mouse
3T3-L1 adipocytes, an AP-1-like sequence (-1856 to -1850) may inhibit transcription
under the control of estrogen.  Agents that increase cAMP levels or mature
adipocytes treated with TNF-&alpha; show decreases in LPL expression too.
TNF-&alpha; may work through mediators like NF-Y binding to the CCAAT box and
an octamer protein which is not Oct-1.  Fatty acids such as &alpha;-lineoleate
increase LPL transcription during adipocyte differentiation.

The Basics of RT-PCR.  Some Practical Considerations.
<p class="Para1">
<b>CHAPTER</b>.  Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is 
widely used.  Isolation of RNA can be done by do-it-yourself preps or by 
commercial kits. Tissue homogenization is done in guanidine thiocyanate lysis 
buffer, followed by phenol extraction, then alcohol precipitation.  Kits use 
spin columns or magnetic bead separation rather than phenol extraction, making
them more rapid and convenient, but quick techniques include contamination
with genomic DNA.  For better purification to eliminate DNA, ultracentrifugation
on CsCl density gradients is a good choice.  If intron-spanning primers are
used in RT-PCR, the PCR products are distinguishable from larger intron-containing
products derived from contaminating genomic DNA.  Otherwise target mRNA 
that should not have introns should be cleaned first with a RNase-free DNase
and then the RNA purified to remove DNase prior to any cDNA synthesis.
<p>
The choice of primer type is important with respect to RT-PCR.  There are 
basically 3 types: oligo(dT), random primers (hexamers), and gene-speicific. Use 
of oligo(dT) primers will catch all the poly(A) RNA, which may have several 
kilobases of untranslated region downstream of the coding region.  mRNA often 
have secondary structure, and attempts to synthesize long stretches from a 
single primer can be a problem.  Addition of random 6-mer primers can increase 
probability of getting full-length first strands into 5&prime; cap. 
Gene-specific primers means only the target mRNA gets 1st strand synthesis: 
useful when target mRNA is low in copy number.  In addition, for the reverse 
(anti-sense) primer, create another primer downstream of it, because this 
ensures against nonspecifically primed cDNA not being amplified during PCR. For 
any first strand synthesis, prefer shorter rather than long primers to avoid 
nonspecific associations at the lower temperature of synthesis. Check that the 
melting temperatures is not more than 45 or 50&deg;
<p>
<b>Primer design</b>.  Use primers that span introns:  for example, an 16-mer 
that spans the eight 3&prime; bases of exon <i>n</i> and the eight 5&prime; 
bases of exon <i>n</i> + 1.  This will not anneal with any RNA containing an 
intron.  Primer pair computer programs are now available that avoid designs 
creating primer with self-complementarity or inter-complementarity yielding 
primer dimers or hairpin loops.  Primer annealing temperatures should match, 
since in cases where one primer has too high an annealing temperature it might 
misprime.  Primers should also have a gradient along the length where annealing 
strength increases from 3&prime; to 5&prime; (that is the 5&prime; end should 
bind first, since transitory binding of the 3&prime; end is the usual reason for 
mis-priming;  thus a more GC-rich 5&prime; end and AT-rich 3&prime; end is 
ideal.  Finally, the annealing temperature of primer and PCR product should 
differ considerably if primers are to anneal faster than the PCR product back 
with complementary strand. After the primer(s) are complete (designed), do a 
BLAST search of the genomic database to check what sequences are likely to be 
amplified other than the target.
<p>
<b>PCR conditions</b>.  If primers are optimal, little is necessary to optimize 
the PCR itself.  Primer concentrations are typically 0.1 &micro;M, dNTPs at 50 
&micro;M, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1.0 U of <i>Taq</i> polymerase in a 50 
&micro;l reaction.  The lower concentrations avoid conditions that lead to 
mispriming and creation of nonspecific PCR products.  A cycle of 15 s at 
96&deg;, 30 s at 55&deg;, and 3 min at 72&deg; is typical.  Note that the anneal 
temperature is not based on <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> of the pair, but works 
generally for all pairs.  A hot start (1 min at 80&deg; before adding 
polymerase) is always done since adding polymerase to components in the cold
could lead to mispriming and unwanted products.  For PCR products to be cloned,
a VERY high fidelity RTase and polymerase should be used.
<p>
<b>Contamination</b>.  There are many cases when spurious bands appear when
they are not expected.  This is because of other amplicons from previus runs
that have contaminated the environment.  If the reagent stock is contaminated,
falsoe positives occur in all reactions, including negative controls.  
However there are contaminations in which negative controls are still negative.
If contamination is suspected, multiple negative controls not normally required
would need to be run: that is, every tube in the PCR run would require its own
negative control.  The best way to avoid contamination is to follow these 
guidelines:
<ul>
<li>PCR should have its own laboratory area (or even room) dedicated to it.
No other work should be done.
<li>Within the laboratory or PCR area, the set up (pipetting of reaction 
reagents) and the analysis of products must be as physically distant from each 
other as possible.  If separate rooms can be done, then do it.
<li>Pipetting instruments should be dedicated to PCR setup and to its analysis.
The pipettors used for template, polymerase, dNTPs should NOT be the same 
pipettors used for amplicon in the analysis area.  And these pipettors should
<i>only</i> be used for these purposes and no other.
<li>If possible, separate lab clothing (coats) should be used in each room.
<li>Only open finished PCR tubes in the amplicon analysis area, and no other
place.
<li>Tips and tubes used for handling products should be disposed of in a special
closed container, and re-cap that PCR tubes before discarding.
<li>Electrophoresis and gel-staining solution should be carefully disposed of
as many PCR products are in them as they are leached from the gel.
<li>Always use filtered <q>aerosol-resistant</q> tips.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG).</b>  dUTP will be substituted for dTTP in its 
correct position.  If all PCR amplifications make use of dUTP, then the 
amplicons of a previous run in a PCR tube representing contamination can be 
destroyed by including UNG to break them down.  UNG is inactivated with the 
first cycle heat denaturation, so it will not affect the target amplification. 
Another alternative is to UV-irradiate the tube before addition of template DNA: 
UV light at 254 nm with 30 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> intensity for two 2-min periods 
destroys dsDNA.

Lipoprotein Lipase:  The Regulation of Tissue Specific Expression and Its Role
in Lipid and Energy Metabolism
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW.</b>
<p>
LPL is major enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing circulating triglycerides.
It is synthesized in parenchymal cells, transferred to luminal surface of
endothelial cells where it binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans.  Enzyme
found in adipose tissue, and cardiac and skeletal muscle.  Also detectable
in macrophages, brain, placenta, lung, spleen, pancreatic &beta; cells, and
steroidogenic tissue.  With development, LPL activities disappears in the adult
but found in very young animals.
<p>
LPL has four distinct physiological roles:
<ol>
<li>Provide fatty acids to tissues via hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins,
chylomicrons, and very low-density lipoprotiens (VLDL).
<li>Serve a <q>bridging</q> function in the absence of any hydrolytic activity
by anchoring lipoproteins to vessel wall and facilitate particle uptake and
triglyceride hydrolysis by other mechanisms
<li>Be a ligand for the LDL receptor and several other members of the liproprotein
receptor family (VLDL-R, megalin).
<li>Mediate selective uptake of lipoprotein-associated lipids such as cholesteryl
ester and lipophilic vitamins (A and E) without uptake of particles.
</ol>
<p>Imbalances or defects in the gate-keeping function of LPL are associated with
excessive lipid accumulation in adipose tissue or macrophages and there may be
pathogenesis of obesity and atherosclerosis.
<p>
In vitro transfection assays using reporter genes have been used to study
the LPL promoter.  The 5' regulatory region may be as long as 4 kb upstream
of the transcription start site.  Most of the basic sites are within
101 bp upstream.  A TATA box, octamer motif interacting with POU domain
of Oct-1 and B cell protein Oct-2, a CCAAT box binding
to nuclear factor-Y.  The octamer could act as an initiator element specifying
position of preinitiator complex formation, although a point mutation in the octamer
causes elevated serum triglyceride levels.  TNF-&alpha; inhibits LPL expression by
blocking the binding of NF-Y to the CCAAT box.  The NF-Y complex assembles a
histone acetyltransferase activity by binding GCN5 and P/CAF in vitro.  Acetylation
of N-terminal Lys residues alters histone structure and disrupts nucleosomes,
facilitating transcriptional activation.
<p>
CT elements are conserved sequences in promoters, enhancers, and locus control
regions.  Basal promoter activity is affected when the three zinc finger protein
Sp1 and possibly other transcription factors bind CT elements.  Sp3 in nuclear
extracts of differentiated THP-1 macrophages bind to the CT element of LPL
promoter.  Drosophila lacks Sp proteins but when expression plasmids containing
Sp1 and Sp3 were co-transfected into SL2 cells, the LPL promoter was transactivated
by the CT element.
<p>
A sterol regulatory element-2 (SRE2) overlaps the CT element.  In vitro protein-DNA
binding assays and transient transfection assays with reporter genes reveals a
novel nonconsensus SRE2 site with sterol responsiveness.  The CT/SRE2 overlapping
site binds SREBP-1 and Sp1 in a competitive manner.
<p>
Sp1 and Sp3 not only bind CT elements, but also have been shown in macrophages to
bind to interferon-gamma (IFN&gamma;) responsive elements (IRE), which are also
found in the LPL promoter (-31/+187).  Exposure to IFN&gamma; causes a decrease
in Sp3 steady state levels, with decreased LPL transcription.
<p>
LPL gene is also regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
response elements (PPREs).  Using methylation interference and gel mobility shift
assays, heterodimers of PPAR&alpha; or PPAR&gamma; combined with 9-cis retinoic
acid receptor (RXR) bind to the PPRE motif.  PPAR&alpha; is mainly expressed in
liver, kidney, heart, macrophage, and skeletal muscle, wherease PPAR&gamma; is found
in white and brown adipose tissue, macrophages, and intestine.  PPAR&beta; is
ubiquitous.  A long list of ligands will activate the PPAR axis:  fatty acids
including polyunsaturated classes and derivatives, arachidonic acid and metabolites,
and conjugated and oxidized FAs.  PPAR&alpha; is stimulated by the synthetic ligan
fibrates (lipid-lowering) and the antidiabetic glitazones stimulate PPAR&gamma;.
Heterodimerization of RXR can be controlled through its ligands.
<p>
The -169 to -151 segment 5' of transcription start contains an enhancer and
silencer, with a functional PPRE site.  One study found that chicken ovalbumin
upstream promoter transcriptional factor (COUP-TF) and a co-repressing silencer
complex of retinoic acid receptor and thyroid receptor (SMRT) both interact with
PPAR&gamma;.
<p>
Within introl 1 is an oxysterol liver X receptor (LXR) responsive element which
directly binds heterodimers of LXR and rexinoid receptor (LXR&alpha;/RXR).
This mediates cholesterol-induced LPL expression in a tissue-specific way.
Mice subjected to high cholesterol diets or LXR-selective agonist show increased
LPL in liver and macrophage, but not in muscle, kidney, intestine, adrenals, or
adipose tissue.  This might attenuate or override inhibition induced by sterol
levels that activate the ADD-1/SREBP-1 pathway.
<p>
A nuclear factor-1-like motif was found forming complexes with liver nuclear
extracts in the adult and results were different in neonates.  It is possible that
the downregulation of LPL in adults is controlled by NF-1.
<p>
Additional <i>cis</i>-acting elements include AP-1 and AP-1-like elements.
c-Jun/c-fos heterodimers and c-jun/c-jun homodimers bind to AP-1 consensus sequences,
possibly controlling macrophage LPL via glucose.  The AP-1-like sequence could
mediate suppression of transcription by estrogen.  While many elements are
upregulating, quite a few in the -225 to -81 region of the human promoter may
bind repressor proteins.
<p>
In addition to the in vitro studies (including transfection of cell lines),
various fragments have been studied in transgenic mice.  Mice given the human
LPL cDNA (including 8 kb of 5' upstream sequence) expressed LPL exclusively in
cardiac muscle.  When put under 25 kb of 5' upstream sequence with full length
genomic LPL gene and 15 kb 3' downstream sequence, LPL mRNA was found in more
tissues:  adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle and cardiac.  Transgenic mice
with the mouse -1824 bp promoter expressed luciferase in highest levels
with brown adipose and in brain.
<p>
Posttranscriptional regulation, including translational and posttranslational,
is poorly understood.  Induction of LPL by certain FAs and the inhibition of
expression by glucose and epinephrine, are mediate by interaction of cytosolic
proteins and the 3'-UTR of LPL mRNA.  Inhibition of protein kinase C in adipocytes
results in decreased LPL synthesis through translational inhibition, and so
PKC has a constitutive role in LPL expression.
<p>
Mature active LPL is a homodimer created by many posttranslational steps
which includes Asn-linked glycosylation in the ER and Golgi.  There is disagreement
from studies showing LPL active early in ER or whether it must be transported to
Golgi.  There is a belief that LPL is shifted between an inactive, probably monomer
form and an active dimeric form, since an intracellular inactive LPL pool has been
found.  This pool of LPL has been shown not to be a precursor to the active form,
but instead may be an aggregation of misfolding LPL molecules.
<p>
PPAR&alpha; and PPAR&gamma; act posttranslationally to affect the trafficking of
LPL.  A glucose-dependent translocation of LPL from intracellular to extracellular
sites in pancreatic &beta;-cells occurs without any dependence on insulin secretion.
In cardiomyocytes LPL translocation to a heparin-releasable fraction is controlled
by glucocorticoid and insulin.  As cytochalasin D abolished this hormonal action,
translocation probably involves the actin cytoskeleton.
<p>
During short term fasting adipose tissue LPL activity decreases without changes
in LPL mRNA levels or mass.  When refeeding occurs, there was a restoration of
activity so long as transcription was not inhibited.  Thus a gene product is made
in fasting that prevents LPL activation but not its synthesis.
<p>
Postheparin LPL provides an assessment of <q>whole body</q> LPL rather than
tissue-specific enzyme.  High levels of LPL in cardiac and skeletal muscle are
associated with anti-atherogenic lipoprotein profiles of low plasma triglycerides
and high HDL-cholesterol levels.  In contrast high LPL levels in macrophages are
associated with increased risk of development of atherosclerotic lesions.  Since
hypertriglyceridemia is an indepedent risk factor for premature atherosclerosis,
and LPL affects plasma triglycerides, then LPL function must play a role.  At least
70 mutations of the gene have been described, and probably 20% of patients with
hypertriglyceridemia are carriers of common mutations.  Besides mutations, other
conditions can affect LPL activities and plasma triglycerides.  Insulin resistance
in type 2 diabetes cause low adipose tissue LPL activities, which are further
reduced by TNF&alpha; and IL-6, causing high triglyceride levels.
<p>
Humans and mice with LPL deficiency show markedly reduced HDL.  During HDL
biogenesis, lipid-poor apoAI acquires free cholesterol (Chol) and phospholipids (PLs) from
plasma membranes of peripheral tissues and from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.
The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is involved in plasma membrane
efflux from intracellular location to apoAI.  ABCA1 mutations cause Tangier
disease, with accompaying very low or absent HDL.  LPL is required to cause
transfer of PL and free Chol from the VLDL surface to HDL.
<p>
LPL is present in atherosclerotic lesions

Overview of Antibody Phage-Display Technology and Its Applications
<p class="Para1">
<b>Book Chapter</b>.  The principle is to insert DNA that encodes a structural
fragment that is a ligand.  The ligand is batch-cloned as a fusion to a gene
encoding a phage coat protein (in M13 [fd], this is pIII, pVI, or pVIII).
The fusion is expressed as part of the phage coat and presented on the phage
surface.  The most popular is the non-lytic filamentous phage that infects
<i>E coli</i> through the F pilus of the bacterium, expressed via the F plasmid.
Both phage- and host enzymes direct the replication of the genome and assembly of
its coat in the periplasmic space of the bacterial cell wall.
<p>
The first use was with antibodies.  Variable (V) regions encoding a scFv
were inserted in-frame to the N-terminus of pIII using phage vector based on
fdtet genome.  The insert was between the pIII signal sequence (to retain
export function) and retained pIII as necessary part of the coat.  Both
V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domains correctly fold to form the scFv.   The
first vectors included all phage genes for life cycle, but vectors were trimmed
to phagemids, which have high transformation efficiency.  Some use much of the
gene III to produce a full pIII.  Others a truncated pIII (lack first two
domains).  Others produce unfused Ab fragment without subcloning.  Others
include expression driven by <i>lacZ</i> promoter;  this may be necessary when
expression toxicity is an issue.  Catabolite repression can be achieved by
including Glc in culture medium by addition of extra transcriptional terminator
or use of phage shock promoter.
<p>
Display formats for Abs include scFvs, Fabs, Ig variable fragments (Fvs) with
engineered intermolecular disulfide bond to stabilize V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>L</sub>
pair and diabody fragments.  The scFv libraries are usually more stable than
larger-sized Fab libraries.  Fab display involves fusion of either light or
heavy (Fd) chain via C-terminus to pIII, and the partner chain is expressed and
secreted into the periplasmic space where chain association forms intact Fab.
Light chains form dimers, so the the H chain is anchored to the coat protein.
In some instances, bispecific dimers of scFvs are created by a bicistronic
cassette with two V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>L</sub> fusions, one fused to <i>gIII</i>.
For this diabody format either a bivalent Ab is isolated, useful for functional
screening, or large panels of bispecific molecules are generated, avoiding
extensive recloning after selection.
<p>
<b>Constructing Ab Libraries</b>.  Gene from hybridomas or cloned B cells or
stimulated B cell cultures might be used, giving rapid access to B genes.
The cDNA from the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> regions from B cells are
produced and amplified and then assembled.  Assembled genes are then inserted
in frame with coat protein pIII, co-infected with helper phage into <i>E coli</i>
and then the random combinatorial library selected.  Expressed V genes are
then isolated.  Libraries are built in scFv or Fab format.
<p>
<b>Immunized Animals or Immune Donors</b>.  The B cells from the spleens of mice
are immunized with antigens or immune donors are used (see Clackson et al,
<i>Nature</i> 352: 624, 1991; Burton et al, <i>Nature Biotechnol.</i> 14:
1149, 1996).  Higher affinity Abs can be obtained than those from hybridomas.
Immune phage libraries are useful for analyzing natural humoral responses,
e.g. in patients with autoimmune disease, viral infection, neoplastic disease,
or studying in vitro immunization procedures.
<p>
<b>Single-Pot Repertoires</b>.  Abs can be obtained only against the set of Ags
to which an immune response was induced, and this necessitates repeated
immunization and library construction.  Ideally universal Ag-unbiased libraries
are available from which high affinity Abs to any chosen Ag can be directly
selected, independent of the donor's immunological history.  A distinction between
naive and synthetic Ab libraries depends on the source of the Ig genes.
<p>
Primary (unselected) Ab repertoire has large array of IgM Abs recognizing
a variety of Ags.  This array can be cloned as a naive repertoire of rearranged
genes by harvesting the V genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen,
or similar sources by getting the IgM mRNA of B cells of unimmunized
human donors.  Use of Ag-biased IgG and V gene may potentially carry mutations
and should be avoided.  V genes can be amplfied from B cell cDNA using
V-gene family based primers;  H and L chains are randomly combined and cloned
to generate a combinatorial libary of scFv or Fab fragments.  It provides
access to Abs from B cells not yet exposed to Ag.  A single naive library if
sufficiently large and diverse will generated Abs to a large panel of Ags,
including self, nonimmunogenic, and toxic Ags.  The affinity of Abs selected
from a naive library is proportional to library size, ranging from
10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>&minus;1</sup> for small library of
3 &times; 10<sup>7</sup> clones to 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>&minus;1</sup>
for a large repertoire of 10<sup>10</sup> clones using brute-force cloning.
<p>
<b>Synthetic Ab Libraries</b> are a second type of single-pot repertoire, built
by in vitro assembly of V gene and D/J segments.  The V genes may be assembled
by a predetermined level of randomization into CDR and possible bordering FRs
into germline V-gene segments or rearranged V genes.  Most natural structural
and sequence diversity is found in loop central to the Ag-combining site, the
H chain CDR3 while the other five have limited variation.  The first synthetic
libraries have made diversity paramount in H chain CDR3.  The first synthetic
library constructed 49 human V<sub>H</sub> segments via PCR with short CDR3
(5-8 amino acids) and a J region, and cloned for display as scFv with human
&lambda; L chain.  Many Abs to haptens and one against a protein Ag were isolated.
CDR3 wer then enlarged (from 4-12 residues) to provide more length diversity.
Abs with nanomolar affinity were obtained in synthetic Ab library combining
in vivo recombination (novel method to synthesize combinatorial libraries) and
strategy to mimic natural Ab diversity (optimally use seqeunce space).  In largest
library up to 1994, 49 human H chain segments were combined with collection of
47 human &kappa; and &lambda; L chain segments with partially randomized CDR3
regions.  H and L chain V-gene repertoires were combined  using the Cre-<i>lox</i>
site-specific recombination to create repertoire of Fabs displayed on phage
making up 65 billion clones.  Library yielded Abs against numerous Ags, some with
nanomolar affinity.  Repropagation results in significant loss of diversity, but
a more stable scFv phagemid library (1.2 billion clones) using same synthetic
V genes has proven effective.
<p>
In some cases panning is done on cells, and these cells are then sorted by
flow cytometry, which are stringent conditions collecting few phage.  Different
subsets of Ab will be selected every time.  When constructing synthetic Ab
libraries one may be guided by factors such as good expression and folding and
low toxicity in <i>E coli</i> to increase the functional library size.  MorphoSys
used V-gene segments based on master frameworks representing each of the Kabat
subclasses to incorporate in principle on well-expressed scaffolds.  V genes
were assembled with oligos made from trinucleotides instead of single bases to
avoid introducing stop codons that would decrease functional library size.
<p>
Abs selected from immune or even single-pot repertoires may not have affinity
sufficient for the purpose.  It may be enough to construct multivalent molecules
but in vitro affinity maturation may be necessary.  This process involves three
steps: (i) introducing diversity in V genes chosen for maturation to create
a 2nd library; (ii) select the higher affinity variants; (iii)  screening to
discriminate variants with differences in affinity and in binding kinetics.
Strategies to increase diversity include methods described here:
<ul>
<li>mutator strains of bacteria
<li>error-prone PCR
<li>chain shuffling
<li>DNA shuffling:  codon-based mutagenesis, oligo-directed mutagenesis, and PCR
techniuqes directed at defining residues or regions of the V genes
</ul>
<p>
Non-directed methods are used to mature Abs with a low starting affinity.  When
Abs with nanomolar affinities are used as starting leads, CDR-directed changes
are successful.  Residues modulating affinity can be randomized (4-6 residues
at a time, ideally) for sampling of the sequence space.  Chain shuffling,
Ala-scanning of CDR regions, parsimonious mutagenesis, or modeling might be used
in this case.  Targeting CDRs in parallel has been tried.  Improvements in affinity
to below 0.1 nM by saturation mutagenesis and affinity selection of CDR3 in the
H and L chains are quite successful.  Bioinformatics studies have also revealed
the key residues for targeting in affinity maturation.
<p>
<b>Ribosome Display</b>.  Beyond phage display may be the ability to use an
in vitro technique to translate, display and select proteins on ribosomes.
Proteins may be selected on a polysome in a panning process similar to phage
display, and then selected mRNA is converted to cDNA for a round of transcription,
translation, and selection.  scFvs may be particularly suited to cell-free
translation systems that select, and so diversity is not limited by any host
cell or phage life cycle.  The "Profusion" technology uses covalent RNA-peptide
fusions.
<p>
<b>Phage Ab Selection</b>.  Any method that can separate specific binding from
non-binding ligands works.  Biopanning using immobilized Ag on solid supports,
columns or BIAcore sensor chips, selection with biotinylated Ag, panning of
fixed prokaryotic and on mammalian cells, subtraction selection using sorting,
enrichment on tissue sections or pieces, selection on paramagnetic liposomes,
selection in living animals.  When bound to Ag, the phage-Ab can be eluted with
HCl or glycine buffers or with triethylamine, or with chaotropic agents, or
with DTT when the biotin is linked to Ag by a disulfide bridge, by enzymatic
cleavage with protease engineered between Ab and gIII, or by competition with
excess Ag or Abs to the Ag.  Because non-specific binding of phage-Ab not specific
for Ag occurs to the matrix, selection is repeated.  In doing affinity selection,
decreasing the Ag concentration will be crucial to limiting those phage-Ab with
the best affinity. Selections would be done in solution rather than by
avidity-prone panning on coated Ag.  In selecting a secondary phage library,
Ag concentration is reduced to below the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of the parent
clone.
<p>
<b>Ag quality</b>  More successful selections use purified Ags.  If saddled
with Ags in a complex (impure) system because it is difficult to purify then,
then depletion or subtraction methods, competitive eolution with Ab or Ag itself
or selection by atlernating between different sources of Ag might be tried.
Ags blotted to membranes might be blotted with BSA or milk protein before trying
the selection.
<p>
<b>Cell Selection</b>.  Ags on the surface of adherent cells or intact cells in
suspension might be useful for phage-Ab from immune libraries since irrelevant
phage-Abs should have a lower presence.  Many other partitioning methods are
possible in theory (depletion/subtraction, cell sorting, magnetic bead systems,
competitive elution with Ag-specific ligand

Distinct Binding Sites in the Structure of &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-Macroglobulin 
Mediate the Interaction with &beta;-Amyloid Peptide and Growth Factors
<p class="Para1">
&beta;-Amyloid peptides accumulate in the brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease. 
Specific residues 1-40 and 1-42 (bA1-40, bA1-42) are seen.  Both these peptides 
bind to &alpha;<sub>2</sub> macroglobulin (a2M) with equal affinity, so studies 
with only bA1-40 were done.  2.5 nM of <sup>125</sup>I-bA1-40 was incubated with 
native and methylamine-treated a2M (a2M-MA) in an 8:1 mol/mol bA1-40:a2Mx ratio, 
and then analyzed using non-denaturing PAGE.  Gel stains show that bA1-40 binds 
to a2M-MA and not native a2M.  A bifunctional chemical crosslinking reagent 
[bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, BS<sup>3</sup>] used according to previous 
reports to assess groth factor binding to a2M was used here to assist in 
determining the <i>K</i><sub>D</sub>:  this involves using crosslinker added 
once binding has reached an equilibrium, running on SDS-PAGE to separate, then 
quantiting using PhosphorImager; plots of free/bound vs. 1/[a2M] are made, which 
is linear with slope <i>K</i><sub>D</sub>/<i>z</i> and intercept 1/<i>z</i> 
&minus; 1. The <i>z</i> value is an exact fraction of a2M-bA1-40 complex.  Its 
value was 0.06-0.14 whereas for growth factor/a2M binding it is 0.15-0.40. 
<i>z</i> could be decreased if a fraction of labeled bA1-40 could not bind to 
a2M-MA or if bA1-40 forms multimers around a2M-MA, preventing crosslinking but 
neither of these effects able to influence the <i>K</i><sub>D</sub>.  The 
apparent <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> of a2M-MA and bA1-40 binding computes to 0.29 
&plusmn; 0.02 for three experiments, which assumes one binding site.  The 
<i>K</i><sub>D</sub> for the binding site itself (not the whole a2M molecule) is 
1.2 &micro;M.  Compare this to the plasma concentration of all subunits in the 
holoprotein at 12-20 &micro;M.
<p>
Native a2M, a2M-MA, and BSA were denatured in SDS and reduced in DTT then 
alkalyated with iodoacetamide.  SDS-PAGE shows a 180 kDa band for the subunit. 
Fainter bands appeared at 120 and 60 kDa in the native a2M lane, which appear 
when the thioester bond is heated to 100&deg;, causing heat fragmentation, not 
seen when the thiol ester bound is already broken.  <sup>125</sup>I-bA1-40
could bind to a2M that had been run on gels and blotted to PVDF, and it was
so for  native a2M and a2M-MA.  bA1-40 does not bind to BSA, so the interaction
is likely quite specific.  This binding is unlike the binding of proteinases
which require 3&deg; and 4&deg; structure; bA1-40 binds to single subunits,
more like growth factors.  To ensure that <sup>125</sup>I-bA1-40 binding 
was not the result of a change caused by radiodination process itself, 
incubation of unlabeled bA1-40 with immobilized a2M prior to incubation with
<sup>125</sup>I-bA1-40 inhibited or competed with binding of radiolabeled
bA1-40.  Additionally, biotinylated bA1-40 was used instead and it was able
to bind as well.
<p>
In the presence of denaturant, if a2M is heated, the thiol ester bond reacts
internally with the polypeptide backbone and breaks it at residue 952.
This N-terminal part (120 kDa) includes the bait region and growth factor
binding sequence.  The C-terminal part includes the LRP-binding sequence and
the &beta;Amyloid part.  a2M was thus heat fragmented and both segments
were tested:  the labeled bA1-40 clearly bound to the 60 kDa fragment 
associated with LRP binding, and not with the fragment for growth factor binding.
<p>
When activated a2M is treated with papain under mildly acidic conditions, 
it produces and 18 kDa fragment which has LRP-binding activity and comes from
the C-terminus (four are produced for the tetramer).  These are amino acids
1314-1451.  The ability of bA1-40 to bind either to the 18 kDa RBF or to 
the 600 kDa amino fragment was tested:  in solution under non-denaturing 
conditions, there was no binding, while as a control the bA1-40 did bind to
a2M-MA.  In a competitive binding study, <sup>125</sup>I-bA1-40 was kept at
2.5 nM, a2M-MA was 300 nM, and the 18 kDa RBF was varied.  The plot shows
that as 18 kDa RBF increases, this interferes with bA1-40 binding to a2M-MA.
IC<sub>50</sub> was 700 nM.  As there was a high conc of a2M, the <i>K</i><sub>D</sub>
for bA1-40 to 18 kDa RBF is ~2-fold lower than the IC<sub>50</sub>.  This
shows the bA1-40 binding site is on the C-terminus.
<p>
In previous work GST-fusion constructs of segments of the a2M polypeptide were 
created, six of them FP1 to FP6.  The amino acid sequences are specified in
the table, along with new cloned subsequences for this study:
<table>
<tr><th>Construct  <th>Amino Acid Range <th>Containing Functions
<tr><td>FP1 <td>99-392  <td>
<tr><td>FP2	<td>341-590 <td>
<tr><td>FP3	<td>591-774 <td>bait region, growth factor binding
<tr><td>FP4	<td>775-1059 <td>thiol ester bond
<tr><td>FP5 <td>1030-1279 <td>
<tr><td>FP6 <td>1242-1451 <td>&beta;Amyloid peptide- and LRP-binding
<tr><td>FP6a<td>1242-1365 <td>
<tr><td>FP6b<td>1242-1400 <td>
<tr><td>FP6c<td>1365-1451 <td>LRP-recognition &alpha;-helix

<tr><td>FP6d-AR <td>1314-1451<td>18 kDa RBF with K1370A and K1374R subs
<tr><td>FP6-AA <td>1242-1451<td>FP6 but K1370A and K1374A subs
</table>
<p>
The mutagenesis in the FP6d constructs was done using Stratagene QuikChange.
FP3 contains the bait region and growth-factor binding site.  FP4 contains the 
thiol ester site, and LRP recognition is in FP6. These aklylated (by 
iodoacetamide, no use of reduction) were separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted to 
PVDF:  labeled bA1-40 bound only to FP6.  Reductively alkylated FP3 and FP6 were 
tried, and still only FP6 could bind labeled bA1-40. This was true whether the 
label was biotin or <sup>125</sup>I, so the label was not a factor in binding.

<p>
The region between amino acids 1370-1377 of the mature subunit is composed
of &alpha;-helix important to LRP binding.  This sets up two Lys residues
at 1370 and 1374 at 45&deg; angles, surrrounded by hydrophobic surface residues.
LRP not only needs the sequence, but also the 2&deg; and 3&deg; structure in
order to bind this region:  the 18 kDa RBF is sufficient if it is not denatured.
Tryptic peptides of this region have no binding ability.
<p>
If the denatured FP6 will bind to bA1-40, will it still bind LRP?  Three 
subsequence constructs of FP6 (FP6a, FP6b, FP6c) were made as shown in the table 
above.  The binding studies showed that FP6a could not bind bA1-40, whereas
FP6c did bind but at lower levels than for the longer FP6 sequence.  FP6b
could bind bA1-40 at slightly higher levels than FP6a.  In other studies
with the 18 kDa RBF, fusion proteins FP6d-AA eliminated the LRP-binding sequence
or substantially reduce LRP but eliminating binding to the a2M signaling
receptor (FP6d-AR).  Both of these constructs had bA1-40 binding activity, 
which very likely indicates that sequences involved in bA1-40 and the LRP
binding are distinct with little overlap, although the two Lys residues do
affect binding somewhat.
<p>
To quantify binding, <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> determinations were made by
purifying FP6 and FP6-AA to homogeneity.  Solution binding experiments
which included use of refolding protocols could not get bA1-40 to bind to
either of these fusion constructs.  FP6, FP6d-AA, and FP3 were then immobilized
on PDF after SDS treatment and probed with 100 nM <sup>125</sup>I-bA1-40
with increasing concentrations of unlabeled bA1-40 (nonspecific binding
is any binding seen with a massive concentration [30 &micro;M] of 
unlabeled bA1-40).  Specific binding of FP6 and FP6d-AA was detected, with
<i>K</i><sub>D</sub> of 2.4 and 5.2 &micro;M, respectively.  <i>B</i><sub>max</sub>
was 20-25% higher for FP6 than the mutant sequence, although this parameter
is not informative for this method.  No specific binding of the bA1-40 was
seen wit FP3.
<p>
Reports have been made that a2M-A&beta; complexes are taken in to cells and 
degraded via the LRP receptor activity.  But if bA1-40 binding is overlapping or 
near LRP recognition, and it inhbits LRP binding, then it refutes the hypothesis 
that A&beta; uptake is LRP-mediated.  To determine this, in vivo experiments in 
mice were done to assess plasma clearance of different forms of a2M. 
<sup>125</sup>-&alpha;<sub>2</sub>-MA (20 nM) is incubated with A&beta; peptide 
(20 &micro;M, 1000:1) or with vehicle for 2 h at 37&deg;.  Then 0.3 &micro;Ci is 
injected, in presence of GST-RAP (40-80 &micro;g) into lateral tail veins of 
CD-1 female mice (30 g).  Blood is withdrawn from retro-orbital venous plexus 
(40 &micro;l) using heparinized capillary tubes, at different times between 0.5 
and 30 min.  Then radioactivity is determined in gamma counter.  Results show 
that the clearance is a first-order process with <i>t</i><sub>&frac12;</sub> of 
3-5 min.  Coinjected with unlabeled a2M-MA, there is a reduced clearance of
the radiolabeled material, reflecting competition.  This rapid time profile
is beneficial since in vitro studies might allow for dissociation of the 
A&beta;-a2M-MA, making it a factor.  Coinjection of GST-RAP (40 or 80 &micro;g)
with labeled a2M-MA inhibited clearance, as expected, since RAP competes with
a2M for binding to LRP.  With preincubation of a2M-MA with A&beta; peptides
in 1000:1 excess the rate of labeled a2M-MA clearance was not changed.  
This indicates most likely, considering the possibility that A&beta; could have
dissociated during plasma transit, that LRP could be involved in A&beta; uptake
via activated a2M.
<p>
a2M binding to A&beta; proteins/peptides clearly requires that intact a2M
undergo a conformational change, and that A&beta; binding may not depend
on 2&deg; or 3&deg; structure, but that a short sequence is revealed in which
chemical interaction occurs.  In contrast LRP recognition requires that no
denaturation occurs, that is that 2&deg; and 3&deg; structure are retained, but
that only a fragment (the 18 kDa RBF) is sufficient.  The growth factor
binding area is broadly specific (promiscuous) but was not able to bind
A&beta; peptides.  A&beta; binding activity is confined to the 1314-1365 
region of a2M.
<p>
Why does A&beta; bind to 18 kDa RBF but not the FP6 and its mutagenized products,
if A&beta; bound to them immobilized?  The difference here is denaturation
with SDS.  FP6 may self-associate in a manner that blocks the A&beta;
binding site.

Ion-Pair Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Analysis of 
Oligonucleotides:  Retention Prediction
<p class="Para1">
Single-stranded oligos synthesized for primers are usally 15-35 nt long and the 
chemical synthesis has a yield of 60-80% (higher yields for shorter length). In 
analyzing oligos, size- or charge-based separations will have more of an effect 
for a 10- and 11-mer (10% difference in charge and length) than for oligos
of 100- and 101-mer length, with a 1% difference in charge and length.
Gradient elution reduces separation selectivity although it is traditionally
used; isocratic elution is not common but might be used as part of a step gradient.
It has been assumed in the past that macromolecules are retained or precipitated
at the column inlet until believed to be desorbed into the mobile phase and the
eluted without stationary phase interaction.
<p>
Oligodeoxythymidine molecule mixture [ (dT)<sub>2</sub>, (dT)<sub>4</sub>,
(dT)<sub>8</sub>, (dT)<sub>10</sub>, (dT)<sub>15</sub>, (dT)<sub>30</sub> ]
shows elution in an system of 4.6 &times; 30 mm 2.5 &micro;m XTerra C18, with a
flow of 1 ml/min, <i>T</i> = 60&deg; and a mobile phase of 1:9 MeCN 0.1 M TEAA pH 7,
where the 2- to 15-mer elute inside 2.5 min, and the 30-mer elutes at 12 min.
A plot of ln <i>k&prime;</i> vs percent MeCN with several plot lines for 
(dT)<sub><i>n</i></sub> for <i>n</i> = 2 to 30 reveals the retention behavior
under different (v/v) conditions for MeCN.  The plots show that there is a greater
effect on retention of longer oligos than shorter ones with changes in MeCN content.
The <i>k</i> value changes from 100, 13.5, and 3.2 for changes in mobile phase from
8, 9, and 10% MeCN, respectively.  This shows that isocratic elution for oligo analysis
is not practical since careful optimization for all lengths is required.
<p>
<b>Mass transfer in stationary phase on oligo separation</b>.  The type of sorbent
and particle size may be crucial to oligo separation.   Three C18 columns of 
particle size 2.5, 3.5, and 5 &micro;m were tested using a 2- to 30-mer mixture. 
Shorter nucleotides (15-mer and less) are successfully resolved on all three columns
despite noticeable peak broadening on 3.5 and 5 &micro;m columns compared to 2.5 &micro;m.
For the longer lengths (&gt;25-mer) there is clearly a loss of resolution in a multipeak
envelope at the later retention times (~16 min).  Using a gradient does not correct
the loss of resolution or fix peak broadening.
<p>
For more slowly diffusing molecules it is useful to employ smaller particle size 
columns.  The Van Deemter equation was used to construct an H (height to 
theoretical plate) vs. flow rate (ml/min) for the three different particles, 
with A = 1.5, B = 1, and C = 0.167 as the Van Deemter parameters.  Then plots 
were constructed for benzene (with <i>D</i><sub>m</sub> = 1.25 &times; 
10<sup>&minus;9</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup> at 30&deg;) and for a 
typical oligonucleotide (with <i>D</i><sub>m</sub> = 1.0 &times; 
10<sup>&minus;10</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup> at 30&deg;).  The 
usual Van Deemter plot is a hyperbolic curve with an minimum showing the optimum 
flow rate for the right theoretical plate distance.  But with oligos, no 
hyperbolic curve is seen but rather a positive linear curve with no minimum. 
This indicate mass transfer has a major impact on oligo separation (term 
<i>C</i> in Van Deemter equation).  Small particle size can reduce the impact of 
slow diffusion;  the 2.5 &micro;m clearly shows better performance than the 5 
&micro;m. Morever, the oligo separation benefits from a slow flow rate.   Column 
flow rates of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 ml/min were evaluated and retention time and 
resolution between the 9/10, 15/16, and 29/30-mers were evaluated.  A gradient 
of 0.1% MeCN per ml volume (irrespective of flow rate).  Data shows that 
resolution for any oligo &gt; 25-mer at a high flow rate (2 ml/min) is quite 
poor.  However this can be used for smaller oligos.  Another approach to 
compensating for solutes that have mass transfer problems is to elevate the 
column temperature, which works if the column is stable to high temperature. 
Nonporous RP-HPLC sorbents can also be employed, but these columns have smaller 
loading capacities compared to porous particles (an order of magnitude greater).
<p>
Slower flow rates clearly improve the analysis but increase the time of anlaysis.
To compensate, gradients can be altered.  Gradients of 0.4, 1, and 2% MeCN 
per ml of mobile phase were tested.  While time of analysis was shortened,
separation selectivity was reduced.  The slope of the gradient had greater 
effect on separating the 29- and 30-mer than compared to shorter lengths 
(14- and 15-mers; 9- and 10-mers).  To resolve the 30-mer, a gradient of 
0.25% MeCN per ml mobile phase was required.  The starting mobile phase will
thus be more effective in resolving long lengths while shortening the run time.
The initial concentration of MeCN was tested at 7, 8, and 9% while keeping a 
constant gradient slope.
<p>
Column length was checked as well, keeping the diameter of column (4.6 mm) and 
particle (2.5 &micro;m) constant.  No improvement in resolution was seen for the
longer molecules (14/15-mers, 29/30-mers) in going from 30, 50, 75, and 150 mm
column.  Thus a short column will suffice (a 4.6 &times; 50 mm was considered
standard).
<p>
In past reports, mobile phase composition was MeCN and ammonium acetate, basically
components that do not perform ion-pairing.  Without ion-pairing the hydrophobicity
for retention is the analyte.  But when an ion-pairing agent is present, its
only hydrophobicity becomes the factor, and it allows molecules that are not 
normally hydrophobic (because of high number of charge centers) to become 
hydrophobic.

Genetic Code: Introducing Pyrrolysine
<p class="Para1">
<b>Dispatch</b>.  The functional diversity of proteins derives from three aspects
of structure:  the primary amino acid sequence, PTMs of the sequence, and then
folding of the polypeptide.  The primary amino acid sequence is dictated by the
genetic code of the 20 canonical amino acids.  In some cases the UGA stop is
recoded with a charged tRNA carrying selenocysteine (the 21st amino acid).
It appears that some methanogenic bacteria have recruited the rarely used UGA
amber stop to incorporate pyrrolysine into archaeal methyltransferases in
methane production.  The <i>Methanosarcinaceae</i> are metabolically versatile
among the archaea and able to use R<sub>3</sub>N as a substrate, where R is either
hydrogen H or methyl CH<sub>3</sub> for the full series of amines.
Study of the monomethylamine transferases involved indicate presence of an
in-frame amber codon with sense readthrough, occupied by an amino acid that is
lysine or a derivative.  Close to this methyltransferase gene (<i>mtmB1</i>)
was a tRNA gene (tRNA<sub>CUA</sub>) that translates the UAG amber codon.
There was also class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (PylS), and in vitro assays
showed that PylS attached Lys to tRNA<sub>CUA</sub> in an ATP-dependent manner.
The discovery of such a synthetase is unprecedented.  The crystal structure
solution of the monomethylamine methyltransferase also shows that the
amino acid is not Lys but pyrrolysine, playing a vital role in methylamine
activation.
<p>
There are two possibilities for Pyl to be found in the methyltransferase.
One is that Lys is post-translationally modified.  The other is translational
insertion of a true Pyl-tRNA<sub>CUA</sub> into the synthesizing polypeptide.
The existence of a special tRNA synthetase however suggests that the latter is
the most possible route.
<p>
If Pyl-tRNA<sub>CUA</sub> is presented to the ribosome, then is Pyl attached
by the synthetase to the tRNA, or is Lys-tRNA<sub>CUA</sub> charged and Lys
modified on the tRNA?  It has been shown that Lys is a substrate for the synthetase
and so there is an argument against Pyl itself being free and attached to the
tRNA.  The synthesis of asparaginyl- formylmethionyl-, glutaminyl- and
selenocysteinyl-tRNAs from aminoacyl-tRNA precursors, so there are precedents.
Genes of unknown function <i>pylB</i> and <i>pylC</i> are co-transcribed with
<i>pylS</i> and tRNA<sub>CUA</sub>, and these and another adjacent gene (<i>pylD</i>)
might participate in Pyl-tRNA synthesis.
<p>
The UAG codon serves two functions in these genomes.  It still represents a
stop codon as well as coding for pyrrolysine.  It is known that UGA for selenoCys
also serves as a termination codon, and sense readthrough is achieved by
the use of elongation factors, accessory proteins, and a signal within the mRNA
to form a stem-loop structure.  Such mechanisms might well exist for Pyl.

Both <i>Thermus aquaticus</i> (<i>Taq</i>) and <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> (<i>Tth</i>)
polymerases can reverse transcribe RNA &rarr; cDNA, but not used in RT-PCR
because they produce only short fragments.  Usually AMV and M-MLV are the 
reverse transcriptases of choice.  In general, these enzymes would be limited
to gene expression detection rather than for cloning.  The one-step RT-PCR below
is designed for specificity.  dNTPs are 0.2 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> is 1.5 mM,
primers at 100 nM and an annealing temperature of 55&deg; is used since they
enhance specific amplification.   A buffer of 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.4 with 50 mM KCl
is workable for PCR, often used for primer extension using AMV RTase.
Extension times are long:  60 min for RTase and 10 min + 59 s per cycle for PCR.
Primers and RNA is denatured at 65&deg; for 15 min prior to amplification.
After 60 min at 42&deg; reverse transcription, denaturation of RNA-cDNA hybrids
is done (3 min at 95&deg;).  This amplification included use of primers with 
restriction sites for cloning.
<p>
The primers are usually 32-35 nt long with between 40-60% G+C content.  They
have internal unique restriction sites and 8-9 additional nucleotides complementary
to the 5&prime; end of restriction sites, necessary for good digestion of the 
amplicon.

<ol>
<li>Primers are prepared at 20 ng/&micro;l in sterile distilled water (this is 
approximately 1-2 &micro;M).  This will be diluted 1:20 (2.5 &micro;l to final 
50 &micro;l reaction) for about 50-100 nM primer.  A stock 10&times; PCR buffer 
(10&times;: 500 mM KCl, 100 mM TrisHCl pH 8.4); 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Prepare 
dNTPs as a mix at 2.5 mM per dNTP.  To primer stock add 0.5 U RNA inhibitor 
(e.g., Inhibit-ACE).  To other reagents, add 1 U inhibitor.   Use 0.2 ml thinwall
PCR tubes.
<li>Add the primers to the reaction tube and add water that represents the
balance remaining from 50 &micro;l after subtracting the volumes to be added
for the RNA in next step, and the PCR buffer, dNTPs and enzymes in the following
step.
<li>Total RNA (100 pg to 10 &micro;g) is added to the reaction tube and added to 
thermaly cycler.  Heat at 65&deg; for 15 min then cool to 4&deg;.  Note that if 
the target mRNA is enriched, mere picogram amounts of RNA are sufficient for 
the first strand synthesis.  Up to 10 &micro;g should be used if the target is
low.
<li>Add 6.5 &micro;l 10&times; PCR buffer and 4 &micro;l dNTP mix and 
MgCl<sub>2</sub> to 1.5 mM.  Add 10 U AMV-RTase and 2.5 U DNA polymerase and 
mix.  Pulse spin to get to bottom of tube.
<li>Incubate 42&deg; for 1 h for first strand synthesis.
<li>Now start the PCR by raising temperature to 95&deg; for 3 min.  Perform
30 cycles of 1 min 95&deg;, 2 min 55&deg; for annealing, and then 72&deg;
starting at 10 min and increasing 59 seconds for each successive cycle.
<li>After completion, use from 10-50% (5-25 &micro;l) of the product and add
loading gel buffer to size-fractionate on 10 mg/ml EtBr (1%) on agarose
gel electrophoresis.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Negative controls</b>.  Use two controls that (1) omit the RNA containing target,
and (2) omit the reverse transcriptase.
<p>
If no specific bands are found on the EtBr-stained agarose gel, gradually increase
the RTase enzyme used.  Avoid excess amounts of <i>Taq</i> DNA polymerase since
it lowers the specific RT-PCR target products.  If bands remain not visible, 
transfer to nitrocellulose (or other membrane) for Southern blot.  Hybridize with
probe that has no over with the primers.  If a signal is seen, use nested PCR
to produce bands visible on agarose gel.  The primer pair should be outside
the original primer pair set.  Note that the outside primer pair can be shorter
(22-25 nt).  Use 1-5 &micro;l of the first amplification as template for the second
round.
<p>
Other problems with failure to see bands are the RNA quality.  Control with 
primers to an abundant mRNA (&beta;-actin).  If the positive control is found,
then the sample RNA probably does not contain target template RNA, or primers
do not anneal efficiently to RNA.  Try another primer set.
<p>
<b>Cloning</b>.  The following steps are taken to clone the amplicon:
<ol>
<li>Purify the amplified product using a PCR cleanup or gel cleanup.
<li>Digest with restriciton enzymes stitched into the product.  Use long 
incubation times and high number of units of enzymes:  50 U at the start, and
probably another 20 U later.
<li>Use a PCR cleanup step again to remove enzyme(s).  Precipitate the digested
duplex by adding 0.05 volume 4 M NaCl and 2 vol cold absolute EtOH.  Let it
remain overnight at &minus;20&deg; (or 30 min at &minus;80&deg;).  Spin in 
4&deg; microcentrifuge 20 min.  Add 1 ml 70% EtOH to pellet and re-spin.
Take up the pellet in 20 &micro;l sterile water.
<li>The vector should be digested with enzymes for 2-3 h using 10 U per 
&micro;g DNA.  If only a single restriction enzyme is used in insertion, 
dephosphorylate the DNA.  Again purify, precipitate and resuspend the DNA in
water as for the target DNA.
<li>Ligation will be set up at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 molar ratios for insert
and vector.  Add sterile water to final 8 &micro;l volume, heat at 45&deg; for
5 min, then cool to 16&deg;.  Add 1 &micro;l 10 &times; ligation buffer and 
1 &micro;l T4 DNA ligase (5 U/&micro;l).  Allow the ligation to occur overnight.
</ol>
<p>
Perform transformation into competent cells.  Positive clones and analyze
using restriction enzymes with agarose gel electrophoresis.  Some clones should
be verified using sequencing.

Effect of Copy Number on the Expression Levels of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen in 
the Methylotrophic Yeast <i>Pichia pastoris</i>
<p class="Para1">
The pAO815 vector is for expression of coding inserts within the <i>Pichia 
pastoris</i> host.  The 7709 bp vector contains a <i>HIS4</i> ORF complement (nt 
4199-1665) to enable selection by histidine auxotrophy, an ampicillin resistance 
(nt 7399-6539) and pBR322-derived ColE1 origin (nt 6394-5740) of replication so 
that clones can be shuttled and maintained and selected in bacteria, a 5&prime; 
AOX1 promoter element (nt 1-940), a 20-base 5&prime; <i>AOX1</i> primer site
(nt 855-875), a 3&prime; <i>AOX</i> transcription terminator site (nt 950-1277).
There is also a fragment from the 3&prime; <i>AOX1</i> gene (nt 4554-5310).
A unique <i>Eco</i>RI site (nt 943-948) is used to insert the coding construct
of interest just above the 5&prime; <i>AOX1</i> promoter and the 3&prime; <i>AOX</i>
TT.  Two <i>Bgl</i>II sites make two fragments:  one containing insert plus
promoter plus the <i>HIS4</i> gene, the other removing the bacterial elements
and the 3&prime; <i>AOX1</i> region is useful for stable integration/recombination
into the yeast chromosome.
<p>
A 719 bp fragment containing the HBsAg S form was inserted to make a 8428 bp
plamsid pAO815+HBsAg using the <i>Eco</i>RI site.  The product was digested
with <i>Bgl</i>II and <i>Bam</i>HI which produces a 1995 bp fragment containing
the 5&prime;<i>AOX1</i> promoter, insert, and 3&prime;<i>AOX</i>TT.  Mixing
fragment with a <i>Bam</i>HI-digested pAO815+HBsAg creates a head-to-tail tandem
two-copy replicated.  Repeated double digest and fragment purification and 
insertion into pAO815+xc.HBsAg where x represents copy number creates a multiple
head-to-tail tandem copy.  All cloning is done in <i>E coli</i> DH5&alpha;.
Copy numbers greater than 8 could not be made because of plasmid instability
in the host.
<p>
Final plasmids are transformed into <i>P pastoris</i> GS115 with is a His auxotroph.
It also has working <i>AOX1</i> gene so can metabolize MeOH (Mut<sup>+</sup>
phenotype).  If the gene were inactivated it would metabolize MeOH less 
efficiently through the <i>AOX2</i> gene (Mut<sup>S</sup> phenotype).  A
transplacement strategy is used in which <i>AOX1</i> coding sequence is removed from 
genome and the plasmid is integrated into the genome:  with <i>Bgl</i>II digestion
creates sequences within the 5&prime; <i>AOX1</i> and 3&prime; <i>AOX1</i> on 
the plasmid.  This fragment can be targeted to the <i>AOX1</i> locus on the
chromosome with a double recombination event and loss of the wild type <i>AOX1</i>
gene.  Since the fragment contains <i>HIS4</i>, auxtrophy is lost and the 
Mut<sup>S</sup> phenotype occurs with loss of <i>AOX1</i> gene.  Transformants
can be grown on histidine-deficient minimal plates.  PCR can be used to show
whether integration occurred.
<p>
Several clones containing different HBsAg copy numbers were checked for 
expression. Multimer formation depends on ligating the <i>Bam</i>HI overhang 
with the <i>Bgl</i>II overhang of another, in the process causing both sites to 
be destroyed.  Radioactive Southern analysis confirms each step in the 
multimerization process.
<p>
The next step was Northern hybridization: total RNA is prepared and 50 &micro;g
run for several lanes with different copy numbers; this is run on 1.2% 
agarose with 6% formaldehyde and probed with radiolabel fragment.  A ~700 bp
band is observed with increasing intensity. Densitometry of the autoradiograph
was done for each lane, and while total RNA was constant, the radiolable 
intensifies.
<p>
Protein level expression in <i>Pichia</i> varying with copy number was tested 
after MeOH induction; extraction is done 8 h postinduction.  An anti-HBs 
antibody was used in a quantitative western blot.  The total HBsAg goes up with 
the HBsAg per expression caseette stays constant.  The change in mRNA and total and
soluble protein levels were evaluated (the soluble protein was estimated by
quantitative particle-specific ELISA).  Total protein increases at a greater
rate than soluble protein:  this is attributable to incomplete lysis (seen on
light microscopy) although before glass bead lysis zymolase is used in 
pretreament.  In addition, unoptimized extraction conditions and membrane association
of HBsAg appear to be factors.  As copy number increases, so does membrane 
association.  Putting in 4 copies increases total rHBsAg by 10-fold, and 8 copies
increases by 18-fold.  However, the mRNA increases by a fold value equal to the
copy number.
<p>
Accumulating HBsAg causes a multihomomeric assembly into 20-22 nm particulate 
structure.  An ELISA with a particle-specific antibody was used to determine 
just how rapid particle formation occurs in the host: soluble cell extracts were 
obtained several hours post-MeOH induction.  It is clear that particle amounts 
double between 4 and 12 hours after induction.  Transformants with single copy 
and the 8-copy form were induced and extracts fractionated on CsCl gradient. 
Fractions from bottom to top were analyzed using the particle ELISA and 
fraction 2 close the the bottom showed the strong signal, showing the position 
of the HBsAg particle.  Analysis of all fractions in a western blot probed with 
a mAb recognizing monomeric HBsAg forms showed no band at all.  Electron 
microscopy of fraction 2 showed classic 20- to 22-nm particles.  Thus the 
expression is in particulate form no matter what the copy number.
<p>
The time for peak product concentration is quite long, from 150-200 h because
of the Mut<sup>S</sup> phenotype.  Does the HBsAg construct remain stably 
integrated?  Routine growth was done followed by MeOH induction for 6 d.
To determine stability, a sample is taken are various intervals and examined
by Southern hybridization using genomic DNA.  A 16 kb fragment is observed
for the 8-copy clone.  What about other changes?  At the end of 6 d, a sample
is smeare on agar plate to grow single colonies.  10 colonies are induced
and a western blot done and compared to original clone.  All clones show
protein level increases consistent with their copy number.

Development of the diagnostic immunoassay to detect anti-PreS1(21-47aa) 
antibody&mdash;a marker suggesting the health improvement of hepatitis B patients
<p class="Para1">
The N-terminal 21-47 residues of PreS1 region of the HBV adr subtype was
amplified from pADR-1 using primers incorporating Bgl and BamH enzymes in the
foward and reverse parts.  Plasmid pUCBB (derived from pUC119 plasmid and
pUC19BC) is digested with these enzymes along with PCR products and these
ligated to form plasmid pUCSI, which is a cloning form.  Plasmid pGEX-3X containing <i>lacI</i>
and a GST tag with BamH, SmaI, and EcoR multiple cloning site.  A Bgl-EcoR
fragment is cut from pUCS (fragment contains BamH site) and ligated to 
the BamH EcoR digest of pGEX-3X double digest, which is now pGEXSI.  This
plasmid is developed and extracted and then a BamH and EcoR digest is done
to form a tandom repeat of the preS1(21-47aa) insertion, plasmid pGEXSII.
This construction process is repeated several times to produce tandem repeats.
Plasmids pGEXSI and pGEXSII are transformed into several strains of E coli:
DH5&alpha;, TG1, JM109, BL21(DE3) and SDS-PAGE used to analyze.  Strain TG1 
was found to express the best.  Variables of IPTG concentration, induction

completed the pET-28a-preS1 5.7 kb plasmid with double-end His6 tag.
Plasmid was transformed into BL21 cells.  15% SDS-PAGE shows that recombiant

Western blotting with a mAb shows it is reactive.  The recombinant was purifiable

New Methods for The Detection of HIV
<p class="Para1">
Serology for HIV-1 and -2 using ELISA and western blot are primary methods of 
HIV infection detection.  ELISA tests have specificity and sensitivity &gt; 99%. 
Antibody is detected is usually possible in 6-8 weeks after infection, nearly 
all tests positive within 6 months, but longer seroconversion has been noted. 
Serological testing can be falsely negative in infected states not yet 
seroconverted.  The ELISA is used usually in screening and diagnosis of HIV-1 
and -2.  Rather than whole virus lysates, recombinant antigens are available and 
3rd gen assays (double-antigen sandwich) have improved sensitivity and 
specificity.  HIV-2 detection difficulties have been alleviated: these are 
mostly limited to W. Africa and S. America, but some isolates in N. America are 
detected.  Gene heterogeneity limits cross reactivity of HIV-2 and HIV-1, but 
combined ELISAs with western HIV-2 confirmation is the suggested CDC/FDA 
algorithm.  Addition of HIV-1 subtype O antigens to ELISA help improve detection 
of this uncommon HIV-1 subtype. False positive ELISA results fall into weakly or 
moderately reactive and usually transient, confirmed negative on westerns; these 
false positive results are usually human or technical error, cross-reacting 
antibodies, and confounding medical conditions. Cross-reacting Abs have been 
eliminated because of use of recombinant or synthetic HIV peptides (some 
cross-reaction may still occur).  False positives may also occur with those on 
HIV vaccine trials.  False negatives also occur for a variety of reasons, and in 
persons in high risk groups, consider that seroconversion has not yet taken 
place.
<p>
For positive ELISA results, confirmatory testing is by western analysis. 
SDS-PAGE of HIV proteins to nitrocellulose blots with incubation in patient 
serum is done. HIV proteins used include p24, gp41, gp120-gp160, and reaction to 
any two of these is considered a positive western.  Tests with one band or any 
other combination of bands that do not meet the criteria should be marked 
<i>indeterminate</i>.  Sensitivity and specificity of the westerns range from 
96-100%.  The HIV-1 serogroup O can give false negatives because the viral 
proteins are different.  Patients with hyperbilirubinemia, antibodies to HLA, 
HIV-2, connective tissue disorders, and polyclonal gammopathies can also give 
false positives.  10-20% of western results from positive ELISA results are 
persistently indeterminate.  It might be false positivity bue could be HIV-1 
infection before seroconversion is complete.  Testing later is warranted if the 
patient is in a high risk group; if reactive bands do not occur later, then 
patient is assessed as not infected.
<p>
Because turnover of results takes several days in the routine case, rapid HIV-1 
tests have been developed.  These are in situations such as public clinics and 
emergency rooms where patients do not return for results.  FDA has approved only 
one rapid Ab test, the Single Use Diagnostic System (Abbott Murex).  Rapid assays
use blood plasma for ELISA or latex agglutination assays and complete in 10 min.
For Abbott SUDS sensitivity is 100% and specificity 99.5%, with PPV = 99% and
NPV = 100%.  Improper specimen handling or tests on patients with indeterminate
westerns can have reduced specificity.  All positive tests should be confirmed 
with standard antibody tests.  Generally the SUDS should not be used for 
screening of general population.
<p>
Home sample collection kits exist so that HIV-1 testing occurs confidentially
and/or conveniently.  Home Access (from Home Access Health Corp) is FDA-approved
which is OTC and mail order.  Patient provides blood by lancet on to test card
and mails card.  An ELISA and IFA are done on dried blood sample.  For positive
or indeterminate results, calls are transferred to counselor.  Sensitivity
and specificity is about 100%.  There are home use kits where patient evaluates
on results, but because of lack of accuracy, these are not FDA-approved.
<p>
<b>Non-serum-based antibody testing</b>.  Orasure (Epitope Inc) is FDA-approved
for HIV-1 Ab testing of oral fluids.  A cotton pad is placed between cheek and
gum for 2-5 min which is hypertonic and stimulates transudation of oral mucosa.
It specifically looks for HIV-1 IgG.  The pad is sent to Orasure laboratory where
ELISA and wester are done.  The test was had 98-100% sensitivity and 99-100%
specificity.  This has PPV = 100% and NPV = 99.97%.  The condition of the oral
cavity is also not the factor in the test.  The Sentinel HIV-1 Urine EIA
(Calpyte Biomed Corp) is FDA-approved for urine based testing with 98.73%
sensitivity and is IgG capture EIA.  In addition, a western blot for confirming
positive urine is described.  An ELISA for HIV-1 and -2 using vaginal secretions
has been described (not FDA-approved).
<p>
The <i>gag</i> gene encodes p24 core protein which is rapidly expressed in 
HIV-1 infection with the antibody also quickly forming and detectable in serum,
plasma, and CSF.  The antigen capture technique is used to detect the p24:
serum is added to plated or anti-p24 Ab-coated beads to capture antigen; 
enzyme-linked anti-HIV-1 IgG is then incubated and then colorimetry done.
The assay includes a dissociation step to remove antibody to p24 present
as immune complex present in the serum, thus improving sensitivity.  The p24
Ag test is prognostic as its level determines active HIV-1 viral presence
(used before development of viral RNA in plasma qPCR assays);  it also helps
to assess effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies.
<p>
HIV-1 can be cultured using uninfected donor PBMCs, and virus present in
plasma, serum, PMBCs, CSF, saliva, semen, cervical secretions and breast milk
can be tested.  IL-2 must be present to activate and stimulate cell growth.
Virions from culture supernatant can be assessed with reverse transcriptase or
p24 Ag assays.  Most cultures are positive within 21 days of infection and
sensitivity is 97% and specificity is 100% when HIV-1 seropositive patients
are used.  There is little need for culture though in everyday clinical testing
and it is used mainly for research including clinical trials.
<p>
The normal biology of HIV-1 is for infection to occur with release of RNA and 
its reverse transcription to a cDNA.  The linear form integrates into hoste 
genome and is a proviral form.  From this new virions are produced by 
transcription and translation, and both RNA genome is released into plasma. 
Tests to detect cDNA or RNA genome are available:  they are mostly used for 
prognostic and therapeutic markers, but also diagnostic as well. PCR for 
proviral form using primers to amplify highly conserved HIV-1 <i>gag</i> gene, 
which then hybridizes to enzyme-linked DNA probe for colorimetric detection: it 
has a sensitivity of &gt; 95% and specificity &gt; 98%. The PCR test is quite 
effective for HIV-1 subtype B (most common in N. America). However it is not 
recommended for routine screening because of inaccuracies with non-B subtypes. 
The plasma RNA PCR test is quite quantitative (viral load test) and is used to 
assess successful management of HIV-1.  This test has shown that viremia can be 
high irrespective of the clinical stage of patient.  Studies have shown also 
that plasma viral load is directly correlated to risk of progression to AIDs and 
death from HIV-1.  It predicts decline of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (the T 
lymphocyte count test is itself inferior in predicting disease progression, 
although combining the results of plasma RNA test and CTL counts is prognostic. 
Development of dual and triple antiretroviral therapies was based on their 
ability to reduce plasma RNA viral counts.
<p>
Three methods to assess plasma HIV-1 RNA are commercially available:
<ol>
<li>branched DNA (bDNA) assay
<li>nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) technique
<li>RT-PCR
</ol>
<p>
In the RT-PCR a reverse transcriptase is added with primer to generate cDNA and 
a <i>gag</i> segment is amplified, with a DNA probe that is enzyme-linked. In 
addition a competitive RNA template with known copy number is added and ratio of 
signal compared with known standard. In the bDNA assays, plasma is added to 
microplate with covalently attached DNA probes to bind to viral RNA.  After 
washing, probes to <i>pol</i> or <i>gag</i> for additional hybridization. 
Alkaline phosphatase is added to generate a chemiluminscent reaction in presence 
of substrate and compared to an RNA standard in sample.  Note that bDNA is based 
on amplifying signal and not target nucleic acid. NASBA assay adds RNA 
transcriptases to amplify HIV-1 RNA as RNA, and then the RNA is extracted and 
quantitated.  These tests are optimized mainly for HIV-1 subtype B, and no
HIV-2 RNA viral load tests are available commercially, and these tests are
not usually effective for quantiting A, C, D, or E strains of HIV-1.  The bDNA
assay may be the best approach for non-B subtype assays but should use special
probes for these types.  Sensitivity and specificity of these three assay types
is generally equivalent when viremia is moderate to high, but there may be much
variability when near level of detection.  Only the RT-PCR is FDA approved
to monitor therapy and prognosis.  As to absolute quantitation the RT-PCR results
are two-fold higher than bDNA, so if time-based monitoring is done.
<p>
Some studies show gender differences in viral load at seroconversion in which
women have lower viral loads, although some studies claim there are no differences.
And even where differences occurred at seroconversion, over time it evened out.
<p>
Often differences in numbers are attributable to assay methodology.  Use of 
heparin plasma shows lower numbers than EDTA plasma.  Even differences in the time
to processing can result in differences.  Vaccinations against tetanus, pneumococcus,
and influenza cause moderate but transient increases in HIV-1 RNA levels; this may
be related to the vaccination process causing activation of immune cells, which
has effects on HIV-1 expression and replication.  Indeed any infectious disease
process whether bacterial, viral, or fungal, can cause increases in HIV-1 viral
load.  Processes that affect lymphocyte activity and regulation by cytokines can
also affect viral load:  for example ovulation in women.  Generally two or more
serial viral load tests should be done before deciding on anti-retroviral therapeutic
regimes.  As to anti-retroviral therapy, the U.S. HHS Dept and International AIDS
Society recommend that before initialization a baseline of plasma viral load
and CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte counts must be determined.  DHHS lists threshold
values (based on assay type) used, and these differ from the guidelines of the IAS.
The goal of therapy must be to use treatments that reduce plasma viral load to below
the detection threahold.  RT-PCR and bDNA can detect plasma HIV-1 RNA as low as
50 copies/ml plasma.  Effective therapy reduces counts by 10- to 100-fold within
4-8 weeks, and undetectability should be reached within 4-6 months.  Viral loads
of 100,000/ml have poor prognosis.  Testing during therapy should be monthly until
the viral load goal is reached, and then testing every 2-3 months thereafter to
check maintenance.
<p>
With acute infection antibodies are usually not detectable and so the rapid methods
for establishing infection are to assess p24 Ag or HIV-1 DNA in plasma or in PBMCs,
or plasma HIV-1 RNA directly.  The p24 level can be high at first but decline 
after 1-2 weeks.  The p24 assay has 89% sensitivity during acute HIV infection and
a specificity of 100%.  HIV-1 RNA is likely more sensitive:  many studies show a
viral load of &gt; 50,000 copies/ml during acute phase, and often greater than
100,000/ml.  This assay shows a 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity.  False
positives can occur with &lt; 5000 copies/ml and lead to misdiagnosis.
<p>
For infants ELISA and western blot testing are not useful in early infancy since
maternal antibodies are present for the first full year of life.  Tests to show
the presence of viral antigens, RNA or DNA are the better choice.  Viral culture
is also an alternative.  Early detection is essential for potentially successful
eradication or maintenance of infant health.  Studies of p24 testing show poor
sensitivity (20%) for infants younger than 1 month and high false positives also
make specificity poor too, and so it is not a diagnostic.  However, detection
in neonates is prognostic in that early and severe HIV-1-related disease occurs.
Current diagnostic standards are PCR-based viral DNA, or viral culture, with
testing done at birth, at 1 or 2 months, and then at 3 to 6 months.  Umbilical
cord blood should not be tested, and positive results should be re-tested with
new blood collection.  Viral culture is a gold standard for neonates but is
labor-intensive, requires specialized lab, and takes 2-4 weeks for results.
Sensitivity is quite low and variable at early age but improves by 6 months.
PCR testing of proviral DNA is superior although sensitivity below 3 months
is not known.  It is 90% after 3 months, but as low as 50% at 1 month age.
Another analysis found low sensitivity at day 1 or 2 (38%) of birth, but climbing
to 93% in the second week of life.  Detection of plasma RNA may be the best
but is being subjected to clinical trials now:  comparison of NASBA to the HIV-1
DNA PCR test found that NASBA had better or equal sensitivity.

Rapid and Specific Detection of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> from
Acid-Fast Bacillus Smear-Positive Respiratory Specimens and BacT/ALERT MP
Culture Bottles by Using Fluorogenic Probes and Real-Time PCR
<p class="Para1">
Resurgence in TB due to AIDS epidemic.  Current detection of mycobacteria:
smears stained by Ziehl-Neelsen or auramine fluorescence;  selective culture
techniques.  Acid-fast bacilli stain lacks specificity.  Nucleic acid amplification
methods are labor intensive and have high specificity but variable sensitivity.
Potential for lots of error as multiple steps in processiing are required.
qPCR available for HSV, VZV, CMV, <i>Legionalla</i>, pathogenic <i>E coli</i>,
<i>S. aureus</i>, <i>M bovis</i>.  Genes identifying drug-resistant <i>H pylori</i>,
HBV, <i>S aureus</i> and <i>M tuberculosis</i> available for PCR.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>. Respiratory specimens processed using <i>N-acetylcysteine</i>
in 2.5% NaOH; centrifuged. Pellet inoculates 7H11 agar plate + MP culture 
bottle (supplemented); also two smears stained auramine fluorochrome, scored 
according to counts of forms seen on 5-point scale. MP culture put in 5% CO<sub>
 2</sub> 35&deg; incubator for 6 weeks using BacT/ALERT 3D instrument: if 
growth, a smear is done and subculture of blood agar and 7H11 plate started. 
Accuprobe materials used as DNA probes to confirm multi-species panel of <i> 
Mycobacterium</i> genus. For PCR, Roche sputum prep kit used; rest of lysates 
frozen at &minus;20&deg; for qPCR. An AMPLICOR <i>M tuberculosis</i> test 
(Roche Diag) was processed per instructions on AFB-smear positive specimens, in 
biosafe cabinet: 50 &micro;l lysate is used in 100 &micro;l total reaction 
volume. Primers Sp1 (5&prime;-ACCTCCTTTCTAAGGAGCACC-3&prime;) and Sp2 (5&prime;
-GATGCTCGCAACCACTATCCA-3&prime;) were used to amplify ~220 bp fragment of ITS 
sequence (EMBL #L15623) from <i>M tuberculosis</i>. Detection was with either 
SYBR Green I or specific fluorescent probes (see Kraus et al, Mol Cell Probes 
15: 375, 2001). The 3&prime;-end of the 5&prime; anchor probe is labeled with 
FAM, 5&prime;-GTGGGGCGTAGGCCGTGAGGGGTTC-FAM-3&prime; (desig 4602) and the 
3&prime; detection probe (desig 4600) is
5&prime;-LC640-GTCTGTAGTGGGCGAGAGCCGGGTGC-*-3&prime; which hybridizes
3 bp downstream of the anchor probe. The 3&prime; detection probe has
phosphate (*) so that it does not extend and amplify with 3&prime; Sp2 primer.
The PCR has 10 &micro;l total and 2 &micro;l is template sample.  Program
is 30 s 95&deg; denaturation followed by touchdown PCR which is 0 s at 95&deg;,
15 s at 61&deg;, 30 s at 72&deg; for 5 cycles; 95&deg; for 0 s, 15 s at 60&deg;,
and 30 s at 72 degs for 5 cycles; 0 s at 95&deg; 15 s at 59&deg;, and 30 s at 72&deg;
for 5 cycles;  and then 95&deg; for 0 s, 59&deg; for 5 s, and 30 s at 72&deg; for
35 cycles.  It takes 40-45 min for 32 samples.
<p>
<b>Results</b>. 135 smears were AFB-positive.  105 of these grew MTB.  Of these
103 were positive on light cycler and AMPLICOR PCR.  Two AMPLICOR-negative
samplers were positive on qPCR: these had rare and moderate numbers on AFB-smear.
30 AFB-smear positive specimens grew other mycobacteria and all were negative
on qPCR and AMPLICOR.  qPCR sensitivity on AFB smear-positive is 98.1% and
specificity is 100%.  C<sub>T</sub> values for 4+, 3+, 2+, and 1+ scored smears
averaged 28.4, 30.4, 32.4, and 36.0 cycles, resp.
<p>
231 MP cultures from respiratory specimens from 188 patients were produced.
114 were positive by qPCR and all were culture positive for MTB: these were from
41 patients.  117 cultures were qPCR-negative.  Negatives were amplified with
SYBR Green I.  Melt curve analysis showed presence of ITS amplification.  qPCR
was 100% for both sensitivity and specificity.

Genomic DNA standards for gene expression proÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®ling in <i>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</i>
<p class="Para1">
Microarray analysis (oligo and spotted) has various trouble points, factors
including spotting efficiency, sample labeling efficiency, transcript
representation, and hybridization reproducibility, made more difficult by analysis
of mixed RNA samples from infected tissues.  Microarrays are in situ/pre-synthesized
oligonucleotides or spotted cDNA being all or portion of expressed genes in organism
arrayed on chemically treated glass slides or other solid surface.  Transcripts
from different expression samples (states) are labeled with one of two dyes
and pair-wise comparisons made of relative changes in gene expression, co-hybridized
on to the arrays.  Normalization is required for the pairwise comparisons.
One is by RNA normalization using sample of tissue at known or reference
expression state (phenotype), or by using RNA samples grouped from different
tissues or time points of expression.  The problem is that only genes with
hybridization signals from both samples can be used to generate relative
expression levels.  Signals from only one RNA sample are discarded.  Among the
other problems, this can be solved by preparing cDNA from total RNA and then
normalizing cDNA signals to those generated from genomic DNA (gDNA).
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>.  Microarrays were made using oligonucleotides determined for
selecting unique 70-mers for each open reading frame predicted in a published
sequence of MTB strain H37Rv and having optimized melting temp of 79 &plusmn;
5 &deg;.  Oligos at 40 &micro;M in 3&times; SSC were spotted to poly-L-Lys-coated
glass slides with spot size of 150-200 &micro;m dia.  The the H37Rv strain is
grown in log and stationary phase in 7H9 medium + 10% OADC at 37&deg;, harvested
at 14, 28, and 50 d.  Total RNA is extracted in TRI reagent with 0.1 mm
silica/zirconium bead with Mini-Beadbeater (BioSpec).  RNA pellets washed with
75% EtOH, air dried, resuspend in 50 &micro;l water + DEPC.  7 &micro;g are labeled
using Stratagene FairPlay labeling kit and Amersham-Pharmacia Cy3 and Cy5 kit.
The MTB cDNA was labeled with minimal set of 37 genome-directed primers at
250 ng/&micro;l designed to prime ORFs in the MTB genome.  For genomic DNA
labeling, nick translation was done to make randomly labeled DNA fragments
(2 &micro;g DNA ~500 bp long) using Cy5.  A 2nd method is to label with
<i>Taq</i> polymerase with the genome-directed primer in reaction containing
Cy3-dCTP for 15 cycles of 94&deg; 1 min, 45&deg; 1 min and 72&deg; 2 min.
And a 3rd method for gDNA labeling is using Klenow fragment and random primers
or genome directed primers with a previously reported method (see citation).
Microarray hybridization is done with equal volumes of Cy3- ad Cy5-labeled
material in 4&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS on the glass slides at 67&deg; overnight.
Slides are washed 5 min room temp in 1&times; SSC/ 0.1% SDS, then 5 min in
0.1&times; SSC.  They are then dried in centrifuge at 1000 rpm 5 min.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  For the three different methods of labeling gDNA, each method
was done twice and pairwise hybridization was done with gDNA labeled with Cy3
by Klenow or <i>Taq</i> against gDNA labeled with Cy5 using nick-translation.
Nick translation proved superior in both signal intensity and count of spots
detected.  This was so even when Klenow was used with genome-directed primers
instead of random primers.  In the expression experiments Cy5-gDNA by nick
translation was done with Cy3-labeled cDNA from the different RNA samples.
A series of experiments with the cDNA from total RNA and gDNA itself permitted
a determination of how much gDNA to use in co-hybridization with samples:
it was 0.5 &micro;g of the nick-translated labeled form.
<p>
For expression data normalization, ratios of the log and stationary phase cDNAs
were estimated after dividing primary ratios of log phase samples relative to
gDNA to the primary ratio of stationary phase relative to gDNA.  When RNA
normalization is done, log phase RNA is the control (Cy3) and stationary phase
RNA is the test (Cy5), and then a color-switch is done to ensure a control.
Results show that % gene expression (to the total coded genome) varied by the
normalization protocol used, and was highest (98%) when genomic normalization
was used.  If RNA normalization is used, only 67% of potential expression is
observed in color-switched experiments.  Also there is a low correlation
(<i>r</i> = 0.25) between fold-changes calculated from color-switching
experiments.
<p>
For detecting significant changs in expression between transcriptomes, a
<i>t</i>-test approach is used.  For the 98% of total genes shown to have
detectable expression level changes using genomic normalization, 207 genes
(5.2%) showed significant changes between log and stationary phases.  IF RNA
normalization is used, only 3% of genes show significant changes.  30 genes
were found in both groups detected by the gDNA or RNA normalization procedure,
and 21 genes were found by both in the significant difference analysis.
<p>
As a check on the microarray results, qPCR was done on select genes.  Generally
amplification-based methods give higher estimates of gene expression, but for
~90% (28 in 31) there was agreement between expression fold-change whether by
genomic normalization or real time PCR.  The agreement dropped to 29% and 68%
if stationary or logarithmic RNA samples were normalizers, respectively.  Genes
known to be highly regulated in log and stationary phases (<i>hspX, fdhF,
glcB, ppdK</i>) were correctly found by genomic normalization but not by RNA
normalization.

Development of the diagnostic immunoassay to detect anti-PreS1(21-47aa) 
antibody&mdash;a marker suggesting the health improvement of hepatitis B patients
<p class="Para1">
Molecular testing for viral load is a more expensive, technically demanding test 
requiring specialized equipment compared to a p24 Ag test.  Viral pathogenesis 
involve viral proteins compared to viral RNA as a mediator of disease. Detection 
of p24 was a stronger predictor of progression to AIDS compared to testing for 
HIV-1 RNA levels.  But in fact there is a close correlation between p24 and 
HIV-1 RNA levels.  HIV-1 RNA is unspliced and p24 is coded directly from it. 
The protein precursors Pr160<sup>gag-pol</sup> and Pr55<sup>gag</sup> contain 
p24, produced from proteolytic processing.  The p9 nucleocapsid protein also is 
contained, so there is stoichiometric correlation.  Each virion has between 
2000-4000 copies of p24.  It also exists freely outside the infected cell or 
virion in soluble form in plasma (checked using ultracentrifuge). It is also 
found in immune complexes or in subviral particles.
<p>
A capture ELISA using anti-p24 pAb or mAb coated to wells or solid support is 
used.  This also requires use of an enzyme-bound (HRP/AP) anti-p24.  To verify a 
positive result, sample is subjected to confirmatory neutralization in which it 
is pre-incubated with capture and tracer antibodies, and this preincubation is 
then assayed, with an expected negative result.  One problem with the assay is a 
false negative due to p24 being present but already present as immune complexes, 
which is a similar situation to the confirmatory neutralization test.  This
often occurs in the early course of HIV infection.  Western blots can show the
p24 antigen signal, but the ELISA cannot.  Another difficulty are false
positives which are the result rheumatoid factor-like antibodies.  It is the
case too that the ELISA test has a lower sensitivity than the more demanding
PCR-based test.
<p>
To deal with the immune complex problem, the sample might be subjected to
pH extremes in order to release the immune complex.  But this too was complicated
with false positivity from Rh factor-antibodies producing false positives, and
also that samples can lead to immune complex formation during pH neutralization.
Other strategies tried include heat denaturation (boiling for 5 min), which
does not appear to affect p24 detection; verified by mixing anti-p24 Ab with 
p24 as well as using patient samples.  Specificity is 96.9% with heat-denaturation
screening and 100% using confirmatory neutralization.  Sensitivity among
infect children showed detection limit of 2 pg/ml at 96%, compared to 47.7%
using non-heat denatured sample (76% when neutralizable).  Note that PCR
of HIV-1 DNA is 96% sensitive and 77% for viral culture.  HIV-infected neonates
with high viral RNA at birth and primary viremia show early onset of AIDS
with rapid disease progression and death.
<p>
Mothers of neonates who are infected do not show sufficient sensitivity to
the p24 test:  it is only 22% sensitive.  To improve sensitivity, an amplifying
biotin-tyramide is used.  In the antigen sandwich test below detection level,
HRP enzyme activate the tyramide in biotin-tyramide which become reactive with
any tyrosine residues present on any protein.  Thus multiple biotin-tyramide
molecules bind to the well if HRP was present.  Later, strepavidin-HRP is added
and washed, and then the substrate.  This amplifies the reaction.  Serum and
plasma samples from 245 HIV-1 infected individuals showed (1) that plasma has
more p24 than serum.  Sensitivity is greatly improved by use of plasma, 
heat denaturation, and the biotin-tyramide amplification.   Both kinetic and
endpoint monitoring of ELISA absorbance signal are advantageous.  Range was
from 0.5 to 6000 pg/ml.
<p>
In a prospective study with p24, HIV-1 DNA and RNA, 232 samples from 61 HIV-1
infected untreated children born to HIV-positive mothers in Switzerland were
studied.  After 10 days of age all tests are 100% positive;  6 of 12 samples
were positive in neonates under 10 d old.  A commercial PCR for DNA and an
in-house PCR for RNA were negative for one p24-positive sample; this sample
was also negative for an ultrasensitive HIV-1 Monitor version 1.5 assay (detection
limit of 50 copies/ml).  Specificity of the p24 assay for 643 plasma samples
from 246 uninfected children born to HIV-1-positive mothers was 99.2% after 
neutralization.  Two of 141 samples (1.4%) tested with RNA PCR (in-house) were
falsely positive (specificity 98.6%).
<p>
p24 Ag as a predictor of disease progression was tested.  169 chronically 
infected Swiss adult with median CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte (CTL) counts of 
140 per &micro;l (range 0-1500) were tested for p24 and HIV-1 RNA from sample 
collected in 1993-4.  Followup testing included a CTL determination and clinical 
staging, with median observation period 2.7 y (0.1 to 4.9 y). CD4-adjusted Cox 
proportional hazard models show RNA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005 and p24 (<i>p</i> = 
0.043) are significant predictors of AIDS progression but that p24 is superior
to RNA in predicting survival (<i>p</i> = 0.032 vs <i>p</i> = 0.19, n.s.).  This 
prognostic value for p24 was confirmed in another study in which first-sample 
from 494 mostly black IV drug users in Baltimore had median initial CTL of 518 
per &micro;l, and 90 (18%) of patients progressed to having AIDS inside 5 years. 
p24 changes were correlated to both HIV-1 RNA (<i>r</i> = 0.55, <i>p</i> &lt; 
0.0001) and CTL (<i>r</i> = &minus;0.34, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).  When p24 &gt; 5 
pg/ml it was a better disease predictor than cutoffs for CTL (&lt; 350 / 
mm<sup>3</sup>) and HIV-1 RNA (&gt; 30,000 copies/ml).
<p>
Anti-retroviral therapy was tested against p24 in a study of 23 adults with 
advanced disease receiving indinavir.  p24 was as sensitive as RNA.  The levels 
of p24 and RNA in 79 samples positive for both markers was <i>r</i> = 0.714 
(<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).  The correlation was similar for RNA tests (Amplicor 
HIV-1 Monitor and NucliSens HIV-1 RNA Quantitative Test).  Treatment was generally
found to show wide variations in RNA levels in the same patient, but p24 levels
showed less variation.  In tests with non-subtype B samples, p24 was able to 
cross react sensitively along with PCR-based tests.  Subtypes A through F could
be sensed by p24 assay, although the sequence variation requires study.
<p>
Samples from 10 years earlier from 547 patients were assayed for p24 and RNA.
Much of the RNA had degraded however, and so the study was narrowed to p24.
92.5% of samples had p24 above the cutoff, and the concentration distribution
was the same as the initial assay.  There is a strong indication that p24
is so stable that it does not require plasma prep tubes, expensive exprress
delivery, or &minus;70&deg; freezers.  Samples can be placed at 4&deg; for 
several days prior to testing.  Freeze-thaw cycles lead only to 3% loss, and
not much change beyond the third cycle.
<p>
Assay costs could be estimated directly (since there is no kit).  But health
insurers arrived at a price of $30 for antigen test and $167 for HIV-1 Monitor
assay in Switzerland, while in the U.S. the costs are $8 and $75, respectively.
In general the p24 assay range from 10-20% of the HIV-1 RNA assay.

Rapid Diagnosis of Mycobacterial Infections and Quantitation of
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Load by Two Real-Time Calibrated PCR Assays
<p class="Para1">
The problems of DNA extraction efficiency and inhibitors of PCR are dealt with
by using a synthetic DNA molecule <q>calibrator</q> which does not cross react
with <i>Mycobacterium</i> sequences. This is an internal control that allows
determination of PCR inhbitors, cutoff value for sensitivity for negative
samples, and normalizing positives for efficiency of DNA recovery. The
bacterial targets are a fragment of the IS<i>6110</i> multicopy element (see
Thierry et al, JCM 28: 2668, 1990) and one of the <i>senX3-regX3</i> intergenic
region (IR) (see Supply et al, Mol Microbiol 26: 991, 1997).
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>. Various mycobacterial species were used. MTB isolates varying
in IS<i>6110</i> copy numbers were tested. DNA was also extracted from a
variety of non mycobacterial species. 121 samples of sputum, urin, CSF,
nasogastric lavage, and bronchoalveolar lavage from 83 patients of which 20 had
tuberculosis and 63 did not were studied. In addition 11 of the 20 TB and 55 of
63 control were HIV-infected. 1 ml of respiratory specimens are treated with
NAc-Cys/NaOH (digestion and decontamination). Specimens then homogenized in 2.
5% NAc-Cys in 68 mM phosphate pH 6.7 and spun 15 min at 400 <i>g</i>. Sediment
from supernatant is spun 3000 <i>g</i> for 20 min and used for microscopy,
culture and DNA extraction. Fixed smears were stained with auramine
fluorochrome and confirmed using Ziehl-Neelsen staining. The BACTEC system is
used for culture and run for 8 weeks. Sputum is treated in 100 mM KCl 10 mM
TrisHCl pH 8.3 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% v/v Tween 20 and 0.5% NP-40,
incubated 95&deg; 30 min, mixed 2 min, digested with proteinase K overnight at
56&deg;. Samples are heated 95&deg; for 10 min then phenol-chloroform with high
salt isopropanol precipitation. A synethtic calibrator DNA, 10,000 copies /
sample is added before DNA extraction for controlling efficiency.
<p>
Primers TAQM3 5&prime;-AGGCGAACCCTGCCCAG-3&prime; and TAQM4
5&prime;-GATCGCTGATCCGGCCA-3&prime; amplify a 122 bp fragment of IS<i>6110</i>
multicopy element (GenBank X52471).  The detection oligo is the 30 bp
5&prime;-VIC-TGTGGGTAGCAGACCTCACCTATGTGTCGA-6TAMRA-3&prime;.  This target
is a central region of IS<i>6110</i> that is highly conserved among mycobacteria.
Primers TAQregT2 (5&prime;-GTAGCGATGAGGAGGAGTGG-3&prime;) and TAQreg2L
(5&prime;-ACTCGGCGAGAGCTGCC-3&prime;) amplify the 146 bp fragment of <i>senX3-regX3</i>
intergenic region (EMBL G2190478) and the 22 bp detection probe is
5&prime;-FAM-ACGAGGAGTCGCTGGCCGATCC-6TAMRA-3&prime;.  All sequences were checked
against EMBL and GenBank for significant homology with other sequences.
<p>
IS<i>6110</i> and the <i>senX3-regX3</i> regions were amplified using PCR using
known primers and the PCR products cloned into pCRII plasmid using TOPO-TA
cloning kit.  The new plasmids were then prepared in a Qiagen plasmid maxi kit,
sequenced, and used for quantifying mycobacterial load.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  Several isolates of MTB that have been sequenced consistently
show a conserved region in the IS<i>6110</i> region common to all MTB and
in other mycobacteria.  The intergenic region of <i>senX3-regX3</i> contains
mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs) found only in the MTB complex.
The sense primer was overlapped with the 53 bp MIRU in order to avoid
amplification problems related with theh 77 bp MIRUs in different MTB strains.
It is a fragment found only once in the region, and it is immediately
upstream the start of the <i>regX3</i> gene.  Cross-reaction with the 77 bp MIRU
is avoided and specific recognition of the 53 bp MIRU is done by placing the
TAQRegT2 primer toward end of 53 bp MIRU, so that the 24 bp gam can differntiate.
The purified plasmid constructs for IS<i>6110</i> and senX3-regX3 IR were quantified
by UV and triplicate 10-fold dilutions done for each construct.  The dynamic
range of 10<sup>0</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> genome equivalent per reaction was
established.  There was a strong correlation between log of initial copy number
and the C<sub>T</sub> value.  Sensitivity and dynamic range of two assays not
affected by presence of concentrations up to 1 &micro;g human gDNA.  The error
in quantitation up to 10,000 copies is 5-16% but lower at 2-6% above
10<sup>4</sup>/reaction.  Within-experiment error is &lt;20% for individual
IS<i>6110</i> and <i>senX3-regX3</i> assays, but 30 and 42% respectively at
10 genome equivalents per reaction.  Between-experiment error is &lt;40%,
although at 10 GE/reaxn it is 46 and 71% respectively.  In tests of many
strains of <i>M tuberculosis</i>, 39 could be detected, although one isolate and
the BCG Tice strain were not, by both TaqMan probes.  Isolate 13 of MTB has
no IS<i>6110</i> but does have <i>senX3-regX3</i>, and was detected, and
BCG Tice has no 53bp MIRU, but was detected by IS<i>6110</i>.  Fewer strains
could amplify the <i>senX3-regX3</i> system compared to IS<i>6110</i>.
Negative controls showed negative results.  Triplicate assay quantitations
were done on IS<i>6110</i> multicopy elements which vary from 1-17:  results show
copy number always higher than for single copy <i>senX3-regX3</i> results.  Plots
of C<sub>T</sub>) vs against the copy number of IS<i>6110</i> were tightly
linear.   AFB smear test counts and culture results were tested against DNA
load using <i>senX3-regX3</i> assay:  30 samples were AFB microscopy and culture
positive, 12 samples were positive by only either microscopy or culture, and
9 samples were negative by both.  Results of PCR show that both-positive differed
significantly by one-positive and from the negative group, and that the one-positive
group differed from the negative group, indicating good correlation between
the counts/load of bacteri and the load of DNA.  Those with the lowest DNA load
were actually on antitubercular therapy.

Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends
<p class="Para1">
The sequences recovered from the inserts of cDNA libraries are often missing
the full lengths.  In the past larger numbers of clones had to be probed with
typically more upstream sequences.  This creates a lot of work.
<p>
With RACE, an anchor sequence is added to the end of the cDNA to be used as
a PCR primer binding template.  A universal primer complementary to the added
anchor template is coupled with a gene-specific primer in a PCR to amplify
regions with unknown sequence.  In the first generation of RACE, homopolymeric
tails (G or A) were added to the 3' end of the cDNA to be used as the anchor
sequence using terminal deoxynucleotide transferase.  The 2nd generation RACE
technique uses T4 RNA ligase to ligate single-stranded anchor to 3' end
of the first strand cDNA.
<pre>
	   5'-----------cDNA------3'GGGGGGGGGGG
	                          3'-AAAAAAAAAAAAAA-5'
</pre>
<p>Because both methods are difficult to optimize due to the inefficienty of
the enzymatic reactions, a third generation RACE now uses T4 DNA ligase
to add double-stranded anchor sequence to both ends of the ds cDNAs,
allowing 3' and 5' RACE.  Clontech's Marathon cDNA amplification kit works
on this principle.
<p>
The method is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Obtain the following materials:
 <ul>
 <li>Isolate total cellular RNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), from
which poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA can be isolated to about a 500 &micro;g
quantity using an isolation kit (say from Qiagen or Stratagene).
 <li>a dNTP mixture (should be dGTP, dATP, dTTP, dCTP).
 <li>Do a first strand synthesis using favorite kit (such as Invitrogen's
 SuperScript II with RNase H reverse transcriptase, which is generally
 excellent at producing longer first-strand cDNAs).
 <li>obtain a cDNA synthesis primer, which can be a universal oligo-dT
 	(5'-CACTATAGGCCATCGAGGCC(T)<sub>20</sub>)MN-3')  for 5'- and/or 3'-RACE,
 	or use an antisense gene-specific primer (for 5' RACE only) which is
 	complementary to the rare mRNA or located upstream on large transcript.
 	Note that the presence of M (A, G or C) and N (A, G, T, C) degenerate
 	primers will put oligo-d(T) primer at beginning of p(A) tail.
 <li>For 2nd strand synthesis:  obtain a 20&times; enzyme mixture and
 	5&times; buffer with T4 DNA polymerase (enzyme in the Marathon cDNA
 	amplification kit from Clontech).  An extra 2nd strand enzyme mixture
 	would include:  DNA polymerase I, DNA ligase, and RNase H all from
 	<i>E coli</i>.
<li>Adaptor or anchor sequence ligation:  a specially designed partially
	double-stranded adaptor in the cDNA amplification kit
<li>Gene-specific primers:  should be about 25 nt long with 50% GC
	content and T<sub>m</sub> of 65-70&deg;.  For difficult genes
	a <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> of 70&deg; or higher should be used in a touchdown
	PCR method.   Anchor primers complementary to adapter sequence for
	5'- and 3'-RACE or to tailing sequence on oligo-dT primer are coupled
	with GSP to amplify unknown sequence by paired primer set.  AP-1
	(5'-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3') and AP-2 (5'-ACTCATATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3'),
	which is nested inside AP-1. are supplied in the Marathon kit.  Note
	that touchdown PCR can help to eliminate extraneous bands and to increase
	yield:  first round has an annealing temperature 5-10&deg; higher than
	what is usually used; annealing temperature is dropped a degree until
	standard melting is reached.
<li>thermocycler
<li>DNA polymerase:  Boehringer-Mannheim Expand PCR supplies three buffers,
	of which Buffer 1 is good for RACE PCR when the product size is &lt; 10 kb.
<li>PCR product purification:  Qiagen's QIAEX II is useful
<li>TA cloning:  Promega's pGEM-T vector system
<li>most general molecular laboratory equipment and reagents
</ul>
<li>In general, RACE will be more successful where the genee of interest is
 expressed to a high degree, and/or where copy number of mRNA is high.  Choose
 tissue where expression is most abundant.
<li>With pineal RNA as the example here, DD-PCR revealed a gene PG23.
 Northern blots were then probed for PG23 with a doublet at 2.0 and 2.4 kb.
 These sizes can be used to identify the correct RACE bands.
<li>Synthesize the first strand:  1 &micro;g high quality poly(A)<sup>+</sup>
mRNA is mixed 1 &micro;l 10&times; buffer, 1 &micro;l of 100 mM DTT,
1 &micro;l of 10 mM dNTP, 1 &micro;l of 10 &micro;M oligo-dT primer
(5'-CACTATAGGCCATCGAGGCC(T)<sub>20</sub>MN-3'), 1 &micro;l of SuperScript
II (RNase H-)reverse transcriptase.  The final volume should be
10 &micro;l.  Run in a thermocycler programmned
for 70&deg; for 10 min, 42&deg; for 50 min, and 50&deg; for 15 min.
Additionally add 1 &micro;l of the RTase after a 5 min incubation at 42&deg;.
<li>For 2nd strand synthesis:  add to the 1st strand synthesis reaction mixture
48.4 &micro;l high-quality water, 16 &micro;l 5 &times; second strand buffer,
1.6 &micro;l 10 mM dNTPs, and 4 &micro;l of 20 &times; 2nd strand enzyme
cocktail.  Mix gently by pipetting.  Run the reaction in thermocycler
at 16&deg; for 1.5 h.  Add 2 &micro;l of T4 DNA polymerase and incubate
16&deg; for 45 min to make blunt end.  4 &micro;l of EDTA/glycogen
is added to stop reaction.
<li>Add 100 &micro;l phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and
extract the top phase.  Repeat.  Add 0.5 vol of 4 M ammonium acetate then
2.5 vol 100% EtOH; place at &minus;20&deg; for 1 h, spin 10 min at 4&deg;.
Wash pellet in 1 ml 75% EtOH.  After drying in air, dissolve in 10 &micro;l.
<li>Add 2 &micro;l of adaptor DNA (this is partially double-stranded),
2 &micro;l of 5&times; ligation buffer, 5 &micro;l of blunt-ended
ds cDNA, and 1 &micro;l T4 DNA ligase.  Leave 16&deg; overnight.
To stop the reaction, inactivate enzyme in 70&deg;.
<li>Antisense gene-specific primer (AGSP) and nested (NAGSP) are produced
from sequences at the 3' end in order to do 5'-RACE.  For PG23 gene the
AGSP is 5'-GGAACAGTCTGAGCTCTAAGCTAGG-3' and NAGSP is
5'-TCTAGAAGGATAAGTTCACGAGGGCC-3' designed on the 277 bp sequence info
just upstream of poly(A) tail.  The combination is designed to extend
the sense strand (2nd strand cDNA) to its 5' end.
<li>The PCR is done in a final 50 &micro;l reaction volume:  5 &micro;l
10 &times; PCR buffer 1 (optimized for RACE reactions), 5 &micro;l 1:100
dilution of adaptor-ligated cDNAs, 1 &micro;l 10 mM dNTP, 1 &micro;l
of 10 &micro;M AP-1 linker primer, 1 &micro;l of 10 &micro;M gene-specific
primer, and 0.75 &micro;l DNA polymerase which is added last.  The
polymerase is added <em>after</em> first denaturing at 94&deg; for 1 min
to reduce nonspecific amplification (known as a hot start PCR, which improves
both sensitivity and specificity).  30 cycles of PCR are done:  94&deg;
for 30 s, 60&deg; for 30 s, 68&deg; for 3 min.  If the mRNA is GC-rich,
it may be helpful to add a co-solvent such as glycerol or DMSO to 5%
concentration.
<li>20 &micro;l of the amplification mixture is loaded on to 1% agarose
in TAE (1&times;) and run at 75 V for 2 h.  The antisense primer-elongated
bands are of the expected size, with the nested primer-started product
slightly smaller than the AGSP.  This confirms that the RACE products
are true.  When cDNA is not present, there is no band.  Amplified products
Bands are extracted with clean sharp scalpel and DNA extracted using the
QIAEX II kit.  A 15 &micro;l elution is saved.
<li>5 &micro;l of the gel-purified DNA is cloned into pGEM-T vector
and the sequence of PG23 mRNA of the 1.4 and 2.0 kb size determined.
<li>If the 1st PCR using AGSP and AP-1 primers is not sufficient to produce
visible bands of expected size, a 2nd round with NAGSP and AP-2 (nested
within AP-1) is done using 2.5 &micro;l of 1:100 dilution of the first
PCR product as template.  If nested PCR shows no bands, this may be due to
nonoptimized RACE PCR conditions or extremely low level gene expression.
</ol>
<p><b>3'-RACE Using Tailed Oligo-dT for cDNA Synthesis</b>.  A northern analysis
revealed an 8.0 kb mRNA for PG10.2 gene and only 145 bp of sequence info
for the DD-PCR fragment was available as a template for designing RACE primer.
A probe of the cDNA library using 145 bp sequence was negative, and this
might indicate that the complement was far upstream.
<p>
First strand synthesis conditions are the same as for 5'-RACE with universal
oligo-dT primer.  Second strand synthesis conditions are the same except
note that blunt-ending of cDNA with T4 DNA polymerase is unnecessary.
ds cDNA purification is also the same.  In designing primer a sense gene-specfic
primers (SGSP) is defined based on the 145 bp sequence information.  An anchor
primer is designed to prime at the end of the synthesized 2nd strand.
<b>5'-RACE Using Gene-Specific Primer for cDNA Synthesis</b>.  Instead
of the oligo-dT primer to synthesize the 1st strand, and anti-sense
gene-specific primer based on the 145 bp sequence is used to synthesize
1st strand.  This cDNA can only be used in 5'-RACE.

Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA Fingerprinting
<p class="Para1">
Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is a PCR technique that relies
on that relies on producing amplified products using an amplfication-based
scanning technique driven by arbitrary priming oligonucleotides.
The amplicons are a multiplicity of anonymous sites characteristic
of the studied genome.
<p>
The first few cycles are done at low stringency to ensure generation of
products primed with mismatches.  Subsequent cycles are done with
higher stringency.  A single primer about 10 bp in size with 40-70% GC
content is used, with the distance between upstream and downstream
primers about 3-4 kb.  Stringency is largely a function of annealing
temperature control, which itself is a function of primer sequence (GC
content generally) and length.  Although a set formula can be used, this
is an initial guideline to a final empirical optimization.

Differences in The Way A Mammalian Cell and Yeast Cells Coordinate
Cell Growth and Cell-Cycle Progression
<p class="Para1">
Schwann cells were taken from the sciatic nerve of 7-day postnatal rat pups
using a sequential immunopanning technique;  cells are expanded on
poly-D-lysine- and fibronectin-coated plastic in DMEM containing 3% FBS,
1 &mu;M forskolin and 20 ng/ml recombinant neuregulin glial growth
factor 2 (GGF2).  Cells were passed every
3 days and shown 99.9% pure by antigenic markers.  For switch experiments
cells are expanded in lysine- and laminin-coated plastic with
serum-free DMEM/GGF2/forskolin with + 20% of the volume being
conditioned with Schwann cells, ITS (10 &mu;g/ml insulin, 100 &mu;g/ml
transferrin, 40 ng/ml selenium), 100 &mu;g/ml BSA, 16 mg/ml putrescine,
and either with or without 3% FBS.  In the switch cells are plated at
100,000 per well of 6-well plates and passed if they reach 300,000 per well.
<p>
Cells were grown in complete medium and passed constantly before reaching
confluence.  When cells were detached with trypsin, cell size (volume)
was assayed using a Coulter counter (Beckman-Coulter Multisizer II,
suspended in Isoton II).  Average size remains unchanged with
repeated passaging.
<p>
Does size affect growth?  The DNA polymerase &alpha; inhibitor aphidicolin
was used to arrest cells in S phase.  Schwann cells are contact-inhibited
and become quiescent (no active cell cycling) when confluent in culture.
Cells are re-plated at lower density in the presence of inhibitor
and with complete medium.  Cells did not proliferate (stuck in S phase)
but did increase in size.  The volume of cells was measured at
24 hour intervals.  Over a period of 5 days, this growth was linear
independent of size.  This correlated with a linear rate of change
in the amount of protein per cell as well, indicating that the volume
increase was not merely water.  With yeast cells, changes in the
rate of growth are exponential, but in Schwann cells, large cells grow
at the same rate as small cells, and thus growth rates are independent
of cell size.
<p>
Cells blocked with aphidicolin and serum-stimulated will add the same
net amount of protein per cell per day independent of size.  Cells in
complete medium and treated with aphidicolin were supplemented with
[<sup>35</sup>S]Met and [<sup>35</sup>S]Cys for two hours at 24, 48, and
72 hours.  The radiolabeled protein per cell was then found to increase
linearly with time with the increase in cell size.  However the net
amount of protein incorporated per day did not increase despite the
increase in cell size, and this indicates that protein loss by degradation
or secretion must also be occurring.  To determine this, cells were
pulsed for 2 hours with radiolabel precursor, then chased with nonradioactive
precursor for 2 or 6 hours.  Plots of the cpm/cell vs. time after
the pulse showed a decline indicating loss of protein, and an increase
in the rate of loss of protein as well.
<p>
Cells were cultured in various percentages of FBS and changes in cell
volume measured over time.  For up to the end of the experiment of
9 days, the increase in cell volume increased consistently.  This
was also dependent on the level of serum, with increased serum resulting
in increased size.  Serum levels of 50% even showed an increased effect
on size.

Hypochlorite-induced oxidation of amino acids, peptides and proteins
<p class="Para1">
Phagocytic cells when activated produce hydrogen peroxide and superoxide in a
respiratory burst, and also release myeloperoxidase.  This enzymes causes
peroxide to react with chloride ion to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl).
This is used to kill bacteria and invading pathogens but is not so discriminating.
HOCl with DNA results in the production of short-lived chloramine species
(RNHCl, RR'NCl) that causes dissociation of ds DNA with disruption of H-bonding.
At elevated temps and in presence of metal ions the process is enhanced.
Heterocyclic chloramines formed from thyimidine and guanosine can be repaired by
thiols and other primary amines via chlorine transfer with regeneration of parent
compound.
<p>
Chlorohydrins form with HOCl when there are double bonds from unaaturated fatty
acids and cholesterol, detectable by GC-MS.  Among physiological effects include
membrane destabilization and cytotoxicity, but formation rate is low and thus
these are minor products in most situations.  Many antioxidants react rapidly
with HOCl.  Generally with thiols it is rapid;  glutathione, related thiols,
and thioethers.  Ascorbate also reacts.  Phenols and hydroquinones react more
slowly.
<p>
Reaction of HOCl with proteins and amino acids have been studied by competitive
kinetic studies and stopped flow methods.  Reaction rates have been determined with
selected amino acid with order of reactivity being Cys &gt; Met &gt; cystine &gt;
His &gt; Ser &gt; Leu.  Met and Cys react more rapidly with HOCl in alkaline
solutions (pH &gt; 10):  OCl<sup>&minus;</sup> is more reactive than HOCl with
protonated amine groups (R-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>).  At pH 8.5, the average
of the pKa values of HOCl and amines, maximal rates are found.  HOCl at physiological
pH (7.4) has been studied with proteins and side chain reactivity is in this
order:  Met &gt; Cys &#8811; cystine ~ His ~ &alpha;-amine &gt; Trp &gt; Lys
&#8811; Tyr ~ Arg &gt; Gln ~ Asn.   Reaction of thiols with chloramines is
much slower but increases as the pKa of the thiol decreases.

Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography (GC &times; GC)
<p class="Para1">
Giddings had discussed using multiple types of separation to achieve power
of resolution and purification.  Early efforts included looking at oxygenates
of gasoline in which only portions of eluate are collected and analyzed in
a second dimension.  True analysis requires sample all of the effluent for
subsequent dimensional analysis.  In 1991 J. Phillips realized what GC &times; GC
required and implemented the technique.
<p>
True separation requires <em>independence</em> and <em>orthogonality</em>.
GC &times; GC is an extension of 2D GC (heart-cut GC).  In the heart cut, 
a region of the 1st column effluent is taken which is often several components
in a time region.  Multiple heart-cuts might be taken and analyzed on a 2nd
column.  The point here is that the heart-cut sacrifices the separation of the
1st dimension, grouping together already resolved components, but considering 
they will al be resolved in the 2nd column anyway.
<p>
A basic requirement of GC &times; GC is that the coupling must be a special
interface (modulator) capable of either sampling or collecting 1st column effluent
and introducing to 2nd column while maintaing 1st column separation.  The 
modulator collects for proper time and injects into 2nd column as a short pulse.

Detection of a Point Mutation Associated with High-Level Isoniazid Resistance
in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by Using Real-Time PCR Technology with
3&prime;-Minor Groove Binder-DNA Probes
<p class="Para1">
Isonazid (INH)-resistant MTB has been reported, and multidrug resistant
(to INH and rifampin) are widespread.  Resistance occurs because of
point mutations in genes for the drug targets. 60-70% of INH resistance is
due to <i>katG</i> catalase/peroxidase gene and 10-15% is due to changes in
the <i>inhA</i> enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase.  <i>katG</i> function
is required to activate INH, which then binds <i>inhA</i> reductase, part of
fatty acid synthase II complex.  There is an G&rarr;C point mutation in a
codon that causes a S315T transition.  Other INH-resistant isolates all show
1- or 2-point mutation changing Ser to either Thr, Asn, Ile, or Arg.  A problem
with MTB is its high GC content, which can complicate melting temperature-basd
SNP detection for mutants.  Probes should be as short as possible, as mismatch
is more likely to destabilize, a wanted effect.   A 3&prime; minor groove
binding (MGB) modification is used in this assay.  An MGB probe is 14- to 15-bp
long oligo with 5&prime; fluorophore and quencher + MGB at 3&prime; end.  The
MGB increases the <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> of the probe-amplicon binding and lets
short probes have <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> of ~60&deg;.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>. H37Rv (ATCC 27294) wild type control and four resistant
isolates with codon 315 ACG&rarr;ACC change with three isolates having MIC 5
&micro;g/ml and fourth having 10 &micro;g/ml. 20 susceptible (&lt; 0.5 &micro;
g/ml) were studied. To measure MIC: grow in Middlebrook 7H10 medium in
concentrations of INH from 0.1 to 50 &micro;/ml [multiply by 1, 2, and 5 over
three logs] and consider resistant of &gt; 1 in 100 of inoculum grew at INH &ge;
 0.5 &micro;g/ml. Sputum samples are collected and Ziehl-Neelsen staining done.
All samples processed with NAc-Cys+NaOH and sediment obtained in 67 mM
phosphate. For culture liquid Dubos medium for the wildtype and L
owenstein-Jensen solid medium for sputum samples. Wildtype control is grown to
10<sup>8</sup>/ml by nephelometry and 10-fold dilutions in Tris/E
DTA/Tween-80/BSA buffer, and 5 ml aliquots pooled sputum inoculated 1:100 with
suspensions before decontamination for spiked analysis. The guan SCN of Boom et
al used to isolate sputum samples and collected in RNase-free water. DNA is
isolated by use of lysozyme, SDS, proteinase K, and adding CTAB, followed by
chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and isopropanol precipitation for liquid cultures.
For solid cultures, 10 mg looped cells are boiled in water for 30 min and
extracted using Capture Column DNA extraction kit. Primer Express software was
used to design primers and MGB probes. Sense (forward) primer is
5&prime;-GGGCTTGGGCTGGAAGAG-3&prime; and anti-sense (reverse) is
5&prime;-ACAGGATCTCGAGGAAACTGTTGT-3&prime;. The wildtype detection probe is
5&prime;-VIC-GATCACCAGCGGCA-MGB-TAMRA-3&prime; and the mutant probe is
5&prime;-FAM-GATCACCACCGGCAT-MGB-TAMRA-3&prime;.  The nt position for primers
is 888 and 986, while the detection probes are at 936, or 48 bp downstream of
the forward primer.  The <i>katG</i> sequence used was GenBank NC000962.
Primer and probe specificity was check with BLASTN and secondary structure by
<a href="http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/old/dna">mfold</a>.
PCR was final 50 &micro;l using 25 &micro;l Hot-Start Master Mix from Qiagen,
5 &micro;l DNA sample,  with 1 &micro;M primers and 0.2 &micro;M probes.
Bio-Rad iCycler iQ was used with 10 min 95&deg; denaturation and 50 cycles
of 15 s at 92&deg;, 1 min at 60&deg;, 30 s at 72&deg; and fluorescence read
at last 30 s of 60&deg; step.  2% agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing
also done.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  Sensitivity of the assay was determined to be about 5 fg DNA
in water for the wildtype control (this is about 1 GE).  The spiking study shows
that sensitivity of the sputum reaction was 20 cells per sample, or 1000 bacterial
ml in sputum.  In testing specificity no hybridizaiton was seen with large amounts
of nonmycobacterial or nontuberculous mycobacteria DNA was present. <i>M bovis</i>
is positive because it is part of MTB.  A total of 20 samples were sequenced
at codon 315 and the qPCR was compared.  18 results of the sequencing agreed
with the expected result of the PCR, while two results did not.  In one case
the sample showed wild-type while the sequence was mutant, and in another,
neither wildtype or mutant was detected although it was MTB positive with resistant
form.  PCR sensitivity was thus 78%  compared with ZN staining.

Detection of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by Real-Time PCR Using
Pan-Mycobacterial Primers and a Pair of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer
Probes Specific for the M. tuberculosis Complex
<p class="Para1">
<b>Technical Brief</b>.  The Roche AMPLICOR MTB assay is the only FDA-approved
test for MTB diagnosis.  It amplifies a 584 bp fragment of 16 S rDNA and identifies
by a hybridization to specific probe.  In this study the AMPLICOR system is
adapted to real time PCR to optimize analysis time.  Original primers are used
and only the detection probe is altered.  Instead of a TaqMan probe, FRET
probes not requiring cleavage are used.  In finding new hybridizing probes
we used process described by Landt in <i>Rapid real-time PCR</i> Meuer et al, eds,
2001.  The upstream probe is the same as the AMPLICOR but the adjacent downstream
probe is conserved in all mycobacteria.  The PCR was then optimized.  The LightCycler
protocol proved inferior to a normal thermal cycler protocol:  for amplicons
&gt; 500 bp there is inefficient amplification in glass capillaries and so reactions
were adjusted to polypropylene containers for an ABi 7700 SDS instrument.
The 640 nm FRET probe emission cannot be processed so a spectral calibration must
be oen with quadruplicate with 1 &micro;M MTBP3 probe (LCRed640 dye emitting
at 640 nm) in 50 &micro;l of PCR buffer.  Re-optimized protocol is 50 &micro;l
reaction with 20 &micro;l sample, 5 &micro;l 10&times; buffer containing
salts, final 0.2 mM dNTPs, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 nM primers:  KY18
5&prime;-cacatgcaagtcgaacggaaagg-3&prime; and KY75
5&prime;-gcccgtatcgcccgcacgctcaca-3&prime; (see Tevere et al, J Clin Microbiol
34: 918, 1996), 100 nM probe MTBP5
5&prime;-accggataggaccacgggatgcatgtctt-6FAM-3&prime;, and 80 nM probe MTBP3
5&prime;-LCred640-ggtggaaagcgctttagcggtgt-P-3&prime;.  After 15 min 95&deg;
initialization, there are 50 cycles 15s/95&deg;, 20s/60&deg;, and 40s/72&deg;
with LCred640 reading at 60&deg; and divided by 6FAM 495 nm for normalization.
A mean of 2.32 plasmids per PCR would yield a result with 95% probability.
From the Poisson distribution where <i>P</i>(<i>a</i>) = <i>e<sup>&minus;m</sup></i>
(<i>m<sup>a</sup>/a</i>!), in which <i>a</i> occurrences per test at a mean
of <i>m</i> objects has a probability <i>P</i>, if <i>P</i> = 0.05 and <i>a</i> = 0,
the ~2.99 plasmids would be required to achieve 95% positivity in a 100%
efficient test.  Thus the DNA amplification must have been 100% efficient.
Reaction were set up to check DNA requirements:  for a positivie result to be
found in 95% of tests,  a probit analysis shows a mean copy number of 7.36 copies
per assay.  The sensitivity of the Roche AMPLICOR is reported at &ge; 20 mycobacteria
per test.  Optimization of this test brought the cost down to $5-6 in reagents
and consumables (the AMPLICOR test is $30 per assay).  Hands-on time is comparable,
but thermal cycling protocol changes reduces analysis tim to 2.5 h compared to
5 h for AMPLICOR.

Detection and Differentiation of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and
Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Isolates by Real-Time PCR
<p class="Para1">
Accuprobe (Gen-Probe, Inc.) was a major advance for genetic probes to detect
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex, <i>M avium/M intracellulare</i> complex,
<i>M kansasii</i> and <i>M gordonae</i>.  However, slow-growing bacteria must
be cultured and more than one probe is necessary if bacteria recovered from
broth culture and no colony info is avialable to limit probe selection.  When
PCR-based assays were developed there are problems with false negatives probably
because of DNA extraction protocols for different specimen types was not optimized.
The Innogenetic INNO-LiPA line probe assay recently developed utilizes reverse
hybridization of PCR amplicon onto paper strip having variety of probes for
mycobacteria which can distinguish different mycobacteria, but the method is
costly and not readily available.  Real-time PCR offers many advantages including
postamplification melting point analysis, which helps to determine sequence
differences.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>.  In this test 168 clinical specimens and 18 reference strains
are tested.  Isolates had been characterized for growth conditions, biochemistry,
Accuprobe assays.  <i>M kansasii</i> was identified using INNO-LiPA MYCOBACTERIA
line probe assay.  Pyrosequencing was also done on the hypervariable region A
of 16 S rRNA and compared to GenBank sequences.  Isolates were obtained as
a 10 &micro;l disposable loopful growing in Lowenstein-Jensen or 7H11 medium and
placed in 200 &micro;l 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 0.5% Tween20, 1% Triton X100,
1 mM EDTA which is heated 100 &deg; for 30 min on block.  Lysate is diluted
1:10000 in buffer and submitted to PCR.  Sequences examined for 16S rRNA gene
are GenBank X52917.  Primers are sense: 5&prime;-ACGGAAAGGTCTCTTCG-3&prime;
(nt 29-45) and anti-sense: 5&prime;-GTCGTCGCCTTGGTAG-3&prime; (nt 242-227):
amplicon size is thus 224 bp.  The probe region is the hypervariable A and have
100% homology with <i>M tuberculosis</i> complex but have &ge; 1 nt mismatches
with other clinically relevant mycobacteria.  Probe 1 is
5&prime;-CATGTCTTGTGGTGGAAAGCG-FITC-3&prime; (nt 151-171) and probe 2 is
5&prime;-LCRed640-TTAGCGGTGTGGGATGAGCCC-{P)-3&prime; (nt 174-194). PCR is
done on the LightCycler (see Wittwer et al, BioTechniques 22:130, 1997).
A 20 &micro;l reaction volume with 5 &micro;l DNA extract and 15 &micro;l
hybridization probe master mix with 0.25 &micro;M primers, 0.4 &micro;M probes,
and 3.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was done.  TE buffer is negative control. ATCC 27294
wildtype MTB is used for positive control.  Cycling is 95&deg; 10 min to activate
FastStart <i>Taq</i> DNA polymerase, then 45 cycle of  10 s at 95&deg;,
10 s at 50&deg;, and 20 s at 72&deg;.  Melting analysis is then done from
45&rarr;75&deg; at  1&deg; every 10 s, and then a rapid cooling phase.
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values are obtained as the peak value of the &minus;<i>dF/dT</i>
curve;  if the high point was a plateau then the <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> was
computed as the midpoint.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  The PCR assay had 100% sensitivity for all species except
<i>M gordonae</i> for which only 10 in 18 isolates (56%) were positive.  PCR
positive <i>M gordonae</i> showed distinctive melting temperature.  Using SYBR
Green I instead of fluorescent probes showed good amplification.  The C<sub>T</sub>
were usually between 25-30.  <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values had a narrow range
of 64.4 &plusmn; 0.8 &deg; (2 SDs) for <i>M tuberculosis</i>, higher than for
other species.  There was an abiity to distinguish many species based on
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>, but not all.
<p>
[Much more melting point data here not discussed.]
<p>
Comparing this PCR assay to COBAS Amplicor showed 100% identity in results.
48 specimens were positive of the 50 specimens known to have MTB.  Melting point
analysis was all within known ranges for MTB.

Simple immunoaffinity method to purify recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen 
secreted by transfected mammalian cells
<p class="Para1">
The S gene region of HBV genome codes for three alternately translated forms.
The nonglycosylated and glycosylated designations are shown in the table
<table>
<tr><th>Form <th>Nonglycoslated <th>Glycosylated
<tr><td>Major  <td>P24  <td>GP27
<tr><td>Middle  <td>none  <td>GP33, GP36
<tr><td>Major  <td>P39  <td>GP42
</table>
<p>
Expression of S gene has been done in several systems: prokaryotes, yeast,
mammalian cells, insect cells/baculovirus, and plants.  Purification of hBsAg
from plasma was first described in 1975.  Purification of the particle form
of HBsAg as recombinant  in stably transfected mammalian cultures has been
done by ultracentrifugation, column chromatography + ultracentrifugation.
<p>
A preS2-S fragment was amplified from HBV DNA (D/ayw3) using PS2-S1 primers
from a previous report and cloned into vector pCR2.1-TOPO from Invitrogen
and then subcloned into pcDNA 3 (also Invitrogen) for expression.  Inserts
were into EcoRI insertion site.  pcDNA3 with the preS2-S insert was called
pDM14 and is under CMV promoter control.  The pDM14 plasmid was cleaned by
CsCl gradient then transfected into CHO cells (using Sambrook and Russell
protocol).  Clones that secreated HBsAg particles were selected using an
ELISA (Organon Teknika Hepanostika HBsAg uniform II assay).  Scaled-up
expression is in roller bottles (890 cm<sup>2</sup> surface area (Corning)
with 50 ml Earle's 199 + 5% FBS.  Supernatant is collected 5 days after
reaching confluence.  PEG(6000-9000) powder is added slowly until 10% (w/v)
is reached in a 30 min period, and then left overnight at 4&deg;.  Centrifugation
is 10000 g 30 min.  Pellet is resuspended in pH 7.4 PBS then dialyzed against
water.
<p>
The PEG precipitation technique is used to separate HBsAg particles from 
supplemented BSA as much as possible.  Ammonium sulfate was also used and
similar in recovery and quality to PEG.  Ammonium sulfate apparently has
an effect on HBsAg stability though.
<p>
The Linx Affinity Purification System was then used.  Protein that will be
the affinity ligand of the affinity column is conjugated to a phenyldiboronic
acid (PDBA) NHS ester with a spacer between PDBA and protein.  The 
PDBA-protein conjugate is then incubated with Sepharose activated with 
salicylhydroxamine (SHA-Sepharose).  This is distinct from using the common
CNBr-activated Sepharose.  It is generally desirable to use a high PDBA:protein
ratio during the coupling reaction to assure creation of a high capacity 
column (a conjugation number between 4 and 12 is considered good). In creating
the PDBA-AH1mAb column, &lt; 1% of the total protein was recovered after
the reaction of PDBA-protein to SHA-Sepharose.  The recombinant HBsAg was
then passed through the system in three replicate runs:  average yield was
42% and average purity 90%.  The mAb ligand used is specific for the ayw2 subtype
while the HBsAg is of the ayw3 subtype, so this might have accounted for 
significant loss of antigen in unbound fraction.  Other conditions that might
affect affinity purification are the elution buffers to recover target protein.
0.1 M sodium bicarbonate at pH 8.0 proved best.  Elution with 3 M potassium
or sodium thiocyanate caused interference with the the ELISA.  Gel analysis
shows a 27 kDa band which is HBsAg.  A band at 50 kDa was present as well:
it could be multimer HBsAg formation.  Reducing conditions in the gel analysis
could cause HBsAg multimer formation.  These two bands did react with anti-HBsAg
polyclonal on a western.

High-Throughput Protein Analysis by Multiplexed Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate
Capillary Gel Electrophoresis with UV Absorption Detection
<p class="Para1">
Capillary gel electrophoreis was introduced by Hjerten and Karger and
co-workers about 20 years ago using SDS.  Polymeric sieving solution
use has created improvement of this technique.  Sensitive detection
is achieved with laser-induced fluorescence but this requires protein
derivatization or labelling.  UV detection at 200-220 nm is possible though
less sensitive.  SDS-CGE has been reported in a microchip format, with
analysis of 10 samples simultaneously in 30 min.
<p>
A 7-protein standard mix was obtained from Sigma (116 kDa &beta;-galactosidase,
97 kDa phosphorylase <i>b</i>, 66.2 kDa BSA, 45 kDa ovalbumin, 31 kDa
carbonic anhydrase, 21.5 kDa trypsin inhibitor, 14.2 kDa &alpha;-lactalbumin).
These are dissolved in 12.5 mM TrisHCl, 0.5% SDS, and 5 mM DTT to a final
100 &micro;g/ml concentration.  Denaturation is in a microplate well
at 95&deg; fro 20 min.  The sieving gel is 5% Dextran 2000 in 0.1% SDS
and 50 mM Tris-borate; a cationic polymer (proprietary) is used to
coat the silica wall to reduce EOF.  The ionic strength is lower than
typical because an otherwise high current generates heat in the closely
spaced set of 96 capillaries.  The cePRO9600 system is used with detection
at 214 nm and a 75/150 &micro;m capillary with 28 cm length to window
(54 cm overall).  Electrokinetic injection is for 50 s at 4500 V.
Separation is at &minus;12 kV.  Capillary conditioning is 0.1 M NaOH
for 10 min, then 5 min flushing with 0.1 M HCl and then deionized water.
Sieving matrix is flushed in for 15 min before sample analysis.
Fresh matrix is flushed 5 min between samples.  This can be done 10 times
before NaOH/HCl/water reconditioning.
<p>
Results of the high throughput analysis show excellent performance, good
reproducibility.

Long-Term Correction of Murine Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency with
AAV1-Mediated Gene Transfer of the Naturally Occurring LPL<sup>S447X</sup>
Beneficial Mutation
<p class="Para1">
An expression cassette containing the human high activity LpL gene variant
S447X was constructed in an adeno-associated virus vector.  Functional LpL
was confirmed in cultured C2C12 cells (300,000 cells) infected with
2.6 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> genome copies (virus titered using PCR).
After 72 h fresh media containing heparin added and 24 h later LpL activity
found in cell lysates (2.3 mU/ml) and in medium (21.6 mU/ml).  Activity
was also found in a control cultured primary human skeletal muscle cells.
10-16 month old LpL (-/-) mice were injected in a previous report with
these viruses and show about 5.5% of wildtype levels of LpL
postheparin plasma activity and also show expresion of hLpL protein, which
rescue them from neonatal death.  These adult homozygous deficient mice
show a 220-fold increase in plasma triglycerides, 9-fold increase in total
cholesterol, 4-fold increase in FFA, and 90% reduction in HDL-C relative to
normal phenotype.
<p>
Animals were injected at two levels with AA1-LPL<sup>S447X</sup>: 8 &times;
10<sup>11</sup> genome copies and 8 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> (10-fold the low
dose) gc intramuscularly at 36 sites.  Controls are injected with PBS.
Within a week there is a dose-dependent elevation in LpL activity and 8-week
average (weeks 2 to 10) is 131 mU/ml which is about one-third of normal
phenotype for the high dose, and the low dose is about 10% of normal.
Protein level measurements show a 12-fold increase in LpL mass over PBS controls
peaking to 1188 ng/ml, which is 61% of postheparin plasma levels in human
carriers of S447X.
<p>
Associated with increased LpL activity in AAV1-LPL<sup>S447X</sup> mutants
are dramatic reductions in triglycerides and total cholesterol.  Plasma TG
was reduced to 98% of pretreatment and TC by 92% with the high AAV1-LPL dose;
with the lower AA1-LPL dose, the duration to the peak reduction was slower,
and the maximum reduction was less than the higher dose.

Guideline to Reference Gene Selection for Quantitative Real-Time PCR
<p class="Para1">
Q-PCR is beginning to dominate the methods used to determine RNA expression
levels.  Most studies use only one reference gene, typically GAPDH, &beta;-actin,
or 18S and 28S rRNA.  Actin and GAPDH can vary considerably in expression and
may be unsuitable.  Other reference genes examined include hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), peptidyl prolyl isomerase A (PPIA), glucose
6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6DPH), TATA-Box binding protein (TBP),
&beta;2-microglobulin (&beta;2M), &alpha;-tubulin (Tub), porphobilinogen deaminase
(PBGD), and ribosomal protein L13 (L13).  All these are regulated and of limited
value as quantitative references.
<p>
Several genes as potential references were examined.  To compare different RNA
transcription levels the <i>C</i><sub>T</sub> values are compared directly.
The <i>C</i><sub>T</sub> is the count of cycles needed for a fluorescent signal
to reach a threshold of detection and is inversely correlated with template
present in the reaction.  PCR efficiency was first assessed by measuring
serial dilutions of 100 ng cDNA from CCRF-HSB-2 cells in triplicate, and doing
three independent runs over three days to assess interassay variation.
<i>C</i><sub>T</sub> &lt; 40 were used in the efficiency calculation;
PCR efficiency = (10<sup>&minus;1/slope</sup>&minus;1) &times; 100.  Efficiency
was found to be 96-100% for several log dilutions.
 Intra-assay variation was &lt;1.6% and inter-assay
variation &lt; 2.4% for all assays.
<p>
Quantitative real-time PCR was used to look at the level of RNA transcription
of the genes in many human tissues:  heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver,
skeletal muscles, kidney, pancrease, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary,
small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leucocytes.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor: Basic Science and Clinical Progress

The cardiovascular system is one of the first developed in embryogenesis.
Endothelial cell precursors probably derive from the bone marrow but first
from hemangioblasts.  VEGF, more formally now called VEGF-A to distinguish it
from later found related factors, is a growth factor part of a large family
connected with PDGF, PlGF, and others.  Several decades ago it was noted that
tumors were highly vascularized and it was supposed that a "factor" was involved.
In 1948 Michaelson described a "factor X" which was attributed to retinal
and iris neovascularization.  In 1968 tumor tissue was able to induce vascularization
when a fliter was between tissue and the vascularizad tissue, indicating a
diffusible factor.
<p>
In 1983 Senger et al described partial purification of a protein from conditioned
medium of tumor cell line able to induce vascular leakage they called vascular
permeability factor (VPF).  Only in 1990 did a partial N-teriminal sequence
become available.  In 1989 Ferrara and Henzel isolated diffusible endothelial
cell-specific mitogen called VEGF.  It was distinct from aFGF and bFGF based
on N-terminal sequencing.  The human VPF was isolated from U937 cells and sequenced.
cDNA cloning of VPF and VEGF indicated they were same molecule.

Gene2Oligo: oligonucleotide design for in vitro gene synthesis
<p class="Para1">
Methods for in vitro gene synthesis include oligonucleotide ligation, the 
<i>Fok</i>I method, DNA shuffling, and PCR.  Assembly PCR and ligase chain 
reaction coupled to PCR are most suitable for large scale syntheis starting from 
short synthetic oligos.  Many methods are not good at design however: oligos are 
all same length and no attempt made to optimize assembly.  Hoover and Lubkowsik 
developed DNAWorks, autoamted method to design optimized oligos for PCR-based 
gene synthesis.  All oligo designs start with using similar thermodynamic 
properties (e.g., melting temperatures).  Oligos should be specific for target 
to avoid incorrect assembly.  Gene2Oligo is software that attempts to optimize 
the important parameters.
<p>
<b>Algorithm</b>.  The input sequence is paritioned by three different methods 
to produce output oligos.  Method 1 emphasizes oligo length, Method 2 priortizes 
melting temperatures, and Method 3 only allows a simple regular cut of the input 
sequence.  The input sequence is the forward/positive/sense strand. The 
complement is the reverse/negative strand in this terminology.  Oligos should be 
exactly adjacent (no gaps between oligos):  while not essential for assembly 
PCR, it is required for LCR.  On the complement, another oligo will overlap both 
strands.  The single oligo is then a combination of two independent sequences 
called <i>hybridization units</i>.  The <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values of 
hybridization units are computed by nearest neighbor model with corrections 
based on salt and DNA concentrations.  The dynamic modification of oligo size 
will involve a first step of adding short head and tail bases to the input 
sequence, providing more degrees of freedom in selecting oligos.  The first and 
last oligos will not need to be exact starts and finishes of input sequence, and 
extra bases/sequences can be removed during final amplification and careful 
selection of primers.  Oligos can be designed within a &plusmn; 4 nt range 
around a median length.  If <i>s</i> is the median length and <i>l</i> is the 
input sequence length including head and tail, the program will compute a matrix 
of <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values for each position of input sequence ranging from 
0 to <i>l &minus;</i> (<i>s</i> &minus; 4), and for hybridization unit lengths 
ranging from <i>s</i> &minus; 4 to <i>s</i> + 4.  At the end the mean of all 
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values are computed (<i>T</i><sub>m-avg</sub>).  In absence 
of a user-defined <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>, the average becomes the default. For 
each position from 0 to <i>l</i> &minus; (<i>s</i> + 4) and both forward and 
reverse strands of input, Gene2Oligo generates substrings of length <i>s</i> + 4 
which are used to create BLAST database.  Entire input sequence then searched 
against this database using WU-BLAST to find sequence similarity. Parameters for 
WU-BLAST are (E5000 V1 W5 B100000 W5 gapS2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 S2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 
hspmax&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 warnings matrix&nbsp;=&nbsp;GT).  The first 8 options are 
set to report any alignments spanning 5 consec nts while not reporting single 
line descriptions not relevant.  Certain warnings are suppressed.  GT matrix 
allows substitution of G by A and T by C with no weight given to GT pairing in 
DNA (see Allawi et al <i>NAR</i> 26: 4925, 1998).  The output is parsed to find 
oligos matching more than one region of the input, because every oligo should 
show specificity to target  <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values are computed for each 
possible cross-hybridization (mismatch) for any oligo length from <i>s</i> 
&minus; 4 to <i>s</i> + 4.  If a <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> is &gt; 
<i>T</i><sub>m-avg</sub> &minus; 30, then the candidate is nonspecific and 
reported in specificity matrix. The algorithm builds a length matrix parsing the 
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> and specificity matrices.  For each position of input 
sequence from 0 to <i>l</i> &minus; (<i>s</i> &minus; 4), two oligos are 
selected which must satisfy the conditions:

<ul>
<li>minimum|<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> &minus; <i>T</i><sub>m-avg</sub>|
<li><i>T</i><sub>m</sub> &gt; <i>T</i><sub>m-avg</sub> &minus; <i>dT</i><sub>m</sub>
<li><i>T</i><sub>m</sub> &gt; <i>T</i><sub>m-avg</sub> + <i>dT</i><sub>m</sub>
</ul>
<p>
where <i>dT</i><sub>m</sub> is a user-defined range or set to 4 by default. 
Candidates not reported as excluded in specificity matrix have their lengths 
stored in length matrix.  If no oligo is found at given position, then position 
is flagged as nonvalid in length matrix.  The oligos finally selected are based 
on length matrix analysis constructed as a tree.  Excluding the head sequence, 
reading starts at first nucleotide, and it is used to point to starting position 
of next candidate.  Second candidate length determines 3rd candidate starting 
position, until end of input sequence or the encounter of nonvalid position. If 
there is a nonvalid candidate, then reader picks 2nd-best oligo length and tests 
for a valid solution.  If none found, read will explore a new branch of the 
tree; if necessary it goes back to starting position and explores all branches.
<p>
Where method priority is based on oligo length, user can choose median size
of hybridization unit.  Software uses default of <i>T</i><sub>m-avg</sub>
for the given median size and a <i>dT</i><sub>m</sub> of &plusmn; 4&deg; to search
for set providing the conditions.  The user can also set both <i>T</i><sub>m-avg</sub>
and <i>dT</i><sub>m</sub>.
<p>
Where there is <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> priority, user sets <i>T</i><sub>m-avg</sub> 
and <i>dT</i><sub>m</sub>.  Program computes the median hybridization unit 
length which has closest <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> to the set average. Finally there 
is a priority given to limiting the cuts forming the sequence assembly.
<p>
Gene2Oligo is written in Java and user input through a web page interface. In 
using the interface, inexperienced users should opt for the default length 
priority method and let software optimize the <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.  If the 
temperature must be set, then <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> priority mode should be done. 
Care must be taken in a length priority mode if hybridization unit length and 
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> are set so that an impossible condition set is not obtained 
(for exammple, setting a length of 15 nt and a <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> of 80&deg;, 
impossible to obtain).  If a <i>dT</i><sub>m</sub> of &plusmn;1&deg; is set, 
there will be little chance of obtaining an oligo set.  Best compromise is 
3-4&deg;. As [DNA] and [salts] affect <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>, these conditions 
should be set as well.
<p>
In a test of the software, <i>S cerevisiae</i> cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>5</sub>
<i>CYB5</i>, GenBank L22494 coding sequence with a GTCCATC added at the 3&prime; end.
It encodes 14 kDa heme protein which transfers electrons to acceptors such as
cytochrome P<sub>450</sub> and lipid biosynthesis enzymes.  A median length of 20
nt and <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> optimized by software was input (by default).  Sodium
and DNA left unchanged.  The 1377 bp sequence was processed with 21 oligo having
lengths ranging from 16-22 nt and <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> ranging from 62.5 to
69.6&deg;.  These oligos were synthesized and used in either LCR or assembly PCR.
After conducting the amplifications, products were analyzed on 1% agarose with a
control use of yeast genomic DNA template.  With only LCR, no product is detected,
but when second PCR is done from LCR product, the expected fragment is seen.
Similar results were observed for assembly PCR.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>.  Oligo synthesis is prone to error.  It is easy to exclude
bad oligos on the basis of wrong length, but incorrect base substitutions are
more difficult.  In using a hybridization set with uniform <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>
LCR or assembly PCR can be done at temperature closer to mean <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>
without affecting hybrids at the lower <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.
<p>
<b>Assembly PCR</b>.  In 50 &micro;l, each dNTP is 200 &micro;M, each oligo is
100 nM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> is 2.5 mM, and either the Promega <i>Taq</i> DNA polymerase
is used (0.5 U) or the NEB <i>Vent</i> DNA polymerase (1 U) is used.  The cycle
program is 95&deg; for 2 min at start, then 30 cycles of 95&deg; for 30 s, 52&deg;
for 30 s, 72&deg; for 1 min, and then a termination of 5 min at 72&deg;.
<p>
<b>LCR</b>.  In 25 &micro;l final volume, 100 nM of each oligo is phosphorylated
with T4 PNK (NEB), then 10 U of <i>Taq</i> DNA ligase (NEB).  The LCR is 94&deg;
for 2 min, then 40 cycles of 94&deg; for 30 s, 51&deg; for 4 min.
<p>
<b>Second PCR</b>.  Full-length product from LCR or assembly PCR is amplified 
using the primers yb5-EcoRI-5&prime; 
(5&prime;-GCGCGCGAATTCCATGCCTAAAGTTTACAGTTACCAAGAAGTTGC-3&prime;) and 
yb5-SacI-3&prime; 
(5&prime;-GCGCGCGAGCTCTTATTCGTTCAACAAATAATAAGCAACACCTAG-3&prime;).  In a 50 &micro;l
reaction, 3 &micro;l of the PCR assembly mix or 5 &micro;l of LCR mix, 200 &micro;M
dNTP each, 1 &micro;M primer, 0.5 U Promega <i>Taq</i> polymerase or 1 U of the
<i>Vent</i> DNA polymerase, and 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.  Program is denature
95&deg; 2 min, 30 cycles of 95&deg; 30 s, 55&deg; 30s, 72&deg; 60 s, and then 5 min
at 72&deg;.

Total synthesis of long DNA sequences: Synthesis of a contiguous 32-kb 
polyketide synthase gene cluster
<p class="Para1">
Khorana and coworkers starting chemical synthesis of polynucleotides by the
total synthesis of tRNA structural genes, and Itakura et al synthesized and
expressed somatostatin.  Polymerase cycling assembly is the most widely used
because of its simplicity.  Overlapping complementary oliogs are anneealed
and recursively elongated with heat-stable DNA polymerase to produce full-length
sequence, then amplified by conventional PCR.  HIV-2 <i>Rev</i> gene at 303 bp
was built and now synthesis is up to 1 kb.  Mandecki et al 1990 reported the
synthesis of 2.1 kb plasmid from a ligation of 30 fragments.  In 1995 Stemmer
et al reported a one-step PCA of 2.7 kb plasmid purified using antibiotic 
selection.  Smith et al assembled the 5386 bp &phi;&Chi;174 phage genome from
a single mix of oligos using ligation and PCA; biological selection was needed
to purify product.  The goal of heterologous expression in <i>E coli</i>
of polyketide synthase genes was this study goal:  type I PKS genes encode
giant enzymes that synthesize natural products like erythromycin, tacrolimus,
and so on.  Synthesis was focused on changing codons optimized for expression
in <i>E coli</i> and to introduce restriction sites flanking modules and
domains for easy interchangaability.  The approach used here is to build
in two error-free steps.  Multiple perfect sequences of 500 bp length 
(<q>synthons</q>) are constructed, then a <b>ligation by selection</b> (LBS)
second step is done.  This connects multisynthon segment of ~5000 bp length.
These are then assembled into large sequences using conventional cloning
strategies.
<p>
In a preliminary set of experiments, optimal lengths of synthons were determined
so as to be error-free.  It was assumed that error distribution in population
of PCA-synthesized DNAs would follow a Poisson distribution.  The error 
frequency (EF) and sequence length (L) permits estimation of the fraction (F)
of clones with accurate sequences and the number of clones (N) requiring
sequencing to give 95% confidence of identifying a correct one. <i>F</i> =
<i>e</i><sup>(&minus;<i>EF</i> &times; <i>L</i>)</sup> and <i>N</i> = (log 2)/
[1 &minus; log(1 &minus; <i>F</i>)].  If <i>EF</i> is to be low at 0.2%
(2 in 1000), then a 500 bp fragment will require sequencing of ~1.5 clones to
obtain a correct one.  For 2000 bp, it would require sequencing 30 clones.
As <i>N</i> increases exponentially with <i>EF</i> and <i>L</i>, small increases
in <i>EF</i> have more pronoucned effect on <i>N</i> for longer fragments.
If <i>EF</i> is increased to 0.25%, then 2.1 clones are required for sequencing
500 bp length, but for 2000 bp, it &gt; 100 clones.  With current DNA synthesis
capabilities, an <i>EF</i> of &le; 0.4% (4 in 1000) for 500 bp synthetic 
fragments, giving <i>N</i> = 4.8.
<p>
In the experiments, more errors were introduced when cycle number during \
amplification was very high (EF = 4.1% at 50 cycles vs EF = 2.6% at 25 cycles).
There was no correlation related with fragment size or or error location
in component sizes.  Fragments with a G+C &gt; 60% had higher EF values.
Errors primer slippage might occur resulting in insertions or deletions.
<p>
Synthons were cloned into vectors using UDG/LIC to avoid time consuming
PCR product purification.  These vectors have resistance markers permitting
subsequent LBS.  Primers for PCA amplification have 22 or 23 bases of U-containing
sequences on 5&prime; ends, the 20 bp priming sequence complementary to sequences
at the end of synthons.  UDG of PCR products gives long 22 or 23 bp 3&prime;
overhangs, which destroys primer dimers formed in PCR.  UDG-processed PCR
products are annealed to LIC vector with complementary 5&prime; overhangs.
These are transfected to <i>E coli</i> and plated to produce several hundred
colonies.  &gt; 300 UDG/LIC reaction and sequencing inserts from 6-8 colonies
each and the EF statistics and cloning efficiencies are determined. &gt; 95%
of clones had correct length, and rest were parent LIC vectors.

Hepatitis B
<p class="Para1">
HBV is common cause of liver disease, with 1 in 3 showing evidence of infection.
Annual death rate due to infection is 1 million.  In U.S. incidence was 14 per
100,000 in mid-1980s and has dropped to 3 per 100,000 in 1998.  Still 1.25 million
adults and children have chronic HBV infection.  Virus transmission is through
blood and body fluids, including semen and saliva.  It is 100 times more infectious
than HIV, and survives in dried blood for more than a week.  In China, SE Asia,
sub-Saharan Africa, HBV is acquired perinatally or early childhood; the prevalence
of chronic infection is 5-20%.  In U.S., Canada and W Europe, 8 in 10 cases is
by sexual contact or IV drug use (prevalence 0.1%).  Infants acquiring perinatal
transmission will likely develop chronic infection (90%);  25-30% will develop
chronic infection if initial infection is before age 5, and 3-5% go chronic
if infected later in childhood or adulthood.
<p>
HBV is member of Hepadnaviridae family, composed of ds circular DNA enclosed
in nucleocapsid (core Ag), surrounded by a spherical envelope (surface Ag).
The virion is called a Dane particle.  Genome includes a polymerase that is
DNA- and RNA-dependent.  With infection of hepatocyte, a cccDNA form develops
(covalently closed circular), which must form in order to produce mRNA.
<p>
The mRNA will be translated into viral proteins.  It is also is a positive 
strand for reverse transcription into HBV DNA that will be packaged into new
virions.  If reverse transcriptase is defective, new virions are not made, and
replication halts.  The <b>e</b> antigen is a peptide produced from the core
antigen:  its presence indicates high levels of viral replication.  See the
table below for markers made by the virus.

<table>
<caption>HBV Infection Lab Markers</caption>
<tr><th>Marker  <th>Abbr  <th>
<tr><td>surface antigen  <td>HBsAg  <td>present in acute and chronic infection
<tr><td>surface antibody <td>anti-HBs <td>indicates immunity acquired by
natural infection, vaccination, or passive immunity (injected immune globulin)
<tr><td>core antibody   <td>anti-HBc 
  <td><ul><li>if IgM, indicates infection in last six months
   <li>if IgG, infection may or may not persist:  positive HBsAg and anti-HBc IgG
     indicate a chronic infection</ul>
<tr><td>e antigen  <td>HBeAg  <td>High level of viral replication
<tr><td>anti-e antibody <td>anti-HBe  <td>low rate of viral replication correlated
<tr><td>DNA        <td>  <td>active replication, useful in monitoring response
to treatment
</table>

<p>
Interpretation of test results (positive or negative) can provide information
about what stage or level of infection is occurring or has occurred.  These
are given in the table below.

<tr><td>&mdash;HBsAg     <br>&mdash;anti-HBc  <br>&mdash;antiHBs
    <td>&mdash;negative  <br>&mdash;positive  <br>&mdash;negative
   <td> Four possible interpretations:
   <ol>
   <li>patient recovering from acute infection
   <li>patient possible distantly immune: very low anti-HBs not detected
   <li>patient may be susceptible (false&nbsp;positive anti-HBc)
   <li>undetectable level of HBsAg: actually a carrier
   </ol>
</table>
<p>
Acute infection is subclinical. in 7 in 10 adults and 9 in 10 children younger
than 5.  Incbuation is from 1-4 months.  Nausea, anorexia, fatigue, low-grade
fever, right upper quadrant or epigastric pain is observed.  Liver function
changes (jaundice) occur as the disease resolves.  Serum ALT and AST can range
from several hundred to 20,000 IU/L, rising 1-2 weeks before jaundice is
evident.  Bilirubin usually &lt; 20 mg/dl.  More severe disease shows increases
in prothrombin time, decreases in serum albumin.  Liver injury is cytotoxic
immune response to virus, not by virus itself.  In 1% of infections, a fulminant
hepatic failure occurs from hepatocellular necrosis: in an exaggerated immune
response, there is hepatic decompensation with encephalopathy and coagulopathy;
mortality is high without liver transplantation.
<p>
If HBsAg levels remain high for &gt; 6 months, chronic infection is suspected.
In addition serum HBV DNA is estimated at 100,000 copies/ml, there is persistent
or intermittent ALT and AST levels, and liver biopsy shows a necroinflammatory
score &ge; 4.  In some individuals HBsAg level remain positive for &gt; 6 months,
but HBeAg is negative while anti-HBe is positive and DNA is &lt; 100,000 copies
per ml, while AST and ALT are persistently normal and liver biopsy shows no
hepatitis:  this is the <b>HBsAg carrier state</b>.
<p>
<b>Four stages</b>.  Infection by HBV is thought to occur in four stages:
<ol>
<li><b>immune tolerant phase</b>: high HBV DNA levels of replication, HBeAg
positivity, normal serum transaminase levesl; this is incubation before the
immune response takes over;  if infection occurs in neonates, this stage
can last for years to decades, since the immune system acquires tolerance
<li><b>immune response phase</b>:  inflammatory response involving active
destruction of HBV-infected cells, with elevated transaminase levels; if
persisting beyond 6 months, infection regarded as chronic; high risk of 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; also conditions such as polyarteritis
nodosa (systemic vasculitis) and membranous or membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis occur.
<li><b>inactive carrier state</b>:  active viral replication ceases as
HBeAg becomes negative, and anti-HBe becomes detectable.  Transaminase levels
return to normal.
<li><b>immune stage</b>:  HBsAg should clear with DNA undetectable; reactivation
or reinfection uncommon.  this occurs in 3% of HBV-infected people annually.
</ol>
<p>
1 in 8 patients with chronic hepatitis will develop cirrhosis each year, and
a smaller percentage get hepatocellular carcinoma.  Lifetime risk of death from
cirrhosis or liver cancer is 15-25%.  These complications do not arise from
virus but from immune-mediate inflammatory response.  Screening by &alpha;-fetoprotein
or ultrasonography for hepatocellular carcinoma is controversial.\
<p>
HBV vaccine programs have reduced acute hepatitis B in U.S. from 300,000 cases
per year in U.S. to 79,000.  Vaccination is recommened fro all children and
adolescents, adults in certain groups, health care workers, and other high
risk groups.  three injections produce antibodies in 9 in 10 adults.
<p>
If pregnant women show positive for HBsAg at first prenatal visit, the HBV
immune globulin and an HBV vaccine to infants within 12 h of birth.  Perinatal
transmission has a risk of 10% if mother is HBsAg-positive, and 90% if she
is HBeAg-positive.
<p>
<b>Chronic HBV Infection</b>.  When patients are positive for HBsAg, the 
chronically infective state should be distinguished from the carrier state.
Laboratory tests to be done should include those looking for liver disease:
transaminases (AST, ALT), bilirubin, albumin; hematology: CBC, PT; HBV panel:
anti-HBc, anti-HDV, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-HCV, HBV DNA, anti-HAV (IgG or
total); AFP.  HIV testing panel should also be done.  High risk patients should
have hepatic US.  If a patient meets conditions for chronic hepatitis B, 
liver biopsy should be done to determine grade and stage of disease.  Tests for
other sexually transmitted diseases should be done;  assessment of family history
of hepatocellular carcinoma; counseling on safe sex practices and abstinence
from alcohol; serology for HAV and vaccination if not immune; also sexual and
household contacts be done.   Chronic HBV infection is indicated if:
<ol>
<li>HBeAg is positive and ALT &gt; 2&times; normal
<li>HBV DNA is detected and ALT &gt; 2&times; normal
<li>There is moderate to severe hepatitis on liver biopsy
<li>HBV DNA is detected and there is cirrhosis (note: IF-&alpha;<sub>2b</sub>
should not be used in treatment if there is decompensated cirrhosis)
</ol>
<p>
<b>Therapy</b>.  FDA-approved treatments for chronic HBV are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Recombinant IF-&alpha;<sub>2b</sub></b> (Intron A)<br>
An immunomodulator that upregulates cytokines involved in responding to cells 
showing evidence of being infected by viruses or parasites.  Predictors of 
effective treatment indications include low HBV DNA, elevated transaminases, 
no fibrosis in liver biopsy specimens, absence of HIV coinfection, and female
patient. Pre-existing neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, severe uncontrolled 
depression, decompensated cirrhosis, current alcohol or drug abuse are 
contraindications for this treatment.  Significant side effects make tolerance
a problem.  Half of treated patients show HBeAg seroconversion in first year;
8 in 100 show development of anti-HBs.  5- and 10-year followup studies show
that 80-95% are negative for HBeAg.  Asians and infants are a high risk group
showing low response.  However, there is reduction in mortality from 
hepatocellular carcinoma in Asian patients, and decrreased mortality from 
decompensated cirrhosis in North American and European patients.
<li><b>Lamivudine</b> (Epivir)<br>
Used to treat HIV, this nucleoside analog was approved for HBV in 1999.
Inhibits reverse transcriptase competitively and thus proviral DNA chain
replication.  Studies have demonstrated its ability to reduce HBV DNA and
transaminase levels and loss of detectability of HBeAg in adults with
chronic hepatitis B.  Lamivudine can be administered orally 
(IF&alpha;<sub>2b</sub> requires IV administration); it has high degree
of tolerability; it is safe with patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
Can be used as first treatment, or subsequent to interferon failure.
More information is needed about duration of therapy and long-term durability
of response.  HBV-resistant strains do emerge (15-20% per year of therapy),
although the mutants are not as infective as wild-type.
<li><b>Adefovir dipivoxil</b> (Hepsera)<br>
A nucleoside analog emerging for lamivudine-resistant HBV, approved for use
in 2002.  In one study, two groups of patients, negative and positive for 
HBeAg were treated for 48 weeks and histologic, virologic, and biochemical
markers followed.  No strains emerged resistant to this.  As a treatment,
its role has not been determined as first line monotherapy, combination
therapy. or salvage against lamivudine resistance.  Its tolerability and
oral administration make it likely to replace IF-&alpha;<sub>2b</sub>.

Hairpin Primers for Simplified Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Analysis of
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and Other Organisms
<p class="Para1">
SNP analysis is important to understand drug resistance, evolution,
molecular epidemilogy.  Best SNP should be simple to design, easy to perform,
easy to automate, be high throughput, and low cost.  DNA sequencing and
derivations, microarray, allele-specific ampliflication, MS-based analysis,
TaqMan probes, molecular beacons, are a tradeoff.  The <b>amplification
refractory mutation</b> (ARMS) method is a good starting point to design
SNP assays.  It uses the fact that <i>Taq</i> polymerase cannot extend
targets mismatched at 3&prime; end.  Two sets of primers, one set conserved
and the other set variable (SNP-specific) are used.  Two PCR assays must be
done, one with reference wildtype and other with mutant/variant.  The matching
set should show a lower <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> value than the mismatched set.
To improve the problems with the ARMS approach, stem-loop probes can given
enhanced abilities to distinguish SNP alleles;  this is seen with molecular
beacons.  SNP-specific primers are now hairpinned in accordance with molecular
beacon principles and improve SNP typing.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>.  Chromosomal DNA from bacterial isolates is obtained by CTAB
method (van Embden et al, JCM 31: 406, 1993). H37Rv is reference wildtype.
Isolates I-524 (S315I), M-5036 (S315N), and M-5455 (S315T) are all
<i>katG</i> mutants are used for SNP typing.  Other isolates for typing are
in Table 1.  The ABi 7900HT sequence detector with 384-well block for qPCR is
used.  Touchdown PCR is used as follows:  95&deg; 10 min, 70&deg; 30 s for
enzyme activiation;  95&deg; 20 s, 69&deg; 30 s, and 72&deg; 30 s stage 2,
and lowering 1&deg; C in annealing step for every cycle for 10 cycles, and
then 40 cycles of 95&deg; 20 s, 60&eg; 30 s, and 72&deg; 30s (stage 3).  Fluorescence
is read during anneal step.  Wells are loaded with 0.15 U Amplitqa Gold enzyme,
2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 &micro;M primers, 1&times; SYBR Green I, 0.5 &micro;M
ROX (6-carboxy-X-rhodamine succinimidyl ester, reference dye) and 0.1 ng DNA or
10<sup>5</sup> molecules artificial template or water (no-DNA control).  Final
volume is 5 &micro;l.  Table 1 shows the primers used.  There is the standard
linear primer, then the 5&prime; end tail sequences for the hairpin (HP),
substituted linearized hairpin (LHP) and substituted extended linear hairpin (ELHP).
The constant primer sequence is also given.  Amplicons are designed to be
short (30-90 bp) and anneal between 60-65&deg;.  The 5&prime; end addition of
sequence is intended to produce a stem with the 3&prime; end.  The software
mfold is used to make a hairpin with <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> of 67-70&deg; and
&Delta;<i>G</i> of &minus;0.5 to &minus;2.0.  Plates are loaded with 5 &micro;l
SNP-specific and constant primer mix and dried down.  The 5&micro;l PCR
cocktail are loaded into plates, plates vortexed and then centrifuged before
loading to robot of sequence detector system.  Since a single codon might contain
two SNP changes, making four possible alleles, for the <i>katG</i> 315 allele
a single HP wildtype and three alternatives are constructed.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  6 clinical isolates were tested for 7 isonazid-resistance
SNPs.  A linear primer ARMS assay detected SNP in only 7 of 13 (one inccrrect,
five indeterminate) while the HP assay correctly found the SNP in all 13 cases.
The hairpin also was more sensitive.  The &Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> are larger
in the hairpin than the linear primer assays.  If the better ability of the
hairpin is because of extended 5&prime; tail as opposed to the stem-loop
design, then a <q>linearized</q> hairpin can be creatd by mutating the 5&prime;
tail of each HP primer so that it no longer has a stem with the 3&prime; end:
these were designed so they cannot have 2&deg; structure and also ahve same
GC content as HPs.   The LHP assay results were intermediate between HP and
LP, with &Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> averaging 1.7 cycles less than HP.  The
5&prime; end tail length was then doubled (ELHPs) to see if performance could be
affected more.  Results were similar to LHP values and EHLP had improved
&Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> with an average similar to those being the average
of HP reactions, although the standard deviation of &Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i>
was smaller for HP than ELHP.  A second base mismatch was also tested, with a
mismatch in the loop or at the end of the stem, and also keeping GC content
constant.  Secondary mismatches resulted in later <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> values
for both the match and mismatch and &Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> values were
improved by 1.1, 0.2, 2.1 and 0.8 cycles for LP, HP, LHP, and ELHP, respectively.
Testing the double SNP change in the same codon (<i>katG</i> 315 codon),
four possible HPs were used: mismatched HPs had much later <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>
than singly mismatched primers.
<p>
For 207 SNPs in <i>M tuberculosis</i> 98 HPs were constructed to detect them.
After the tests, 91 HP primers could be used (many included a secondary mutation)
and they detect 191 SNPs in <i>katG, kasA, ahpC, inhA, mabA, ndh</i> genes of
MtB.  Assays detecting indels use the same principles.  Four cycles of HP design
were necessary to get to the 91 of 98 figure:  the first was only 71, the 2nd
was 82, and the third was 87.  It was shown that as little as 50 fg chromosomal
DNA per well was sufficient to produce results, although 100 ng/well gives
more reliable amplification curves.  Short amplicons may account for better
sensitivities.

Simple Technique for Internal Control of Real-Time Amplification Assays
<p class="Para1">
False negatives in real time PCR might result from amplification inhibitors.
Inhibitors such as hemoglobin, EtOH, detergents (SDS) can affect amplificaiton
efficiency.  Inhibitors are checked by using a positive or internal control
with sample after its purification.  If this is done for all samples, it doubles
the cost in time and material.  These controls cannot also account for false
negatives arising from failed extractions.  Internal controls which have
plasmid sequences similar but not identical to the target might be used as
controls.

mismatches with detection probe are underlined
</table>
<p>
The internal control oligonucleotides (ICOs) are designed to consist of
primer and probe binding regions for the target DNA.  Mismatches are introduced
in the detection probe to reduce melting temperature of the detection probe
ICO hybrids.  In a separate room prepare the ICOs in 1 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0 and
10 &micro;M EDTA pH 8.0.  These are diluted to 5000 molecules per &micro;l
in TrisEDTA and stored.  Generally ICO in the sample is as low as possible
to minimize competition in low titer samples  For HBV, HSV, and VZV assays
6000 to 62,500 copies / ml or 60-625 copies per reaction in a 10 &micro;l
assay were used, added before DNA extraction.  For MTB, 1500 ICO copies / reaction
are used.  DNA is extracted with AMPLICOR respiratory specimen kit:  first
decontamined with NaOH/NAc-Cys, then 100 &micro;l miex with 1 ml RW washing buffer
then centrifuged.  Sediment is resuspended in 100 &micro;l RL alkaline lysis
buffer and heated 60&deg; for 45 min.  100 &micro;l RN neutralization is added.
VZV, HSV1, and HSV2 were extracted from lyophilized INSTAND proficiency testing
service: 1 ml water added, then 200 &micro;l processed through QIAamp DNA
Blood Mini Kit.  Same reagents used to isolate HBV DNA from 200 &micro;l plasma.
PCR was done in 20 &micro;l assay for MTBC and 10 &micro;l for others.  The
10 &micro;l reaction has 5 pmol primer, 2 pmol probes, 2 &micro;l FastSTart
DNA Hybridization reagent and then 2.5 &micro;l DNA sample.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  ICOs are designed mismatches for the amplicon so that the
melting temperature for detection probe is lower.  They should not produce
a fluorescence signal during amplification if the <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> is
lower than the temperature at which fluorescence is measured.  During melting
point analysis at the end of the amplification, the ICO-probe hybrids will
show a lower melting point whereas the positive samples show a higher
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.  A second ICO-specific melting point peak at lower
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> might be present in the positive sample if the ICO concentration
is too high or the analyte DNA is too low or even absent.  As the ICO competes
with analyte DNA, it is usually not amplified in those samples.  The table
above shows the melting temperatures between the hybrids formed between
template and detection probe vs. ICO.  The <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> is usually
&gt; 5&deg;.  Such a differenc prevents control from producing detectable
fluorescence at the step of measurement during amplification and lets control
and target be distinguished during melting analysis.
<p>
As ICO competition might alter sensitivity of the assay, a MtB DNA dilution
series was done with and w/o ICO.  At 5000 GE/reaction and sample with lowest
concentration at 25 GE/reaction there is no difference in sensitivity.
For the melting analysis both the no MtB and low MtB GE had an ICO peak of
49&deg;.  The higher MtB GE sample, there was no ICO amplification.  Both
hybridization probes had similar <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values so no distinct
melting peak is seen.  A broad 59-65&deg; peak and the shape changes with the
amount of template DNA.
<p>
5 clinical sample testing positive had also been tested by microscopy, culture,
and two different commercial aasays (Roche AMPLICOR and Becton Dickinson ProbeTec).
Two were scored negative by microscopy (low titer of bacterial cells)  An
ICO-specific <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> was seen in these negative samples and in
two of the positive samples; this result is explained in a future manuscript.
<p>
ICOs were then used for HBV, HSV, and VZV assays. For HBV, test samples are
dilution series of from strongly positive sample. 62,500 ICO molecules/ml were
added to each dilution before DNA extraction. Positivity was found in the HBV
assay with as little as 10 HBV GE per reaction, with no changes in sensitivity
cause by ICO presence. Inhibition was simulated by the presence of 100 mg/ml
(10% w/v) EtOH to reaction with 10 HBV GE in a reaction tube. No signal during
amplification was seen. Melting point analysis shows HBV melting peak at 65&deg;
 for all positive samples, while an ICO peak at 50&deg; was found for lower HBV
copy number samples and from two negative samples and a negative control.
IMPORTANT:  if no amplification occurs in the sample and no low <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>
value is seen in melting analysis, then it is most likely a false negative.

Hepatitis B virus genotypes: comparison of genotyping methods
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Eight genotypes of HBV from A to H are based on nucleotide 
variation with differences of 8% or more.  Serological subtyping is based on
immunoreactivity to HBsAg.  Relationships between serology subtypes and genotypes
have been assessed.  Geographical distribution shows Genotype A in N. Europe,
America and India.  Genotypes B and C distribute in Asia and Pacific.  Genotype
D is mostly in Mediterranean, Near East, large parts of former USSR and India.
Genotype E is Africa.  Genotypes F and H prevalent in S. and C. America.
Genotype G is in France, Germany, USA, and Mexico, although presumed to
originate from C. America.  Most divergence is in Genotype F (original New
World strain); it is closely related to woolly monkey HBV which is also quite
divergent.  Multiple genotype infections have been reported.  Recombination between
two genotypes was reported:  HBV/Ba is a chimera of genotypes B and C where majority
of framework is genotype B except for the basal core promoter (BCP/precore/core)
region corresponding to genotype C.  Recombination crossover points would be found
between nt 1740 and 1838 in the 5&prime; terminus, and between nt 2443-2485
in 3&prime; terminus.  The recombiant HBV is all through Asia except in Japan.
Another B/C recombinant was described with crossover poitns between nt 1260-1639.
Recombinant crossover points for HBV genome A/D chimera is found in PreS1/PreS1/S
regions.
<p>
Genotypes B, C, F, and H are 3215 bp long.  Genotype D is 3182 bp long:  has a 
33 nt deletion in PreS1 (spacer region of polymerase gene).  Genotypes E and G
have 3 nt deletion in same region as polymerase.  Genotype A has a 6 bp insert 
in the terminal protein region of polymerase gene and in the overlapping core
gene.  Genotype G has a 36 nt insertion in N-terminus of core gene (3248 bp long).
<p>
The G1896A substitution in the precore sequence is a distinguishing feature causing
a stop at codon 28 (pcW28stop), resulting in loss of HBeAg expression.  G1896
will base-pair with nt 1858, being a T nucleotide in genotypes B, D, E, G, and
some subtypes in genotype C.  The mutation causes stabilization of epsilon structure.
This stop mutation rarely seen in genotype A, F, and strains of C since this is a
cytidine base at 1858.  The basal core promoter (BCP) controls transcription of 
two products, which are translated into precore HBeAg, core proteins HBcAg, and
polymerase.  BCP mutations at positions 1762 and 1764 affect the ratio of transcripts
causing a pre-C/C mRNA ratio, leading to reduced HBeAg synthesis and enhanced virion
production.  Such mutations in BCP are reported in genotypes A and C, less frequently
in B and D, except for a study in Greek patients showing it.
<p>
Genotype G contains an extra 36 nt at the N-terminus of the core protein.  Genotype
A has two amino acids (D153 and R154) at the C terminus.  This insertion also present
for the gene encoding the terminal protein in the overlapping reading frame.
The core protein sequence between residues 18-27 (FLPSDFFPSV/I) represent a major
HLA class I CTL epitope.  Note that genotype C and variants of B and F have an isoleucine
at codon 27, the other valine.
<p>
Three envelope proteins are coded by the genome:  preS1 (L), pres2 (M), and S. 
Genotypes D and A isolates show a truncation of 11 amino acids in PreS1; similar 
deletion in chimpanzee.  Genotypes E and G have single amino acid deletion at 
codon 11.  Deletions in PreS1 are located in spacer region of polymerase gene in 
overlapping reading frame.
<p>
Comparative genomic analysis is possible as a number of mammalian orthohepadna 
viruses have been sequenced.  Nonhuman primate viruses show close relatedness. 
Distinct clades are formed in HBV genotypes from these animals.  These are 
HBVcpz (chimpanzee), HBVgor (gorilla), HBVgbn (gibbon) and HBVoru (orangutan). 
Chimpanzee and gibbons show relationship with human HBV genotypes D and E.
<p>
The numbering of nucleotides and nomenclature of genotype is affected by
insertions and deletions relative to the <i>Eco</i>RI restriction site within
PreS2. This site is found in genotypes A and some of D and H. Genotype H
(GenBank Acc AY090459) starts numbering at the first G. Mutations do not affect
numbering. A nomenclature was developed to deal with issues related to
differences in polymerase protein length of the various genotypes. This system
defined the reverse transcriptase start region to be consistent for all
genotypes. Mutations within the ORFs should also be preceded with the protein
name in lowercase and abbreviated as follows: ps1, ps2, s, x, c, rt, tp, rh.
Another nomenclature would be to indicate nucletotide and amino acid numbering
at the start of each ORF. Numbering would be by amino acids at the start by
default, and for nucleotides by using <span class="tt">nt_</span>: thus <span
class="tt">nt_pcA1</span> is the first nucleotide of the precore gene.
Advantages: (i) mutations are discussed relevant to gene of interest (ii)
arbitrary <i>Eco</i>RI start designation does not alter major mutations (iii)
with new genotypes identified, insertions/deletions within first 1900 nt do not
affect new numbering, (iv) problems describing mutations (incl. insertions and
deletions) are overcome, particularly in the PreS2 region or within spacer of
the polymerase in the overlapping reading frame spanning the <i>Eco</i>RI site.
The numbering system allows nucleotide of gene interest to be located.
<p>
In the new system promoter regions are described relative to the transcriptional
start.  This is usually 25-30 bp downstream from the TATA consensus and 20-100
nt from the AUG translational start.  But the 5&prime; UTR of precore mRNA 
and pregenomic mRNA are heterogeneous.  Primer extension shows only one 
transcriptional start for the pregenomic (1819) and one from the precore (1788).
Thus the notation for all genotypes the major BCP mutations at A1762T and
G1764A relative to precore transcriptional start it nt_RNApcA(-26)T and 
nt_RNApcG(-24)A.  The precore stop mutation at G1896A is nt_pcG83A.
<p>
HBV genotyping is done definitively by PCR amplification and sequencing of entire
genome, followed by phylogenetic analysis.  The analysis is the method for finding
relative and evolutionary relatedness of sequences to each other and to controls.
Phylogenetic tree and statistical analysis reliability can be tested by bootstrap
analysis using 1000 replicates: problem is that it is time-consuming, expensives,
and needs expertise to interpret algorithms for phylogenetic analysis.
<p>
Analysis at the gene level has been described, particularly for S gene.  In a 
two-round nested amplification, an OS1 sense primer and antisense OS2 primer 
produce amplicon 1 which is then targeted by JM sense primer and then OS2 on the 
reverse.  These primers are also sequencing primers, along with Seq2.  The 
program Seq-HepB was developed to analyze HBV.  Pairwise analysis is done with 
small window size between test sequence and representatives for genotypes.  The 
assay used for sequencing analysis lacks sensitivity:  PCR cloning leading to 
sequence analysis finds only the predominant species where minor species can 
also be present.  To overcome the limitation requires screening &gt; 100 clones.
Other methods which target conserved sequences include RFLP, single genotype-specific
primers, multiplex PCR for simultaneous multi-genotype analysis, and hybridization
techniques.  Serology-based tests are included.
<p>
<b>RFLP</b>.  In one test the amplicon of the S gene is digested.  Enzymes used
include <i>Hph</i>I, <i>Nci</i>I, <i>Alw</i>I, <i>Ear</i>I, and <i>Nla</i>I.
SNPs can interfere with the reliability of the genotyping if it occurs within
a key restriction site.
<p>
<b>Single or Multiplex PCR With Specific Primers</b>.  One group developed 
specific primers for genotypes A to F based on conserved bases within the 
envelope ORFs (PreS1 to S).  Round 1 amplification produces an amplicon of any 
of the six genotypes, and is then split for two Round 2 reactions which 
determine which of the six, in which amplicon length sets the genotype.  Another 
group developed multiplex PCR for distinguishing A-F genotypes.  Six primer 
pairs specific for each genotype amplify in a single amplification.  Sensitivity 
is 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> ge/ml;  to increase sensitivity a prior round
of whole genome amplification can be done.
<p>
<b>Hybridization</b>.  Innogenetics has developed genotyping hybridization strips.
DNA isolation from patient samples containing putative HBV DNA are amplified with
primers to conserved bases in PreS1 region, and these are hybridized with genotypic
specific oligos immobilized on membrane strips.  Only genotypes A, D, and F
are detected;  confirmation by serotyping was also done.
<p>
<b>Serotyping</b>.  Specific monoclonals to PreS2 and S regions will distinguish
A through F.  These mAbs can be used in EIA and thus large scale studies.  EIA
results were confirmed by sequencing the S gene for 68 HBV strains, with 100%
matching.  For purposes of genotyping however, a full sequence and phylogenetic
analysis should be done.  In addition, good methods for identifying and classifying
new genotypes should be forthcoming.
<p>
One problem that has emerged is assessing titer after vaccination.  The WHO
reference anti-HBs to <i>ayw</i> and <i>adr</i> shows 2- to 3-fold less binding
than to <i>adw</i>.  PCR-based HBV assays also have problems if there are 
mismatches at the 3&prime; end since that is the true primer position (false
negatives can arise).  Search for conserved primer pairs for PCR showed that
current procedures would cause failures to detect many genotypes.  There are
some references that will detect all genotypes.
<p>
<b>Genotype-Natural History of Infection Association</b>.  A relationship between
Genotype C and prevalence of cirrhosis and HCC in patients &gt; age 50 has been
found.  Genotype B has been associated with HCC in patients &lt; age 50.
Cirrhosis has been found in patients in greater number with Genotype C than
Genotype B.  HBeAg is detectable more frequently with genotype C than with B, 
and anti-HBe is detected more frequently in patients with Genotype B and C.
BCP mutations A1762T/G1764A were associated with Genotype C compared with B.
The precore mutation G1896A (creating stop codon) is found with similar frequency
in B and C.  Genotypes A and D are prevalent in India.  Patients with D had
more severe disease, developed HCC, and were younger than patients with Genotype
A.  Genotype A patients had the lowest recurrence.
<p>
<b>Genotype and Antiviral Therapy Response</b>.  100 mg daily dosing of 
IFN-&alpha; or lamivudine are the current therapy.  Patients with Genotypes
C and D have a lower response rate to IFN-&alpha; compared to A and B.  
Genotypes C has a higher frequency of BCP mutations and higher serum ALT 
compare to B.  Genotype B show higher response to IFN-&alpha;.  IFN-&alpha;
has no correlation to genotype but rather to nt 1746 in the BCP region and other
positions in BCP.  Better response by Genotypes A and B may correlate with 
faster rate of mutations in BCP of Genotypes C and D.
<p>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>.<br>
<b>Methodology</b>.  All genotyping methods ultimately require whole genome 
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, and new and recombinant genotypes can only
be identified this way.
<p>
<b>Nomenclature</b>.  A system that includes both nucleotide and amino acid level
differences should be created.  This system numbers the mutations from a reference
point of the gene of interest.  For mutations in the noncoding region (upstream
in the promoter), the use of translation and not transcriptional start is better,
since there is clear heterogeneity in transcriptional start.   Since insertions
and deletions occur in various genotypes, the genotype itself must be part of the
nomenclature.
<p>
<b>Reference Standards</b>.  No reference plasma for test kit standardization
and quality of all HBV genotypes exists.  Thus in-house and commercial nucleic
acid amplification techniques cannot be validated for sensitivity to genotype
differences.  HBV genome accession numbers representing genotypes are shown.

Validation of housekeeping genes for normalizing RNA expression in real-time PCR
<p class="Para1">
The error in quantitating RNA expression can come from a number of sources:
the sample input, extraction of RNA, reverse transcription and so on.  One approach
can be to normalize RNA to control error, but this requires good RNA quantitation
method and does not account for variation in reverse transcription.  The widely
used method is normalizing to internal reference or housekeeping gene.  When
choosing a housekeeping gene, it is important to establish first that it does not
fluctuate under a variety of phenotypic conditions.  &beta;-actin and GAPDH
have been classic choices but recent evidence shows they are inappropriate.
RT qPCR was used to study 13 housekeeping genes expressed in whole blood and
PBMC cultue of healthy persons and TB patients. Houskeeping genes thought to
be invariant in T cell culture were selected.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b> 28 clinical samples from 4 patients with smear-positive
pulmonary TB and 4 healthy volunteers.  Patients had high variablility with
respect to race, sex, and age.  20 ml whole blood taken and 2.5 ml processed
on PreAnalytiX PAXgene blood RNA tubes to set up the mRNA expression profile.
Balance of blood put in heparinized container and kept at 37&deg; 4 h after
which 2.5 ml transferred to PAXgene tube.  PTB patient blood layered on Ficoll_Paque
gradient to get PBMC, where were cultured in RPMI 5% human AB serum, Gln, +
pen-strep at 1 million per ml in 0.5 ml culture in 24-well plates.  Cells given
TB antigen and harvested at baseline and day 2 or 3.  Day 4/5 sample also taken.
BrdU was added as response to phytohemagluttinin addition.  10 genes were
selected for testing as housekeeping genes which include &beta;-actin and
GADPH.  Another groups of genes were among 47 of 535 maintenance genes seen by
microarray data to be stable in 11 different human tissues.  The aim is to
find a housekeeping gene that has minimal variability under experiemental
conditions.  Some genes are low copy number cytokines.  To be suitable as a
reference gene, the mean expression level should have a std deve &lt; 2-fold
to be qualified as a reference gene. Ribosomal unit RNAs are not used because
oligo(dT) is a primer for cDNA synthesis and random hexamers overestimate mRNA
copy by up to 19-fold.  RNA was isolated using a PreAnalytiX PAXgene blood
RNA kit.  RNeasy Mini was used for PBMC, and all sampled DNase-treated.  RNA
was examined on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer/RNA 6000 Nano Labchip for blood RNA
and RNA 6000 Pico Labchip for culture RNA.  1-5 &micro;g RNA was taken from
blood and 0.1-0.8 &micro;g from 50,000 PBMCs  600 ng RNA from PTB patients,
400 ng from healthy controls, and 3 ng from culture reactions were used
with Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (blood RNA) or Sensiscript Reverse
Transcriptase (culture RNA) in 60 &micro;l reactions to make cDNA.  15 and 0.1
ng of the reverse transcription product from blood and culture RNA, respectively,
were used with ABi Prism 7700 using a TaqMan setup.  The 18S rRNA was omitted
in the use of the kit.  Primers were at 0.5 &micro;M and probes at 0.3 &micro;M
in 50 &micro;l.  The fold difference between internal reference gene relative
to a calibrator is = 2<sup>&minus;&Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i></sup> when PCR efficiency
is close to 100%.
<p>
<b>Results</b>. Group 1 and 2 (total 16) housekeeping genes were assessed in
blood RNA using 16 blood samples:  4 healthy + 4 TB patients &times; two
time points (4 hours apart).   Fold changes were determined along with standard
deviations.  The most stable was a Group 1 and 2 gene, human acidic ribosomal
protein (<i>HuPO</i>): average fold-change &lt; 2 and maximum variability
&lt; 5-fold.  GADPH, &beta;-actin, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
(<i>HPRT</i>) showed far more variability (20- to 25-fold).  Genes did not differ
from each other temporally in expression however:  between 4 h for 13 genes
fold-change = 1.37 &times; 0.33 times.  For PBMCs the same studies show both
<i>HuPO</i> and <i>HPRT</i> as having the least variability (&lt; 2-fold).
The most variable are GADPH, &beta;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin, &beta;-actin,
and EF-1&alpha;.

Acute hepatitis B virus infection in Turkey: epidemiology and genotype 
distribution
<p class="Para1">
ABSTRACT.  The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) genotypes in Turkey. Epidemiological and clinical data for 158 
patients with acute HBV infection from 22 medical centres in the period February 
2001 to February 2002 were collected prospectively. HBV genotyping was based on 
analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms and nested PCR. There were 
59 female and 99 male patients, with a mean age of 34.2 +/- 15.6 years. The most 
common probable transmission route was blood contact in 63 (41.1%) cases, but 
was unknown in 78 (49.4%) cases. The mean alanine aminotransferase level was 
1718 +/- 1089 IU/L. Four of the 158 patients (2.5%) died because of fulminant 
hepatitis. One year after discharge, 11 (10.6%) of 103 cases were positive for 
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 80 (77.7%) were positive for anti-HBsAg. 
Genotype determination was unsuccessful in 11 cases because of a negative PCR; 
genotype D was found in the remaining 147 cases. The results suggested that 
acute HBV infection constitutes a significant health problem in Turkey and that 
genotype D is predominant.

Distinguishing hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype D from non-D by a simple PCR
<p class="Para1 abstract">
ABSTRACT. Different HBV genotypes have characteristic geographical distribution, 
which is important epidemiologically. HBV strains have been classified into 
eight different genotypes (A-H) on the basis of &gt;8% differences in the entire 
genomic sequence. Genotypes A and D are predominant in Europe, Africa, and the 
USA, genotypes B and C are restricted to East Asia, genotype E is found in 
Africa, and genotype F is found in indigenous populations in Central and South 
America. Genotype D is prevalent in the Turkish population. HBV genotype D shows 
a 33-bp deletion in the pre-S1 region that accounts for their smaller genomic 
size (3182 bp). This deletion can be used to facilitate the identification of 
genotype D. A primer in the pre-S1 region was designed to discriminate genotype 
D from non-D by PCR. Sixty genotype D (40 acute and 20 chronic) and 4 genotype A 
sera identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were included 
in the study. Using this simple PCR method, all genotype D sera were identified 
correctly and the test was able to detect HBV DNA at 1000 genomes per ml. An 
advantage of this method is that it can differentiate in a mixture of genotypes 
(genotype D from non-D) provided that one isn't present below 1 x 10(4) 
copies/ml. In conclusion this method is rapid (approximately 5h) and it will 
contribute to the epidemiological study of HBV in high prevalence areas of 
genotype D. It can also differentiate between genotype D from non-D in cases of 
co-infection.

Dual-Probe Assay for Rapid Detection of Drug-Resistant <i>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</i> by Real-Time PCR
<p class="Para1">
Major anti-TB drugs are isonizad (INH), rifampin (RIF), and ethambutol (EMB).
&gt;95% RIF resistance is a mutation in 81 bp core of the <i>rpoB</i> gene.
INH resistance is associated with several genes:  <i>katG, inhA, oxyR,
ahpC</i>. 30-65% of strains have a change in codon 315 (Ser).  70% of EMB-resistant
have change in codon 306 of <i>embB</i>.  Drug susceptibility is tested by
culture at different concentrations of anti-TB drug.  TaqMan minor groove
binder probes can detect 1-bp mismatches and SNPs.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b> DNA from 24 <i>Mycobacterium</i> species all ATCC-registered
were extracted along with nonmycobacterial controls.  DNA from drug resistant
clinical isolates was extracted using chloroform and mechanical methods (see
citation).  A QIAamp DNA Mini kit was used for nonmycobacterial species.  Sputum
was collected from 27 patients with pulmonary TB and drug susceptbility tested
on these.  The NAc-Cys/NaOH decontamination was done and basic fuchsin (Ziehl-Neelsen)
staining done.  DNA on sputum was extracted with AMPLICOR prep kits and AMPLICOR
also run.  For designing primers for PCR, GenBank L27989, U68480, and X68081
were used for genes <i>rpoB, embB,</i> and <i>katG</i> respectively.  Both the
strands of PCR amplicons were sequenced for <i>rpoB</i> and <i>embB</i>.  Internal
primers had to be used for sequencing the longer <i>katG</i> gene.  TaqMan
probes were designed using Primer Express (ABi)  Four of 8 probes were FAM-labeled
and other four were VIC-labeled (see table below for all sequences used).
Real-time PCR was 25 &micro;l with half of volume ABi Universal Master Mix;
1 &micro;M primers,  5 ng DNA if pure or 1 &micro;l extract. Probes concentrations
are in table.  Amplification in ABi 7700 was 50&deg; 2 min, 95&deg; 10 min, and
then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95&deg;, 1 min at 60&deg; (combined anneal+extension).
Fluorescence was expressed as &Delta;Rn (change in normalized reporter signal).
<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> = number of cycles to achieve certain luminescence intensity
in each probe (&Delta;Rn = 0.2).  If real-time PCR produced no signal, nested
PCR was done:  1 &micro;M of three kinds of primer sets (shown in the table),
1 M GC-rich solution, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 &micro;l template DNA
with primer pairs for <i>rpoB, katG, embB</i> creating 534-, 464-, and 408-bp
amplicons, respectively.  After 1st PCR, product is diluted 100-fold in water
and 1 &micro;l is used for real time PCR again.  To detect PCR inhibition,
an internal control oligo created by adding each <i>rpoB</i> primer to the
Lambda phage primer which is FAM-labeled on 5&prime; end TAMRA labeled on 3&prime;
end.  Some amplifications are run on 3% agarose in 1&times; TAE (100 V, 45 min).

<p>
<b>Results</b>.  Five probes were created to detect mutations in the <i>rpoB</i>
hot spot, which are the 81 nt between codons 507 and 533.   A control probe
was produced outside this hot spot both to identify <i>M tuberculosis</i> nad
quantify DNA.  Assay is basically four tubes:  three for control and RIF
resistance, and one tube for INH and EMB resistance.  All probes amplify with
the wild type:  where mutations occur, fluorescence signal does not increase
as it should during amplification.  To confirm that sufficient DNA is present,
16S rRNA or <i>dnaJ</i> primers were used to show signal.  Amplification was
quite specific:  other mycobacterial and non-mycobacterials species showed no
signal increase.  Sensitivity down to 100 fg was found for TB control probe
and <i>rpoB</i> primer set.  Mutations were detected with 250 fg TB genomic
DNA (<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> = 37).  If combined with nested PCR, detection down
to 10 fg was possible.
<p>
45 RIF-resistant lab strains were analyzed, and classed into 20 groups
based on the genotype discovered.  <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> values were higher
when mutations were found.  The <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> of an internal control
probe and the &Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> express the difference between
control and each MGB probe.  Probes hybridizing with the region without
mutations had low &Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> (&minus;2.44 to 1.61) and
&Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> is higher (&ge; 7) when mutations were in target
that should hybridize with MGB probe, and indicating that this
&Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> of high value is related with mutations in the
sequence.  No SNPs were observed in codons 510-514 of <i>rpoB</i>.  Clones
were constructed in codons 511 (CTG&rarr;CCG) and 513 (CAA&rarr;CTA), and when
used at templates in real-time PCR, the fluorescence had disappeared with use
of the rpo510/514 probe.   27 sputum samples were analyzed, with 25 of them
culture-positive and two culture-negative, with 9 being smear-positive and
18 being negative.  One sample had a <i>katG</i> mutation and another a
<i>rpoB</i>531/<i>katG</i>315/<i>embB</i>306 triple mutation.  All confirmed by
DNA sequencing.  16 of the 27 samples had strong fluorescence, 11 had none
even after 40 cycles:  since the internal probe control was positive for the
11 negative, it was not due to PCR inhibition but rather low sample DNA.
Primers for the three genes were added for standard PCR:  all primers to one
tube per sample.  After amplification, a nested real-time PCR was done.  All
27 samples could be detected, although the <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> value was
more variable, and &Delta;<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> was larger: &minus;3.40 to 3.15
compared to the pure DNA extracted from lab straing (&minus;2.44 to 1.61).

Comparison of the Real-Time PCR Method and the Gen-Probe Amplified
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Direct Test for Detection of <i>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</i> in Pulmonary and Nonpulmonary Specimens
<p class="Para1">
Up to this time culture has proven more sensitive than nucleic acid amplification
esp. of smear-negative tuberculosis.  This study compares real-time PCR to
the Gen-Probe Amplified <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Direct Test (AMTDII),
used on the ABi Prism SDS 7000.  100 specimens taken from 93 patients were
decontaminated with NAc-Cys/2% NaOH and then centrifuged  (3000 <i>g</i>, 20 min,
4&deg;).  Sediments are auramine-rhodamine fluorochrome-stained and inoculated
into Lowenstein-Jensen medium and antibiotic supplemented BacT/Alert MP culture.
Nonpulmonary from normally sterile are cultured without decontamination.  Balance
of specimen prepared for either AMTDII or qPCR.
<p>
The AMTDII performed by placing 450 &micro;l specimen in lysing solution and
taking 25 &micro;l for amplification (duplicate are processed). One specimen is 
spiked with MtB to check for inhibition. AMTDII is done with one negative and 
positive control, and run is valid when negative control is &lt;20,000 RLU and 
positive is &gt; 1,000,000 RLU. 500 &micro;l sample was used ideally (but 100 
&micro;l minimal) for the MagNA Pure LC DNA isolation kit III (Roche Mol 
Biochem). Primers and probe for IS<i>6110</i> (GenBank X52471) were designed 
with Primer Express: senseL 5&prime;-CCGAGGCAGGCATCCA-3&prime; (nt 1062 to 1077),
anti-sense: 5&prime;-GATCGTCTCGGCTAGTGCATT-3&prime; (nt 1112 to 1132). The
minor groove binder probe sequence was
6-carboxyfluorescein-5&prime;-TCGGAAGCTCCTATGAC-3&prime; (nt 1095 to 1111)
Amplifications were in 25 &micro;l with TaqMan Universal Master Mix with dUTP
and <i>uracil-N-glycosylae</i>, primers at 0.1 &micro;M, probe at 0.3 &micro;M,
and 5 &micro;l DNA extract.  Positive controls of 45 &micro;g/ml DNA from
Mt H37Rv genome at 10<sup>&minus;2</sup>, 10<sup>&minus;4</sup>, and 10<sup>&minus;6</sup>
were done.  QC was okay if negative control had no <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, and the
<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> of positive control was between 17-19, 25-27, and 33-35,
for the dilution series.  Amplification was 50&deg; 2 min and 95&deg; for 10 min,
the 45 cycles of 95&deg; 15 s and 60&deg; for 1 min.  Specimen types varied
from sputun to bronchial aspirate to bronchoalveolar lavage.  Nonpulmonary
included lymph node, tissues, urine, synovial fluid, abscess, and pleural fluid.
<p>
Results show the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
values of both tests.  In general real-time PCR maybe slight more sensitive,
as specific, and less susceptible to amplification inhibition than the AMDTII
assay.

Rapid Direct Detection of Multiple Rifampin and Isoniazid Resistance Mutations
in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in Respiratory Samples by Real-Time PCR
<p class="Para1">
To detect resistance more rapidly than waiting for susceptibility cultures to
grow, molecular characterization using real-time PCR may be more useful.
15 auramine-positive respiratory samples were also shown to be drug-resistant
M tuberculosis.  16 stain-positive samples which had non-resistant bacteria
were used as control comparisons.  Some negative sputum samples were spiked
with 10,000 CFU/ml of H37Rv (non resistant).  Of the rifampin resistance
studied, these were codons 511, 513-517 each, 526, 531, and 533 <i>rpoB</i>
mutants.  Substitutions in codon 315 of <i>katG</i> represented the INH mutants.
To check specificity (false positive) negative sputa were spiked with 10,000 CFU/ml
of six other mycobacterial species and eight nonmycobacterial species.  The
Becton-Dickinson SIRE method was used to detect INH and RIF susceptibility
of isolates.  DNA sequencing was done on the two genes using qPCR primers;
an ABi Prism 3100 sequencer was used.  500 &micro;l NAc-Cys/NaOH-treated sample
is centrifuged max speed for 15 min and pellet suspended in 50 &micro;l
Accuprobe reagent 1/2 mix (Gene Probe) and diluted in 1:16 MGIT (B-D) medium
and boiled 5 min. 25 &micro;l sterile 106 &micro;m glass beads are added and
this is sonicated 5 min:  DNA extract.  For real time PCR, FRET probe pairs,
RPO1 and RPO2 span the <i>rpoB</i> core region, and have the following properties:
RPO1, 5&prime;-CAGCTGAGCCAATTCATGGACC-FAM-3&prime; and
5&prime;-LCRed640-AACACCCCGCTGTCGGG-(P)-3&prime;; for RPO2,
5&prime;-ACAGACCGCCGGGCCCCAG-FAM-3&prime; and
5&prime;-LCRed705-CGACAGTCGGCGCTTGTGGGT-(P)-3&prime;.  These are cover the wild
type sequence.  Channels F2 (Red640) and F3 (Red705) were detection.  For
<i>katG</i> detection, probes were 5&prime;-GACGCGATCACCACAGGCATCGAGG-FAM-3&prime;
and 5&prime;-LCRed640-CGTATGGACGAACACCCCGACGAAATGG-(P)-3&prime;, detected in
channel F2.  Runs included water-only negative and sputum spiked with H37Rv as
positive.  Asymmetric PCR format helps to increase amount of target DNA complementary
to the FRET probes.  (Other primer sequences for sequencing the genes are
not given here; check the paper.)  Master mix, PCR condition, post-PCR analysis
and analytical sensitive are specified;  check this paper.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  DNA sequencing was done and codons in <i>rpoB</i> and <i>katG</i>
accounted for RIF and INH resistance, respectively.  10 replicates were used
for real-time PCR analysis of H37Rv wild-type spiked in sputa.  Melting point
analysis of the probes show RPO1 is 67&deg;, RPO2 is 64.9&deg;, and KAT is
68.9&deg; (SD values also calculated).  All clinical samples were wtih two
standard deviations fo the average <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.   Then 10 specimens
with known resistance were spiked in which there were different substitutions
in eight different codons for <i>rpoB</i>.  All resistance strains were
identified by deviating beyond the limit from the reference <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.
Finally sensitivity was tested by spiking sputa with serial dilutions of
H37Rv wildtype and three resistant strains, and this was correlated to CFU
growing in culture, and by microscopic quantification of bacilli counts.
The test was able to detect 1000 CFU/ml corresponding to 10 acid-fast bacilli/line).
This test also found <i>M bovis</i> (part of <i>M tubeculosis</i> complex
and <i>M avium</i>, the latter having a very different <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.

Allosteric Mechanisms of Signal Transduction
<p class="Para1">
In the elaboration of allosterism, it was proposed that regulatory
effectors and ligands bind in distinct sites but that the binding induces
a reversible conformation changes.  Koshland reported his induced-fit
theory he used to explain enzyme action (not regulation).  Monod, Wyman
and Changeux proposed that regulatory proteins have a quaternary structure
with identical subunits organized into finite assemblies (oligomers),
and that these assemblies undergo discrete conformational changes
affecting the quaternary stucture.  With Koshland's induced fit, ligand
binding causes the conformational change.  The MWC theory relied on
available structural data for hemoglobin from Perutz.

Single-Day FISH Procedure for Paraffin-Embedded Tissue Sections Using A
Microwave Oven
<p class="Para1">
FISH is sensitive method for detecting amplified genes in tumor cells.
Aside from being labor-intensive, difficulties with FISH include
inaccessibility of target probes due to cross-linking created during
tissue fixation.  One kit
<a href="http://www.vysis.com/PretreatingParaffinSpecimens_32217.asp">manufacturer</a>
specifies at least 2 days of several acid/chaotrope-based pretreatments
and overnight hybridization.  Thus clinical and research labs prefer
specimens not formalin-fixed or paraffin-embedded, at the risk of loss
of structural integrity.
<p>
Commercially available kits from Vysis/Abbott were used:  <i>HER-2 LSP</i>
(locus-specific probe), <i>CEP17</i> (centromere enumeration probe for
chromosome 17), and &alpha;-satellite DNA.  4-&micro;m thin sections were
cut from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks from 9 breast cancer
and 7 endometrial cancer cases.  As controls, lymphocytes from healthy
humans and 4 breast cancer cell lines were also embedded in paraffin,
with a total of 21 specimens analyzed.  Two procedures, the Vysis and
a microwave oven-based in our lab, were used.  In each specimen,
a mean of 62 (range 30-173) cells were scored and the following parameters
determined:  mean copy number for each probe, <i>HER2-/CEP17</i> ratio,
proportion of aneusomic cells between methods (see a supplementary
table S1 <a href="http://www.BioTechniques.com/">online</a>).  The microwave
was a Samsung MW1080STA, with 10 power levels and max power of 1100 W.
Power levels in other microwaves can be assessed by measuring temperatures
in pretreatment step buffer and in hybridization step water; protocol 1
specifies optimal temperatures in parentheses.  Time of microwave irradiation
must be controlled since too high a temperature can result in loss of
tissue structure and tool little a temperature may result is poor LSP
probe hybridization.
<p>
In comparing the Vysis and microwave procedure, the mean copy numbers
were quite comparable (table S1 online).  Microwave-treated specimens
performed well in non-amplified, amplified, and control slides, with
two exceptions:  for BT-474 cells, mean absolute <i>HER-2</i> signal
per cell was slightly higher per compared to Vysis (<i>p</i> = 0.002).
The difference is probably more attributable to the complex nature
of <i>HER-2</i> amplification than the type of treatment.  With BT-474
cells, there is a formation of compact heterogeneous clusters of
<i>HER-2</i> genes, and the identification of these signals can be
difficult with variable counts.
<p>
A high hybridization efficiency was seen with the microwave protocol.
The <i>HER-2/CEP17</i> ratio were comparable (4.2 with Vysis and 4.5
with microwave, <i>p</i> = 0.448).  With both methods this particular
case is diagnostic for <i>HER-2</i> amplification and polysomic for
ch17.  With the endometrial cancer cases, highly amplified <i>HER-2</i>
is seen with a 15.2 ratio shown with Vysis method and 13.9 with
microwave.  A statistical analysis of the combined FISH results shows
a high concordance between mean <i>HER-2</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.945) and
<i>CEP17</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.361).  For 5 specimens, the microwave treatment
was repeated a second time and results were close the first slide,
indicating good reproducibility.
<p>
For cell line pellets embedded in paraffin, microwave treatment was not
required to be as long.  Bright spots were observed after only two
rounds of low-power treatment whereas full-strength treatment was required
for four rounds on tissue.  One person can process 3-5 slides in a normal
working day (8 h);  the time-limiting step is the microscope survey in
all cases.
<p>
<b>Method</b>.
<ol>
<li>Put the paraffin-embedded tissue slides in a 65&deg; oven for 1 h.
<li>Clear the slides in xylene and gradually rehydrate using standards methods
after removing from the oven.
<li>The slides are incubated 15 min in 0.2 N HCl to denature the DNA.
<li>Rinse well in double-distilled water.
<li>The slides are microwave-irradiated in 10 mM citrate pH 6.0 for
90 seconds at power level 9 (100&deg;).
<li>Continue for 7 minutes at power level 2 (90&deg;).
<li>Place the slides in chilled (4&deg;) 70% EtOH for 3 min,
and then in chilled (4&deg;) 100% EtOH for 3 min.

Sequential Proton Transfer Through Water Bridges in Acid-Base Reactions
<p class="Para1">
The molecular details of proton transfer in aqueous solutions are not
well understood.  Membrane channels constructed for proton transfer
work through proton &ldquo;wires&rdquo; in which protons hop in a series
along amino acid side chains and on water molecules.  In the exchange
of a proton from acid to base, the theory is that water facilitates
charge separation when a proton leaves the acid.  Experimental evidence
is shown here that water acts as a bridge in moving proton from acid to
base.
<p>
IR spectroscopy can be used for examining structure of acids and bases
in solution by analysis of various vibrational modes.  The problem is
that hydrated protons in room temp acidic aqueous solutions at low pH
produce spectra that are the result of strongly varying configurations.
The Zundel cation (H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>:
H<sub>2</sub>O--H<sup>+</sup>--OH<sub>2</sub>) stablizes a lone proton
between two oxygen atoms of two water molecules, and the Eigen
cation (H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>:
H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>[H<sub>2</sub>O] ) puts the positive charge
on an oxygen atom of a water molecule and then uses protons on three
separate molecules to surround for stabilization.  Theoretical analyses
of vibrational bands in gas phase hydrated proton clusters is not trivial.
<p>
Studies of tight acid-base complexes shown that a direct link between
acid and base involves ultrafast proton transfer with only modest
rearrangements of solvent shells.  For &ldquo;loose&rdquo; (solvent-separated)
complexes, transfer is controlled by the solvent water bridge.  In another
type of reaction in which there is a low base concentration, acid and base
are initially separated by substantial distance and must come together
to make an encounter pair;  diffusion step is rate-limiting.
<p>
A photoacid is sensitive to an optical trigger in which a pump pulse
is tuned at the electronic transition, and the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>
jumps 6-7 units to initiate proton transfer.  A probe pulse in the
mid-infrared can monitor reaction progress.  In a previous study
of pyranine (8-hydroxy-1,3,6-trisulfonate-pyrene, HPTS) and acetate
in deuterated water, the deuteron was transferred in 150 fs.  Encounter
complexes forming after diffusion react with first-order time constant
of 7 ps.  Based on this and a concentrated base (1-4 M acetate) study showing
preformed solvent-separated (loose) acid-base  complexes with 6 ps transfer
time constant, Rini et al. inferred encounter pairs consist of
HPTS--(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><i>n</i></sub>--<sup>&minus;</sup>OAc
paths without specifying count <i>n</i> water molecules.
<p>
Use of <sup>&minus;</sup>OOC-CH<sub>(3&minus;<i>x</i>)</sub>Cl<sub><i>x</i></sub>
allows a way to tune reactivity:  as the number of chlorine atoms (<i>x</i>)
increases, acidity increased (from p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> = 4.75 for
acetic acid to 2.7 for monochloroacetic acid).  There is a lower
reaction exothermicity and also slower proton transfer, permitting
observing intermediates.  HPTS is used with &minus;O-Ac-Cl, which provides
3-fold advantage over use of &minus;O-Ac: (i) fraction of water-separated
loose complexes is larger, (ii) IR wavenumbers of 1435 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>
is sufficient to detect onset and rise of HPTS photobase marker band,
(iii) slower proton transfer permits longer window of observation.
<p>
In solution of D<sub>2</sub>O, HPTS could be followed in an electronically
excited state using IR.  Decay of the 1486 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>

A strategy for obtaining near full-length HCV cDNA clones (assemblicons) by 
assembly PCR
<p class="Para1">
HCV causes chronic hepatitis progressing to hepatocellular carcinoma, with 170 million
affected worldwide from infected blood products, IV drug use, and sexual transmission.
50-85% of the primary infections become chronic with stable viremia; 1 in 5 of these
cases will become HCC.  HCV is a ss RNA (+ form) virus which is sole member of 
Hepacivirus within <i>Flaviviridae</i> and relatedness to other flavi- and pestiviruses.
It has a 9600 bp genome, which code a 3011 amino acid ORF flanked by 5&prime; and
3&prime; UTRs.  The 5&prime; has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) with
cap-independent translation of the polyprotein.  This 5&prime; UTR has 90% sequence
identity for all HCV genotypes and is the target of diagnostics.  Both host and
viral proteases process the polyprotein into Core, E1 and E2 structural proteins,
and NS2, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5a, and NS5b nonstructural proteins.  The hypervariable
region HVR I of E2 and the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR) of 
NS5a generate the most genetic heterogeneity.  The 3&prime;-UTR has a variable
sequence of between 21-39 nt, a poly U/UC tract of variable length, and the 
&chi;-tail which is 98 nt highly conserved and probably plays a role in RNA
replication of HCV.  PEG-ylated interferon combined with ribavirin is the primary
anti-HCV treatment.  Genotypes 1 and 4 show poor response, while genotypes 2 and 3
have a sustained response in 4 of 5 chronically infected patients.  Future treatments
will involve use of ribozymes cleaving the 5&prime;-UTR, protease/helicase (NS3) and
polymerase (NS5b) inhibitors blocking viral replication, ribavirin analogs and
anti-firbrotic agents to control disease progression.  An in vitro cell culture
system to support complete viral life cycle needs development.  RT-PCR can be used
to construct cDNA from all RNA viruses, but this often involves cloning and ligation
of subgenomic cDNA fragments.  Short region amplification  for making HCV cDNA
clones is easier and needs less viral RNA.  A self-replicating HCV RNA subgenomic
(now genomce) replicon carrying neomycin resistance to select transfected cells was 
established in Huh-7 cells.  Replicons of genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a were developed.
In this report Long RT-PCR is optimized with three overlapping amplicons for each
genotype and subtype.  With these amplicons, assembly PCR is used to obtain near
full length HCV genoes (assemblicons).
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  To assess the capacities of reverse transcriptase, subgenomic
HCV RT-PCR was done as a marker.  6 RTases (THERMO RT, AMV RT, M-MLV RT, Expand RT,
and Superscript II RT) were tested.  The Roche Expand RTase outperformed other enzymes
and was found to amplify all subgenomic HCV PCRs with good product yields.  The
Promega AMV and M-MLV RTases performed well after the Expand enzyme.  The Display-THERMO
enzyme could not amplify any PCR targets.  Random priming in cDNA synthesis was more
effective than using a specifically primed cDNA (the &chi;-tail of 98 highly
conserved region that is a poly U/UC tract thought to play role in HCV RNA replication).
<p>
The Expand RTase was used for Long HCV RNA.  Three overlapping amplicons for genotype
1b were run on Long PCR.  Size of amplcions is 5.2, 3.2 and 2.5 kb, and the 5.2 and
3.2 have an overlap of 1.2 kb.  The 3.2 and 2.5-kb biotinylated overlap by about
600 bp.  Threshold sensitivity for amplification is log<sub>10</sub> 6.0 IU/ml
for 140 &micro;l serum for RNA extraction.  Biotin molecules were necessary for 
complete assembly of the 9.3 kb assemblicon of each HCV genotype.
<p>
The 5.2 and 3.2 kb amplicons are assembled into 7.3 kb biotinylated assemblicon,
done using a 5&prime; biotinylated primer of the 5.2  and antisense primer of the 
3.2 kb amplicon.  Then the biotinylated assemblicon with 3&prime; biotinylated
2.5 kb assemblicon.  Full length assembly was only possible when the 7.5 
and 2.5 kb amplicon had biotin molecules.  The 9.3 kb assemblicon had no 
biotin-labeled ends.
<p>
Assembly PCR for large fragments is quite difficult because of competition of 
opposite strand for template annealing in favor of overlap annealing.  This 
might be circumvented by adding single-stranded PCR product.  Instead a 
biotin-strepavidin capture methodology used in heteroduplex tracking assay.
Biotinylated amplicons are captured on strepavidin magenetic beads, with the 
competing (opposite) strand then degraded
<p>
<b>Methods.  Reverse transcription</b>.  9 &micro;l or Genotype 1a and 1b RNA
are added to 1 &micro;l 50 &micro;M random hexamers and incubated depending
on RTase product:  10 min at 75&deg; with Enhanced Avian RTase, 5 min at 70&deg;
with AMV and M-MLV RTase, 10 min at 65&deg; for Expand RTase and Display THERMO
RTase, and 5 min at 65&deg; for Superscript II then snap-cooled on ice.
The reactions were prepared and mixed without vortexing and transferred to
a thermocycler with profile being 23&deg; 10 min/37&deg; 60 min/94&deg; 2 min
for M-MLV and AMV RTase, 30&deg; 10 min/42&deg; 45 min for Expand, 42&deg; 50 min/
70&deg; 15 min for Superscript II.  Additional conditions are given for other 
enzymes.
<p>
Genotype of each assemblicon was determined using the 5&prime;-UTR and NS5b
regions.  A molecular diagnostics ass from Innogenetics (Belgium) using INNO-LiPA
HCV II genotype assay was done.
<p>
<b>Long Amplicon PCR</b>.  For the 5.2 kb amplicon (nt 39-5293), the cDNA from
the Expand RTase (5 &micro;l) is used with 0.5 mM dNTPs, 20 pmol of forward and
reverse primer, and 3 U of Expand Long Template polymerase, with 3.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>
and 5% DMSO present.  After initial 2 min at 94&deg;, 35 cycles of 15 s at 94&deg; /
30 s at 60&deg; / 4 min at 68&deg;, with incremental addition of 20 s per cycle
after 10 cycles.  A final elongation of 7 min at 72&deg; was done.  In a secondary
PCR (2&deg;), 2 &micro;l of the 1&deg; were used for template and cycling was 
identical except for primer pair used.  The product was gel purified using 
QIAEX II gel purification kit.  For the 3.2 kb amplicon (nt 4183-7382), 
5 &micro;l of cDNA, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 20 pmol primer, 3 U Expand enzyme, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>
and 2% DMSO in final 50 &micro;l volume.  Amplification is 40 s of 20 s at 94&deg;,
30 s at 60&deg;, and 150 s at 68&deg; with incremental addition of 15 s / cycle
after 10 cycles and final elongation of 7 min at 72&deg;.
<p>
<b>Biotinylated amplicons</b> of 2.5 kb size (nt 6840-9371) is made with 5 &micro;l
cDNA, 350 &micro;M dNTPs, 20 pmol each primer (reverse primer has 5&prime; biotin),
3.25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 7% DMSO.  [Details of cycling here.]  To make the
biotinylated 7.3 kb, 15 ng total DNA with 9.2 ng of 5.2 kb amplicon and 5.8 ng
of 3.2 kb are put in total of 5 &micro;l.  dNTPs are 0.4 mM, 20 pmol per primer,
3 U Long Template polymerase, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2% DMSO in final 50 &micro;l
volume. [Cycling details here.]  This is gel purified.  The 9.3 kb is now
assembled mixing equimolar biotinylated 7.3 kb (12 ng) with biotinylated 2.5 kb 
(4 ng).  These are giving dNTPs, magnesium chloride, enzyme, DMSO and cycled, and
then gel purified.  No strepavidin capture is used.

Salmonella: virulence, stress response, and resistance
<p class="Para1">
The <i>Salmonella</i> pathogen is a leading cause of foodborne disease around 
the world. Meat, eggs, and unpasteurized milk can be contaminated and are the 
source of infection.
<p>
The <i>S. enterica</i> genome is on a 4 Mb chromosome containing many integrated 
bacteriophage (prophage) genomes and a 90 kb virulence plasmid transferred via 
conjugation.  <i>Salmonella</i> shares many genes for catabolims, replication 
and cell repair for growth and survival and have genomic structures 
(organizations) that are similar.  Large islands (clusters?) of genes exist in 
<i>Salmonella</i>, particularly related to pathogenesis. Galan and Curtiss 
(1989) found the first <i>Salmonella</i> pathogenecity island (SPI1) involved 
with invasion of epithelial cells.  More pathogenicity islands have been 
discovered: SPI2 and SPI3 are required for systemic illness, SPI4 function is 
not known, and SPI5 is associated with diarrhea.  Elements of prophages have 
been found that are required for <i>Salmonella</i> survival and pathogenesis in 
the animal host.  There are 6-12 operons for the expression of adhesins and 
fimbriae (pili), needed for attachment to tissues. About 1000 different 
serotypes are found through typing the O LPS antigen and flagellar antigens 
phase 1 and 2.  The O antigen is specified by the <i>wba</i> locus encoding a 
number of dehydrogenases, epimerases, isomerases, glycosyltransferases, 
polymerases, and other enzymes used in construction and export of the complete 
LPS molecule to outer membrane.  O Ag chain length, capping of core LPS 
molecule, and polymerization of antigen in Group B salmonellae are the function 
of ancillary genes.
<p>
The virulence plasmid contains genes for attachment and growth in 
reticuloendothelial system of animal host.  Its genes are required for systemic 
salmonellosis, but the plasmid is not required, and its distribution is variable 
for the different serotypes.
<p>
To establish infection, <i>Salmonella</i> transit the acidity of the gastric 
organ and are present in the intestine.  Bacteria invade enterocytes and induce 
cytokines that bring in neutrophils and inflammation of intestinal mucosa 
(gastroenteritis), causing diarrhea.  Eventually neutrophils kill the bacteria 
and this progression is self-limiting.
<p>
The more serious infection comes from some serotypes able to invade lymphoid 
tissue in the intestinal epithelium (M cells) where they are ingested by 
phagocytosis but resist killing.  The M cells attempt to transport to intestinal 
lymph nodes where more effective killing might occur, but the bacteria replicate 
within.  In the abdominal lymph nodes, they proliferate quickly and cause an 
<b>enteric fever</b> (typhoid fever) which is self-limiting but usually treated 
with antibiotics.  The chloreaesuis serotype of <i>Salmonella</i> can replicate 
rapidly, escape macrophages and enter the blood stream.  This can lead to 
septicemia (bacteria growing in blood);  other serotypes may cause bacteremia 
(bacteria present transiently in blood) and go to other tissues.  In either 
case, these are life-threatening and require antibiotics.
<p>
Among the attachment genes available, the adhesins, such as type 1 fimbriae, act 
like lectins which attach to carbohydrate moieties on lipids and proteins of the 
epithelial cells.  The curli on the other hand recognize specific amino acid 
sequences on host cell surface proteins.  The adhesins mainly affect tissue and 
host tropism with the pathogen.  Adhesins have polar or peritrichous 
distribution as long, thin, flexible, rigid or aggregative protein filaments 
which are the fimbriae.  EGF receptor is among the receptors that help the 
bacteria to be internalized, and to trigger cytokine release.  Internalization 
is induced by the bacterium itself, via an <q>invasion-needle</q>.  There is a 
loss of cytoskeletal structure (including microvilli) but the bacterial StpP 
protein seems to induce the reformation of microvilli.  The SPI1 pathogenicity 
island encodes a type III secretion system for exporting invasins and assembling 
the invasion-needle.  The key effector proteins, SipA-C and SptP, trigger 
endocytosis.
<p>
SPI5 plays are big role in gastroenteritis and the occurrene of diarrhea because
it enables interaction with enterocytes.  The genes <i>pipA-D</i> and
<i>sopB</i> induce intestinal fluid secretion and inflammatory response, but
are not needed for systemic infection.  <b>SopB</b> is a phosphoinositol 
phosphatase whose substrate is phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, and
its action induces Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent chloride secretion.  SopB mutations
effectively reduce the ability to produce diarrhea.  SPI1-related activity
triggers a strong inflammatory response and neutrophil migration.
<p>
The route of <i>Salmonella</i> to more serious systemic infection is through M 
cells, the equivalent of macrophages in the intestinal epithelium which are 
involved in sampling microbial antigens in the intestinal environment.  It can 
enter macrophages and dendritic cells and then traverse into lymphoid tissue if 
it resists their killing mechanisms.  The bacteria can employ SOD and catalase 
to diminish formation of oxidative species, and also employ enzymes that repair 
membranes, proteins, and DNA.  Within the acidic environment of the 
phagolysosome, the bacteria changes the LPS to resist cationic defensin 
peptides. It expresses enterochelin in order to sequester iron from a depleted 
environment; iron-scavenging genes are found in SPI1 cluster.  It expresses high 
affinity transporters for macro- and micronutrients to obtain what it needs.
The SPI2 cluster expresses a second type III secretion pathway to put SpiC,
SseI, SseJ, SspH2 and SifB into macrophage cytoplasm; these proteins alter
vacuole trafficking in the macrophage and inhibit lysosome fusion.  The virulence
plasmid expresses SpvB which encodes an ADP-ribosylating enzyme acting on 
F-actin formation, its polymerization into filaments.  SPI2 and the virulence
plasmid <i>spv</i> locus are required for systemic infection.
<p>
The coordination of gene expression with respects to virulence occurs in
regulons or <q>virulons</q> in which the bacterium is sensing its environment
and then responds with the correct virulon.  Global regulatory elementslike CAP/CRP,
<i>phoP/Q</i> <i>rpoS</i>, <i>ompR/envZ</i>, and <i>dam</i> are important and 
any mutations severely curb virulence.
<p>
A major change in chromatin structure can come by altering DNA methylation, 
affecting scaffolding proteins such as IHF and HNS with DNA, and the supercoiling
machine.  When negative supercoiling occurs, hydrogen bonds are broken and ds
DNA is opened with access to RNA polymerase for promoters.  Osmolarity also affects
DNA supercoiling and may be a signal for regulatory response of the invasion
gene expression.  Methylation may be involved in silencing; the combination of
methylation and cell division might create a heterogeneous population with different
sets of genes ON and OFF.
<p>
Bacteria also possess &sigma; factors which can globally regular genes.  These 
factors associate with RNA polymerase and modify its transcription, probably by 
making it recognize different sequences that initiate binding and then 
polymerization.  The normal <q>housekeeping</q> factor is &sigma;<sup>70</sup> 
which makes RNA polymerase recognize the TTGACA at &minus;35 and TATAAT at 
&minus;10 relative to transcriptional start.  When there is heat stress, the 
organism produces &sigma;<sup>32</sup> encoded by <i>rpoH</i> gene. 
Transcription of GroEL/ES folding chaperones and the Lon and Clp proteases which 
degrade aberrant or denatured proteins is under control of &sigma;<sup>32</sup>. 
These enzymes help <i>Salmonella</i> resist stressed environments.
<p>
In the transition from exponential to stationary phase, bacteria turn on genes 
that enable resistance to heat, acidic pH, oxidative stress, osmotic stress. 
This transition is controlled by &sigma;<sup>S</sup> (<i>rpoS</i>) which turns 
on genes for ATR and acid resistance, SOD and catalase, and cellular repair 
enzymes.  The &sigma;<sup>S</sup> and two-component regulatory element 
<i>phoP/Q</i> activate virulence  need for survival and proliferation within the 
RES and repress other genes such as those involved in colonization.  The 
regulation of virulence genes by <i>rpoS</i> and other elements is done through 
intermediate regulatory products like <i>hilA, invF</i>, and <i>spvR</i>.  
The <i>rpoS</i> mediates acid tolerance in various foods as well.  The alternate
&sigma; factor, <i>rpoE</i> is activated when there is a depletion in carbon
and entrance to stationary phase, and several genes to adapt to oxidative stress,
low pH, heat shock and polymyxin B resistance.  When <i>rpoE</i> is inactivated,
the bacterium is more susceptible to oxide radicals produced by neutrophil
myeloperoxidase, to antimicrobial peptides, its inhibition of intracellular 
proliferation, and the ability to spread from intestine and Peyer's patches.

<p>
In the two-component regulatory system, there is usually a membrane sensor
that binds to a signalling molecule and activates a kinase function.  The 
kinase then phosphorylates a DNA-binding transcriptional activator. 
The <i>phoP/Q</i> is involved in low phosphate (limiting phosphate) detection.
This particular switch seems critical for <i>Salmonella</i> virulence in the RES.
Gene reporters were used to identify PhoP-activated (<i>pag</i>) and PhoP-repressed
genes (<i>prg</i>).  Its effect is on genes present in SPI1 and SPI2 pathogenicity
islands, turning OFF invasion genes and switching ON genes required for survival
within macrophages.  The <i>phoP/Q</i> also regulates <i>prmA/B</i> which regulates
resistance to antimicrobial peptides in macrophages and neutrophils:  the <i>prm</i>
operon produces enzymes modifying the lipid A core of LPS.  <i>phoP/Q</i> also
response to conditions inside phagosome, magnesium levels, and low pH.  The
<i>ompR/envZ</i> system affects the <i>ompB</i> locus which activates or represses
genes and the ratio of OmpC and OmpF porins in outer membrane.  In addition, 
the bacterium can change phenotype by sensing its density with respect to other
cells, switching from motile single cells to sessile, aggregated which bind to
solid surfaces:  this is quorum-sensing which occurs in food products too. 
Bacteria can form a biofilm with high densities.  Quorum-sensing occurs when
bacteria create a signal who concentration varies with cell density, and this
then triggers the biofilm production.  The biofilm is polysaccharides, proteins,
or both, forming an extracellular matrix.  In <i>Salmonella</i> the auto-inducer
is 4-hydroxy-5-methylfuranone (derived from S-AdoMet), which interacts with the
LsrR protein.
<p>
<i>Salmonella</i> maintains its cytoplasmic pH of 7 using ATPases, proton pumps,
lysine decarboxylase, and lysine/cadaverine antiporter.  K<sup>+</sup> pumps help
to guard against osmolarity changes; also osmoprotectants such as glycine betaine.

Manufacturing of recombinant therapeutic proteins in microbial systems
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW.</b>  Very first host systems in <i>E coli</i> used to express human 
insulin and growth hormone (hGH) in early 1980s.  Even today the <i>E coli</i> 
K12 derivatives are the most widely used, having been selected for absence of 
proteases and other mutations that would alter recombinant protein expression. 
Other E coli hosts have been made that are now secretory.  Yeasts such as <i>P. 
pastoris</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are more commonly used but there are many 
other hosts as well.
<p>
<i>E coli</i> B and K12 strains still widely used for expressing 
non-glycosylated peptides and proteins both in research and industry.  The host 
can be optimized to produce the recombinant to be as much as 50% of the protein 
cell mass.  Factors that affect expression include synthesis rates, plasmid copy 
number, and segregational plasmid stability.  Also proposed has been a means to 
integrate recombinant gene within the main chromosome with its issues of 
potentially lower productivity.  In <i>E coli</i>, decisions can be made to make 
expression constitutive or inducible, while most systems are the latter. Yield 
and quality of the heterlogous product depend on gene dosage, transcription 
efficiency, mRNA stability and efficiency, and translation fidelity.
<p>
Hosts are maintained as antibiotic-resistant hosts in pre-culture media. When 
scaling up, the antibiotics are not included in culture media. Industrially the 
best expression vector produces medium to high copy numbers which permits rapid 
growth to high cell densities, then the induction phase begins with gene 
expression.  The strength of the promoter should be tunable and low-priced 
inducers that are non-toxic available at the large scale. Promotes commonly 
employed are the lactose-based native and derived promoters (<i>lac, tac, 
trc</i>) which are induced by lactose or IPTG.  <i>araBAD</i> is controlled by 
L-arabinose, or &lambda;pR/pL by temperature shifts.
<p>
Expression of multimeric proteins, or protein complexes, particular antibodies 
and their fragments is done with polycistronic or two-cistronic vectors. In 
addition, the transcribed regions (such at translation initiation region or 
areas affecting ribosomal affinity) have been manipulated to optimize 
translation.
<p>
Problems with large-scale production include metabolic overload and stress, 
since plasmid maintenance and heterologous protein expression are a burden for 
the host cell.  Fermenter design and the process of fermentation are ongoing 
areas of research.  Gradients in pO<sub>2</sub> and pCO<sub>2</sub> could create 
cellular stress.  Continuous monitoring with automatic feed systems (for glucose 
and dissolved oxygen) as well as acetate level assessment are part of the 
fermentation process.
<p>
T7 RNA polymerase-based transcriptional control has a strict regulation of the 
non-induced state.  mRNA stability is promoted by altering mRNA conformation or 
using hosts whose nucleases have been nullified.  Translational efficiency will 
take into account optimal codon optimization in the coding region.  Altering 
hosts to overexpress rare tRNAs has also been proposed.
<p>
Intracellularly expressed recombinant proteins produced at high levels usually 
aggregate and form inclusion bodies, a result of limited solubility and the lack 
of chaperone systems for the proteins.  Right now, interferons, interleukins, 
growth hormones and antibody fragments are produced through inclusion bodies. 
An advantage of IB formation is that the product is more easily isolated and 
purified after cell lysis, and the other biomolecular components removed in the 
supernatant during continuous centrifugation. Solubility and aggregation are 
functions of peptide/protein sequence and also on promoter strength and 
fermentation characteristics (temperature, growth rate).
<p>
Adversely strategies to improve protein solubility where required also increase 
likelihood of proteolytic degradation, N-terminal methionylation, not to mention 
multi-step, yield-diminishing protein purification techniques to eliminate 
pyrogens among other toxic components.
<p>
A question often arises as to whether the authentic amino terminus is required. 
N-terminal Met tends to be acetylated or acylated.  If the 2nd residue is small, 
uncharged and non-destabilizing, endogenous deacylase and a Met-aminopeptidase 
can be used to remove N-acyl groups or N-Met. If the authentic sequence is 
desired, a signal sequence can be fused to direct secretion to periplamsic or 
extracellular space.  Alternatively the protein can be fused to a partner 
molecule enzymatically or chemically cleaved off during isolation and 
purification.  Moreover aminopeptidases can be co-expressed to remove N-terminal 
Met residues.
<p>
<b>Secretion</b>  Cytokines, whole antibodies, and antibody fragments have been 
expressed in secretory <i>E coli</i>.  Protein chaperones that assist in correct 
folding within the cytoplasam or periplasm have been included. Ray et al have 
described glycine-extended salmon calcitonin expression in which they 
co-expressed secretion factors to enable translocation efficiency. Fernandez and 
DeLorenzo used the type I secretion pathway to secrete a fully oxidized single 
chain variable fragment (scFv).  Humphreys et al have done a systematic study of 
signal sequences in difference species.  Proposed also are the use in 
co-expression of chaperones and oxidoreductases to enable protein folding.
<p>
As expression hosts of recombinant proteins of eukaryotic origin, yeast provide 
many advantages.  They do post-translational modifications and can be made to 
secrete the proteins.  Glycosylation patterns however are distinct from the 
human manner in which glycosylation is done.  For example, yeast Golgi do not 
trim the N-glycans similarly to mammalian processing;  instead of trimming the 
mannose chains, yeast add more (hypermannosylation).
<p>
Yeast host selection is not usually be antibiotics but rather by auxotrophy. 
Plasmid vectors usually contain the missing gene required to enable growth. 
Vectors are also designed to be shuttle vectors for <i>E coli</i>. 
<i>Saccharomyces</i> is typically used because it grows well and growth 
optimization has been done to keep EtOH buildup low; glucose feed must be 
controlled because of a limited respiratory capacity.  The recombinant is 
usually put under inducible rather than constitutive control, using the 
galactose control system usually.  One advantage of <i>Pichia</i> as for 
<i>Saccharomyces</i> is that the expression vector is integrated into the 
genome, and in multiple copies, and its metabolism is respirative rather than 
fermentative, allowing higher growth.  Its medium also is relatively simple 
compared to <i>Saccharomyces</i>, utilizing glyceral or MeOH for carbon and 
ammonium salts for nitrogen.  MeOH can induces the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) 
promoter to which the recombinant can be tied.  Alternative promoters can be 
used to guard against the explosive volatility of MeOH.
<p>
<b>Hansenula polymorpha</b> is a facultative methylotroph much like 
<i>Pichia</i> with simple carbon sources, and expression plasmids integrated 
into host genome.  It has been used to produce several cytokines, vaccines, and 
coagulation factors.
<p>
GFP has been produced with differenct secreation signals in <i>S pombe</i>
for the reason that its glycosylation and post-translation modifications are
more similar to mammalian cells.
<p>
Wang et al have looked at about 800 different yeast species with many
metabolic features.  Engineering efforts are underway to enable human-like
glycosylation in yeast.  Zhang et al have recently engineered <i>E coli</i>
to produce proteins involved in glycosylation.
<p>
<i>Aspergillus niger</i> have been used recently in the production of enzymes 
and in whole antibodies.

From Biochips to Laboratory-on-a-Chip System
<p class="Para1">
<b>Book Chapter</b>.  Traditional microfabrication involving plastic molding
and microarraying are done with silicon, glass or plastic chips.  Chips for
biological analysis faciliate total integration of three classic steps:
sample prep, biochemical reaction, and result detection and analysis.
For biochip fabrication the most commonly used methods are photolithographic
processing, making microchannels in a silicon or glass substrate.
Microfabrication processes include injection-molding, casting, imprinting,
laser ablation, and stamping for plastic substrates.  Plastic substrates
are less expensive and easier to manipulate than glass or silicon-based
substrates;  plastics are also easier to dispose of after use.  Microarrays
represent a third category of biochips using robotics station-based
microdispensing methods.
<p>
<b>Photolithographic fabrication of silicon and glass</b>.  Wet etching is
most widely used method to fabricate microfluidic channels in glass, silica,
and silicon substrates.  A soda lime microscopic slide (e.g. Fisher
Scientific Cat #12-550C) is responsive to etching and frequently used.  For
deep etching of microchannels a more resistant sacrificial etch mask
should be used.  A photoresist composed of Cr/Au and amorophous silicon
can be used with HF-based etchants (HF/HNO<sub>3</sub>, which easily attacks
amorphous silicon.  Photoresist/Au/Cr etch mask on Borofloat will etch
35 &micro;m depth in about 5 min with 49% HF.  Amorphous can be deposited
on substrates by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition; it has the best
resistance to HF etching as well as fewest defects. Channels with smooth sidealls
and depth of 70 &micro;m are achieved with it as etch mask.  Amorphous silicon
is twice as resistant as Cr/Au based masks.  Borofloat glass is produced
using a float process and has a flat surfacing requiring no mechanical
polishing.  Bonding of glass plates to create the chip can be done with two
polished graphite blocks to sandwich them, the place in evacuated furnace with
stainless steel weight on top.  Another method uses a thin layer of silicon
dioxide deposited on surface of one glass, then bond the top and bottom glass
plates anodically, which produces a yield that is better than thermal fusing.
Another bonding technique is to use quartz glass substrates with HF, which
produces low thermal damage, low residual stress (bonding at room temp),
and operational simplicity.  Plasma etchning of the silicon master for
hot embossing and deep reactive ion etching of Pyrex using SF<sub>6</sub>
plasma have been reported.  Microstereolithography is a method based on
the polymerization of photosensitive polymers by a focused UV beam and used
to produce 3D structures and encapsulate material in microfluidic structures:
these can be fabricatd by single exposue reduction photolithography using
arrays of microlenses and gray scale masks.
<p>
With plastic microfabrication, laser ablation, injection-molding, compression
molding, casting, and X-ray lithography can be used in polymeric substrates.
Injection-molding and casting are replication methods, which can generate
capillary or reservoirs with smooth surfaces, necessary for capillary
electrophoresis functions.  Capillary electrophoresis chip injection-molding
is a multi-step fabrication process:  (1) "negative" image of capillary
channels using silicon master wet-etched through standard photollithography.
The fabricated silicon master has protruded features formed;  (2) a "positive"
metal mold is formed through electroplating against the silicon master;
(3) the metal mother used to make daughter metal molds to be mounted on
mold insert.  The insert can be used through injection- or compression-molding
to produce hundreds of thousands of molded plastic chips using polymeric
materials like acrylic copolymer resin.  A sealed capillary electrophoresis
chip was prepared by first driilling a few mm diameter through holes on the
molded piece followed by thermal lamination of a thick sheet of Mylar coated
wtih thermally activated adhesive at raised temperature.  A microfluidic
device with integrated spectrophotometric elements was injection-molded in
poly(methyl methacrylate [PMMA]) recently, combining direct photopatterning,
replica molding techniques and rapid cooled release mechanism in conjunciton
with material-material transfer.  With the casting process, materials
such as PDMS and PMMA are cast against a wet-etched silicon master.  The
PDMS replica is peeled off easily.  Photoablation creates a debris from the
long polymer that can be washed away: plastics capable of this include
polycarbonate, PMMA, polystyrene, nitrocellulose, polyethylene terephthalate,
and Teflon.
<p>
<b>Microarraying Methods</b>.  These are either contact or noncontact printing
methods.  The contact is when a microarray substrate is physically contacted
by the liquid dispensing mechanism.  Metal pins of micron size or capillary
tubing delivers sample solution in volumes of pico- to nanoliters.  With
noncontact printing the liquid dispensing mechanism shoots sample of same
volume directly to the microarray substrate suitable for making protein or
antibody arrays where structure of protein is essential.  Microarraying
technologies include Illumina BeadArray, NimbleGen's micromirror tech,
and Agilent's thermal inkjet.  NimbleGen's arrays are built using photo
deposition chemistry using a proprietary maskless array synthesizer.  A digital
micromirror device (DMD) uses a solid-state array of miniature aluminum mirrors
to pattern up to 786,000 individual pixels of light, and the DMD creates
virtual masks replacing the physical chromium masks used in traditional
arrays.  The virtual masks reflect the desired pattern of UV light with
individually addressable aluminum mirrors controlled by the computer.  The DMD
controls pattern of UV light on microscope slide in reaction chamber which is
coupled to DNA synthesizer.  UV light deprotects oligo strand, allowing synthesis
of appropriate DNA molecule.
<p>
In the next section control of the microfluidics using pumps, valves, and other
units machined using microfabrication and microelectro mechanical system (MEMS)
technology is addressed.
<p>
<b>Microvalve</b>.  This structure is necessary in controlling reagent storage,
the priming of channels, switching of flow streams, the isolation of specific
areas of the chip during sensitive steps in chemical processing.  The
<b>freeze-thaw valve</b> requires no moving parts and has no dead volume:
essentially, a portion of the stream is frozen in the microchannel and thus
prevents flow.  One means to achieve this is to use a mixture of gaseous and
liquid carbon dioxide at about &minus;65&deg; delivered from cylinder of
compressed liquid.  Alternatively, liquid can be made frozen using a chip-based
electrothermal cooling device (Peltier).  <b>Magenetic valves</b> were
produced from thin square-shaped membrane structures (2 &times; 2 mm) of an
electroplated NiFe alloy as the flow controlling element.  In this structure,
a magnet is applied externally to the chip and the membrane is magentizable:
the four edges of the membrane are sealed against the silicon substrate, thus
stopping flow if a high pressure is applied for fluid to pass around the edges
of the membrane.  Bulk micromachining and wafer bonding have been used to make
more practical magnetic pumps using similar principles:  valves of this type
are closed when in the <q>relaxed</q> (no energy applied) state:  when voltage
is applied to the inductor in the glass wafer, the generated magnetic fluxes
will cause the permalloy/magnetic membrane to be attracted to the upper
electromagnet, with valve open to allow fluid through valve seat.  With a current
of 700 mA, the flow rate can be up to 600 &micro;l/min.  Externally applied
magnets can also move a ferrofluid within a microchannel to open or close an
intersection.  <b>Flow switches</b> have been developed that result in a valveless
five-way valve:  two syringe infusion pumps generate a constant flow rate and there
is a flow chip with 3 inlets and 5 outlets.  A sample containing a flow stream
is centered and guided by two buffers on each side through a linear microchannel
and leaves flow chip via the middle outlet.  If the flow ratio between two
control buffers is altered, the sample stream is deflected and is forced to enter
one of 4 outlet channels, depending on set flow ratio.  A microdevice called
a <q>flowFET</q> (similar functionality to a FET in microelectronics) works on
the principle that the magnitude and direction of electroosmotic flow (EOF)
can be controlled by a perpendicular electric field.  Two fluid switching methods
were established by controlling the lateral position of a stream in multiphase
laminar flow and the channel aspect ratio in tangentially connected microfluidic
systems.
<p>
<b>Micropumps</b>.  One category of micropump is the <b>electrohydrodynamic
pump</b> composed of two planar-processed, conductive electrodes.  Pressure
within the fluid can be generated by ion dragging caused by applying 300-500 V,
with pressures on the order of inches of water.  There is a coulomb interaction
with a space-charge region that is formed by injected or induced charges in the
fluid, the charges caused by electrochemical reactions in the fluid.  Another
kind of pump is the <b>magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pump</b>:  the Lorentz force
is used to propel an electrolyte along a microchannel etched in silicon using
an alternating current; flow is continuous (not pulsatile) with no moving parts,
and compatible with solutions possessing biological specimens.  The
<b>electroosmotic pump</b> is one created by intersecting capillaries on a glass
chip.  <b>Traveling-wave pumping</b> is achieved by using four high-frequency
square-wave voltages with sequential phase differences of 90&deg; to the
micrometer-sized electrodes arranged in parallel and one next to another.
The <b>thermal capillary pump</b> works by selectively allowing DC current flow
through the addressed electrodes built inside teh microchannel fabricated on
the silicon chip.  Nanoliter-sized discrete drops of fluid can be moved using
addressable local heating.  Electrodes are made by first depositing a 0.35 &micro;m
thick layer of aluminum on silicon wafer using electron beam coating technique,
then covering the aluminum electrodes sequentially with 1 &micro;m
SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, 0.25 &micro;m Si<sub><i>x</i></sub>N<sub><i>y</i></sub>,
and 1 &micro;m SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub> using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
deposition.  Such a pump can accurately mix, measure, and divide drops by simple
electronic control.  The <b>piezoelectric pump</b> was first built with two glass
plates and silicon wafer.  A pressure chamber and raised flat surface suspended
with a thin diaphragm are formed on the upper glass plate.  The piezoelectric
actuator is is placed on the raised flat surface.  To guide flow of the pumped
liquid, two check valves of polysilicon are fabricated on silicon wafer at inlet
and outlet of pressure chamber.  When the actuator is switched on by applied
periodic voltages, liquid is driven to the outlet; when the actuator is switched
off, liquid flows from inlet into pressure chamber. Dynamic passive valves
show superior performance to traditional static passive valves.  Mechanical
elements such as flaps, spheres, or membranes are usually needed to stop flow
of fluid in static passive valves; the dynamic passive valve has flow channels
having simple truncated pyramidal shape.  A miniature piezoelectric pump with
high bubble tolerance and self-priming capability is an improvement.  A pump
rate of 1 ml/min for water and 3.8 ml/min gas, and driving electronics has a
volume of 30 &times; 13.5 &times; 8 mm<sup>3</sup> makes it suitable for
lab-on-a-chip.  An injection molding method has been described for producing
a piezoelectric pump. The <b>magnetic pump</b> is an electromagnetically
driven peristaltic micropump on silicon wafer operating with 30 &micro;l/min
max flow with 10 Hz perstaltic motion with 300 mA dc current.  Bidirectional
pump flow is possible with this pump type.  There is a report of a
microperistaltic pump with two parts:  one part is integrated in a disposable
cartridge, while the other is reusable integrated in the analytical device.
In the disposable cartridge, three identical chambers are fabricated in the
cartridge and actuated in peristaltic mode by strong permanent magnetic forces
as well as restoring forces.  Peristaltic timing is generated by second part
which is a reusable rotating permanent sector magnet.  <b>Other pump types</b>
include <b>thermally drive phase-change nonmechanical micropump</b> being
investigated theoretically and experimentally.  Fluid pumping can be actuated
by moving vapor slug (bubble) generated by suitably phased heating elements
along the channel.  Gallardo et al have shown pumping of aqueous and organic
liquids in mm- and &micro;m-sized channels controlling concentration of
redox-active surfactants temporally and spatially using an electrode array.
<p>
<b>Sample Prep</b>.  The 1st stage in lab-on-a-chip:  crude samples (blood, urine,
water) will isolate the biomolecule of interest.  Minimum sample volume depends
on analyte concentration and minimum molecules of interest.  If there are 100
molecules/ml, then 1 &micro;l sample may contain no analyte.  If there are
4400-11,000 white cells in 1 &micro;l human blood, that is about 14-40 ng DNA.
Depending on the circumstances, samples of larger volume may need to be
pre-processed before putting on the chip.  <b>Microfiltration</b> processes
might be used to isolate WBCs from RBCs, to remove Hb since it interferes with
PCR and other manipulations of DNA.  Microfilters have been fabbed using wet
and reactive ion etching of silicon: structural designs include arrays of
posts, tortuous channels, comb-shape and weir-type filters.  A microfiltration
chip generally an etched chamber with filter element across entire width
of chamber.  Structure capped with planar glass.  Sample is pumped into chip
and particulates of known type trapped at front grill or within filter bed.
WBC and RBC separations are function of cell concentration, applied pressure,
medium viscosity, and filter port size.  RBCs can pass through 3 &micro;m
filter gaps while very deformable WBCs with 15 &micro;m diameters pass through
gaps of 7 &micro;m.  A filter system of 1.0 &micro;l whole blood with 5000
WBCs  can be okay if only 10% cells collected (500 cells).  Magnetic cell
sorting has been attempted with 300-fold enrichment, but interaction time of
particles with magnet was difficult because microchannel flow was parabolic,
and there was buildup of magnetic particles that increased field gradient
and caused particle clogging.  <b>Electronic cell separation</b> was attempted
by making spiral gold electrodes on glass substrate:  four parallel spiral
elements are energized with phase-quadrature signals with 100 Hz and 100 MHz
frequencies.  3D forces are generated to cause cell radial motion, levitation
and trapping.  These have been used to enrich breast cancer and to isolate same
cells from blood.  Pt/Ti and In/Sn-oxide electrodes aside from Au have been
studied.
<p>
<b>Biochemical Reaction</b>. Nucleic acid amplification has been done in
chips fabbed from glass, silicon-glass, and plastic.  Thermal and isothermal
amplification was done with reaction volumes of 1-25 &micro;l  Silicon-glass
was bonded using either silicone rubber or anodic bonding, and amplicon products
ranged from 50-1600 bp.   An on-chip polysilicon thin film heater or external
Peltier heater-coooler, or infrared radiation was used to achieve heating cycles.
Conventional hot-start PCR, LCR, DOP-PCR, multiplex PCR, and SDA have been done
in microchips. Single-step RT-PCR has been used for RNA.  Stability to within
&plusmn;0.3&deg; and transition of 8&deg;/s has been achieved.  Passivation
to make surfaces friendly to PCR and LCR have been tried.  Covering silicon
with thermally induced silicon dioxide (2000 &Aring; thick) is most effective
for NAA reactions.  Isothermal NAA techniques (NA sequence-based amplfication
and SDA) are candidates for microchips.  Other reactions incud CZE and post-column
reaction (amino acids with o-phthaldehyde) and have generated theoretical
plates of 83000 and 90 ms peak widths.
<p>
<b>Result Detection</b>.  An advantage of microfabbed chips is the ability to
create separation  methods which include free-solution capillary electrohoresize,
capillary gel electrophoresis, micellar electrokinetic chromatography,
isotachophoresis, isoelectric focusing, open-channel electrochromatography,
and free-flow electrophoresis.  Use glass capillary electrophoresis chip, a
free solution capillary electrophoresis of six &gamma;-FITC-labeled amino acids
done in 15 s, with counting done using confocal microscopy.  In a study of CGE
in 1994 non-crosslinked 10% % polyacrylamide is filled into microchannels machined
on planar glass to size-separate phosphorthioate oligos between 10-25 nt in
45 s with 200 nm plate height.  MEKC uses monoionic surfactants above critical
micellar concentration to separate uncharged solutes which partition
into micelles.  Three coumarin dyes were separated in 50 mM SDS in 100% MeOH
at 400 V/cm with excellent reproducibility.  8 biogenic amines were separated
in 75 s in MEKC in glass chip and this was also done for soy sauce samples too.
Isotachophoresis was used to separate two herbicides on glass-glass microchip:
paraquat and diquat at 230 nM were dected using Raman spectroscopy, with the
Raman microprobe could to microchip without interfacing.  Spectra were generated
using 532 nm NdY-VO4 laser of 2 W collected at 8/cm resolution with holographic
transmissive spectrography and cooled CCD.  A glass microchip etched with
200 &micro;m wide-10 &micro;m deep and 7 cm long channel was used for cIEF using
Cy5-labeled peptides focused in 30 s with 400 nm plate heights.  With
open-channel electrochromatography (OCEC), electro-osmotic pumping is used to
move mobile phase through serpentine microchannel.  ODS is bonded as stationary
phase and three neutral coumarin dyes in a 10 mM
Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> &bull; 10 H<sub>2</sub> (sodium
tetrborate) buffer in 25% MeCN are separated.  For separation of biopolymers
or cells 2D methods might be deployed:  micromachined silicon has been used
to separate RBITC-labeled amino acids in 20 min at 40 V using FFE.
Pulsed-field electrophoresis (PFE) was done in microfabbed silicon devices
where arrays etched on silicon were utilized as separation matrix rather than
gels used in conventional PFE.  Biopolymer motions in microarray matrix are
more uniform compared to what happens in gels.  Megabase DNA will not be trapped
in these arrays.   In the analysis of oligos, fragment sizing can be used to
determine if there are sequence mutations or the other is to determine sequence.
In analyzing sequence differences PCR amplified HLA-DQ&alpha; was rapidly sized
in about 2 min in glass cap device, with DNA markers from 72 to 1353 bp sizes
spiked in sample.  Hydroxyethyl cellulose was added as sieving matrix.
<p>
<b>Microarray-Based Affinity Binding Assay</b>. DNA chips for mutation
detection, SNP analysis, DNA resequencing, and gene expression studies have
been developed. To screen for heterozygous mutations in the 3450 nt exon 11 in
<i>BRCA1</i>, a glass-based DNA chip with 96600 site density, and probes 20 nt
long synthesized in situ by light-directed synthesis. DNA mutation detection
using microfabbed silicon bioelectronic chip is done by oligo hybrids showin
different affinities and sensing using adjusted applied field strength. Single
bp mismatch discrimination is seen in &lt; 15 s with high resolution with
electronic field denaturation approach. The large-scale identification, mapping
and genotyping of SNPs in a 2.3 Mbase genomic DNA was done with glass-based
high density variation detection chip: 3241 candidate SNPs were identified and
a map showing the 2227 locations produced. The assays took 15 h. Both oligo and
cDNA have been arrayed on glass for gene expression: the genome-wide expression
monitoring of S. cerevisiae was done with 260,000 chosen oligo probes.
Expression from 1 copy in 10 cells to hundreds per cell were seen in rich and
minimal media. Protein microarrays made on active silicon chips with
microelectrodes made on chip as individually addressable connections in CMOS
circuitry built on the silicon as well.  Peptides are attached by
electropolymerization of pyrrole-modified peptides; these were ACTH fragments.
Peptides were examined with antibodies.  Other means include high density
arrays on PVDF surfaces.  Macromolecular deposition techniques include
microdispensing, electrospray deposition, robotic printing, stamping, inkjet
deposition, and ion soft-landing.

Separation of modified 2&prime;-deoxyoligonucleotides using ion-pairing 
reversed-phase HPLC
<p class="Para1">
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of oligos from 2- to 100-mers often provides
as much as 98% purity to remove failure sequences.  Disavdantages are low loading
capacity and the need to extract and remove gel components.  Anion-exchange
and reversed-phase HPLC are more desirable. Anion-exchange can purify from 2- to
30-mers between 95-98% purity.  Separation selectivity decreases with increasing
oligo length and overall yield is sacrificed as the fraction is restricted to
higher purity.  In addition AEX eluates must be desalted.  RPLC using trityl-on
oligos allows the prodcut to be retained strongly and allows purities of 95%;
acidification must be done to remove the DMT function; a disadvantage is the 
significant presence of failure sequences that are also trityl-on which cannot
be resolved.  In this study purification using ion-pair RPLC (IP-RPLC) is demonstrated
for normal and modified oligonucleotides.
<p>
Modifications to the oligos are generally methyl and ethyl esterifications.
A purification of an <i>N</i> <sup>6</sup> isopropyl dA 23-mer is demonstrated.
All oligos have same sequences, but differ in length and psotion of alkyl adduct.
Adducts are on base functional groups, not the phosphoribose backbone.
<p>
A <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-isopropyl dA 23-mer was ordered and supposedly HPLC purified.
It was analyzed on receipt, and still shows many impurities.  It was re-analyzed
after semi-preprative purificaiton.  In purification, the gradient is not as steep
as it is for analytical work, in which rapid analysis is desired and resolution
in sacrificed.  Column temperature is important here:  lower temperatures often
improve resolution as the oligo can gain secondary structure with differences in
sequence and conformation.  Purification temp of 30&deg;.  Resolution decreases 
with higher temperatures, the case for shallow gradients at high temperatures.
Purity of isolated oligos is about 98%.  Note that no desalting is required.
<p>
In another study, an oligo was modified with an <i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl A,
<i>O</i><sup>5</sup>-methylG, and an <i>O</i><sup>4</sup>-methylT and these were
resolvable with an optimizied multigradient program, with unmodified oligo 
eluting at 23 min and the alkylated eluting within 35 min after the unmodified
eluted.
<p>
Thus IP-RPLC can separate oligos with same sequence with different alkyl adducts
at same base position, or same alkyl adduct on a different base, or a different
location on the same base.  This does not occur with anion-exchange HPLC.
The interesting thing is to study how hydrophobiciity (based on RPLC retention
time) is affected by the type and position of alkylation, and what effect it
has on charge density in the base rings.  It should be noted that the alkyl
adduct to exocyclic heteratoms (those not part of the base ring) are more likely
to affect chromatographic chemistry compared to adducts on endocyclic heteratoms.
In one case, a methylation of carbon 5 in cytosine did not allow separation of
modified and unmodified 22-mer oligo; however this could be resolved with an 18-mer.
<p>
With longer oligos, the peak width increases substantially even in an optimized
gradient program to adjust elution to the similar retention times.  For the 18-mer
the peak width is 2.3 min but the 32-mer is nearly doubled with a 4.1 min peak
width.  The resolutions compute to 1.3 for the 18-mer (resolution &gt; 1 is 
baseline) while it is 0.6 for 32-mer.
<p>
The Transgenomic WAVE system was used with two different OligoSep columns
(DNA-99-3510, analytical) and a semi-prep (NUC-99-2866) using the nonporous
C18 PS-DVB columns with <i>T</i> = 30&deg;.  Solvent A is 0.1 M TEAA and solvent
B is A + 25% MeCN, with 0.75 and 1.2 ml/min for analytical and semiprep columns.
A 1 mg load is possible.  In general lyophilized samples are taken up in 100
&micro;l deionized water and 2 &times; 50 &micro;l injections done on the analytical
column.  With semi-prep, the sample is taken up in 1 ml and 2 &times; 500 &micro;l
injections done.  Fractions are collected in 400 &micro;l volumes.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>.  Previous reports have emphasized that IP-RPLC and its 
dynamic ion-exchange features separate based on charge interaction and oligo
length independent of sequence and of minor modification to oligo bases.  But
additional work shows that both sequence and secondary interactions (conformation)
also affect retention, separation, and resolution.  Alkyl adduct addition might
not just affect electrostatic and hydrophobic characteristics, but also create
steric effects that alter conformation and bending, which alters solute
stationary phase interaction.  Base composition is important as well:  thymine
is the most hydrophobic.  Alkylation can alter tautomeric changes in bases
(keto to enol to keto transitions) and thus affect charge center formation and
delocalization.

A computational method to predict genetically encoded rare amino acids in proteins
<p class="Para1">
<b>Method</b>.  Codons are expanded or re-defined beyond the standard genetic
code of 20 canonical amino acids in the three Domains of life.  Selenocysteine
and pyrrolysine (Sec and Pyl) are the proposed 21st and 22nd amino acids, resp.
Sec is a strong nucleophile and is reported in a range of organisms from
<i>E coli</i> to <i>H sapiens</i>.  As an element selenium is a micronutrient
but also an environmental hazard to animals in excess amounts.  Sec is a rare
amino acid, and predicting their presence in proteins is difficult.  Rare
amino acids are not coded by a dedicatd codon but rather encoded under special
circumstances.  Sec is encoded by an opal (UGA) codon and Pyl by an amber
(UAG) code.   So when is it a stop codon and when is it sense?  In the transcript
that includes Sec as an amino acid is a signal for insertion of the selenocysteine
amino acid callsed SECIS (selenocysteine insertion sequence).  There is considerable
divergence in this signal with respect to sequence and relative position of the
signaling element.   Elements can be upstream (5&prime;) to the recoded ORF
(archaea, eukaryotes) or downstream of the recoded UGA (bacteria).  As for Pyl,
there is a PYLIS (SECIS equivalent) <i>cis</i>-acting element and perhaps
competition between termination or sense readthrough.  Attempts have been made
to catalogue the selenoproteome in the various genomes for predicting codiing.
One criterion is the UGA codon alignment pairwise with the Cys residue in
homologous proteins.  The other criterion is detecting the consensus SECIS signal.
In a test both methods give near-zero false negatives.  The methods applied
separately have faults however.  High numbers of false positives occur with
a genome-wide search of short, local RNA folding motifs such as SECIS element,
complicated by the fact there are divergent SECIS sequences among organisms.
This study introduces a multi-component shceme for microbial Pyl and Sec prediction
with a series of criteria:  a read-through similarity analysis (RSA) applied at
an early stage to evaluate sense readthrough of the ORF.  It does not rely on
any special RNA context, readthrough mechanism, or incorporation of any particular
amino acid residue at the recoding site.  After RSA, then the Cys alignment and/or
SECIS can be enforced or overridden.  This method identifies all the UGA-encoded
Sec residues of known selenoproteins, including novel candidates, and it identifies
UAG-encoded pyrrolysyl proteins as well.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  The prediction scheme was developed based on expectation of
<ol>
<li>showin significant read-through similarity
<li>alignment of Sec with semi-invariant Cys in a set of aligned homologues
<li>a hairpin motif (putative SECIS) near candidate ORF
</ol>
<p>
As to RSA, the sequence following the UGA codon was examined to see if it aligns
to homologous proteins expressing similar sequences.  This statistical detection
in relatively short regions is obtained using modified interpretation of
standard dynamic alignment methods.  For each predicted ORF, BLAST is used to
search homologous proteins in customized database.  BLAST search space is
restricted to 100 residues length pivoting at the stop codon.  BLOSUM62 matrix
is used throughout and the Sec residue is treated as <q>any amino acid</q> (X).
The BLAST database contained maximum of 650,87- protein sequences from the
annotated complete microbial genomes of NCBI.  A self-excluding BLAST database
was used for homology search in each organism.  Top hits (<i>E</i> &le; 0.1)
on either side of stop codon were identified.  For each selected, truncated
ORF sequences ({<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>,...,
<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>,..., <i>x<sub>u</sub></i>,..., <i>x<sub>n</sub></i>},
where <i>n</i> = min(<i>u</i> + 60, <i>u</i> + <i>t</i>}, <i>u</i> = position
of stop codon, <i>t</i> = position of subsequent stop codon) and the corresponding
top hit sequence from the BLAST search ({<i>y</i><sub>1</sub>,
<i>y</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>y<sub>j</sub></i>,...<i>y<sub>m</sub></i>}), a
(<i>n</i> + 1) &times; (<i>m</i> + 1) dynamic alignment matrix was calculated
with affine gap penalty function.  N-terminal overhangs for both sequences were
not penalized, and the 0<sup>th</sup> row and 0<sup>th</sup> column were
initialized with zero values.  For each element (<i>i, j</i>) of the matrix,
the following is calculated
<p class="eqnserif" style="white-space:pre!important;text-align:left;margin-top:-1em!important;">
     <i>a</i>(<i>i, j</i>) = <i>s</i>(<i>i, j</i>) + max { <i>a</i>(<i>i</i> &minus; 1, <i>j</i> &minus; 1), <i>b</i>(<i>i</i> &minus; 1, <i>j</i> &minus; 1), <i>c</i>(<i>i</i> &minus; 1, <i>j</i> &minus; 1) }
     <i>b</i>(<i>i, j</i>) = max { &minus;(<i>h</i> + <i>g</i>) + <i>a</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i> &minus; 1), &minus;<i>g</i> + <i>b</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i> &minus; 1), &minus;(<i>h</i> + <i>g</i>) + <i>c</i>(<i>i</i> &minus; 1, <i>j</i> &minus; 1) }
     <i>c</i>(<i>i, j</i>) = max { &minus;(<i>h</i> + <i>g</i>) + <i>a</i>(<i>i</i> &minus; 1, <i>j</i>), &minus;(<i>h</i> + <i>g</i>) + <i>b</i>(<i>i</i> &minus; 1, <i>j</i>), &minus;<i>g</i> + <i>c</i>(<i>i</i> &minus; 1, <i>j</i>) }
     score(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) = max { <i>a</i>(<i>i, j</i>), <i>b</i>(<i>i, j</i>), <i>c</i>(<i>i, j</i>) }
     <i>s</i>(<i>i, j</i>) &rarr; BLOSUM62 matrix
     <i>h</i> = 12, <i>g</i> = 2

     best_score<sub>ORF</sub> = max { score(<i>n, j</i>), <i>j</i> = 1,..., <i>m</i> }
<p>
The significance of the alignment at the COOH extension after the stop codon was
of the greater interest, so the highest score from the <i>n</i>th column,
namely the alignment of the terminal residue <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> of the
truncated ORF with the { <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>,..., <i>y<sub>m</sub></i> } residues,
was taken as the maximal score (best_score<sub>ORF</sub>) instead of usual
Smith-Waterman score.  A <i>Z</i> value is computed by shuffling the terminal
extension region 100 times, recomputing the scores in the terminal block of the
matrix ({<i>x</i><sub>stop</sub>,..., <i>x<sub>n</sub></i>} and
{<i>y</i><sub>1</sub>,..., <i>y<sub>m</sub></i>}) and averaging the maximal
score ( &lang;best_score<sub>rand</sub>&rang; ).  A test calculation with 10,000
times shuffling for one genome produced similar results.  The values from
randomized sequences were used to calculate a <i>Z</i>-value:
<p class="eqnserif" style="white-space:pre!important;text-align:left;margin-top:-1em!important;">
     <i>Z</i><sub>ORF</sub> = (best_score<sub>ORF</sub> &minus; &lang;best_score<sub>ORF</sub>&rang;) &divide; standard_deviation
<p>
A generally weak dependence on length and amino acid composition makes the
<i>Z</i>-values (which follow an extreme value distribution) useful for evaluating
significance of alignment scores.  A fairly conservative <i>Z</i>-value cutoff
(<i>Z<sub>c</sub></i> = 8.0) is used to decide statistical significance of a
C-terminal alignment, but the selection criteria had to be relaxed for two
legitimate selenoproteins with Z-values of 7.9 and 4.6.
<p>
<b>MSA</b>. For each of the selected candidate ORFs (<i>Z<sub>c</sub></i> &ge; 8), a
sensitive iterative PSI-BLAST search was performed using position-specific
scoring matrices.  Top 10 hites (<i>E</i> &le; 10<sup>&minus;3</sup>) were used
to construct a MSA with ClustalW.  Amino acids lining up with the putative
Sec residue were examined, and Sec that aligned with &ge; 2 Cys residues were
selected for further analysis.
<p>
A 111 nt-long mRNA sequence window around the UGA position (&minus;10 to +100)
were analyzed from each of the ORFs passing previous tests in each bacterial
organism. These sequences were used to a single, common hairpin motif using the
rapid, heuristic-based RNAPROFILE algorithm.  A test calculation predicted the
known SECIS element of the gene encodign <i>E coli</i> FDH correctly.  Putative
SECIS hairpin motifs were inspected manually.
<p>
Performance of the RSA step weas analyzed with the <i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i>
which utilizes UGA to code for Trp throughout its genome.  <i>M genitalium</i>
has a samll genome of 470 genes, majority of which have a homolog in the
test database and thus minimizing effects related to any small database size.
The RSA was applied to all theoretical ORFs with a single in-frame TAA, TAG,
or TGA, which are 313, 137, and 780 ORFs, respectively.  A self-excluding
BLAST database of microbial proteins was used.  Over 78% of the TGA cases
(91% when a self-included database was used) were identified by the RSA method
as recoding events with a <i>Z</i> &ge; 8 in the case of <i>M genitalium</i>;
they aligned overwhelmingly with Trp residues in homologs.  In contrast only
2-3% of the ORFs with TAA or TAG stop passed the RSA test.  When the selenorprotein
detection was used for <i>Aeropyrum pernix</i> genome having no Sec insertion
genes, 26 of the 1288 ORFs with in-frame UGA were selected by RSA (~2%) but
filtered out in the subsequent MSA test.
<p>
Only the genomes of organisms containing at least one of the genes identified
for synthesizing selenoproteins were analyzed (SelA, the tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>
selenium transferase; SelB, the elongation factor which binds the hairpin and
the charged tRNA; SelC, the tRNA gene itself).  (Note the SelD, labile selenium
donor selenophosphate synthetase, was not used as part of the SID (selenocysteine
insertion device) becasuse it can be a selenoprotein itself.
<p>
All the predictored theoretical ORFs (&ge; 90 nt) containing in-frame UGA stop
were run through RSA.  3594 of the 203,339 ORFs met the test for likely similarity
of readthrough sense.
<p>
These were then subjected to MSA (multiple sequence alignment), and the Cys
alignment criterion was applied.  Cys residues often function as nucleophiles
or metal coordination, and Sec is a good functional substitute.  The MSA
reduced the candidate ORFs to 109.
<p>
The next test was the SECIS element detection.  In archaea and eukaryotes, SECIS
is conserved, and less so in bacteria.  Although a bacterial SECIS consensus
has been reported, this study used a fast, heuristic-based search for a short
hairpin motif common to a set of short, unaligned mRNA segments downstream of
the UGA codon of the candidate selenoprotein ORF.  Both primary and secondary
structure were evaluated in this alighment for bacteria.  For archaea, the
SECISearch program reported by others was sufficient.
<p>
53 of 55 known selenoproteins were found with this multistep process (96%
sensitivity).  90% of the protteins belonged to known families  About 48% of
the selenoproteins fall within the formate dehydrogenase protein family.  FDH
is a member of the molybdopterin-dependent FDH/DMSO reductase superfamily of
homologous enzymes in the SCOP classification.  Several ORFs showed presence
of -CxxC- or -CxxCxxC- motifs usual for subset of redox proteins where a Cys
is replaced with Sec.
<p>
Two known selenoproteins were not detected.  The first was a <i>SelD</i> gene
in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> because of a sequence error in the genomic data.
The 2nd was a radical S-adenosylmethionine domain in <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i>.
The Sec residue is too close to the COOH terminus, causing a very low RSA
<i>Z</i> value.  A strength of the RSA is that it can detect selenoproteins
with nonstandard SECIS motifs.  Four selenoproteins were identified by RSA
and Cys alignment that would have been rejected using the SECIS alignment.
<p>
The RSA was used to search for pyrrolysine (Pyl) as a UAG amber readthrough.
Methylamine serves as an electrophile for methylation of a cobalt-corrinoid
cofactor.  Homologs of the <i>pylS</i> gene coding for Pyl-specific aminoacyl
tRNA synthetase were searched, and those genomes identified were species thought
to have Pyl-containing proteins.  In four species there are 34 ORFs with putative
Pyl residues having significant readthrough to homologous methyltransferases.
Additional files are included in the publication of the ORFs that pass both the
RSA and the MSA filters.
<p>
The selenoproteins fell into certain pathways and functional categories.  The
major detected bacterial selenoproteins were formate dehydrogenases converting
HCOO<sup>&minus;</sup> to CO<sub>2</sub> in anaerbosis.  SelD, GrdA, and GrdB
are from anaerobic glycine reduction pathway; HesB with nitrogen fixation,
and several oxidoreductases (thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin).  In the archaea
the Sec proteins are confined to enzymes in anaerobic methanogenesis (FDH,
formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase from FDH family, and heterodisulfide reductase).
Pyrrolysine is found in methyltransferases using methyalmine substrates.
<p>
Previous work using the SECIS approach to identify Sec-containing proteomes
had false hits of 3-15 per 10 megabases in eukaryotes, and this surpassed the
number of true selenoproteins.  Another study used metazoa in which aligned
known SECIS elements formed a training dataset, and this was used to improve
a statistical profile.  A bacterial SECIS-search method identified 48,472
SECIS hits in 29 genomes (1.5% of all UGA codons analyzed), and 28,974 (about
60%) were selected for further analysis of the proteins sequence in the
UGA-flanking region.  Use of techniques looking at RNA signal sequence in an
early phase of analysis is a problem, and especially with new genomes whose
signals are not understood.  Instead, the first step should be to look at
protein sequence alignments.  RSA is done on the amino acids in small segments:
of 203,339 sequences analyzed, 3594 (about 1.7%) were passed on as candidates
which is a reasonable number.  MSA was then done on the transcripts to limit
that number to 109 ORFs, and 92 (about 84%) made it past that filter.  Thus
most of the false positives are removed.

The direct genetic encoding of pyrrolysine
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Methanogens were placed in the group Archae rather than the
Bacteria and Eucarya (see work of Woese).  Indeed, methanogenesis appears to
depend on pyrrolysine and is the 22nd genetically encoded amino acid found
in nature.  Most methanogens can convert CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub>,
but members of <i>Methanosarcinacea</i> have pathways that can start from
CO, CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>&minus;</sup>, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, CH<sub>3</sub>S-R,
and CH<sub>3</sub>NHRR&prime;.  In particular pyrrolysine must be in the genetic
code of these organisms to produce methane from methylamines.  Methanogens
have coded for pyrrolysine by altering the UAG codon, normally a stop codon
in multiicellular organisms, for translation of Pyl.
<p>
Coenzyme M (CoM) is methylated as the next to last step in forming CH<sub>4</sub>
from CH<sub>3</sub>NRR&prime;.  Methyl-CoM disproportionates into CH<sub>4</sub> and
CO<sub>2</sub>, producing energy and anabolic precursors.  The methyltransferases
MttB, MtbB, and MtmB are responsible for producing CoM methylation from
(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>N, (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH, and
CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> (the tri-, di-, and monomethylamines), respectively,
and they are highly abundant.  Each methyltransferase methylates a cognate
corrinoid protein demethylated by MtbA, a methylcobamide:CoM methyltransferase.
The encoding genes were found to contain an in-frame amber stop that actually
translates.  Other members of Archaea do not show translation.  Multiple copies
of <i>mtmB, mtbB</i> and <i>mttB</i> in three members of <i>Methanosarcina</i>
and one of <i>Methanococcoides</i>.  With the exception of a family of
transposase genes, the methylamine methyltransferase genes are the only genes
known to have conserved amber codons with translatable amino acid.  After
finding the translating codon, it was suspected that translation might be
achieved by posttranscriptional editing (e.g. intron processing), but sequencing
and S1 nuclease analysis of transcripts eliminated that possibility.  Alternatives
to translation (e.g., ribosome hopping) were eliminated by sequencing the
MtmB polypeptide showing UAG translation as Lys.  UAG was thus either a
canoncial residue or a labile lysine derivative.  MtmB crystallography (by
M. Chan and coworkers) revealed a modified Lys (Pyl) was at the position.
Pyl is a Lys with &epsilon;-nitrogen forming amide linkage with
(4<i>R</i>,5<i>R</i>)-4-methyl-pyrroline-5-carboxylate.  Note the 4-methyl
group was thought to be a 4-amino, but mass spectra confirm the assignment.
There is an imine bond in the pyrroline ring, and the C-2 carbon shows reactivity
with ammonia, hydroxylamine and dithionite.  Adding an electronegative group
to C-2 rotates pyrrolysine by 90&deg;, presenting the C-2 adduct to an
incoming corrinoid protein.  Pyrrolysine may thus form a methylammonium adduct
in the active site of these methylamine methyltransferases, activating and
orienting the mono-, di-, and trimethylamine for CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>
transfer.
<p>
Is Pyl the 22nd or 21st amino acid?  SelenoCys (Sec) was the previous noncanonical
amino acid added to the genetic code, which is also coded by the UGA stop
codon and associates with a dedicated tRNA species.  However, there are huge
differences.  SeCys is found in all three Domains of life whereas Pyl
is limited to <i>Methanosarcinacea</i> and Gram-positive <i>Desulfitobacterium
hafniense</i>.  SeCys is not a free metabolite, but rather formed on the
tRNA.  In contrast Pyl is a free amino acid that is charged to a dedicated
tRNA by a cognate synthetase.
<p>
Pyrrolysyl-tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> (also called tRNA<sub>CUA</sub>) is encoded by
<i>pylT</i> gene adjacent to <i>mtmB1</i> gene cluster in <i>Methanosarcinacea</i>
members.  <i>D. hafniense</i> has a <i>pylT</i> and mttB homologues (latter
has in-frame amber codon).  The tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> are highly conserved, although
diverging from <i>D hafniense</i>.  tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> for selenoCys has
unusual characteristics not found in most tRNAs, including its UCA anticodon,
an extended acceptor stem, extremely small D loop, and a lack of consensus
bases found in most tRNA species.  tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> has the expected cruciform
secondary structure, but a small D-loop.  Instead of the customary two bases,
there is one base between acceptor and D-stems.  The G base in the D-loop that
is universally conserved and the T&psi;C sequence in the T loop are lacking.
The anticodon stem has 6 instead of 5 bp, with only a 3-base variable loop.
Additionally the distal base pair in the anticodon loop (bp 23&bull;41) is
A&bull;U in <i>Methylsarcinacea</i> but G&bull;C in <i>D. hafniense</i>, which
could indicate that the 6-base stem for the anticodon part is vital.  Melting
curve analysis indicates a conformation that is likely L-shaped tertiary
structure typical of tRNA species;  there is likely a similarity of
tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> to mammalian tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(UGA) suppressor.  Base
modifications in <i>M. barkeri</i> tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> show probable changes
to U<sub>8</sub> (4-thio-U) and U<sub>50</sub> (1-methyl-pseudouridine).
<p>
The PylS product codes for the synthetase that charges Pyl to its tRNA.  The
<i>pylS</i> gene is adjacent to <i>pylT</i> for the tRNA.  An early recombinant
product was said to be a Lys-tRNA synthetase, but is probably a misfolding.
His-tagged PylS is unable to use any standard amino acid (like Lys).  In the
presence of synthetic Pyl, it uses ATP to form Pyl-AMP, which then joins to
tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> as shown with acid-urea gel shifts.  The reaction is quite
specific:  presence of canonical amino acids are neither utilized nor inhibit
the reaction.  The <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> for the naturally occurring
4<i>R</i>,5<i>R</i> stereoisomer of <i>L</i>-pyrrolysine is 50 &micro;M, with a
<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> of 6 min<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  The <i>K</i><sub>M</sub>
for a racemic mix of enamine and imine forms was 10-fold higher but with a
similar <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>.   The higher <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> might indicate
competitive inhibition with isomers present.  tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> is not a
substrate for PylS.  PylS sequence alignment was done using deduced translations
of seven forms of the protein in <i>Methanosarcinaea</i> and in <i>D hafniense</i>.
<i>D hafniense</i> has two genes that make up the N- and C-terminal forms of
PylS (<i>pylSn</i> and <i>pylSc</i>), and these sandwich in a cluster in the
genome the <i>pylBCD</i> cluster responsible for Pyl biosynthesis.  The alignment
using the archaeal PylS reveals a huge gap between <i>pylSn</i> and <i>pylSc</i>
indicating two domains in PylS.  The COOH-terminal has three motifs that
identify catalysis domains in class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, while the
amino terminal sequence is not related to known synthetases but might be involved
in specific recognition of the tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> substrate.
<p>
Amber suppression has been used to add amino acids to the <i>E coli</i> genetic
code, adding an unnatural amino acid.  <i>E coli</i> has been created that
incorporates the <i>pylT</i> tRNA gene and the <i>pylS</i> synthetase which
includes the ability to produce <i>mtmB1</i> transcripts which incorporate
exogenously supplied Pyl during translation.  These in vitro studies confirm
the specificity of PylS for Pyl and tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup>.
<p>
It should be noted that class 1 and class 2 Lys-tRNA synthetases (not PylS) of
<i>M barkeri</i> were observed to charge tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> with Lys in vitro,
and the potential of the physiological role is not known.  The rate is quite
slow however:  1 synthesis per hour and PylS charges tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> with
Pyl both in vivo and in vitro far more rapidly.
<p>
The elongation factor EF-Tu can bind Lys-tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> in vitro, but since
Pyl-tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> is also translated in <i>E coli</i> at a UAG codon, it
also binds EF-Tu. Sec-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> is not bound by EF-Tu but rather by
SelB or EFSec as special elongation factors. SelB binds to a structural element
SECIS of the transcript that is 3&prime; to the UGA (not UAG) codon and
promotes its translation rather than its termination. In Eucarya and Archaea,
SECIS is in the 3&prime;-UTR and not near the UGA (not UAG) codon. In Eucarya,
EFSec binds to SECIS via the SBP2 protein.
<p>
Genome analysis of <i>Methanosarcinacea</i> genomes finds no product in which
UAG is a stop codon, although there are definite examples of UAG as a stop
codon in <i>D. hafniense</i>.  While the archaeal species may have recoded
UAG fully as a sense codon, it is possible that UAG translation requires a
<i>cis</i>-acting factor(s) for Pyl-protein transcripts.  There is a conserved
stem-loop structure (called PYLIS) found immediately 3&prime; to UAG codons
in <i>mtmB1</i> and <i>mtmB2</i> transcripts from several <i>Methanosarcina</i>
spp although this might reflect high identity in the <i>mtmB</i> genes.
Such similarity was found in <i>mtmB1</i> and <i>mttB</i> in <i>M barkeri</i>,
but not in <i>mtbB1</i> transcript.  Thus if the element were necessary for
Pyl translation, it should be present.  It might be that the PYLIS structure
in the transcript sequence involve factors similar to SelB or SBP2.  There is
a truncated SelB homolog in <i>Methanosarcina</i>.  These structures may also
act to discourage translational termination.
<p>
Balakrishnan has published a group theoretical analysis of the existent genetic
code and predicted that UAG would encode a novel amino acid similar to His.
While it is debatable that His or Pyl are structurally similar, they both
have N-containing 5-member rings ionizing in physiological range.  This report
also predicted that UAA would encode another amino acid with properties similar
to Lys or Arg.
<p>
UAG is a stop codon rarely used in many organisms, and so it could very well be
recruited to code for unusual amino acids. <i>E coli</i> has the ability to
suppress the amber stop using common amino acids, Pyl, and other unnatural
amino acids. Thus UAG suppression combined with <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>
-acting factors can further the evolution of proteins. Other instances might
exist. For example a phosphoSeryl-tRNA synthetase involved in archaeal Cys
synthesis has recently been described.
<p>
<b>Update</b>.  A mutant with the <i>pylT</i> and its promoter deleted in
<i>Methanosarcina acetivorans</i> has been shown to be unable to translate
UAG as Pyl.  It grows well on all substrates except methylamines, and so
the major role of Pyl is in methylamine metabolism.  A new algorithm to detect
Pyl-containing proteins using bioinformatics tools has also been reported:
this was used to identify a very small number of proteins.  Also a new report
shows that PYLIS element is found in transcripts, revealed by in vitro
RNase- and lead-based structure probing, although the role of this element
in UAG translation as Pyl remains unverified.

Fibrinogen and Fibrin Structure and Functions
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Both fibrinogen and fibrin play roles in blood clotting, cellular
and matrix interactions, inflammatory response, wound healing and neoplasia.
The fibrinogen monomer is a 45 nm rod-shaped molecule with two outer D domains
connected by coiled-coil segment to central E domain.  Two sets of three
polypeptide chains (A&alpha;, B&beta;, and &gamma;) are joined in the N-terminal
E domain by five symmetrical disulfide bridges.  Non-symmetrical disulfide
bridges form a ring.  The A&alpha; has 610 aa, B&beta; has 461 aa, and the
&gamma;A form has 411 aa.  A minor variant of the &gamma; chain, &gamma;&prime;, comes from
alternative processing in which positions 408-411 &gamma;<sub>A</sub> is
substituted with 20 residues (positions 408-427) containing two sulfated
Tyr residues: this variant is 8% of total fibrinogen &gamma; chain and are
in heterodimeric fibrinogen; heterodimers are 15% of all plasma fibrinogen.
Homodimeric with variants are 1% of molecules.
<p>
The A&alpha; chain is structured with N-terminal fibrinopeptide A (FPA):  this
is the site for thrombin proteolysis leading to fibrin assembly: exposing the
polymerization interaction site E<sub>A</sub>.   E<sub>A</sub> is composed of
(1) residues 17-20 GPRV at N-terminus of &alpha;-chain and (2) residues
15-42 in the &beta;-chain of fibrin.  The complementary binding pocket is in the
D domain (Da) located between positions 337-379 of &gamma; chain.
With E<sub>A</sub>:Da interaction, fibrin molecules align in staggered overlapping
end-to-middle domain arrangement for forming double-stranded twisting fibrils.
Lateral associations occur to make multi-stranded fibers.
<p>
Branch junctions in fibrin networks are of two types.  A double-stranded fibril
converges laterally with another fibril to form a four-stranded fibril
(<q>bilateral junction</q>).  Lateral convergence of more fibril makes a
multi-stranded structure.  The second type is the equilateral junction:  this
is the convergent interaction of three fibrin molecules to show three
double-stranded fibrils.  If fibrinopeptide cleavage is slow, the equilateral
type predominates: the matrix is less porous and more heaviliy branched than
those formed with high levels of thrombin.  On the &beta; chain is a segment
that is Fibrinopetpide B (FPB; B&beta;1-14):  its release (enzymatic digestion
by thrombin) is slower than for FPA.  Site E<sub>B</sub> is &beta;15-18 (GHRP)
and this interacts with complementary site Db of the D domain.  With
E<sub>B</sub>:Db, rearrangement of the &beta;<sub>C</sub> of the D doman occur,
and this promotes intermolecular &beta;<sub>C</sub>:&beta;<sub>C</sub> contact,
which is involed in creating lateral associations.
<p>
The &alpha;C domain starts at position 220 in D domain and extends to A&alpha;610.
Fibrinogen catabolite fractions I-6 to I-9, which have no C-terminal portions
of &alpha;C domains will form clots with prolonged thrombin times, reduced
turbidity, and show thinner fibers.  &alpha;C domains are non-covalently tethered
to E domain, but dissociated after FPB cleavage.  Then &alpha;C domains are
available to interact with other &alpha;C, promoting lateral fibril interactions.
<p>
Two constitutive self-association sites in &gamma; chain of each D domain
(&gamma;-module) participate in assembly and cross-linking.  The &gamma;<sub>XL</sub>
site overlaps the &gamma; cross-linking site.  Intermolecular &gamma;<sub>XL</sub>
interaction aligns these crosslinks for fXIII- or fXIIIa-mediated transglutamination.
The other site is for D:D in the outer portion of the fibrin(ogen) D domain
between positions 275-300 of &gamma;-module.  These create end-to-end alignment
in assembling polymers.  The fibrinogen variant Tokyo II (&gamma;R275C) has
defective D:D interaction and shows branching resulting from slow fibrin assembly
and inaccurate end-to-end positioning.
<p>
The C-terminal region of the &gamma;-chain of each fibrin(ogen) molecule has
one cross-linking by which fXIII or fXIIIa catalyzes &gamma;-dimers:
reciprocal intermolecular &epsilon;-(&gamma;-glutamyl)lysine covalent bonds
between &gamma;406(K) and &gamma;398/399(Q) of another chain are formed.
Similar Lys-&gamma;-Gln bridging occurs with -NH<sub>2</sub> and Lys acceptor
sites in A&alpha; or &alpha; chains: this creates &alpha;-oligomers and
larger &alpha;-polymers.  There is also &alpha;-&gamma; crosslinking intermolecularly,
and also intramolecularly for heterodimers.
<p>
Da:E<sub>A</sub> interaction drives fibrin assembly and facilitates intermolecular
anti-parallel aligment of &gamma;-chain pairs at &gamma;<sub>XL</sub> sites, and
this accelerates rate of cross-linking.  The alignment of &gamma; chains is slower
in fibrinogen than fibrin (thus crosslinking in fibrinogen slower).  However,
fibrinogen crosslinking is concentration-dependent, so its rate can be exceeded
in fibrin if concentration is merely raised.  A controversy arises as to whether
&gamma; chains crosslink transversely between fibril strands or longitudinally
along each strand.  This author has assumed that &gamma; chains crosslink in
fibrin fibrils transversely between the D domains.  This allows for a property
of viscoelasticity in which a maximum stretch of up to 1.8 times the length,
and so crosslinked fibrin films can recover original form, whereas uncrosslinked
fibrin can not do this.
<p>
Plasma fXIII is a heterotetramer with A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> structure.
It binds to &gamma;&prime;-chain and is carried by this fibrinogen form
(Fibrinogen 2).  fXIII has the ability to crosslink both fibrinogen and fibrin
in Ca<sup>2+</sup> presence although it is normally suppressed.  Rates of
crosslinking are comparable to fXIIIa with fibrin.  <q>Intrinsic</q> fXIII
xlinking includes &alpha;<sub>s</sub>-antiplasmin (&alpha;<sub>2</sub>-PI) which
is itself xlinked to fibrinogen:  it is now shown that fXIII can crosslink
&alpha;<sub>2</sub>-PI and fibrinogen.  In normal circumstances only small
amounts of crosslinked fibrin(ogen) are detectable, so fXIII must be regulated.
This regulation may come from heterodimeric &gamma;&prime;-chain containing
Fibogen 2 as it is crosslinked more slowly than &gamma;A/&gamma;A Fib 1 form.
Also excess B subunits present might inhibit since they prevent
thrombin-indenedent activation of fXIII (A<sub>2</sub>).
<p>
Thrombin-substrate binding is mediated by a fibrinogen recognition site
<b>exosite 1</b>.  After binding, FPA is quickly released while FPB is released
more slowly.  Fibrin itself has a residual thrombin binding, but not as a
substrate but likely as inhibitor (an anti-thrombin activity).  This is
antithrombin I (AT-I).  There are two classes of binding:  (1) a low affinity
in the E domain (two sites per molecule) and higher affinity in the D domains
of fibrin(ogen) with the &gamma;&prime; chain (which are 8% of total &gamma;-chain
population in plasma).  N-terminal residues in &alpha;-, &beta;-, and &gamma;-chains
contribute to the forming the low affinity site, residual aspects of thrombin
exosite 1.  The high affinity site is fibrin(ogen) is in the C-terminal part of
&gamma;&prime; between positions 414-427.  Sulfated Tyr residues at
&gamma;&prime;418 and &gamma;&prime;422 increase the thrombin-binding potential.
Thrombin 'exosite 2' binds fibrin at the &gamma;&prime; and binding is divalent,
which increases apparent association constant for high affinity binding.
There are cases of dysfunctional fibrinogens that lead to the deficiency or
absence of AT-I activity.  Fibrinogen type New York I and Naples I show reduced
thrombin-binding and are associated with severe venous and arterial
thromboembolism.  In congential afibrinogenemia or hypofibrogenemia there is both
venous and arterial thromboembolic disease.  With afibrinogenemic plasma there
is an increased level of thrombin which can be normalized by infusion of
fibrinogen.  Adding fibrinogen 2 (&gamma;A/&gamma;&prime;) is more effective
at normalizing thrombin generation than variant 1 (&gamma;A/&gamma;A).  There are
increased levels of prothrombin activation fragment F<sub>1+2</sub> and
thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complexes in afibrinogenemic plasma, and these
markers are normalized with infusion of fibrinogen.  All these findings indicate
fibrinogen importance in thrombin regulation.
<p>
Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is synthesized in endothelial cells
and circulates in blood.  In the presence of fibrin, tPA-mediated activation
of plasminogen is accelerated (not with fibrinogen).  In the distal portion of
each &alpha;C domain are high affinity plasminogen-binding sites.
Fibrinogen type Dusart (A&alpha;R554C-albumin) does not bind plasminogen well.
Fibrinogen type Marburg lacks the &alpha;C domain and there is impaired
stimulated plasminogen activation by tPA.  Both polymers crosslinked and uncrosslinked
promote tPA-stimulated plasminogen activation.  Activation results from a
ternary complex formation of tPA binding fibrinogen and then binding of
plasminogen.  Plasmin then cleaves fibrin.  This exposes additional Lys-binding
sites, which leads to more plasminogen accumulation, and enhancing fibrinolysis.
Positions A&alpha;148-160 and &gamma;312-324 are the two sites providing
enhanced activation: they are cryptic but exposed during fibrin assembly primarily
during D:E interactions inducing conformational changes in D region.
A&alpha;148-160 binds with equal affinity to tPA or plasminogen, although in vivo
plasminogen binds with preference since its concentration is higher in plasma
than tPA.  &gamma;312-324 exclusively binds to tPA.
<p>
&alpha;<sub>2</sub>-PI crosslinks to fibrin &alpha; chains at A&alpha;303.
It enables resistance to fibrinolysis.  It covalently binds to fibrinogen.
fXIII crosslinks to fibrinogen and it too can incorporate &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-PI
into fibrinogen.  PAI-2 is an inhibitor of plasminogen activation by urokinase
or tPA and crosslinks to fibrin in &alpha;C domain remote from the
&alpha;<sub>2</sub>-PI site at A&alpha;303.
<p>
Lipoprotein(a) [LP(a)] is formed from apoLP(a), which is a disulfide-bound
form to apoLP B-100 moeity of LDL.  LP(a) bind to plasmin-degraded fibrin
and fibrinogen in the &alpha;C domain using Lys-independent mechanism, competing
with plasminogen to fibrin(ogen), and crosslinked to fibrinogen by fXIIIa.
<p>
His-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) is both plasma and platelet protein that binds to
fibrin and fibrinogen.  High proportion of HRGP circulates as complex bound
to Lys-binding site of plasminogen, and it is an inhibitor of plasminogen binding
to fibrin(ogen).  In vitro it retards fibrinolysis.  High plasma levels or
deficiencies of HRGP are associated with thrombophilia.
<p>
The fibrin &beta;15-42 sequence mediates fibrin assembly but is also a heparin
binding site, enabling cell-matrix interactions.  This sequences mediates
platelet spreading, fibroblast proliferation, endothelial cell spreading,
proliferation and capillary tube formation. It also is involved in the
release of vWF.  A dimeric heparin-binding fragment (&beta;15-66)<sub>2</sub>
containing sequence &beta;15-57 mimics the high affinity heparin binding of
fibrin or the fibrin E fragment.  Fibrinogen B&beta;1-14 interferes with
heparin binding.  Fibrin &beta;15-42 can bind vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin,
and endothelial cell receptor:  capillary tube formation and angiogenesis
are stimulated;  (&beta;15-66)<sub>2</sub> dimer has much higher affinity to
receptor, indicating a biological association.
<p>
Integrin-binding sequences have a RGD consensus.  A&alpha;572-575 is an RGDS
sequence with integrin binding site, and so possibly is A&alpha;95-98 (RGDF).
The &alpha;C domain crosslinks will promote integrin-dependent cell adhesion
and signaling.  RGD sites compete with fibrinogen &gamma;<sub>A</sub>400-411
sequence for binding of platelet integrin &alpha;<sub>IIb</sub>&beta;<sub>3</sub>.
<p>
The integrin &alpha;<sub>M</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> (Mac-1) is a high affinity
leukocyte receptor for fibrin(ogen) on stimulated monocytes and neutrophils
important for fibrin(ogen)-leukocyte interactions.  Mac-1-binding site within
fibrinogen D domain has two sequences &gamma;190-202 and &gamma;377-395 called
P1 and P2, forming adjacent antiparallel &beta;-strands.  P1 is part of
&gamma;-module, while P2 is inserted to module to form antiparallel &beta;-sheet
with P1.  Deletion of minimal recognition sequence &gamma;390-395 does not
ablate Mac-1 binding.  A second sequence in P1 between &gamma;228 and &gamma;253
contributed to binding activity, explaining why no ablation.
<p>
Fibrin or immobilized fibrinogen bind to Mac-1 with great avidity.  This means
Mac-1 sites, while soluble fibrinogen is a poor ligand.  When converted to
fibrin or immobilized on plastic, cryptic sites are revealed in the D domain.
Other evidence of conformational change include exposure of receptor-induced
binding site (RIBS-1) in the &gamma;373-385 region, which is recognized only
after &alpha;<sub>IIb</sub>&beta;<sub>3</sub> binds to fibrinogen.
<p>
X-ray structures of the D domain and its &gamma;-module would indicate that
&beta; strands are immutable and that transverse crosslinking could not occur
because &gamma;-chain C-terminal segment could not extend far from the D domain
to engage crosslinking of that type. Yakolev et al report htat the P2 segment
containing &gamma;381-390 couild be displaced without disrupting the module
compact structure. This is called a "pull-out" hypothesis in which P2 insert
can be unfolded to enable &gamma;-chain crosslinking and allow for transverse
crosslinking.  Exposure of the Mac-I binding site and RIBS-1 epitope supports
the pull-out model.
<p>
Among the other interactions are plasma fibronectin with A&alpha;-chain
C-teriminal of fibrinogen.  This binding leads to covalent crosslinking
to the Gln-3 of fibronectin.  FGF-2 (bFGF) and VEGF also bind to fibrinogen
and this is mitogenic for endothelial cells.  IL-1&beta; (but not IL-1&alpha;)
displaces bound FGF-2 and also stimulated endothelial cells.

Real-time PCR for mRNA quantitation
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Real-time PCR collects data during the process of PCR, and
real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) is about doing it after
getting a cDNA from mRNA.  The result data is about characterizing a point in
time of PCR, the cycle threshold (C<sub>t</sub>) when amplification of target
is first detected, when fluorescence intensity is greater than background
fluorescence.  The greater amount of the starting material mean C<sub>t</sub>
should be reached earlier than smaller amount.  The dynamic range of the assay
is 7-8 orders of magnitude.  qPCR assays are 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup>
times more sensitive than RNase protection assays, 1000-fold more than dot-blot
hybridization.  They can detect one copy of a specific transcript.  These assays
are sensitive enough to determine differences of gene expression as low as 23%,
with one-third the CV values than band densitometry or probe hybridization
end point assays.  They can also distinguish almost identical sequences,
requiring far less RNA template than other gene expression analysis methods.
A disadvantage is the requirement of expensive equipment and reagents.
<p>
PCR occurs in four phases: a linear ground, early exponential, log-linear,
and plateau phase.  The linear ground is the first 10-15 cycles occurs when
fluorescence is not above background.  Baseline fluorescence is determined
at this time.  In early exponential, the fluorescence rises about a threshold
that is usually 10 times greater than the baseline standard deviation.  This
is the threshold cycle (C<sub>t</sub>) or crossing point (CP).  The starting
copy number is determined from this value.  In log-linear, PCR occurs with
optimal amplification, with near-perfect doubling.  When plateau is reached,
reaction components are limited and changes in fluorescence intensity are
no longer reliable.
<p>
In two-step real-time RT-PCR, the cDNA first strand synthesis occurs in separate
reaction tubes;  in one-step, it is all in one tube.  It is believed that
experimental variation is less with one-step.  But there are cases when one-step
should not be done the same sample is assayed on several occasions, as RNA
degradation can affect results.  Also one-step protocols are reportedly less
sensitive.  Two-step protocols is quite reproducible (Pearson coefficients from
0.974 to 0.988).  Also with two-step using a DNA-binding dye like SYBR Green I
one eliminates primer-dimers by manipulating melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>).
<p>
<b>Absolute quantitation</b> uses serially diluted standards of known concentration
to make a calibration curve.  The curve has a linear relationship between
C<sub>t</sub> and the initial amount of RNA or cDNA.  It assumes that standards
and samples all have the same amplification efficiency.  The standard serial
dilutions should encompass the levels in experimental samples.  The standard
should be a fragment of dsDNA, ssDNA, or cRNA bearing the target sequence.
The construction of a cRNA one-step PCR has been simply described by Fronhoffs
et al.  A two-step DNA standard can be made by cloning target sequence into
plasmid, by purfiying a conventional PCR product, or by direct synthesis of
target.  The standard should be pure.  DNA standards have greater quantification
range, sensitivity, reproducibility, and stability than do RNA standards.
<p>
<b>Relative quantitation</b> detects changes in sample gene expression based
on external standard or reference sample (the calibrator).  Results are expressed
as a ratio of target-to-calibrator.  Numerous mathematical models can calculate
mean normalized gene expression from relative quantitation assays.  A comparison
of different methods is shown in the table below.

<p>
The amplification efficiency of the reaction in relative quantitation is quite
important. Assumptions have been that amplificaton doubles with each cycle
during exponential phase. Many PCRs do not have ideal amplification, so
correction must be done. Current models make assumptions of reaction kinetics
and require an accurate measurement. Amplification efficiency is usually
determined from the data of the standard curve:
<p class="eqn">
exponential amplification  = 10<sup>(&minus;1/slope)</sup> <br>
efficiency = exponential amplification &minus; 1
<p>
The efficiency is rather stable in early exponential and gradually declines to
zero, as components deplete and products compete with the reaction.  It is
important to check for efficiency differences:  a 5% difference between different
amplicons will result in a 2-fold difference after 26 cycles.  The flourescence
raw data can be used to assess reaction kinetics.  Data can be log-transformed
and plotted with slope of the regression line.  The Liu and Saint method lets
the technician determine the cycles with exponential characteristics, while with
Tichopad et al method there is a statistical algorithm to find the exponential
phase.  Efficiency from raw data analysis is more accurate than data from a
standard curve.
<p>
In using the standard curve method for relative quantification, each sample
quantity is determied with the standard curve and then expressed relative to
single calibrator sample; the calibrator is set at 1-fold.  This method usually
used if efficiencies of reference and target genes are unequal.  It is simplest
method since it requires no exogenous standards or quantification of calibrators
and requires no complex mathematics.  But it does not incorporate endogenous
control (housekeeping gene) so results must be normalized.
<p>
The comparative C<sub>t</sub> (2<sup>&minus;&Delta;&Delta;C<sub>t</sub></sup>)
calculates gene expression as fold-difference between sample and calibrator.
It includes a correction for nonideal (i.e., not 1) efficiencies, but the kinetics
of all samples should nonetheless be approx. equal because different efficiencies
cause errors with this method.  Validation assays with serial dilutions should be
done with plots of &Delta;C<sub>t</sub> vs. log [sample] of each dilution.  If
|slope| &lt; 0.1, then the comparative C<sub>t</sub> method is valid.  PCR
product should be kept small (&lt; 150 bp) and reaction optimized.
<p>
The Pfaffl combines quantification and normalization into one calculation.
The relative expression software tool (REST) runs on Excel, and automates
data analysis using this model.  REST use the Pairwise Fixed Reallocation
Randomization Test to calculate the result significance and indicate if the
reference is suitable for normalization.
<p>
Q-Gene provides and Excel sheet that provides info on the experimental plan and
setup, data analysis and graphical presentation.  It calculates mean normalized
gene expression with std errors using two math models, which correct for different
amplification efficiencies.  Expression values compared between two matched groups
to determine sample relative to calibrator.  Statistical tests include
paired and two sample Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed
rank test, and Pearson's correlation.
<p>
Gentle et al was one of first models where fold changes between samples and
efficiencies of samples versus controls are calculated without using standard
curves.  Linear regression of mean of log of raw fluorescence data from
exponential phase are used for efficiency calculations.  Plotting the experimental
and control samples shows difference in slopes which is the log of fold differences,
and slopes represent log of amplification efficiencies.
<p>
Liu and Saint use a sigmoidal math model to quantitate or normalize gene expression.
Like Gentle et al, it calculates efficiencies from slope of the amplification
plot and not the standard curve.  Authors say this is more accurate than
comparative Ct with respect to varying efficiencies because user indicates the
PCR cycles are exponential.
<p>
The amplification plot method uses simple algorithm to calculate efficiency of
every individual sample in the assay.  Data are used to calculate quantiation
of expression.  Peirson et al have prepared an Excel macro called Data Analysis
for Real-Time PCR (DART-PCR) that calculates all from raw data.
<p>
With absolute quantitation, there is a greater effort because of the need to
create reliable standards for quantitation and include standards in every PCR.
With relative quantitation, C<sub>t</sub> data used for comparison are arbitrary
values and results only used internally.  For comparing samples between PCR assays,
a reference control must be used in every plate or run.  For comparing data
on different days or in different laboratories, absolute quantitation should be
done.  Both methods are comparable respect to determining fold changes.
<p>
Several <b>controls</b> are useful to include.  A <b>minus reverse transcription</b>
control accounts for DNA contamination.  When one has numerous samples,
an alternate method preventing detection of genomic DNA has the target PCR
span an exon/exon boundary.  To account for differences in reverse transcriptase
and the amount of RNA input, an endogenous control being a message always present
in a sample should be used.  Differences in PCR master mix volumes have also been
shown to be factors in efficiency differences.  A passive reference dye (e.g.,
ROX) is included to account for subtle differences in master mix volumes as well
as PCR fluorescence signals.  Problems with master mix can be accounted for using
exogenous control, which is a construct of characterized RNA or DNA spiked into
each reaction.
<p>
Normalization is used to correct for sample-to-sample variation.  Many samples
vary in tissue mass or cell number, integrity and quantity of RNA, or
experimental treatment.  With ideal conditions, mRNA levels can be standardized
to cell number, but with whole tissue samples, this type of normalization is
impossible.  Normalization is usually against a control gene that is also a
positive control for the reaction.  Best control gene is one whose expression
does not vary irrespective of tissue or cell type, developmental stage or
sample treatment.  As no gene meets such criteria for every condition, validation
of control gene expression stability is required.  With so-called housekeeping
genes, the assumptions of constant expression with different treatments or
biological processes have proven wrong.  rRNA might be a reference gene for
normalization.  28S rRNA is thought more representative of mRNA integrity since
18S rRNA can remain intact in samples with degraded mRNA.  There are certain
problems in using 28S rRNA however.  rRNA is transcribed with a different
polymerase than mRNA, and so changes in regulation may not be similar.  rRNA
transcription is not affected by treatements that affect mRNA expression.
In total RNA, the sample is composed largely of rRNA by mass:  a 10 &micro;g
total RNA sample will be 5.5 &micro;g 28S rRNA and 2 &micro;g 18S rRNA.  A rare
transcript would be difficult to measure.
<p>
Normalization can also be done against total RNA.  RiboGreen RNA is a dye that
can quantitate total RNA.  The Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer has a feature to quantitate
RNA, but spectrophotometry may lack sensitivity and accuracy.  Another means
to normalize might include the use of multiple mRNA species:  a normalization
factor can be obtained from the gemoetric mean of expression levels.  Microarrays
can be used to identify potential candidates useful for normalization
(Vandesompele et al have a list of housekeeping genes).  Expression stability
can be assessed with either <a href="http://medgen.ugent.be/~jvdesomp/genorm">geNorm</a>
or <a href="http://www.gene-quantification.info">BestKeeper</a> Excel macros.
Although labor-intensive, it is necessary where normalization is a must.

alt="different detection chemistries in real-time PCR (qPCR)">
<p>
One means of detection is <b>DNA binding dyes</b>.  These emit fluorescence when
bound to dsDNA, and intensity increase is linear with formation of PCR product.
Dye binding is not really sequence-dependent, so a dye can be used for all
amplicons.  The use of DNA binding dyes makes it impossible to do multiplexing
however.
<p>
With <b>hybridization probes</b>, there is either a three or four oligonucleotide
method.  With the 4-oligo method, there are two primers and two sequence-specific
probes.  The two probes must binding adjacently (head-to-tail).  On the
upstream probe, there is an <i>acceptor dye</i> labeled on the 3&prime; end,
and on the downstream probe, the 5&prime; end is labeled with donor dye.  The
dyes are then juxtaposed, and in a relationship suitable for FRET.  With the
3-oligo method, the upstream primer takes the place of the upstream probe, and
the downstream probe must be butted against the primer.  The downstream probe
can be designed to cover a mutation site and discriminate known alleles and
detect new ones simultaneously.  Dissociation curves identify and differentiate
the alleles.  A single melting curve can distinguish four T<sub>m</sub> values,
and six differently labeled probes can be multiplexed, thus allowing a run of
24 assays in a single tube.  Multiplex assays can increase data collection
efficiency, but they are technically challenging to optimize.
<p>
The use of <b>hydrolysis probes</b> is the basis of the TaqMan chemistry, also
called the 5&prime;-nuclease assay.  The basis of the assay is a probe with the
5&prime; end labeled with a reporter fluorophore and the 3&prime; end labeled
with a quencher.  While the two labels remain attached to the probe, quenching
is obtained.  When the probes hybridize, the DNA polymerase will pass over them
and cause hydrolysis of the two labels.  The fluorophore is no longer quenched
by proximity to the quencher, and fluorescence intensity increases.  Since
quenching is a function of the distance between reporter and quencher, the
shorter the distance, the more the quenching, and the greater the sensitivity
of the assay as background fluorescence is reduced.  But shorter probes also have
low T<sub>m</sub> values:  these short length probes can have their T<sub>m</sub> values
increased using minor groove binding agents (e.g., dhydrocyclopyrroloindole
tripeptide [DPI<sub>3</sub>]).  In general the TaqMan assays has lower costs
of production with reduced background fluorescence and larger dynamic range.
<p>
<b>Molecular beacons</b> are probes with inverted repeat sequences which will
clearly form a hairpin loop.  Reporter and quencher dyes are attached to the
5&prime;- and 3&prime;-ends, that result in contact quenching FRET while the
hairpin is formed.  During hybridization, the hairpin melts and the reporter
is separated from quencher, allowing increased fluorescence.  Generally
hairpin probes have greater specificity than linear probes because the
probe-target complex must have more thermodyamic stability to form, and this
is better for discriminating alleles.  Wavelength-shifting molecular beacons
have been developed to fluoresce in a number of colors in a single monochromatic
light source.
<p>
<b>Scorpions</b> combine the upstream PCR primer and detection probe, with the
reporter fluorophore on the 5&prime; end, then a sequence specific for the target
as well as forming a hairpin, then a quencher dye at the end of the stem-loop,
and then a DNA polymerase blocker, which is a base that does not allow extension
by the polymerase and then a sequence on the 3&prime; end which binds to the
target and allows PCR priming.  The probe sequence in the hairpin anneals to
the target, and this separates quencher from fluorophore.  As the act of probing
and sequence-specific priming is contained on a single molecular (unimolecular
event), the scorpion based probe does better than bimolecular methods when
using rapid cycling with instruments like the LightCycler.  Cycling is done
at temperatures optimal for the DNA polymerase rather than the 5&prime; nuclease,
which requires lower temperatures.  Scorpions provide the higher specificity for
discriminating alleles and are easily multiplexed.  Improvements in scorpion
chemistry include the use of duplex scorpions with separate, complimentary
molecules holding the reporter and quencher labels.  Duplex scorpions still bind
in unimolecular event but the separate molecules for reporter and quencher
provide greater intensity as these dyes can separate completely.
<p>
The <b>Sunrise&trade; primers</b> are products of Oncor and similar to scorpions
in combining priming and detection in the same molecule.  The 5&prime; end
forms the hairpin stem-loop, and the 3&prime; end does the priming, and
probe-target melts the hairpin and separates the reporter from quencher.
<p>
The <b>LUX&trade; fluorogenic primers</b> are the <u>L</u>ight <u>U</u>pon
e<u>X</u>tension (Invitrogen) system with self-quenched, single fluorophore
labeled primer nearly identical to Sunrise primers.  Rather than using a
quencher adduct, it is the secondary structure on the 3&prime; end reducing
the fluorescence.  It is thus less costly than dual-labeled probes or primers.
It only requires two oligos for specificity, but unlike a SYBR Green I system
which can use a melting analysis to detect erroneous amplification, there is
no such system for LUX.  Agarose gels must be run to detect a single amplicon.
A gel analysis should also be run with Sunrise and scorpions as well.
<p>
PCR can have problems in variations, particularly with mispriming.  With a
1- or 2-step process.

Expression and purification of the complete PreS region of hepatitis B Virus
<p class="Para1">
The envelope of the HBV virion is made of small, middle, and large surface
proteins derived from alternate translations of a single S gene, where all
translations have same reading frame and stop codon, but different start codon.
The large form, preS1S2-S, can have the preS region finally oriented inside
or outside the viral envelope.  The encapsidation of nucleocapsides and
budding of virus requires the L proteins having PreS on the cytoplasmic membrane
with cytoplasmic orientation.  Residues in PreS1 and PreS2 are believed 
involved in with nucleocapsid just prior to budding.  During infection itself
PreS region may be involved in binding with the unknown cell receptor:
residues 21-47 represent an epitope in PreS1 where that might occur. Efforts
to clone only PreS1 have been to no avail, since it is either insoluble or
degrades quickly.  A His-tagged PreS clone was also insoluble, while nondenaturing
conditions cause quick proteolysis, and structural analysis is a problem for
cloned proteins denatured and renatured.
<p>
Several PreS constructs were made using different vectors, although all inserts 
were the residue 1-174 region that is PreS.  pET28&alpha;(+) was used because of 
its 6xHis tag, and the insert oriented to make either an N- or C-terminal tag.
Other tags include N-terminal DHFR from pQE-40, N-terminal MBP from 
pMAIC2<sub>&chi;</sub>, N-terminal GST from pGEX2T, N-terminal Thioredoxin
from pThioHisA, and C-terminal intein-CBD from pTXB1. (An intein is a segment of
a protein able to excise itself in a splicing reaction, much like an intron
is spliced in RNA.)  The <i>E coli</i> host strains were Top10 (F<sup>&minus;</sup>)
for DHFR-PreS and thio-PreS, and BL21(DE3) used for the other fusions.  All 
fusions are under lacI repressor, so IPTG was necessary for induction:
0.1 mM for DHFR-PreS, 1 mM for thio-PreS, and 0.3 mM for the rest.  Lysis
by sonication was done in a buffer of PBS with 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 M PMSF.
<p>
All fusions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE.  Although there was a high expression for
both His-PreS and PreS-His fusions, they were insoluble.  GST-PreS was found to 
be soluble, but they were severely degraded.  A worse degradation was seen with
DHFR-PreS.  In another report, it was indicated that MBP-PreS would be stable,
but moderate proteolysis was observed.  Thio-PreS appeared to be quite stable
(0.2-0.5 mg/ml culture).  PreS-CBD was both soluble and did not show degradation.
<p>
Chitin resin (NEB) was used to purify the PreS-CBD protein.  While coupled to
the resin, treatment with 50 mM DTT in PBS at 4&deg; causes self-cleavage
because of the intein presence.  Nonetheless with this construct, cleavage was
not successful because of the free PreS region.
<p>
The Thio-PreS function includes a His-patch motif that also allows purification
on nickel affinity column.  This patch differs from other linear His tags
in its conformation.  Nonetheless this Thio-PreS fusion cleans up on nickel
column, with optimized eolution of 0.25 M imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, and 20 mM 
pH 6.0 phosphate.  Attempts to use affinity column for thioredoxin (Thio-Bond,
Invitrogen) were not useful.  Some contaminants were still evident even with
metal affinity: a rapid freeze-slow thaw allowed removal of these contaminants
by keeping the contaminants in the precipitate and the Thio-PreS soluble.
<p>
The mAb 125E11 was used in a western blot of MBP-PreS, PreS-CBD, and
thio-PreS, and bands were found at all the expected MW values.  Degradative
bands could also be found, espeically with MBP-PreS, less so with thio-PreS
and PreS-CBD.  This mAb also could capture viral particles in an assay developed
for it.  If thio-PreS were added to the sera, they competeted with the viral
capture.

Internally Controlled, Large-Volume LightCycler Assay for Detection of
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in Clinical Samples with the COBAS AMPLICOR Assay
<p class="Para1">
Culture remains the <q>gold standard</q> in indentifying tubeculosis bacterium,
although it is not rapid.  More rapid are the nucleic acid amplification
techniques.  The only such FDA-approved test is the Amplified Mycobacterium
tuberculsosi Direct Test (AMTD) (Gen-Probe) and the COBAS AMPLICOR <i>M.
tuberculosis</i> assay  The latter performs well with smear-positive
respiratory samples.  Most laboratories can only run a single set per day
and just-in-time testing of one sample is not feasible.  Real-time PCR
can make use of TaqMan probes (which release fluorophore apart from a quencher)
or FRET probes, which detect by two oligos hybridizing closely to create
a fluorescent relay.  The LightCycler is particularly useful in optimizing
for speed to shorten a run time.  Sensitivity remains a problem since reaction
volume is limited and thus limits sample.  In this new configuration,
100 &micro;l capillaries are used and up to 25 &micro;l of sample DNA possible.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>.  146 clinical specimens ordered for MTBC testing were used:
they were sputum, bronchial or tracheal aspirates, bronchial or tracheal
secretions, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and nonrespiratory (biopsy, blood,
gastric fluid, stool, urine, CSF, wound exudate).  72 showed positive in
AMPLICOR and were AFB positive smears too.  57 of the 72 were culture-positive.
The 15 culture-negative had been receiving antimycobacterial treatment.
Genomic DNA was obtained from numerous mycobacterial and nonmycobacterial
species, whose presencen had been tested by PCR with KY18 and KY75 primers
for 16/18S rRNAfs (pan-mycobacteria primers).  Specimen DNA is obtined from
NAc-Cys/NaOH decontaminated in which sample material up to 10 ml is used
directly while larger volume specimens are concentrated (from 30 ml to 5 ml);
Specimens are prepared in phosphate+0.5% Tween80 for PCR.  Cultured cells
are lysed by alkaline procedure with freeze-thaw cycles and presence of
proteinase K, and then cleanup up on silica columns (QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit).
The A<sub>260</sub> was read and 10 fg mycobacterial DNA is about 3 genome
equivalents.  An internal control oligo (ICO) containing the primer- and
probe-binding region but with three base mismatches in the FAM-labeled sensor
probe so as to have a lower <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>: the sequence is

GCATGT<u>T</u>TTGTGGTGTAAAGCGCTTTAGCGGTGTGGGATGAGCGTGACGGCCTACCAAG-3&prime;.
<p>
<b>Results</b>. H37Rv Mt DNA was diluted in series to determine sensitivity on
LightCycler in 20 and 100 &micro;l capillaries, and five replicates were done
in this test. At 2.5 genome equivalents/&micro;l, 2/5 of the tests were
positive with 100 &micro;l capillary and none were positive with 20 &micro;l
capillary. COBAS AMPLICOR could detect 0.5 GE/&micro;l, or 25 genomes per assay.
 The same dilution series was done, but with a diluent that contained 1.5
ng/&micro;l human DNA to check for interference. Results were the same using
diluent with or w/o the human DNA, showing it had no interference. In a test of
specificity, a panel of other MTBC members and non tubercle mycobacteria and
other bacteria and fungi extracts were present. All results were negative. A
signal was only seen with <i>M tuberculosis</i> and the melting profile showed
a <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 65&deg;. Agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the
amplifications that had signals. With the ICO, the optimal amount is determined
by a titration to get the amount as minimal as possible and not compete with
low amounts of target DNA (which reduces sensitivity): this was found to be 125
ICO molecules per 100 &micro;l assay. Results of target analyte were same
whether ICO was present or absent. Testing the presence of an inhibitor, in
this case NAc-Cys/NaOH used in decontamination, a 1:5 and 1:10 NAc-Cys/NaOH
dilution presence completely abolished any signal.  We know they are false
negatives however since ICO signal is not seen, shown in melting point analysis;
negative control without inhibitor showed the ICO signal with peak at 48&deg;.
As inhibitor became more dilute, the <i>M tuberculosis</i> signal was better.
With a high amount of <i>M tuberculosis</i> competing with ICO, no ICO peak
is seen.
<p>
In a comparison with COBAS AMPLICOR, 67 respiratory and 5 nonrespiratory samples
were positive and also positive with the LightCycler assay.  73 negative
samples, 41 respiratory and 32 nonrespiratory, these were negative also in the
LightCycler assay.  A bronchoalveolar lavage sample with positive smear and
cultured <i>M malmoense</i> was negative in AMPLICOR and weakly positive in
LightCycler.  One smear- and culture-positive stool sample had no result in
AMPLICOR (inhibition) but was clearly positive with LightCycler.
<p>
The COBAS AMPLICOR and the assay developed here target the hypervariable region
of 16S rRNA.  The former produces a 584 bp amplicon, while the latter has a
shorter product at 206 bp because the reverse primer is not downstream as
much and the region chosen for reverse primer is relatively conserved.  This
allows a more rapid cycle in optimization.  AMPLICOR will produce results for
all the MTBC and even mycobacteria outside the MTBC.  In some cases the LightCycler
assay will amplify non-mycobacterial species, but postamplification melting
shows a very different <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> from the mycobacteria, and especially
<i>M tuberculosis</i>.  AMPLICOR includes presence of a linearized recombinant
plasmid containing target sequences, modified at the binding site of the
detection probe.  If ICO is amplified, it is detected with ICO-specific probe in
separate post-PCR hybridization.  Other strategies have used an IC with different
fluorophore which can be read with different filter set.  In this strategy,
the ICO spans the primer sites and the probe-binding has mismatches that alter
the <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> of the ICO, such that it has a lower <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.
A more perfectly matched oligo will being at the annealing temperature compared
to the mismatching, but if the mismatching is the only one present, it too
will bind to a small degree.
<p>
Variation in the several assays already pointed to in the literature might arise
from pre-analytical factors such as DNA purification and extraction differences.
This paper shows agreement between the FDA-approved AMPLICOR and this real-time
PCR (100% sensitivity, 98.6% specificity).  This assays uses a small volume
of sample DNA (50 vs. 25 &micro;l).

Comparison of Six Methods of Extracting <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> DNA
from Processed Sputum for Testing by Quantitative Real-Time PCR
<p class="Para1">
Six methods of extracting DNA from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> are
compared. Two qPCR assays were then done to evaluate. Sputum specimens are
decontaminated in NAc-Cys/2% NaOH that are culture negative and pooled for use
as a standard respiratory specimen. ATCC 27294 M tuberculosis is made up in
sterile saline to a density of 1.0 McFarland standard, then diluted 1:10 and
used to spike sputum pool (stored in 200 &micro;l). There were 8 replicates for
all extractions. Respiratory specimens were spiked and frozen then thawed and
spun 6000 <i>g</i> 1 min and pellet processed for each of the six methods.
<p>
1. <b>Boiling in Tris-EDTA</b>.  200 &micro;l 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA added
and vortexted then put in boiling water 15 min.  Centrifuged max speed microfuge
for 5 min.  100 &micro;l supernatant stored &minus;20&deg; until PCR.
<p>
2. <b>ABi PrepMan ultra</b>.  200 &micro;l PrepMan Ultra reagent is added to pellet,
and processed as for TE buffer.
<p>
3. <b>IDI lysis from Infectio Diagnostics Inc.</b>.  Pellets are treated with
TE buffer as above in preparation for boiling, but the suspension is placed in tube with
glass bead matrix and tubes vortexed vigorously for 5 min at highest setting
on Vortex Genie 2 in microfoam insert and then put in boiling water bath.
<p>
4. <b>QIAGEN QIAmp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN)</b>  Sample are processed with the tissue
protocol of the kit with the modification of using a 30 mg/ml lysozyme
digestion step in the tissue lysis buffer, and then boiling for 15 min.  The
proteinase K step was done at 56&deg; for 1 h.  Then DNA was processed through
a spin column.
<p>
5. <b>SDS-Triton X-100</b>.  Pellets are processed as for TE buffer boiling except
that 200 &micro;l of 2% SDS-10% Triton X-100 is used instead of TE buffer.
<p>
6. <b>SDS-Triton X-100 + sonication</b>.  The 200 &micro;l SDS/Triton X-100 is used
and then the mixture vortexed briefly.  Then the suspension is sonicated for
15 min, then treated as for TE buffer.
<p>
The target DNA is an 83 bp segment in <i>IS</i>6110 in which the sense primer
is nt 801-818 5&prime;-CTAACCGGCTGTGGGTA-3&prime;; and antisense is nt 866-884

Bases marked '*' are proprietary <q>superbases</q> to increase hybridization
stability.  An internal control plasmid of nonhuman genomic DNA was used
for controlling inhibition:  primers and probe are described by Stevenson et
al, Abstr 18th Ann Clin Virol Symp, abstr M35, 2002.  The Cepheid Smart Cycler
II system and the Corbett Researh Rotor-Gene 3000 real-time DNA analysis systems
were used.  For both systems, the final volume is 25 &micro;l with 12.5 &micro;l
OmniMix HS (3 U TaKaRa hot start Taq polymerase, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,
25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 &micro;M MTBC primer, 0.2 &micro;M probe, 0.25 &micro;M
each IC primer, 0.2 &micro;M IC probe, 20 pg IC DNA, and 2 &micro;l DNA template;
for the Rotor-Gene mixture the MTBC probe was 0.3 &micro;M.  Water was used for
negative control.  PCR is 95&deg;/2 min, then 50 cycles fo 95&deg;/5 s,
58&deg;/20 s, 76&deg;/20 s.
<p>
The limit of detection for both instruments was found to be 0.5 fg <i>M tuberculosis</i>
DNA with internal control.  PCR amplification was inhibited with the SDS/Triton X-100
method with or without sonication:  the IC did not amplify.  It has been shown
that SDS above 0.01% can inhibit PCR, clearly inhibiting the Taq polymerase.
<p>
The <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> values were 25.3 for IDI, 25.9 for QIAGEN, 25.8 for
PrepMan, and 27.9 for TE on the SmartCycler.  For the Rotor-Gene, values
were 25.1 for IDI, 26.9 for QIAGEN, 26.5 for PrepMan, and 27.7 for TE.  Difference
between TE and the other three methods were significant in pairwise comparison
but only for the SmartCycler.  There was no difference between any method on the
Rotor-Genie.  The computed extracted amount based on the <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>
value was 42.8 pg for IDI, 28.2 pg for QIAGEN, 30.4 pg for PrepMan, and 7.4 g
for TE for the Smart Cycler, and 51.7, 14.9, 20.1, and 8.6 pg, respectively
for the Rotor-Gene.
<p>
Generally column purification is the best as it produces material at least
free of inhibitor.  It is important that the extraction not compromise
sensitivity as well as the PCR.  QIAGEN is a gold standard.  It took less than
1 h just by boiling in TE, but also for PrepMan and material.  Only 2 or 3
new containers were required for transferring separated material, while the
QIAGEN system required 2.5-3 h with extensive hands-on processing.  PCR with
the SmartCycler was complete in 55 min and the Rotor-Gene runs were 95 min long.
SmartCycler can run 16 samples in a block with six blocks.   The Rotor-Gene
can run 72 samples in a 25 &micro;l volume.  Costs per extraction were $3.00
for IDI, $2.30 for QIAGEN, $1.05 for PrepMan and $0.03 for TE buffer.

Low-cost monitoring of HIV infected individuals on highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART) in developing countries
<p class="Para1">
Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) must be monitored and using purely clinical
evaluations lacks sensitivity in determining disease stage and progression. 
Laboratory analysis includes total lymphocyte count (TLC), CD4<sup>+</sup> T 
lymphocyte counts, HIV plasma viral load (PVL), and &beta;<sub>2</sub> 
microglobulin as surrogate markers.  PCR-based HIV genotyping and phenotyping. 
Flow cytometry of T cell subsets is a reference standard.  RT-PCR, bDNA, and 
NASBA are used for PVL testing. But all these are difficult in resource-limited 
nations.
<p>
Assays considered standard and low cost for counting CD4 T lymphocytes include:
<ul>
<li>Becton-Dickinson FACSCount (2-color flow cytometry) which can report CD4, CD8
and CD3 counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio; is automated requiring little training,
but it has a high cost per test ($28 in 2005), requires specific reagents,
reverse pipetting skill, long processing time
<li>Beckman-Coulter Cytosphere manual CD4 kit:  latex bead kit for light
microscope, which gives absolute CD4 counts, using low cost microscope, pipette,
hemocytometer, but does not give percent CD4 value (like FACSCount), is low
throughput, has high cost per test (half of FACSCount), and is labor intensive
with results in 6 h.
<li>Dynal Biotech Dynabeads CD4/CD8 kit:  cell isoltion using magnetic beads
with fluorescent or light microscopy needed; a magnet and mixer must be obtained
from the manufacturer, and results are turned over in 24 h, it costs the same
as Cytosphere kit per test, and also labor intensive
<li>Bio-Rad Capcellia:  ELISA with CD2 magnetic bead isolation, then colorimetric
detection of CD4/CD8.  Processes 40 test per plate, and 15 samples per hour,
is labor-intensive, and require MTP reader, multichannel pipettor, and reporting
in 6 h.
<li>Guava Technologies Easy CD4/CD8:  microcapillary flow cytometry, absolute
CD4/CD3 and/or CD4/CD8;  small volume blood, minimum waste disposal, minimal
training, and 48 h old samples are advantages;  a daily calibration of beads,
computer literacy, need to lyse red cells, and specific antibodies are needed;
throughput = 20 samples/day.
<li>Partec ByFlow: dedicated flow cytometer.  No need to lyse cells; no beads
and in 15 min CD4 count is ready; disadvantages include questionable stability
of volumetric counting, no validation of performance independently, and
training on software.
</ul>
<p>
For the direct detection and quantitation of HIV, these tests are available:
<ul>
<li>Roche Amplicor (v. 1.5):  a RT-PCR assay for HIV:  standard assay has 50 
copies/ml cutoff, while ultrasensitive is 400 copies/ml; can be run manually or 
automated on COBAS.  High throughput assays also for HBV, HCV, CMV by clades.
About $90/test.
<li>Perkin-Elmer Ultrasensitive HIV p24 Ag:  around 30,000 copies/ml is clinical
cut-off.  ELISA reader and washer, with 1 day reporting, easy to perform and
high throughput
<li>Cavidi ExaVir:  Kinetic HIV reverse transcriptase activity, with 5000
copies/ml cutoff; incubator or water bath @ 32&deg;, 3 day turnaround time;
no positive or negative controls
</ul>
<p>
In general a TLC can be performed at least when specific CD4 counting is not
available.  It can indicate whether opportunistic infections might occur.
Where TLC &lt; 1400 per &micro;l, it is a good predictor of CD4<sup>+</sup>
T counts of &lt; 200 cell/&micro;l.  TLC had a positive association with 
CD4<sup>+</sup> T counts and negative one with PVL.  One study reports a 
correlation of <i>r</i> = 0.70 in study of about 2800 patients between 
CD4 and TLC counts; anothe in UK reported <i>r</i> = 0.64.
<p>
[Specifics and characteristics of assays measuring TLC, CD4 and other cell types,
and HIV are mentioned in this review.]
<p>
<b>HIV p24 Ultrasensitive Assay</b>.  Sensitivity improved 3 orders using
signal amplification boosting (ELAST).  Plasma is heat-denatured to release
p24 Ag.  Results comparable to RT-PCR.  Correlation to plasma RNA viral load
assay is <i>r</i> = 0.75.

Epidemilogical Surveillance for Vaccine Preventable Diseases project by 
Ministry of Health, from serum collected 2000-2001.  Provinces were Antalya,
Samsun, Diyarbakir.  Males and females were numerically identical and from

Abbott Murex HBsAg v 3, using Murex Biotech UK manufacture.  55 were HBaAg
and 37 of these were subtyped.  Prevalence is 5.2% (32 of 618) in Diyarbakir,
and 1.8% in other two provinces (12/649 Antalya; 11/612 Samsun).  Other samples
were from Ankara facility that investigates AIDS and hepatitis.
<p>
For subtyping the HBsAg Subtype EIA from Special Immune Research Japan was
used.  Of the 129 samples, 113 (87.6%) were <i>ayw</i>.  Only two had 
<i>adw</i>.  Other results as to <i>d/y</i> or <i>r/w</i>  were less clear,

All genomes had 3182 bp except for one with 183 bp deletion in preS1 coding 
sequence (nt 2987-3169).  A 33 nt deletion in preS1 was found in all 11 complete 
sequences, which is in the spacer region of the polymerase gene, and this is 
characteristic of genotype D.  Two patients HBeAg(-)/antiHBe(+) had nt_pcG83A 
[G1896A] stop codon mutation in pre-core: this produces nonfunctional premature 
protein.  The pc71 position (T1858) produces an A base at nt_pcG83 and nt_pcG86 
for creation of more stable stem loop structure.  Core promoter mutations ad 
nt_RNApc A(-26)T (T1762A) and nt_RNApc G(-24)T (G1764A) were found in one 
HBeAg(+) and two HBeAg(-)/antiHBe(+) cases, reducing transcription rte of 
pre-core/core mRNA.  Another HBeAg(+) had nt_RNApc A(-26)T.  In three isolates
there was stop codon (at codon 69) in S gene (patients 6-8); patient 7 also had
the preS1 183 bp deletion.  In patient 6, ten clones were isolated, and half of
them had a stop at codon 69, and the other half were wild type.  For the six clones
sequenced from patient 7, half had teh 183 bp deletion and the stop at codon 69,
two other clones only had the stop at codon 69 and no deletion, and one clone
was wild type.  The key amino acids for subtyping Arg-122, Thr-125, Pro-127,
and Lys-160 showed ten <i>ayw2</i> and one <i>ayw3</i> strain.

Direct detection in clinical samples of multiple gene mutations causing
resistance of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> to isoniazid and rifampicin
using fluorogenic probes
<p class="Para1">
Drug-resistant TB among news cases can be higher than 1 in 10 case in more than
30 countries, and multidrug resistant TB in 14 countries could be 3% of new 
cases. Susceptibility cultures are used to determine resistance but are not 
rapid growing. For isoniazid resistance the mutations are in <i>katG</i> 
converting enzyme and in the regulator region of <i>inhA</i>. In 95% of 
rifampicin resistance case mutations in <i>rpoB</i> are responsible. This 
particular study looks at method to detect smear-positive and negative samples 
for typical mutations in INH and RIF resistance using the Taqman system. This 
was a multicenter study using sputum samples found to be culture-positive and 
collected over 2 year period. 98 samples from 55 patients with INH or 
RIF-resistant bacilli and 126 sample with susceptible bacilli are controls. 1 
ml decontamined samples are frozen &minus;80&deg; until used. Susceptibility 
was accoridng to a Bactec radiometric method. Genes IS6110, katG, inhA, and 
rpoB were selected for study. Codon 315 of katG, the C209T in the ribosome 
binding sit of inhA, and five codones in rpoB: 507, 513, 516, 526, and 531. ABi 
Primer Express program was used to design primers and probes. A FAM-labeled 
oligo was used for wildtype and a VIC-labeled probe used for mutated (resistant)
 isolate. 0.5 McFarland suspension of cultured strains was prepared in 400 
&micro;l TE with 100 &micro;l Sigma crystal beads, vortexed 2 min, heated 
95&deg; for 45 min, spun in microfuge 10 min and supernatant frozen at &minus;
20&deg;.  Clinical specimens were instead microfuged 10 min and pellet resuspeneded
in 200 &micro;l TE and heated 45 min 95&deg;.  This was then purified on
Roche Diagnostics High Pure DNA Extraction kit.  For spiked samples DNA extracted
in same way as clinical samples.  ABI Prism 7700.  Each sample had 8 reactions:
IS6110, katG 315 codon, the RBS site of inhA, and five codons of rpoB.  A mutant
probe for rpoB codon 507 could not be constructed because of GC composition, but
others had wildtype and mutant probe pairs.  Details are PCR are not typed here.
The useful data are the <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> value and cumulative fluoresence
signal at end of 40 cycles.  The IS6110 was used to establish positivity of
<i>M tuberculosis</i> itself, and follow up was done to check resistance.
For resistance determination, the cumulative fluorescence signal of both
probes was added and signal percentage of each probe with the other as well at
the <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> of the probes.  A &gt;70% signal in one probe and an
earlier <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> compared with other probes is a specific hybriziation.

Rapid Determination of Rifampin Resistance in Clinical Isolates of <i>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by Real-Time PCR
<p class="Para1">
Rifampin works by binding to &beta;-subunit of RNA polymerase and inhibiting
transcription. 96% of resistance to rifampin has been shown due to mutations in
the 81 bp region where resistance is determined, between codons 507 and 533.
41% of resistance was in codon 531, 32-36% in codon 526, and 7-9% in codon 516.
This study looks at real time PCR to see if resistance to rifampin can be
checked in these bacteria. This study looks at 96 resistant and 23 susceptible
isolates as well as the ATCC 25177 H37Ra strain of <i>M tuberculosis</i>. For
cultures grown on Lowenstein-Jensen medium colony loopfuls are suspended in TE,
washed three times, boiled 20 min, and supernatant used for PCR. Primers TbRif1
(5&prime;-CAGACGTTGATCAACATCCG-3&prime;) and TbRif2 (5&prime;-TAC
GGCGTTTCGATGAAC-3&prime;) should cover positions 2307 to 2611 for a 305 bp
amplicon and span the 81 bp region of the <i>rpoB</i> gene (GenBank L27989).
The anchor probe RpoAP1 is 5&prime;-CACGCTCACGTGACAGACCGCCGGGC-FAM-3&prime; and
the detection probe RpoSP1 5&prime;-LCRed640-CCAGCGCCGACAGTC<u>T</u>
GCGCTTGTGGGTC-(P)-3&prime; are from positions 2441 and 2411 resp covering
codons 531 and 526, respectively. The underlined T base is a G&rarr;T
substitution to get the sensor probe to have a lower <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.
Probe pair RpoAP2 5&prime;-TCGCCGCGATCAAGGAGTTCTTCGGCACCA-FAM-3&prime; and
RpoSP2 5&prime;-LCRed705-CAGCTGAGCCAATTCATGGACCAGAAC-(P)-3&prime; cover codons
516 and 513 (nt 2335 and 2367, respectively).  PCR is 20 &micro;l with 2 &micro;l
mix giving a final 2.63 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.  Primers are at 500 nM, while the
probes are 100 nM for RpoAP1, 400 nM for RpoSP1, and 200 nM for RpoAP2 and
RpoSP2.
<p>
Drug susceptibility testing was done on clinical specimens studied here.
50 of 96 (52%) were resistant to rifampin and three others to rifamycin
derivatives.  89 of th 69 rifampin-resistatn isolates were detected by real-time
PCR.   23 of 23 susceptible were correctly identified by PCR, giving overall
sensitivity of 92.7% and specificity of 100%.  Probe pair RpoSP1 and RpoAP1
detected 78 of 96 (81%) of rifampin-resistant isolated.  H37Ra and susceptible
isolates had a <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 77.5&deg; while 58 resistant isolates
had an average <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 71.5&deg;.  In another group of isolates,
a <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 72.8&deg; was found.  The codon 531 Ser&rarr;Leu accounts
for the 6&deg; drop while a codon 526 His&rarr;Glu accounts for the 4.75&deg;
drop mutation.  11 resistant mutants were identified using RpoSP2 and RpoA2,
and susceptible isolats and H37Ra had a <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 66.3&deg;.
Resistant isolates had lower <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> varying in <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>
drops from 3.2 to 5.8&deg;.  The 3.2&deg; drop isolates were 513 (Gly&rarr;Leu)
mutants and the 3.8&deg; mutants were 516 (Asp&rarr;Val) isolates and
the 5.8&deg; isolates were also 516 mutants (Asp&rarr;Tyr).  Postamplification
melting curves are without multiple or broad peaks, suggesting a homogeneous
amplification.  Other rifampin resistant isolated were not detected with either
of the probe pairs used, and 4 of 7 of these did not have mutations in the
sequenced regions, while two had mutations, one in codon 511 and another in
codon 522.  Another had mutations in both 510 and 536.

Assembly PCR oligo maker: a tool for designing oligodeoxynucleotides for 
constructing long DNA molecules for RNA production
<p class="Para1">
Assembly PCR OligoMaker uses a nearest neighbor method for computing melting 
temperatures of annealed segment, using unified DNA-DNA hybridization 
thermodynamic parameter of Allaw and SantaLucia with monovalent cation 
correction to entropy term as given by SantaLucia.  Default [Na<sup>+</sup>] is 
50 mM and [DNA] = 0.5 &micro;M.  As alternative the method of Wallace 
[<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 2(A + T) + 4(G + C)] can be used.  In the first step of 
assembly PCR, oligos are at 7 &micro;M in water, and in the second PCR step, 
they are diluted to 4 &micro;M.  In first PCR, 4 &micro;l of all oligos, 4 
&micro;l 5 mM dNTPs, 10 &micro;l of 10&times; NEB ThermoPol buffer, 1.5 &micro;l 
Vent DNA polymerase (2000 U/ml), and 68.5 &micro;l water are combined.  A 
precycle stept at 94&deg; for 7 min is done. Then 8 cycles of amplification: 1.5 
min at 94&deg;, 2 min at 54&deg;, 3 min at 72&deg;.  In the last cycle, the 
elongation 72&deg; step was 5 min.  For the second PCR, 1 &micro;l of the first 
PCR reaction is mixed with 4 &micro;l of the two flanking primers, 4 &micro;l of 
5 mM dNTPs, 10 &micro;l of 10&times; NEB ThermoPol buffer, 1.5 &micro;l of the 
Vent DNA polymerase, and 75.5 &micro;l ddH<sub>2</sub>O.  A 5 min 94&deg; step, 
the 25 cycles of 30 s at 94&deg;, 2 min at 54&deg;, and 1.5 min at 72&deg;; then 
an elongation for 5 min at 72&deg;.  Analyses are on agarose gel 
electrophoresis. The amplicon and pUC18 are digested with <i>Hin</i>dII and 
<i>Eco</i>RI, which are then mixed and ligated in T4 DNA ligase then transformed 
into DH5&alpha; cells
<p>
With the Assembly PCR OligoMaker, input can be DNA or RNA sequence, specified
in either 5&prime;&rarr;3&prime; or 3&prime;&rarr;5&prime;.  A query is then 
made whether to include the Top17 sequence for T7 RNA polymerase priming.
To achieve highest RNA production, the sequence after T7 promoter should have
two or three G bases.  The target DNA is divided into even number of segments
with user-defined maximum length, which are 40, 50, 60 or 70 nt.  In developing
the overlapping regions between alternating strands, the overlappping sequences
are arranged to match a target <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.  The user can set the
target <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> between 50 and 60&deg;, with default of 55&deg;.
In all cases the overlap annealing regions are tested for annealing possibilities
inter- and intramolecularly.  Where other annealing possiblities exist, if 
the <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> is greater than the user-defined setting, a warning
is given to the user and the region flagged in the results window.  The user
has several options to work around the problem:  making changes to the sequence,
or adjusting the maximum length to shorter or longer settings.
<p>
In testing the program, a target DNA with repeat region was used and the algorithm
was able to detect and compensate for it.  The proposed oligos were synthesized
to create the DNA molecule that was to be produced as an RNA.  The target
RNA is a 191 nt molecule consists of 5&prime; and 3&prime; <i>cis</i>
hammerhead ribozymes and core 20 nt region forming hairpin, which is to be studied
using NMR.  Using default 70 nt max oligo length, the 191 nt was divided into
four oligos for first PCR, with primers for the 2nd PCR too.
<p>
Agarose gels show the 1st PCR product to be a diffuse band or smear.  It is
after the 2nd PCR the full length product appears.  This amplicon was cloned
into pUC18 and sequenced, which was found correct.
<p>
The advantage of Assembly PCR OligoMaker over <a 
href="http://helixweb.nih.gov/dnaworks/">DNA Works</a>, Gene2Oligo, and 
DNA Builder (no web interface found in 2011) is that user can determine
oligo maximum length, which provides option also of having fewer oligos,
which provides fewer opportunities for error.  The Assembly PCR OligoMaker
created four oligos of 56, 64, 64 and 59 nt for the 191 nt target, for 
a total of 243 nt to be synthesized; the maximum 70 nt default had been chosen.
In DNA Bulder, 6 oligos were determined for 306 nt.  DNA Works output 10 oligos
for total synthesis of 371 nt, and Gene2Oligo selected 13 oligos for total of
440 nt.

Triple-Bond Reactivity of Diphosphorus Molecules
<p class="Para1">
Triply bonded dinitrogen is a very stable form of nitrogen among
Group XV elements, but white phosphorus, tetrahedral P<sub>4</sub>,
is the stable form of this element.  When heated to 1100 K (827&deg; C),
it becomes two triply-bonded P<sub>2</sub> molecules in equilibrium.
Multiply bonded nitrogen shows stable &pi;-bond formation, but the
&pi; electrons are quite reactive for phosphorus.  Dissociation of
the nitrogen &pi; bond is twice as high (226 kcal/mol vs. 117 kcal/mol).
It is of interest to astrophysicists (exotic gas-phase species),
and found in plasmas generated in high-temp deposition of III/IV
semiconductor materials.
<p>
Organic azides (N=N=N-R) will react with transfer of a nitrene
(N-R) to Group V metals involving a stable intermediate complex of
intact RN<sub>3</sub>, and the product eventually is a Group 5 metal
imido and N<sub>2</sub> gas.  P=P=N-R is a diphosphorus analog
of the azide and the question is whether its product would be a

Endothelial bound lipoprotein lipase (LpL) depletion in hypoalbuminemia results
from decreased endothelial binding, not decreased secretion
<p class="Para1">
[only interested in methods here...not the results].
<p>
<b>LpL Activity Assay</b>.
LpL activity assays done according to Krauss et al.  10 &micro;Ci of
[<sup>3</sup>H]triolein, 1.5 mg phosphatidylcholine, 37.5 mg triolein
are combined in chloroform in a 16 &times; 50 mm tube and dried under
nitrogen.  Then 2.8 ml of 0.2 M TrisHCl pH 8.6, 0.15 M NaCl, 1.2 ml
10% fatty-acid free BSA, 250 &micro;l 1% Triton X-100, and 250 &micro;l
of heat-inactivated (human) plasma from fasting subject is added.
Sonication was done for 5 min in Branson Sonifier 250 with 5 and 50% duty.
This should produce an emulsion of 4.5 ml, for about 40-45 assays.
100 &micro;l of emulsion is added to 0.4 ml sample (if necessary, diluted
with Tris-saline).  Sample is incubated 30 min at 37&deg;, then stopped
with 1.62 ml chloroform:MeOH:heptane 1.25:1.41:1.00.  After vortexing,
0.50 ml of 0.4 M boric acid/0.4 M potassium carbonate pH 10.0 is added.
Samples were vortexed again for 15 s and then centrifuged 10 min at 1000
<i>g</i>.  1 ml of the top phase is counted in LSC.  0.1 ml emulsion is
counted as standard for oleic acid release and a standard curve using
purified LpL.  The curve is linear with respect to LpL mass.  1.0 M NaCl
is used to inhibit LpL activity in order to determine the fraction of lipase
activity (hepatic) which is not LpL.
<p>
<b>Bovine LpL Purification</b>.
LpL for use in the standard curve was purified from raw skim milk.
The milk is incubated in 0.4 M NaCl at 4&deg; overnight with heparin-Sepharose.
This is then packed into an XK-26 column and rinsed 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4,
20% glycerol, 0.5 M NaCl, and then rinsed with buffer + 0.75 M NaCl until
OD280 levels off.  The LpL is eluted with 1.5 M NaCl:  fractions with
OD &gt; 0.2 AU are analyzed on SDS-PAGE, and fractions with single 55 kDa
band are pooled.
<p>
<b>Q-RT-PCR</b>.  RNA was isolated from rat hearts:  heart is quick-frozen
in liq nitrogen and store at &minus;70&deg;.  Extraction of thawed tissue
is with Trizol (Invitrogen) using manufacturer's instructions, after dissolving
in DEPC-treated water.  1 &micro;g RNA is incubated 30 min with 1 U DNase I,
then 200 U M-MLV for first strand synthesis (Invitrogen) with 0.5 &micro;g
oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen) in 1 mM dNTPs (Promega), 3 mM magnesium chloride,
and 7 U RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen).  The Q-PCR is done on a GeneAmp 5700
(PE-ABi) with SYBR Green I for monitoring double-stranded products:  the
50 &micro;l reaction has 10 pmol primer, 200 &micro;M dNTPs, 1.25 U HotStart
Taq (Qiagen), 5 &micro;l of 1:1000 SYBR Green I in DMSO, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>,
and buffer coming with polymerase.  The sequence is
5'-GCAGGAAGTCTGACCAACAAG-3'(forward) and 5'-CTTCACCAGCTGGTCCACAT-3' (revrse).
Relative expression of treated vs. controls is found by comparing cycle number
at which 294 bp product reaches a threshold compared to a 267 bp GADPH PCR
product:  this is calculated as ln (relative expression level) =

Correction of Feline Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency with Adeno-Associated Virus
Serotype 1-Mediated Gene Transfer of the Lipoprotein Lipase S447X Beneficial
Mutation
<p class="Para1">
LpL binds to heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans on the lumenal side of
capillaries, and is abundant in heart and skeletal muscle and adipose tissue,
catalyzing the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis of triglycerides in chylomicrons
and VLDLs, which controls FFA uptake into the tissues.  Its activity is also
important for delivery of apolipoproteins and phospholipids to HDL.  Type
I hyperlipoproteinemia is caused by human LpL deficiency and has many effects
on different systems and organs.  Lipid-lowering drugs are of little use
and LpL has a short half-life in plasma so enzyme replacement therapy is of
little help.  Pancreatitis and abdominal pain are the chief symptoms of LpL
deficiency even in a low-fat diet.
<p>
Gene therapy studies in mouse and cat models have been tried.  Mice treated
with human LPL<sup>S447X</sup> in Ad vector showed significant improvement
in reduced plasma TG levels in adult -/- mice.  The human LPL<sup>S447X</sup>
variant is a beneficial mutation carried by 18-25% of population associated with
increased LpL activity and improved lipoprotein profile.
<p>
One of the principal factors in successful long-term therapy is finding the
right adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector.  At least 8 different AAV vctor
serotypes have varied tropism and transduction efficiences.  	The serotype
2 (AAV2) is most widely used but AAV1, AAV7, and AAV8 transduce muscles
efficiently.  We reported that AAV1-LPL<sup>S477X</sup> in LPL -/- mice
result in long-term correction of dyslipidemia, effects lasting &gt; 1 y
after just one administration of vector.
<p>
AAV1 was produced using calcium-phosphate-mediated cotransfeciton in 293 cells.
AAV1 helper plasmid pDP1 or pVD20 was used for the AAV1 capside, AAV2 replicase,
and adenovirus helper genes.  Plasmid pVD5 was used to provide LPL<sup>S447X</sup>.
The transgene cassette is 5'-AAV2-ITR-CMV promoter-LPL<sup>S447X</sup>-WPRE-bGH
poly(A)-AAV2-ITR-3'.  Bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site [bGH-poly(A)]
and woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE)
will enhance transcription.  AAV1-LPL<sup>S447X</sup> is purified from crude
cell lysate by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation or affinity chromatography
then by filtration and concentration against 5% sucrose-PBS.  A quantitative
PCR is used to measure viral titer in terms of genome copy, and purity checked
by SDS-PAGE.  Infectivity is assessed by infecting 293 cells with virus
and then monitoring hLpL protein synthesis into Markit-F LPL kit medium.
<p>
Adult male LPL<sup>-/-</sup> age 2-8 y deficient in detectable LPL activity and
protein and having extreme lipemia with plasma triglyceride levels averaging
10.2 g/dl (56-fold higher than heterozygous cats) after short 4 h fast.
Total cholesterol is 4.1-fold higher and HDL-C levels are 38% lower than in
+/- cats.  Extreme hypertriglyceridemia, lactescent plasma, and severe
pancreatitis are the hallmark symptoms idential with human LpL deficiency.
<p>
Male LpL<sup>-/-</sup> were injected intramuscularly in 10 sites with either
10<sup>11</sup> genome copies/kg of AAV1-LPL<sup>S447X</sup> or with 17
&times; 10<sup>11</sup>, low and high dose, respectively.  After 1 week the
high dose resolved visible plasma lipemia and plasma TGs were reduced 99%
(4422 mg/dl down to 45 mg/dl, avg values, diff <i>p</i> = 0.029) and total
cholesterol was reduced 74% (from 382 to 101 mg/dl, <i>p</i> = 0.039).
HDL-C increased by a very significant 27% (from 75 to 94 mg/dl).  There was
no therapeutic effect seen with low dose injection.  All the changes seen were
gone by 3 weeks and TGs, TC, and HDL-C returned to pretreatment levels within
3 weeks.
<p>
With the high dose AAV1-LPL<sup>S447X</sup>, postheparin LpL protein increased
to peak of 1682 ng/ml after 1 week.  With the 17-fold lower dose AAV1-LPL,
there was a smaller rise in LpL postheparin activity:  206 ng/ml.  Thus
there is a dose dependence.  LpL activity also showed the same dose dependence:
with high dose AAV1-LPL infection, peak activity is 139 mU/ml (51% of wildtype
feline level) at 1 week, and with low dose infection, it was 12.7 mU/ml
(4.7% of wildtype) after 1 week.  As with the mass of LpL, the activity
increases were transient, beginning to decline after 1 week and returning to
pretreatment levels after 2-3 weeks.
<p>
Anti-human S447X LpL antibody titers were monitored as well.  These began
to appear 3 weeks after AA1-LPL injection in both low and high doses.
Antibody titer was also dependent on the AAV1-LPL dose: rising to 125 mg/ml
6 weeks after high dose injection and 62 mg/ml at 6 weeks after low dose
injection.  Anti-LpL antibodies neutralized LpL activity in all but one
of the animals.
<p>
A 3 &times; 10<sup>11</sup> genome copy/kg dose was given to a heterozygous
(+/-) cat in the same manner and an anti-LpL antibody titer was detectable
after 3 weeks.  This verifies that the human LpL<sup>S447X</sup> itself
is antigenic.
<p>
With the rise of anti-hLpL antibody in the cat detectable at 3 weeks, plasma
CPK levels also increased with peak level of 4589 U/L at week 3 and 5588 U/L
at week 4 with low dose injection, compared to a background of 201 U/L.
They returned to baseline by week 8.  This shows that there is muscle tissue
damage.
<p>
Homozygous -/- cats were treated with weekly oral doses of cyclophosphamide
(100-200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per week);  the drug delays the onset of humoral
responses to AAV-mediate transgene expression of factor IX in a dog model
of hemophilia B.  Cats were then injected in doses at 3 levels: low =
10<sup>11</sup> genome copies/kg, intermediate at 5 times more, and high
at 10 times more.  Plasma lipemia and hypertriglyceridemia were resolved in
the high dose animals in 3 days, in th intermediate dosed-animals in 7 d,
and in low dose animals between 7 and 14 d.  Plasma TGs were reduced by
&gt;99.9% of pretreatment levels.  Nonetheless, the effect of these injections
was again transient, as animal plasma TG levels returned to baseline within
2-3 weeks, and anti-human LpL antibodies were seen.
<p>
The longest effect (up to 8 weeks) was seen with some animals injected with low
dose combined with 150-200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cyclophosphamide immunosuppression.
Antibody titers were detected not until 8 weeks.  One of the low dose animals
showed a response within a short time (3 weeks).   The rise and fall of postheparain
LpL activity and mass levels was also seen, and the fall was concomitant to
anti-LpL titer increases.
<p>
Thus cyclophosphamide immunosuppression delays but does not eliminate the
immune response.
<p>
In a third experiment, the number of intramuscular injection sites was varied
(2, 10, 50 sites in three different cats) with a total dose of 5 &times; 10<sup>11</sup>
virons/kg.  With only 2 injection sites, plasma TGs were resolved more rapidly
(witbin 4 d and max by day 7).  With 10 injections, the lowering of plasma TGs
was slower, and even slower with 50 injections, but the therapeutic effect lasted
longer (4 weeks vs. 1 week for the 2 and 10-site injection protocols).  A plot
of LPL<sup>S447X</sup> mass (ng) per site against the dose per site shows that
production and secretory capacity of skeletal muscle after induction of
AAV1-mediated hLpL expression is not a limiting factor of the local vector
dose used.
<p>
Cats were sacrificed at 8-10 weeks posttreatment and the gastrocnemius and
triceps muscle tissue were harvested and extracted to measure LpL activity
and mass (deltoid muscle was extracted as an untreated control).  Liver
also assayed since AAV1 vector leaks from injection into circulation and is
cleared by liver.  Both protein and activity were found in the muscles of
cats injected with low, intermediate (5 &times; low), and high (10 &times;
low).  Expression was consistently higher in the gastrocnemius compared to
the triceps but no relationship could be found between dose injected and level
of protein and activity found.  No LpL activity or protein was seen in the
control deltoid muscle or in liver tissue, thus indicating localization of
enzyme into its site of injection.

B16F-10 melanoma ia from a highly metastatic line and maintained in DMEM + 10% FBS
with antibiotics.  Sulforaphane and hydroxyproline are from Sigma.  Mice are
divided into 4 groups of 14 animals and injected 1 million B16F-10 cells per
animal in lateral tail vein.  Sulforaphane is adminster i.p. at 0.5 mg/kg for
10 d:  in Group 1, ad the same time as cell administration; in Group 2, 10 days
before cell injection; in Group 10 days afer cell injection.  8 animals are
sacrified on day 21, the lungs excised, blood collected.  Morphological examinations
of lungs include tumor nodules, collagen hydroxyproline, hexosamine, uronic acid.
Blood serum is estimated for sialic acid, &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)
levels.  The balance of the 6 animals in each group are studied for survival.
Mortality is expressed as percent increase in life span (ILS):
%ILS = (T &minus; C) / C * 100, where T = number of days of survival of treated
animals, C = number of days of survival of controls.  4 &micro;m formalin-fixed
paraffin embedded sections are stained in H&amp;E.  Melanoma cells are seeded
5000 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottomed titer plate and left 24 h 37&deg;.
1-50 &micro;g/ml sulforaphane are added and allowed to incubate 48 h.  After
4 h, 20 &micro;l 5 mg/ml MTT added and percentage of deaded read at 570 nm.
In the collagen invasion assay, modified Boyden chambers are used:  lower chamber
is filled with serum-free DMEM and polycarbonate filter coated wtih 25 &micro;g
Type I collagen placed above it.  B16F-10 cells (100,000 in 150 &micro;l DMEM)

Table shows nodules TNTC in control (untreated).  The lowest number of nodules
is when sulforaphane is simultaneously, followed by the prophylactic group, then
the group where nodules were allowed to develop.  Life spans were increased
in all treated groups, with the simultaneously injected group nearly double.
In general the inhibition of nodule formation was more than 80% in all groups.
Several parameters of lung tissues (HO-Pro, uronic acid, hexosamine) were
investigated.  With untreated melanoma cell injection, all parmaters increased
10-20 fold.  With sulforaphane treatment, all numbers are reduced, but not entirely
within the level of normal (uninjected) mice.  As to serum biochemistry,
both sialic acid and GGT levels were highly elevated (5-fold) compared to
uninjected, but reduced with sulforaphane treatments; most so with simultaneous
injection, less so with prophylaxis, and even less so with post-injection but
significant tumor reduction.  Lung tissue in untreated controls showed many
nodules in terminal bronchioles; tumor cells had polygonal shape and prominent
nucleolus, melanin deposition and necrotic areas.  In the cell proliferation
assay, increases in the level of sulforaphane had a direct cytotoxic effect
above 5 &micro;g/ml, and so these lower concentrations were used for additional
in vitro work.  Addition of sulforaphane to the medium of cells in the
collagen invasion aassy shows signficantly inhibition (92%) of invasion at
5&micro;g/ml, and perentages at 2 and 1 are 61% and 36%.  What effect on
tumor proliferaton?  Tritiated thymidine assays showed progressively reduced
incorporation with higher sulforaphane counts.  The gel zymography assays shows
that matrix metalloproteinases secreted into medium were inhibited by sulforaphane.
In control two bands at 92 and 79 kDa correspond to MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity,
respectively.  Gels loaded without trypsin activation show no clearing.  activated
trypsin + EDTA did not show clearing (indicating metal dependence).  Conditioned
medium treated with sulforaphane during trypsin activation, there is no clearning,
indicating inhibition of procollagenase to collagenase activiation.

Characterization Of Hydrogen Bonding: From Van Der Waals Interactions To
Covalency. Unified picture of hydrogen bonding based on electron density
topography analysis
<p class="Para1">
Classical texts by Jeffrey (with Saenger) and by Scheiner in the late 1990s
have addressed hydrogen bonding specifically in biology and chemistry.  In 1990
Bader provided a theory of atoms in molecules (AIM) which uses theoretical
tools to understand H-bonding interaction.  H-bonding is simple the noncovalent
attractive interaction between a proton donor X-H and an acceptor Y either in
the same or different molecule.  The H atom should be bonded to one of the
electronegative atoms of N, O, or F.  Acceptor Y is an electronegative region
or a region of electron excess.  Current theory has now expanded to include
C-H as a donor and the electrons in a &pi; molecular bond.  In general, if
X-H forms an H-bond with Y, there is a shortening of distance between
X-H...Y.  The X...Y distance is &lt; &sum; (van der Waals radii of the atoms
X and Y).  This results in a red shift of ~100 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> in
X-H stretching vibrational frequencies.  In addition there is reduced mean
magnetic shielding of the proton leading to low field shift of a few ppm,
and anisotropy of proton magnetic shielding increases by as much as 20 ppm.
H-bonding falls into three classes of strength: strong 15-40 kcal/mol,
moderate 4-15 kcal/mol and weak at 1-4 kcal/mol.  Strength is a function
of bond length and angle (directionality).  Generally deviations of &lt;20&deg;
have marginal effects on strength.  H-bonding is a mix of mostly electrostatic
interaction and partly covalence.  There are acid/base (electrostatic),
hard/soft polarization, van der Waals with dispersion and repulsion and
intermolecular electron correlation interactions, and charge transfer (covalency).
<p>
The X-H covalent bond is weakened in H-bonding, and there is a decrease
in X-H stretching frequency (red shifting).  In addition an nonnegligible
electron density transfer occurs from acceptor atom Y to donor atom X.
This density comes from a nonbonding pair in Y to the &sigma;<sup>*</sup>
antibonding orbital in X-H:  it is the occupancy of this orbital that
accounts for bond distance and strength reduction and X-H stretch frequency
decrease.
<p>
<b>Blue-shifting: anti-H-bonding</b>.  Some reactions cause compression of
X-H bond and increased X-H stretch frequency.  For example, in the complexation
of chloroform and triformylmethane.  This has also been called improper H-bonding.
The mechanism was found to be a structural reorganization of the X-H bond
arising from a balance of hyperconjugative bond weakening and rehybridization
bond strengthening; it might occur when the X-H bond-elongating hyperconjugative
n(Y)&rarr;&sigma;<sup>*</sup>(X-H) interaction is weak.  If weak, and the
X hybrid orbital in X-H can undergo sufficient change in hybridiation and
polarization, rehybridication dominates  and leads to shortening of X-H bond
and then the blue shift.  This ends up being a logical consequence of Bent's
rule in organic chemistry, which predicts that increasing <i>s</i> character
occurs in X-H bonds with H-bond formation, as H becomes more electropositive.
<p>
Homo- and heterodimers with H-bonding have been studied using ab initio
electronic structure calculations and density funcitonal theory (DFT) methods.
Kollman and Allen (1972) reviewed this theoretical foundaiton.  Most calculations
have been done with H-bonding in water.  Pople's and Dunning's correlation
consistent basis sets have been used to calculate structure and energetic of
the water dimer.  Large scale ab initio MO calculations give the best estimate
of H-bond energy strength in the water dimer as 5.0 &plusmn; 0.1 kcal/mol.
When corrected for zero-point and temperature effects the value of
&Delta;<i>H</i>(375) = &minus;3.2 &plusmn; 0.1 kcal/mol, close to the experimental
determination of &minus;3.6 &plusmn; 0.5 kcal/mol.  In addition dimers of
other simple H-bonding-capable small molecules have been studied:  MeOH,
HCHO, HCONH<sub>2</sub>, HCOOH, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, phenol, etc.  Properties
sought include geometry, energetics, vibrational frequencies, electronic
properties.
<p>
<b>Solvation</b>.  Neutral and charged molecule solvation is of importance.
To study solvation process, size-selected clusters of type M-S<sub>n</sub>
are isolated and used as models to look at molecular hydration of molecule
M in solvent S.  There are two approaches: (1) <b>continuum solvation model</b>
or implict solvation and (2) direct interaction of solvent molecules with
solute (<b>discrete model</b>).  Approach (1) treats solvent as continuous dielectric
medium reacting with solute charge distribution.  Self-consistent reaction
field (SCRF) model is used to model bulk effects of solvation.  Continuum models
do no account for specific H-bonding of solute with solvent.  Buckingham-Fowler
modle, Molecular Mechanics for Clusters (MMC) and the models of Dykstra,
Alhambra/Luque/Orozco, the Polarizable Atomic Multipole Model, and the
Electrostatic Potential for Intermolecular Complexatin (EPIC) are some strategies
to try.  The EPIC model employs topographical theory of molecular electrostatic
potential (MESP).  Much of the model with respect to water molecule interaction
with polar and nonpolar molecules has been validated.  Benzene was a prototype
for nonpolar microsolvation, and supported by IR measurements.
<p>
The structure and function of biomolecules is critically dependent on H-bonding.
DNA does not pair and proteins do not fold with H-bonding.  Ab initio calculations
show that H-bonding strength of G-C and A-T pairs is 20.0 and 17.0 kcal/mol.
Hydration is also important in this bonding.  Each nucleotide is surrounded
by 12 water molecules in the primary hydration shell.  The primary shell is
impermeable to cations nor do they associate in freezing as part of the ice.
A secondary shell is permeable to cations and will be part of ice formation
on freezing.  A third class of water molecule is basically part of bulk water
and thoroughly disordered.  Experiment and molecular simulation shows this
hydration level.
<p>
For protein secondary structure H-bolding accounts for the &alpha;-helix,
&beta;-sheet, &gamma;-turn, &pi;-helix and so on.  For the &alpha;-helix,
intramolecular bonding occurs between the nonbonding electron pair on the
C=O oxygen atom on the <i>i</i>th peptide and the H atom on the NH group of
the <i>i</i> + 4th residue in the peptide.
<p>
[Section on molecular clustering skipped.  Techniques to study mentioned
include spectroscopy by microwave, vibrational rotation tunneling (VRT),
REMPI and hole burning, and zero kinetic energy.]
<p>
Theoretical methods for studying H-bonding include semi-empirical molecular
orbital methods, Hartree-Fock (HF) and post-HF methodologies.

Biology and Biochemistry of Glucosinolates
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.
Used to be known as <q>mustard oil glucosides.</q>  Found in all <i>Brassica</i>
plants (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, etc) and in condiments (mustard,
horseradish, wasabi).  Functions are many:
<ul>
<li>Primarily in plant/crop protection, both natural and commercial
<li>Good agricultural biofumigants
<li>Have a role in anti-carcinogenesis
</ul>
<p>The convenient plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> produces glucosinolates.  Reports
in the plant kingdom have been limited to the order Capparales, including
15 families (Brassicaceae, Capparaceae, and Caricaceae included).
<p>
120 glucosinolates are described composed of &beta;-D-glucopyranose linked
to sulfur atom to (<i>Z</i>)-<i>N</i>-hydroxyiminosulfate ester, with a variable
R group.  The R group actually derives from one of 8 amino acids (Ala, Leu,
Ile, Met, Val, Phe, Tyr, and Trp) which undergo many transformations before
the final glucosinolate is produced. Transformations includ hydroxylation,
O-methylation, desaturation, glycosylation, and acylation.
<p>
<b>Myrosinase</b> is a thioglucoside glucohydrolase activity responsible
for hydrolyzing the glucose moiety from the glucosinolate.  The aglycone
product is unstable, with the thio-iminosulfate group.  Rearrangements to
more stable structures will lead to isothiocyanate, nitrile or other classes
of products.  Myrosinase activity only occurs when these are mixed, as by
tissue damage, since the enzyme is either compartmentalized or inactive.
<p>
Plant breeders have significantly reduced the levels of seed glucosinolates
in order to get the protein-rich seed cak for animal feed supplementation (after
getting the oil out).  2-hydroxy-3-butenyl glucosinolate in rapeseed forms
oxazolidine-2-thione which can cause goiter.  Rapeseed leaf glucosinolates have
been altered to improve their function against pests and fungus; a problem is that
glucosinolates can also attract some pests.  <b>Biofumigation</b> is the process
of using harvested plant material in soils in order to suppress pathogens, nematodes,
and weeds.
<p>
Glucosinolates induce phase II detoxification enzymes such as quinone reductase,
glutathione-S-transferase, and glucuronosyl transferases.  Sulforaphane is
the isothiocyanate product of 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate from broccoli
and this and other isothiocyanates probably prevent tumor growth, blocking the
cell cycle and promoting apoptosis.  It may also treat <i>H. pylori</i>-caused
gastritis and stomach cancer.
<p>
Glucosinolate biosynthesis occurs in three phases.
<p>
<b>Phase 1: Amino Acid Chain Elongation</b>.  In vivo feeding studies, the
isolation of enzyme activities in vitro, and isolation of key intermediates
provide evidence of this.  The parent amino acid is deaminated to form 2-oxo
acid.  Then three steps occur in which 2-oxo acid is condensed with acetyl CoA
to form 2-malate, which then isomerizes by a 1,2-hydroxyl shift to a 3-malate
derivative, and then a oxidation-decarboxylation occurs to produce a 2-oxo acid
with chain extended by a methylene.  This extension can be repeated, consuming
one acetyl-CoA each time.  Finally transamination can be done to produce an
amino acid.  Up to 9 cycles have been identified.  This biosynthetic process
mimics what happens in leucine biosynthesis and what happens in the TCA cycle.
The evidence started with feeding of radiolabeled precursors in the 1960s, which
have been confirmed with stable isotope labeling studies.  The added methylene
actually derives from the methyl carbon of acetyl-CoA.  Activity of this chain
elongation has been found in cell-free extracts as well.
<p>
Isolation of the genetic elements in <i>Arabidopsis</i> was done using a cross
between two ecotypes, Columba and Landsberg <i>erecta</i>.  Candidate genes
were two adjacent sequences of high similarity to the gene encoding isopropylmalate
synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the condensation reaction for Leu biosynthesis
chain elongation.  One of the two genes was identified using fine-scale mapping
as <i>MAM1</i> (methylthioalkylmalate synthase I).  Missense mutants did not
have correct glucosinolate chain-length profiles, and expression of <i>MAM1</i>
in <i>E coli</i> produced an extract able to condense
&omega;-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoate with acetyl-CoA to give
2-(&omega;-methylthioalkyl)malates.  This gene only did the first two cycles
of elongation, and so there must be another gene, probably the adjacent sequence
(<i>MAM-L</i> for <q>MAM-like</q>) found that encodes the protein providing
further elongation.  In fact a knock-out was produced which lacks a long-chain
Met-derived glucosinolate, and then restored after transformation with functional
<i>MAM-L</i>.  A survey also shows a third <i>MAM</i>-like gene in
<i>Arabidopsis</i>, called <i>MAM2</i>.  Majority of ecotypes had <i>MAM1</i>
or <i>MAM2</i> but not both.  <i>MAM1</i> was associated with two elongation
cycles, but <i>MAM2</i> only with one.
<p>
With <i>Arabidoposis</i> the study of pathway intermediates is possible and
has allowed great progress.  From amino acid to glucosinolate core, intermediates
include <i>N</i>-hydroxy amino acids, aldoximes, <i>aci</i>-nitro or nitrile oxides
(too reactive to be isolated), <i>S</i>-alkyl thiohydroximates, thiohydroximic acids,
and desulfoglucosinolates.  Except for <i>S</i>-alkylation, all activities have
been associated with genes.
<p>
Aldoxime biosynthesis from amino acids is done by cytochrome P450 enzymes belonging
to CYP79 family.  Seven forms in <i>Arabidopsis</i> have been found using
functional genomics.  This approach was based on similarities of biosynthetic
pathways of glucosinolates and cyanogenic glycosides, which are also amino acid-derived
products with aldoxime intermediates.  CYP79 homologues are identified, expressed
heterologously and characterized enzymologically (substrate specificity).
<p>
Yeast are transformed with cDNAs and resistance to 5-fluoroindole (precursor
of toxic tryptophan derivative) was found: CYP79B2 was found, as was CYP79B3,
which catalyze Trp &rarr; indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx).  The double knockout
<i>cyp79B2/cyp79B3</i> makes no indole glucosinolates at all.  The <i>busby</i>
and <i>supershoot</i> mutants have several morphological changes including
several hundred axillary shots:  these are <i>CYP79F1</i> mutants, and these
have no short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates (1-4 -CH<sub>2</sub>- groups).
A <i>CYP79F2</i> homolog is 88% identical and metabolizes long-chain elongated
Met derivatives.  Reports show the F1 form will oxidize 1- to 6-homoMet derivatives
with both short- and long-chain glucosinolates, but the F2 form metabolizes only
the 5- and 6-homoMet forms.  The CYP79A2 form works on Phe derivatives, and the
B2/B3 works on Trp derivatives.  C1 and C2 isoforms are known but function has
not yet been determined (transcripts present at low levels).
<p>
The aldoxime is converted to the thiohydroximic acid in the next step.
In <i>Arabidopsis</i> this is CYP83B1.  Knockouts of this gene have a high
auxin phenotype.  There is also an A1 form:  it metabolizes aliphatic aldoximes,
and the B1 works better with aromatic aldoximes:  B1 has a higher affinity for
aromatics (50-fold difference in <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> with A1 form.
In one screen a <i>cyp83A1</i> knockout was found to have very reduced levels
of phenylpropanoids (sinapoylmalate), indicating a link between glucosinolate
and phenylpropanoid metabolism.
<p>
CYP83 enzymes produce the <i>aci</i>-nitro form or nitrile oxide (oxidized
aldoxime) which is unstable and cannot be isolated;  the reaction is
R-CH=N-OH &rarr; R-CH=N<sup>+</sup>(-OH)-O<sup>&minus;</sup>.  In vitro the enzyme
reacts efficiently with nucleophilic S-donor to make S-alkyl thiohydroximates.
What follows is conjugation with Cys, probably through a glutathione-S-transferase-like
enzyme:  R-C(-S-Cys)=N<sup>+</sup>(-OH)-O<sup>&minus;</sup>.
<i>S</i>-(hydroximoyl)-L-cysteine conjugates will rapidly cyclize internally
in vitro to make 2-substituted thiazoline-4-carboyxlic acids.  Since this
does not actually happen biologically, the plant has a lyase which cleaves
the <i>S</i>-alkyl thiohydroximate to make the thiohydroximic acid, and this
is coupled to the <i>S</i>-donating enzyme, also in turn tightly coupled to
the CYP83 enzyme.  This chain of reactions must occur without any loss of
reactive sulfur intermediates.  One such <i>C-S</i> lyase in Arabidopiss was identified
through a bioinformatics approach.  A knockout mutant shows the complete
absence of aliphatic and aromatic glucosinolates, which is interesting since
with other gene types, there are multiple members of the family that always
at least produce some glucosinolates (thus this must be a family with one
gene only).
<p>
UGT74B1 (AtIg24100) is a UDP-glucose-thiohydroximic acid
<i>S</i>-glucosyltransferase.  The substrate phenylacetothiohydroximic
acid is glycosylated to produce the corresponding desulfoglucosinolate.
This was found in <i>Arabidopsis</i> based on homology to patented ortholog
in <i>B. napus</i>.  Knockouts significantly decreased glucosinolate
accumulation but did not eliminate, indicating other UGTs in the genome.
<p>
Differential RNA display technique was used to identify coronatine-regulated
genes and was used to identify PAPS:desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferase,
AtST5a (AtIG74100), which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to the
hydroxyl group of the hydroximic portion of the glucosinolate.  Other genes
(AtST5b and AtST5c) were found and revealed that AtST5a prefers the Trp-
and Phe-derived desulfoglucosinolates.
<p>
Cyanogenic glycosides share some steps in the biosynthetic pathway, but are
found in a wide variety of plants:  ferns, gymnosperms, angiosperms.
Glucosinolates are found only in the order Capparales and a single outgroup
(genus <i>Drypetes</i> of Euphorbiaceae).  Since both produce aldoximes as
intermediates, it is thought that glucosinolates represent a recent
evolutionary divergence from cyanogenic glycosides.  CYP79 is required for
cyanogenic glycoside production, in common with glucosinolates.  Many other
enzymes show sequence similarity.  CYP71 family metabolizes the N-hydroxylation
but its cytochrome P450 family has diverse enzymatic activities.  One theory
of the evolution of glucosinolates is that a toxic compound instead of the
expected hydroxynitrile was formed, and that the pathway that evolved was
a way of detoxifying the substance.
<p>
<b>Further Transformations</b>.  After glucosinolate formation the R group
can be continuously modified by other steps.  This is especially true of
methionine and its chain-elongated derivatives.  The sulfur atom in the
thioether is often oxidized, creating the methylsulfinylalkyl and the
methylsulfonylalkyl moieties.  The sulfinyl moieties can be further modified
by oxidative cleavage to alkenyl and hydroxyalkyl chains.  Salicylic acid
appears to be an inducer of the CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 enzymes, but it induces
different kinds of glucosinolates in different plants.

Chimeric Antigens of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>: Toward Standardization of
Toxoplasmosis Serodiagnosis Using Recombinant Products
<p class="Para1">
Infection in humans by <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is often asymptomatic and
the disease self-limiting.  A primary infection in the fetus of the pregnant
mother can cause severe consequences:  miscarriage, permanent neurological
damage, premature birth, visual impairment.  Diagnostics for <i>T. gondii</i>
makes use of parasite-specific DNA by PCR or anti-parasite Ig detection.
The PCR assay is complicated by the fact that infection endures after a limited
parasitemia, and that samples must be carefully handled.  EIAs to detect 
the IgG, IgM, and IgA classes are desirable.  Assays make use of whole
<i>T. gondii</i> soluble extracts, but assay quality is variable since there 
are no standards regarding method of preparation or purification <i>Toxoplasma</i>
antigen.  As much as 30-60% of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis are
show negative or undetectable IgM response.  Attempts to use recombinant 
antigen are not as good as testing for IgG or IgM to tachyzoite antigen.
<p>
DNA encoding the fragments of the MIC2, MIC3, and SAG1 antigens was amplified
from cDNA obtained in <i>T gondii</i> RH strain using primers
K551 and K553, K552 and K555, and K554 and K556, respectively.  The MIC3 and
MIC2 products were mixed and used as templates with K551 and K555.  DNA was
purified and mixed with SAG1 PCR product, and this was template with primers
K551 and K556.  All this generates a chimeric antigen EC2.  Then sequences
within GRA3, GRA7, and M2AP were amplified with primers K563 and K565, K564
and K567, and K566 and K568, respectively.  GRA3 and GRA7 product are mixed
and use as template with primers 563 and K567, then this DNA purified and mixed
with M2AP which is then amplified to make a chimeric sequence EC3.  The EC2 and
EC3 sequences are digested with SpeI and NotI and then subcloned to pGEX-SN.
<p>
Note: pGEX vectors are expression vectors that create fusions with a GST tag,
with a multicloning site enabling unidirectional placement of inserts and 
with a sequence permitting cutting the GST tag off the insert using special 
protease; another construct contains a cAMP-PK site that allows <sup>32</sup>P 
labeling.  The GST domain is 26 kDa: sequence has translational start
ribosome-binding site; translation is under control of <i>tac</i> promoter.
The plasmid has the <i>lacI</i><sup>q</sup> repressor.

Evaluation of murine monoclonal antibodies targeting different epitopes of the 
hepatitis B virus surface antigen by using immunological as well as molecular 
biology and biochemical approaches
<p class="Para1">
HBV virus forms an infectious particle with nucleocapsid of icosahedral shape
enveloped with membrane from host cell during budding.  Other virus particle
forms include the spherical and filamentous, which are composed  entirely of
HBsAg and subviral particles.  Six protein products are made from alternate
translations of the S gene: P24, GP27, GP32, GP36, P37, and P39.  GP32 and GP36
are mono- and diglycosylated forms of M protein.  P39 is glycosylated form
of L protein.  Relative proportions of S:M:L in the typical virus envelope
are 2:1:7 (Heermann et al 1984).  S protein is major surface antigen with the
group-specific <i>a</i> determinant and allelic subtype variants <i>d/y</i>
and <i>r/w</i> (Bancroft et al 1972, Le Bourier 1971).  The S protein shows
four transmembrane domains and two hydrophilic loops, one extracelluar and
other buried below envelope with amino acid positions 101-159 (by sequence
analysis) (Stirk et al 1992).  Protective humoral immunity is mostly directed
against the common determiant <i>a</i> (Vyas et al 1973).  Hepatocyte attachment
is achieved by the PreS1 region on the L protein, with aa 21-47 being the 
epitope involved (Neurath and Kent 1989).  Antibodies against this region
create a neutralizing effect (Maeng et al 2000, Hong et al 2004).
Monoclonals Abs to various products of S gene help to map epitope structure-function.

A new HBsAg screening assay designed for sensitive detection of HBsAg subtypes 
and variants
<p class="Para1 abstract">
ABSTRACT. The design of a new HBsAg screening assay, the Hepanostika HBsAg Ultra 
is based on the use of monoclonal antibodies raised against native wild-type 
HBsAg and reactive with HBsAg in which the common 'a'-determinant is modified by 
site-directed mutagenesis of four of the cysteine moieties. The design was 
checked using the same cysteine variants and samples from patients known to be 
infected with HBsAg variants. The results found were compared with other 
state-of-the-art commercial screening assays. The design of the Hepanostika 
HBsAg Ultra enabled detection of all variant HBsAg-positive samples in contrast 
to the other commercial assays. An additional 980 samples were tested to assess 
the specificity and sensitivity of the Hepanostika HBsAg Ultra. Screening of 
presumed negative serum and plasma samples resulted in a specificity of 100%. 
This makes the Hepanostika HBsAg Ultra the first screening assay with a design 
able to detect HBsAg variants with high sensitivity and specificity.

Two pairs of primers for nested PCR were developed for the target MPB64 protein
in the whole <i>M tuberculosis</i> H37Rv genome (GenBank NC_000962).  The QNRT-PCR
is similar to nested PCR except the second (inner primer set) step includes
use of a third oligo, a TaqMan probe.  Two probes are used both 22 nt long:
one is VIC-labeled wildtype and other is FAM-labeled mutant.  For quantitating
the <i>M tuberculosis</i> DNA accurately, two plasmids are constructed.  The
wildtype (W) plasmid contains 239 bp fragment of MPT64, created by inserting
the 1st step PCR amplicon from H37Rv into pCR2.1 using Invitrogen TA cloning
kit.  For the mutant (M) plasmid, 22 point mutations were randomly created in the
239 bp fragment, with the mutations not altering the percent GATC base compositions.
Primers which included MPT64 sequence and also an additional 16 artificial
nucleotides on 5&prime; end were synthesized:  the 16 nt additions included
an <i>Nhe</i>I site (5&prime;-GCTAGC-3&prime;) at 5&prime; end.  Using W-plasmid
construct as template with these primers and a PCR program with much longer
amplification steps (including 5 min extension), a 4168 bp amplicon is produced.
This is digested with <i>Nhe</i>I.  There is no <i>Nhe</i>I site in the vector
pCR2.1 so it is possible to ligate both ends of the PCR product.  The ligation
product is cloned using TA cloning kit.
<p>
Nine cases, two confirmed and others highly probable, had TB with severe background
disease with neural involvement.  Cranial MRI showed four cases of hydrocephalus
and intracranial focal masses.  Seven patients responded to antituberculosis
treatment and the other two died from an aggravation, one from renal cancer and
the other from adult T-cell leukemia (no autopsies since permission not taken
from family).  Two cases were culture-positive for TB and a single PCR assay
was positive for these two.  Nested PCR however showed all 9 cases to be positive.
For 20 patients in a non-TB control group, both single and nested PCR assays
were negative for all patients.  A human &beta;-globin PCR on CSF samples was
positive for all 29 tests (TB + nonTB groups), an internal control: showing that
DNA is extracted well from CSF with no PCR inhibition.  Both single and nested
PCR were negative for six control bacteria that were not <i>M tuberculosis</i>.
A plot of the <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> value vs. the log of the starting copy number of the
W-plasmid and M-plasmid were constructed to show the inverse linear relationship
with <i>r</i> = 0.999 for both.  There were no significant differences between
plots and they were highly precise.  The cycle count of Step 1 of nested PCR had
an effect on the <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> values:  at 35 cycles, there are big
significant differences between starting copy numbers of W plasmids, which is
desired.  The test was optimized to determine the best starting concentration
of M plasmid count as an internal control.  This is done against a varying
W plasmid, and it was determined that 1000 copies M plasmid was the best to use
with these results.  The primer concentrations were adjusted for 2nd step PCR to
determine the best to use:  as there was no difference between 0.9 and 1.8
&micro;M and since there was no difference in the results, the lower primer
concentration was used.
<p>
When only single step PCR was used for direct DNA CSF extract (2 &micro;l),
only two cases showed amplification and it could not be sufficiently quantitated.
This would have been the case for real-time PCR as a single step.  With the
nested qPCR (QNTR-PCR), test positivity is established and those specimens
established as negative by other methods were also negative on the QNRT-PCR
assays.  A difficult aspect of doing the assay is to extract sufficient
DNA from the CSF.  QIAGEN QIAmp Blook Kit and COBAS AMPLICOR respiratory
specimen prep kit were inadequate.  With phenol-chloroform extraction using
high MW carrier Ethachinmate, followed by precipitation, enough DNA could be

<i>M tuberculosis</i> has four major specific sequences: the IS<i>6110</i>
insertion elements, 16S rRNA, 65 kDa heat shock protein antigen,  and MPT64
have PCR assays developed for them, the first two having the most applications.
COBAS AMPLICOR targets 16S rRNA.  MPT64 is believed to be the most sensitive
and specific for any PCR assay.  On this basis MPT64 was chosen as target.
An argument against nested PCR is the false positive, in that sample contamination
occurs at multiple points.

Molecular characterization of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen from 
Chinese hamster ovary and <i>Hansenula polymorpha</i> cells by high-performance 
size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle laser light scattering
<p class="Para1">
The first generation of HBsAg was from human plasma with chronic carriers.
This can be in form or 42 nm infectious virions and 22 nm non-infectious 
particles; the latter are highly immunogenic.  Expression in yeast 
(<i>S cerevisiae, P pastoris, H. polymorpha</i>) and mammalian cell lines (CHO)
has been demonstrated.  Immunogenicity varies.  CHO-derived HBsAg particles 
are glycosylated and compare well to plasma-derived HBsAg compared to 
yeast-derived HBsAg.  Immunogenicity of 22 nm HBsAg composed of ~100 monomers
is 1000-fold greater than single molecule HBsAg. A <i>Hansenula</i> recombinant
of S form only  and one in CHO composed of the L form (Pre-S1-PreS2-S) have
been created, so can vary.  To examine molecular properties, Ishikawa and
coworkers using high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and
low angle laser light scattering (LALLS).  These methods can provide information
on moleculer weight (size), shape and other molecular parameters.  For this study
only the S core coding region was transformed into CHO cell line, grown in 
roller bottles in DMEM+5% FCS.  HBsAg are recovered from the medium using
hydrophobic interaction chromatography, anion-exchange, concentration by 
ultrafiltration, and then gel filtration (published procedure).  The smaple
is concentrated by ultrfiltratio (YM-10) before HPSEC.   Recombinant from
<i>H polymorpha</i> with same coding region is done with MeOH induction, and
extracted using high pressure homogenization, then purified by anion exchange,
hydrophobic interaction, and SEC.   The HPSEC system (Agilent 1100) is a TSK
G5000PWx1 (7.8 &times; 300 mm) using PWx1 guard column has a post column
multi-angle light scattering detector (DAWN EOS &lambda; = 690 nm, Wyatt Tech)
and a refractive index detector (OPTILAB DSP, Wyatt Tech) in addition to a 
UV detector, all in series as UV, MALLS, RI.  A 50 mM phosphate with 0.05% sodium
azide pH 6.8 is used.  Flow rate is 0.5 ml/min.  UV is calibrated against sodium
chloride, and RI detector against toluene.  MALLS is normalized using BSA according
to Wyatt Tech.  The change in refractive index with concentration (<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)
means that RI determination is critical to calculate correct MW.  It is possible
to estimate molecular weights according to following equation:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i> = [<i>M</i><sub>P</sub>(<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)<sub>P</sub> + 
<i>M</i><sub>L</sub>(<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)<sub>L</sub> + 
<i>M</i><sub>C</sub>(<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)<sub>C</sub>] / (<i>M</i><sub>P</sub> + 
<i>M</i><sub>L</sub> + <i>M</i><sub>C</sub>)
<p>
Values from the literature show that (<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)<sub>L</sub> = 0.134 ml/g
and (<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)<sub>C</sub> = 0.148 ml/g, for lipid and carbohydrate
content.  Above a certain concentration, protein is a constant 
(<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)<sub>P</sub> = 0.186 ml/g independent of amino acid.
<p>
<b>Results and Discussion</b>.  HBsAg particles are a polydisperse protein
assembly with molecular weight &gt; 2 MDa.  The HPSEC must first be calibrated
with standards with similar MW and conformation as HBsAg.  The CHO recombinant
showed a retention time of 14.9 min and the Hansenula was at 15.6 min in the
program.
<p>
The basic light scattering equation is:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>K<sup>*</sup>C/R</i>(<i>&theta;</i>) = (1/<i>M</i>) [1 + 
(16&pi;<sup>2</sup>/3&lambda;<sup>2</sup>)&lang;<i>r</i><sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup>&rang;
sin<sup>2</sup> (&theta;/2) + ...] + 2<i>A</i><sub>2</sub><i>C</i>
<p>
where <i>K</i><sup>*</sup> is optical parameter = 
[4&pi;<sup>2</sup><i>n</i><sup>2</sup>(<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)<sup>2</sup>]/(&lambda;<sup>4</sup><i>N</i><sub>A</sub>),
<i>C</i> = solute concentration in mg/ml, <i>R</i>(<i>&theta;</i>) = excess
intensity of Rayleigh ratio of light scattering at angle <i>&theta;</i>,
&lambda; = wavelength used in measure, <i>n</i> = solvent refractive index,
<i>d</i><i>/dc</i> = incremental change in refractive index, <i>N</i><sub>A</sub> =
Avogadro's number, <i>M</i> = weight-average molecular weight, 
&lang;<i>r</i><sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup>&rang; = mean square radius of gyration,
<i>A</i><sub>2</sub> is a second virial coefficient which is negligible at 
the low concentrations used in column chromatography.  For an HBsAg being 
glycoprotein, the (&lang;<i>r</i><sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup>&rang;)<sup>&frac12;</sup>
will be &lt; &lambda; / 20, or rather with a MW &lt; 5 &times; 10<sup>7</sup> g/mol,
and so the second term in the bracketed sum of the equation (with sin<sup>2</sup>
term) will be negligible at all angles.  The equation simplifies then to 
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>K<sup>*</sup>C/R</i>(<i>&theta;</i>) = 1/<i>M</i>.
<p>
Rearranging and substituting for <i>K</i><sup>*</sup>:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>R</i>(<i>&theta;</i>) = 
[4&pi;<sup>2</sup><i>n</i><sup>2</sup>/(&lambda;<sup>4</sup><i>N</i><sub>A</sub>)] (<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)<sup>2</sup>
<i>MC</i>
<p>
Thus the light scattering (LS) signal <i>R</i>(<i>&theta;</i>) &prop; 
<i>MC</i>(<i>d</i>n/<i>dc</i>)<sup>2</sup>, since the other values are constant.
The RI signal &prop; <i>C d</i>n/<i>dc</i>, and UV signal is proportional to 
protein concentration.  The LS/RI and RI/UV should be constant.  Elution peaks
for both CHO and Hansenula recombinants were narrow, indicating composition of
lipid, carbohydrate, and protein are homogeneous, and so the <i>d</i>n<i>/dc</i>
are likely to be constant.  The Hansenula product is 59.6% protein and 
40.4% lipid and <i>d</i>n<i>/dc</i> = 0.164 ml/g.  Since the sequence of CHO
is 59.5% protein, 38.4% lipid, and 2.1% carbohydrate, its particle is assumed 
to be the same.  A value of <i>d</i>n<i>/dc</i> = 0.165 ml/g is computed.
The weight-average molecular weight (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) computes for the 
CHO product to be 4921 kDa and for Hansenula is 3010 kDa, based on four runs.
Plots of differential weight fraction vs. molecular weight shows differences
in the distribution of particles.  CHO shows the higher mean weight and a more
narrow distribution of weights for molecular forms.  Plot of molecular weight
vs retention time (elution volume) show partial coincidence of the CHO and
Hansenula curves in the middle MW region, indicating CHO may be more compact
than Hansenula, since there is more mass in the same size (volume).
Plots of the cumulative weight fraction vs. MW show that ~70% of the weight
is between 4000 and 6730 kDa in CHO recombinant, and the same fraction is 
between 2050 and 4260 kDa in the Hansenula product;  the steeper slope of the
distribution indicates a narrower distribution of masses, and show consistency
in the UV elution profiles.  Thus the MW and its distribution of weights 
show that particles from CHO recombinant are larger and more homogeneous than
for the Hansenula.  The CHO is known to be more immunogenic, and this may be
related to observation of glycosylation and greater homogeneity of CHO particles.
<p>
Elution volumes (retention times) in HPSEC are function of both MW and solute
shape.  Relationship of size to weight is not linear and clearly geometry
dependent.  Light scattering analysis reports the shape as the RMS of the
radius of gyration (&lang;<i>r</i><sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup>&rang;)<sup>&frac12;</sup>.
Plot of the RMS radii vs retention time for both products should reveal the
values of interest.  The plot shows a significant fluctuation for CHO recombinant
probably because particle dimensions are at the detection limit resulting
from small angular dependence in light scattering.  The lowest detectable radius
for static light scattering is 10 nm.  A distribution of RMS radii can be
determined by plotting both the differential and the cumulative weight fraction
against the RMS radii (nm) (software does this).  For CHO recombinant, this
distribution of radii are from 15-28 nm, with an average <i>r</i><sub>g</sub> = 22.1 nm
(<i>n</i> = 4 runs), while for the Hansenula, distribution is 10-40 nm with
<i>r</i><sub>g</sub> = 18.1 nm.  These results are consistent, since Hansenula
showed a wider UV peak.  Asymmetry is 0.86 for CHO and 0.59 for Hansenula.
The size and size distribution are similar to values for plasma-derived HBsAg
with 22 nm diameter for Dane particle.
<p>
Much of the immunogenicity of HBsAg comes from the protein, and not so much the
lipid and carbohydrate, neither of which absorb at 280 nm.  The protein moiety
molecular weight can be computed as:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>M</i><sub>P</sub> = [<i>K</i><sub>RI</sub><sup>2</sup> / (<i>K</i><sub>LS</sub><i>K</i><sub>UV</sub>)]
[(LS)(UV)/&epsilon;<sub>P</sub>(RI)<sup>2</sup>]
<p>
where <i>&epsilon;</i><sub>P</sub> is extinction coefficient for the protein 
moiety, and <i>K</i><sub>RI</sub>, <i>K</i><sub>LS</sub>, and 
<i>K</i><sub>UV</sub> are instrument calibration constants for this class of 
biomolecule.  These can be determined using standard proteins with known MW and 
extinction coefficients.  The (LS), (UV), and (RI) are the area signals on those 
instruments.  The (LS) is the area signal of the 90&deg; (11th angle) of MALLS. 
The <i>&epsilon;</i><sub>P</sub> can be experimentally obtained or estimated 
with reasonable accuracy from amino acid composition of protein monomer. The CHO 
<i>adr</i> recombinant has an <i>M</i><sub>P</sub> = 25435 Da and 
<i>&epsilon;</i><sub>P</sub> = 3.384 ml (cm mg)<sup>&minus;1</sup>  and the 
Hansenula <i>adw2</i> product has <i>M</i><sub>P</sub> = 25394 Da and 
<i>&epsilon;</i><sub>P</sub> = 3.215 ml (cm mg)<sup>&minus;1</sup>.  Using a HSA 
monor with <i>M</i><sub>P</sub> = 67.0 kDa and <i>&epsilon;</i><sub>P</sub> = 
0.677 mg (cm mg)<sup>&minus;1</sup> at &lambda; = 280 nm and the measured values 
obtained, the ratio <i>K</i><sub>RI</sub><sup>2</sup> / 
(<i>K</i><sub>LS</sub><i>K</i><sub>UV</sub>) = 18071.  Applying this value to 
the unknown proteins, the average molecular weight for teh CHO recombinant
is found to be 3948 Da and for the Hansenula recombinant it is 2190 Da.  This
is just for the protein moeity.  Using this value as a divisor for the particle
weight of the assembled complexes, the CHO particle has 155 monomer subunits
while the Hansenula particle has 86 monomers.  It is possible that the lower
immunogenicity of the Hansenula product could be due to a lower monomer number.

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1913337/?tool=pubmed">MarT 
Activates Expression of the MisL Autotransporter Protein of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Serotype Typhimurium
<sup>&#8711;</sup></a>
<p class="Para1">
<i>Salmonella</i> typhimurium serotype has 13 operons to express fimbriae and 
three gene to encode adhesins in the autotransporter family: <i>shdA, misL</i> 
and <i>bigA</i>.  Only two of the adhesins will express in vitro:  the 
<i>fim</i> operon for type 1 fimbriae, and the <i>csg</i> (<i>asg</i>) gene for 
the thin-curled (or thin aggregative) fimbriae, also called <i>curli</i>. 
Sequence scanning found an <i>Salmonella</i> pathogenicity island 3 (SPI3) 
containing the <i>misL</i> gene having autotransporter function.  Autotransporter
proteins have an N-terminal signal peptide, internal passenger domain, and C-terminal
translocator domain.  After secretion and signal peptide cleavage, the translocator
domain forms &beta;-barrel in outer membrane through which passenger domain is
exported to cell surface.  The MisL passenger has an affinity for the fibronectin.
In vitro, the bacteria attacht to fibronectin coated glaass; in vivo, they show 
increased invasivness for epithelial cells.  The <i>misL</i> gene must function
for intestinal colonization in chicks and mice given serotype Typhimurium orally.
MisL codes for an adhesin.  The translocator domain in the C-terminus can elicit
antibody responses.  Expression of <i>misL</i> can be induced inn macrophages 
in vitro.  Growth in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth of a bacterium with <i>misL-lac</i>
chimera does not produce &beta;-galactosidase activity indicate that normal media
may not be an inducer;  western blots are negative too, so it is not just because
the fusion is inactive, if present.  When put under an arabinose promoter (from
<i>E coli</i>) anti-MisL serum detects MisL protein in LB cultures with arabinose
present.
<p>
<b>Identifying T-POP Insertions Triggering MisL Expression In Vitro</b>. 
The serotype Typhimurium LT2 strain is modified so that promoterless 
<i>lacZYA</i> genes are inserted into host chromosome behind stop codon of
<i>misL</i> gene.  To do this, the pCM2 is a derivative of the suicide vector
pFUSE with 5&prime;; end of <i>misL</i> gene is transferred from <i>E coli</i>
S17-1&lambda;<i>pir</i> into LT2 using conjugation.  The strain MA1 results
and will generate library of random T-POP insertion mutants.  Plasmid pNK972,
encoding the Tn<i>10</i> transposase in transfected into MA1 (<i>misL::lacZYA</i>).
Bacteriophage P22 derivative (P22 HT105/1 <i>int</i>) is grown on typhimuurum0 carrying
the T-POP transposon on <i>E coli</i> F&prime; plamsi (TH3923) and this phage
lysate used to deliver T-POP transposon into MA1(pNK972).  Selection is with
20 &micro;g/ml Tet (T-POP has Tc<sup>r</sup>) and X-Gal (BCIG, 60 &micro;g/ml),
which reports presence of <i>misL::lacZYA</i>.  With 40,000 transductantns, 21
colonies were blue or light blue.  All 21 were worked further (M-1 to M-21).
T-POP can identify both negative regulatory elements (through insertional activation),
positive regulatory element (through driving expression from Tc-dependent promoter.
Western blot could not identify MisL in any of the 21 mutants grown in LB broth.
With Tc supplementation, a 100 kDa band is observed that reacts with anti-MisL
in mutants M-1 and M-2.  The predicted size is 98.4 kDa for the mature MisL.
The T-POP likely inserted upstream of the positive regulatory element of the 
mutant.  All 21 isolates were grown in presence or absence of Tc, and &beta;-galactosidase
levels were high (100 and 300 Miller units) only in the M-1 and M-2 cultures 
when Tc is present.  The other 19 did not express &beta;-galactosidase beyond
background.  The M-1 and M-2 strains are named MA1-1 and MA1-2, respectively.
Note that the <i>misL</i> expression in MA1-1 and -2 are Tc-inducible (shown
by western), and since &beta;-galactosidase activity was positive, then the 
T-POP insertion must be a positive and not negative regulator.  Inverse PCR was
used to amplify the T-POP insertion sites.  Products are cloned into DH5&alpha;
<i>E coli</i>  using vector PCR2.1 and sequences determined.  NCBI database search
by BLAST showed that the two insertions were at same position within the <i>marT</i>
open reading frame located upstream of nucleotide +7 (relative to <i>marT</i> start
codon).  Insertion site was adjust to 7-base sequence which matches the Tn<i>10</i>
hot-spot consensus sequence.
<p>
<b><i>marT</i></b>.  This gene is in SPI3 and encodes 285 amino acid protein which
has 41% sequence identidy with CadC transcriptional activator in in <i>E coli</i>.
Deduced amino acid analysis shows a winged helix-turn-helix domain from amino 
acids 32-180.  The 31 N-terminal amino acids of MarT not found in CadC, but the
rest of the sequence is shared between two proteins.  The transposon insertions
in both MA1-1 and -2 generated a truncated <i>marT</i> open reading frame downstream
of Tc-inducible <i>tetA</i> promoter.  A 2nd ATG codon at nt 70-72 could initiate
translation with truncation of first 21 amino acids, and this leaves the winged
HTH domain intact;  thus a truncated but functional MarT regulatory protein might
still be produced.  Another possibility is that <i>tetA</i> promoter from T-POP
drives expression of the downstream <i>fidL</i> gene, which might also activate
<i>misL</i> expression; FidL is hypothetical inner membrane protein with no 
conserved functional domains.
<p>
The <i>marT</i> gene was into pBAD/gIIIA expression vector under control of
arabinose induction using a primer pair for <i>marT</i>.  The plasmid pCT6
was transfected into Typhimurium LT2 and MisL expression checked with western
blotting with anti-MisL.  A ~100 kDa band under arabinose induction was found;
not found in LT2 grown with no pCT6 transfection.  Thus <i>marT</i> expression
in LT2 induces expression of MisL.  The MA1 (<i>misL::lacZYA</i>) strain was
also transfeted with pCT6:  there was a significant increase in &beta;-galactosidase
in the MA1(pCT6) transfectant in 200 &micro;g/ml or 2 mg/ml L-arabinose.
It should be noted that as little as 0.2 &micro;g/ml arabinose was necessary 
(1000-fold less) to induce MisL expression in the LT2(pCT6) transfectant compared
to the MA1(pCT6) transfectant, confirmed by western analysis.  This indicates that
the <i>misL::lacZYA</i> fusion reduced expression of the <i>misL</i> gen by 
an unknown mechanism.
<p>
<b>How does MarT control <i>misL</i> expression?</b>.  Since it is a winged HTH 
protein and likely DNA-binding, plasmid pCT7 was constructed to create a MarT 
recombinant with C-terminal 6xHis tag under arabinose control.  The primers 
5&prime;-GGAGCTCTCCTGCTACGCAGCCACAGCATC-3&prime; and 
5&prime;-GCTGCAGCCCATGTGTCACCCCGCGG-3&prime; within the pBAD/gIIIA vector.
The LT2(pCT7) transfectant with L-Ara showed weak expression on anti-MisL westerns.
The fusion protein showed considerable insolubility during attempts to use 
affinity chromatography.  New primer pairs were used to amplify <i>marT</i> into
pGEX4T-2 to construct pCT17, which is a GST-MarT function under <i>lac</i> promoter
control.  Transfected into LT2 host and induced by IPTG, it was detectable under
a western.  Cells were lysed in French press and purified using a glutathione
Sepharose column.  The eluted protein was mixed with DNA containing the <i>misL</i>
promoter region and a electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA using a Pierce
LightShift Chemiluminescence Kit, Pierce).  5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide 
with cold 0.5&times; TBE buffer.  DNA-protein complexes were electrotransferred to
cationic nylon using TBE (30-60 min at 380 mA) and then the EMSA kit used to detect.
The <i>misL</i> promoter region was a PCR amplicon created with biotinylated primer
pairs.  Increasing amounts of GST-MarT were run on the lanes:  this cause a band
of higher apparent MW to form, signifying a retarded mobility of the complex.
With purified GST as a control, there was no mobility shift.  In a competitive 
version, unlabeled PCR amplicons were mixed with biotinylated amplicons with
GST-MarT present, and this resulted in inhibition of the gel shift.  Using PCR
amplicon of an unrelated promoter (<i>vjbR</i> from <i>Brucella abortus</i>), 
there was no inhibition of the gel shift.
<p>
MisL and ShdA are autotransporter proteins causing attachment of bacteria to 
fibroncectin and helping Typhimurium serotype in intestinal colonization in 
murine host.  These proteins under various in vitro growth conditions are not 
detectable by Western blotting.  Mice produce anti-MisL antibodies (shown in 
seroconversion) when MisL and ShdA can be induced in vivo.  Immunofluorescence 
signals are strong in thin sections of mouse intestinal cecum after infection 
with serotype Typhimurium in which anti-MisL and anti-ShdA are colocalized, 
along with anti-O4.
<p>
The data above show that MarT encoded in SPI3 is a direct transciptional 
activator of <i>misL</i> gene expression.  MarT is close homolog of CadC which 
are members of the ToxR-like regulatory protein family.  CadC activate 
<i>cadBA</i> operon encoding the CadA lysine decarboxylase and the CadB 
lysine-cadaverine antiporter in <i>E coli</i>.  Normally a histone-like nucleoid 
protein H-NS turns off <i>cadBA</i> by binding its promoter, just upstream of 
CadC binding site.  Acidic external pH and exogenous lysine induce the binding 
of CadC to the promoter, disrupting or altering H-NS repression, and activating 
operon expression.  In <i>Salmonella</i> H-NS usually silences genes that have 
GC content lower than genomic average, usually genes acquired by lateral 
transfer, and thus being a barrier to RNA polymerase binding.  The SPI3 cluster 
is a result of lateral transfer with GC content of 47.5% and lower than the 52% 
average.  Immmunoprecipitation of chromatin shows H-NS binding to the 
<i>misL</i> promoter as well.  More testing is required to show that MarT is 
involved in de-repression of H-NS to stop the silencing of <i>misL</i>.

Hypochlorous Acid-Mediated Protein Oxidation: How Important Are Chloramine
Transfer Reactions and Protein Tertiary Structure?
<p class="Para1">
Leukocytes undergo respiratory burst to generate superoxide by NADPH oxidase
system, and these dismutate to generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.  Enzymes
including proteases and myeloperoxidase (MPO) are also released  and chloride
presence generates HOCl.  Amines and sulfur-containing compounds are major
targets of HOCl, and this include K, H, C, and M side chains at low HOCl.
At higher concentrations chloramines form and well as oxidation of Trp
and chlorination of Tyr.  Two smsll proteins, insulin (5.7 kDa) and lysozyme
(14.4 kDa) were selected for study.  These proteins have no free Cys and low
levels of Met and Trp.  Chloramine formation is more likely in the absence
of these residue types, so transfer reactions can be studied easily.
<p>
Lysozyme and insulin were mixed with N-acetyl amino acids and treated wtih HOCl. 
(<i>N</i>-&alpha;-acetyl-Cys)<sub>2</sub>, <i>N</i>-&alpha;-acetyl-Trp, and 
<i>N</i>-&alpha;-acetyl-Tyr were dissolved directly because they are insoluble 
in concentrated form.  0.5 mg/ml (34.7 &micro;M) insulin was treated 37&deg; for 
3 h to molar ratios of HOCl (0-25-fold) with N-acetyl amino mixtures.  For the 
N-acetyl amino acid mixtures, no loss of His, Lys, and Arg residues was seen to 
be loss significantly, while there was a trend to loss of Lys.  With the insulin
samples, there was no significant loss of Lys at any molar excess of oxidant,
but both His and Arg were observed with 25:1 HOCl:protein (not so much at
lower).  Two-way ANOVA was used to compare data sets showed that His and Arg
are consumed significantly in insulin compared to N-acetly amino acid mixture
with 25-fold HOCl excess; and no significant difference in consumption of Lys
compared to the mixture.  A significant loss of Tyr was seen with 10-fold HOCl
excess and much greater in protein samples than N-acetyl amino acid mixtures
(by 2-way ANOVA).
<p>
Treated at 22&deg; for 24 h and 37&deg; for 3 h, 0-25-fold HOCl was mixed with
0.5 mg/ml lysozyme.  There was no significant difference in results for the 
two different conditions.  Relative to control at any oxidant excess. there was
no His. Lys, Arg losses in N-acetyl amino acid mixtures (an insignificant trend
was seen with Lys).  In lysozyme there was no significant loss of Arg but His
and Lys showed significant losses.  In both the mixtures and lysozyme, there is
significant loss of Trp especially at high excesses (25-fold); in contrast,
Tyr residues were quite stable at lower excess, 40% remaining at high excesses.
No differences in consumption were seen for Tyr between mixtures and lysozyme.
In all cases where Met was present (mixture, lysozymes), it was rapidly consumed
at any excess of oxidant, forming the sulfoxide.  Even at higher oxideant excesses
Met(SO) was further consumed.
<p>
<b>Chloramines</b>.  Signficantly greater levels of chloramines and amides preent
in N-acetyl amino acid mixtures compared to insulin (3 h, 37&deg;).  Insulin
chloramines were close to baseline levels.  When HOCl:N-acetyl amino acids
were 1:1, 25% of HOCl remained as TNB-active.  For lyxozyme and the N-acetyl
amino acid samples chloramine levels were close to zero at low HOCl excesses;
at higher exceses, chloramines build up in the NAAM but not lysozyme.  this may
be because of reduced stability of chloramines in proteins, but also could be becuase
of inability to properly quantitate because of precipitation at high HOCl excesses.
<p>
These differences in NAAM and proteins is consistent with hypothesis that 
secondary rections of chloramines have role in affecting amino acid change
(loss) in proteins.  Consider the chloramines of 
<i>N</i>-&alpha;-acetyl-Lys (NAA-K) and Gly will react
with 3-indolepropionic acid to see a model of chloramine-mediated damage
to Trp side chain.  UV/vis absorbance changes were monitored for 18 h with 
spectral collection at intervals between 1-3 min.  At 280 nm, the &lambda;<sub>max</sub>
of indole, there is an initial decay followed by an increase.  Between 240-260 nm
there is an increase in absorbance indicating simpler linetics.  All data shows
that Trp oxidation is occurring by HOCl and by His side chain chloramines.
Plot of the observed 2nd order rate constant (<i>k</i><sub>obs</sub>) against
[3-indolepropionic acid] show a straignt line from which the 2nd order rate 
constant can be determined.  The derived constants are equivalent to the 
intial reaction of chloramines with Trp side chains, which means that initial
oxidation is the rate-determining step. 
<p>
Rates of oxidation of -S-S- bonds by chloramines of NAAG and Gly were assessed
using 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid which is a model for disulfide bond 
formation.  Maximal absorption at 248 nm (for the dithiopropionic acid) is
seen at time = 0 and there is a shift to 244 nm.  These results are consistent
with the global analysis.

Met is oxidized quickly to MetS(O), but at higher excesses of HOCl, it is
further degraded.  The oxidation of N-&alpha;-acetyl-MetS(O) and DMSO were
studied as a model.  NAA-MSO reaction with HOCl was monitored from 260-320 nm
(with max at 292 nm) and simple expontential kinetics over 30-60s time scales
evaluated.  Reaction of DMSO with HOCl was monitored from 220-320 (DMSO absorbs
weakly at these wavelengths).  In addition His-side chain chloramine model
of 4-imidazoleacetic acid chloramine with DMSO was tested; a more complex analysis
of data was required, and second-order rate constants obtained by global analysis.
Decays are nonexponential and the 2nd order rate constant cannot be verified
by single wavelength analysis.  Intermediate identity was not determined 
but it could be a chlorinated species such as CH<sub>3</sub>S(O)(Cl)CH<sub>3</sub>.
<p>
First-order rate constants for chloramine decomposition were assessed by 
preparing chloramines of &epsilon;-amino-<i>n</i>-caproic acid and NAA-Lys 
(Lys side chain models), 4-imidazoleacetic acid and NAA-His (His side
chain models), and Gly (&alpha;-amino group model). 10-fold excess HOCl was
used for the Lys side chain and &alpha;-amino to prevent dichloramine formation.
His side chain chloramines decompose rapidly with excess substrate (previously
shown elsewhere), and His side chain chloramine was prepared 1.1-fold molar
excess of imidazole over HOCl.  The Lys and Gly chloramines were maintained
22&deg; for 7 d, and 24 h for the His side chain chloramine.  At intervals
the chloramine concentration using TNB assay.  ln[chloramine] vs time was
plotted, the slopes corresponding to &minus;<i>k</i>, the negative of the first-order
rate constant.  Kinetic data from previous reports combined with rate constants
obtained in this study provide opportunity to develop computational model.
Previous models used rate constants for HOCl reaction with protein components
but did not predict secondary reactions.  The computational model produced are
identical to those from the original computational model.  Second-order rate
constants used for secondary reactions of His chloramines were those from a
previous study.  The model predicts that the two Met residues in lysozyme
are converted to MetS(O) with just 2-fold molar excess HOCl.  The sulfoxide
is further converted to the sulfone, which only occurs with 25-fold molar excess,
and with up to 30% sulfoxide converted.  For disulfides as present in insulin
the model shows 67% of disulfide bonds in two proteins remain with 1:1 HOCl:protein,
dropping to 35% with 2:1, and are consumed entirely with 5-fold excess.
Model shows that His residues are not lost within 24 h of treatment, consistent
with previous reports.  Lys residues in both proteins will have minimal (&lt;10%)
irreversible loss to form carbonyls after 24 h with 25-fold HOCl excess.

Chapter 2 is the analysis and managment of biochemical data, introducing
biostatistics and informatics.  Univariate statistics is about measuring data.
The mean and standard deviation are discussed.  The <i>F</i> distribution as
the ratio of the two variances of compared datasets is discussed for
its ability to report whether the variances are significantly different from
one another.  The <i>t</i> test used to determine whether differences between
means of two groups of data is signficiant.  For comparing whether the means
of several experimental groups are different, ANOVA is used.  The sum of the
squared differences within groups and their degrees of freedom in computed
to produce the <i>error sum of square</i> and <i>error degrees of freedom</i>.
Then the between-groups error and degrees of freedom are computed.  Finally
the total sum of squares and degrees of freedom are computed.  All the ratios
are the mean square deviations.  Finally an F statistic is computed as the
quotient of the groups mean square deviation and the error mean square deviation.
<p>
Another technqiue to be used is simple linear regression and correlation, to
examine dependency between two variables.  If one variable is independent
and the other shows dependency the relationship is <b>regression</b>.  However
if the two variables do not show dependency with each other but do show changes
with respect to each other, the relationship is <b>correlation</b>.  The
regression relationship is expressed mathematically as
<i>Y<sub>i</sub> = &alpha; + &beta;X<sub>i</sub> + &epsilon;<sub>i</sub></i>.
The parameter <i>&epsilon;<sub>i</sub></i> properly expresses the random error seen
in experimental data measurements (this is called <i>residual</i>).  For linear
fits of the data, the <i>least squares</i> method is routinely used.  The total
sum of squares of the dependent variable <i>Y</i> is computed, then the regression
sum of squares, (&sum; <i>xy</i>)<sup>2</sup>/&sum; <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, which
is equal to the total if all points fall on the regression line.  Subtracting
the regression SS from total SS gives the residual sum of squares,
&sum;(<i>Y<sub>i</sub> &minus; Y&prime;<sub>i</sub></i>)<sup>2</sup>.  The regression
line is determined as well as its fit <i>correlation coefficient</i>.
<p>
When there are simultaneous measurments for two or more variables (<i>m</i> =
count of variables), then the relationship
<i>Y<sub>j</sub> = &alpha; + &beta;</i><sub>1</sub><i>X</i><sub>1<i>j</i></sub> +
<i>&beta;</i><sub>2</sub><i>X</i><sub>2<i>j</i></sub> +
<i>&beta;</i><sub>3</sub><i>X</i><sub>3<i>j</i></sub> + ...
<i>&beta;<sub>m</sub>X<sub>mj</sub></i>.  For this to apply, observed values
of <i>Y</i> must be random with <i>Y</i> normally distributed, all distributions
must have similar variances, all <i>Y</i> values must be independent, and the
error in <i>X</i> is small compared to the error in <i>Y</i>.  If the value
<i>Y</i> is dependent upon the multiple <i>X</i> values, then the relationship
is multiple regression.  If none of the variables is functionally dependent on
any other, then the relationship is multiple correlation.  When the analysis
is complete, an ANOVA table will usually be presented.
<p>
Aside from Excel to perform some basic mathematical manipulations including
statistics, some statistical packages are available to permit data analysis.
SPSS with multiple different analyses.  SyStat is also useful with an easy
interface.

The linear solvation-energy relationship (LSER) was theorized by Kamlet et al 1981:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>X<sub>i</sub> = X</i><sub>0</sub> + <i>m</i>(<i>V</i>/100) +
<i>s&pi;* + b&beta; + a&alpha; = X<sub>m</sub> + s&pi;* + b&beta; + a&alpha;</i>
<p>
where <i>V, &pi;*, &beta;</i>, and <i>&alpha;</i> are the solute van der Waals
volume, the Solovatcoh-Romic parameter, basicity (H acceptor) measure, and the
acidity (H donor) measure of compound <i>X<sub>i</sub></i>, respectively.
<p>
Chapter 3 is about using Internet resources in order to explore more about
biochemistry.  The Internet structure and protocols are explained, in addition
to services.  A discussion of databases of importance is given.
<p>
Chapter 4 is about visualizing biomolecules using molecular graphics.  Line
drawings with skeletal and ball-and-stick models are used to represent small
molecules with a sphere for an atom and a line segment for a bond.  Atoms are
placed in coordinate space and the bond computed.  For every pair of bonded
atoms, the distance is calculated: if distnace is less than sum of vand der Waals
radii of both atoms, then a bond is assumed.  In another approach, such as for
a protein with standard amino acids, a list of pairs of atom names can be made
and each pair corresponding to a bond: in constructing the graphic of a protein,
for each residue the coordinates of each pair atoms is placed.   Atoms can be
represented as a sphere or disk.  Coloring and shading using dot patterns can
provide a sense of depth and movement.
<p>
Molecular structures can be represented using three levels of graphics.  A
1D formular or string/character format such as SMILES, 2D chemical structures
such as ISIS draw, and 3D representations such as PDB atomic coordinate display.
Nucleotide sequences are represented in usually a GenBank or FASTA format.
Amino acid seqeunces also have a FASTA format, as well as PIR and Swiss-Prot
which spaces sequences on each line to make sure the position number is tracked
easily.  TOPS is a 2D representation of secondary structure of proteins, in both
space and direction: circles (being helices [&alpha; and 3<sub>10</sub>]) and
triangles (being &beta; sheet) are connected by line segments.  All line segment-connected
shapes form one fragment, and the N- and C-terminus followed by an integer in which
the C-<i>i</i> of the preceding fragment connects to the N<i>i</i> of the fragment
that follows.  There will be numerous fragments that are not connected to each
other by line segments (but are by the N- and C-notation); a fragment can be
found in only one domain.  All shapes (secondary structure elements) have a
direction (N&rarr;C) that is up <i>out of the plane</i> or down <i>into the plane</i>.
If the N-terminal connection is drawn only to the border/edge of the shape
and the C-terminal connector from the center of the shape, the direction is up.
If N is from cetner and C from the edge, then the direction is down.  Furthermore
if triangles point up, the &beta;-strands are up and the converse is true.
<p>
For 3D structural work of proteins, almost all structures have been shown by the
X-ray diffraction of protein crystals.  Some details have come from neutron
diffraction, and some from NMR.  Theoretical models from molecular modeling too
have contributed.  Most protein structures have been resolved to 1.7 to 3.5 &Aring;
for fine detail (when better than 2 &Aring; it is high resolution).  The <i>R</i>
factor of a determination is a measure of how well the model reproduces the
intensity data:  the lower the factor, the better the data.
<p>
Chapter 5 is about the structure and analysis of biochemical compounds. Water
and its importance addressed.  Inorganic ions, organic compounds.  Four classes
of biomolecules:  carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids): their
monomeric and polymeric forms.  For polymers, the linkage (by atom) is characterized
by <i>torsion angles</i>, which is the angle of planes or bonding atoms.
For polysaccharides, the monomer between two monomers has two linking atoms;
a plane is constructed formed from the bond angle of one link and also from
the other.  The C1 angle is &phi; while the linking bond to whatever the next
carbon is is &psi;.  Note that if the linking carbon is out of the monomeric
ring (like C6 for hexapyranoses) then its angle with respect to the ring is
&omega;.  Similarly two amino acids together will form a plane with the atoms
making up the peptide bond, and the &alpha;-C will be the linking point for
comparing the &phi; and &psi; torsion angles.  The &alpha;-helix is a
3.6<sub>13</sub> helix (3.6 residues per helix turn, 13 atoms to form one
pitch unit or turn).  Other biomolecule structures are discussed.
<p>
Purification and chromatographic methods are discussed.  In addition spectroscopic
methods are addressed (see table)

<p>
Chapter 6 is about biomolecular interactions in dynamic biochemistry.  The nature
of ligand-receptor, antigen-antibody, inducer-DNA binding is discussed.
A receptor R might have <i>n</i> sites for binding ligand L.  Each site will
have an association constant <i>K<sub>i</sub></i>, such that <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> =
[RL<sub>i</sub>]/[R][L<sub>i</sub>].  The moles of ligand bound per mole receptor
can be computed as <i>&nu;</i> = <i>K</i>[<i>L</i>]/(1 + <i>K</i>[<i>L</i>])
where the equilibrium constant is the same for all ligands, or
<i>&nu;</i> = &sum; {<i>i</i> &prod; <i>K<sub>j</sub></i>}[<i>L</i>]<sup><i>i</i></sup>
/(1 + &sum; {<i>i</i> &prod; <i>K<sub>j</sub></i>}[<i>L</i>]<sup><i>i</i></sup>)
in the case of multiple equilibrium constants.  Solutions can be found by
plots of algebraic expressions of these formula.  When the equilibrium constants
are the same (thermodynamic equivalence), and one site does not interfere or
cause dependence on another, then
<i>&nu;</i> = <i>nK</i>[<i>L</i>] / (1 + <i>K</i>[<i>L</i>]) and this can be
re-expressed as the Klotz equation, 1/<i>&nu;</i> = 1/<i>n</i> + 1/<i>nK</i>[<i>L</i>],
or as the Scatchard equation <i>&nu;/</i>/[<i>L</i>] = <i>nK</i> &minus; <i>&nu;K</i>.
For non-interacting <i>n</i>-equivalent sitesm
<i>&nu;</i> = <i>nK</i>[<i>L</i>]<sup><i>h</i></sup> / (1 + <i>K</i>[<i>L</i>]<sup><i>h</i></sup>)
known as the Hill equation.  This can be transformed to
log {<i>&nu;</i>/(<i>n &minus; &nu;</i>)} = log <i>K</i> + <i>h</i> log [<i>L</i>],
where <i>h</i> is the Hill coefficient and measure of strength of interaction.
If all <i>n</i> equivalent sites are non-interacting, then <i>h</i> = 1.  If
<i>h &rarr; n</i> then all sites are strongly interacting.
<p>
<b>Cooperativity</b> is the phenomenon where a ligand binds and induces a
change in assocation constant for a successive (or different) ligand.  If the
association is increased, it is positive cooperativity.  If it is reduced
it is negative cooperativity.  The concept of <b>allosterism</b> is when ligand
molecules will bind to different sites.  Multiple sites on a single molecule
can indicate the possibility of cooperativity; alternatively, a multimer with
each subunit have its own single binding site for a ligand can show cooperativity,
and this is the only known case (there are no single molecules with multiple
binding sites).  Where identical ligands affect cooperativity, this is <i>homotropic</i>.
Where different ligands affect cooperativity, it is <i>heterotropic</i>.
The <b>symmetry model</b> of homotropic cooperativity has been proposed by
Monod, Wyman, and Changeux and originally called the allosteric model: an
oligomeric protein (allosteric protein) binds ligands (allosteric effectors)
such that (1) each subunit (protomer) can exist in either two conformational
states, T (tight) or R (relaxed); the conformational symmetry is such that
all protomers must exists in all the same state either T or R at any instance,
and the dissociation constant for the T and R conforomations for the ligand must
be different.  The fractional saturation can be computed from these assumption.
Another model is the <b>sequential model</b> by Koshland, Nemethy, and Filmer,
in which the conformational stability of each subunit is determined by the
conformations of the subunits interacting with it.  Again the subunit protomers
have two states, but there is no requirement for conformational symmetry.
There is an additional provision that the ligand only binds in one of the two
states.  The symmetry model predicts only positive cooperativity, whereas the
sequential model allows for both positive and negative.

Improved performance of the automated toxoplasmosis IgG, IgM &amp; IgG avidity 
assays on the Abbott ARCHITECT Instrument
<p class="Para1">
Goal of project is to optimize IgG, IgM, and IgG avidity assays for acute
infection and immunity status.  The Toxo-IgG assay uses P30 and P35 recombinant
antigens bound to solid phase to capture seropositive antibodies; any bound
antigen is then detected with anti-human IgG specific antibody containing
label.  Toxo-IgM uses a mouse anti-human IgM mAb coated to solid phase:
once IgM molecules are captured (note that it captures all IgMs, a tachyzoite
lysate is added which reacts with any IgM molecules specific for tachyzoite
antigens.  Labeled anti-P30 antibody is then added, which should react any
tachyzoite antigen that reacted with an IgM.  The third assay is a Toxo-IgG
avidity:  high avidity IgG Abs are suppressed with soluble P30 Ag with an
indirect anti-human IgG format, with sample diluted specifically in a defined
concentration range to distinguish high from low avidity.  The three-test
panel should provide specificity for detection of primary Toxoplasma infection.
Blood was tested from 518 donoars, 220 inpatients, and 250 pregnant women.
Sensitivity was evaluated from 165 seroconversion panels.  Where results
were difficult to determine, additional Toxo assays were used.
<p>
The Architect Toxo IgG was equivalent to the AxSYM assays, and more sensitive
than comparison assays.  It was quite sensitive to detect past infections
(low level [IgG]), usually equivalent or better than comparator assays, and
it showed high specificity.  IgM assay specificity was 99.7-100% for the three
groups tested above.  Sensitivity in acute infection was equivalent to AxSYM
Toxo-M.

Mutations in the S gene region of hepatitis B virus genotype D in Turkish 
patients
<p class="Para1">
ABSTRACT. The S gene region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for 
the expression of surface antigens and includes the 'a'-determinant region. 
Thus, mutation(s) in this region would afford HBV variants a distinct survival 
advantage, permitting the mutant virus to escape from the immune system. The aim 
of this study was to search for mutations of the S gene region in different 
patient groups infected with genotype D variants of HBV, and to analyse the 
biological significance of these mutations. Moreover, we investigated S gene 
mutation inductance among family members. Forty HBV-DNA-positive patients were 
determined among 132 hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) carriers by the first 
stage of seminested PCR. Genotypes and subtypes were established by sequencing 
of the amplified S gene regions. Variants were compared with original sequences 
of these serotypes, and mutations were identified. All variants were designated 
as genotype D and subtype ayw3. Ten kinds of point mutations were identified 
within the S region. The highest rates of mutation were found in chronic 
hepatitis patients and their family members. The amino acid mutations 125 (M -> 
T) and 127 (T -> P) were found on the first loop of 'a'-determinant. The other 
consequence was mutation inductance in a family member. We found some mutations 
in the S gene region known to be stable and observed that some of these 
mutations affected S gene expression.

Fast and efficient separation of immunoglobulin M from immunoglobulin G using 
short monolithic columns
<p class="Para1">
IgG and IgM are useful in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. IgG are 
monomeric forms of H and L chain pairs having mass of 150 kDa. IgM is a 
pentameric arrangement of H and L chains with mass of about 950 kDa. 
Bacterially derived proteins A and G have been used in affinity-specific 
isolation of IgG.  Pseudo-affinity ligands such as thiophilic ligand and 
bio-mimetic ligands can also be used as alternatives.  In addition, 
precipitation, size-exclusion, ion exchange, hydroxyapatite, and hydrophobic 
interaction chromatography can be used to achieve high purity.  Use of a 
mannan-binding protein as ligand can select for IgM (also thiophilic column such 
as 2-mercaptopyridine). This paper describes use of short ion-exchange 
monolithic columns. Convective interaction media (CIM) stationary phases are 
designd for macromolecule/nanoparticle separations.  They achieve low pressure 
high-flow separations which are suitable for diagnostic purposes.
<p>
A Knauer gradient HPLC system with two K-500 pumps, low dead volume mixing 
chamber, K-2600 UV/Vis detector (response time of 100 ms and 1 cm optical path 
with &lambda; = 230 or 280 nm, 10 &micro;l flow cell, connected to 250 &micro;m 
i.d. PEEK tubing, 20 &micro;l sample loop, with Eurochrom data acquisition were 
used in all experiments.  CIM columns (BIA Separations) with either 
diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) and ethylenediamino (EDA) or quaternary amino (QA) 
ligans were used, 3 &times; 12 mm (340 &micro;l) in dimension.
<p>
Optimal buffer conditions were sought and the best found were a 20 mM phosphate 
or 20 mM MOPS buffer at pH 7.2.  As test protein mixtures, HSA, IgG, and IgM 
preparations were used with a CIM QA monolithic column.  Majority of IgG 
molecules are not retained on QA with any buffer, while IgM are completely 
retained with phosphate and about 50% are retained with MOPS.  HSA is fully
retained with either buffer.  Thus it seems phosphate buffer is best to 
use to achieve IgM/IgG separation on a QA column.
<p>
The pH of the buffer was varied (pH 6.5, 7.2 and 8.0) on a QA column with
the sample being a mix of IgG, HSA, and IgM in a linear 1 M NaCl gradient
with a phosphate loading buffer. IgG elutes in the unbound material while
HSA and IgM elute with the gradient.  The separation of HSA and IgM is 
poor at pH 8.0, and best at pH 6.5, although the pH 7.2 separation is about 
the same.
<p>
Column chemistry was then compared using HSA, IgM and IgG under gradient elution
conditions using QA, DEAE, and EDA columns.  In all three columns IgG was
not retained and IgM and HSA were poorly resolved in QA and DEAE (with pH 7.2
conditions).  The EDA column however provided baseline separation, with HSA
eluting in a narrow peak first and IgM eluting much later in the gradient with
a broad peak.
<p>
Binding capacity of IgM was tested for the three types of columns. The QA and 
DEAE columns had nearly identical characteristics: about 20 mg IgM per ml of 
media, while EDA column had only half that capaciy (9-10 mg/ml).  Capacity was 
also tested on an EDA column at different flow rates on the column, to determine 
if there was a kinetic dependence (rate-limiting binding factor).  Linear flow 
rates of 43, 217, and 866 cm/h were tested, and the breakthrough was all 
identical, so there was no flow rate dependence.  The capacity of IgM in serum 
as opposed to using pure IgM loaded on the column was also tested and was about 
2.25 mg/ml, significantly lower than for the pure material.  In addition the 
slope is not steep, indicating that competing proteins are displacing IgM on the 
column.   Capacities were also determined on all three types of columns by 
diluting serum 1:1, with QA showing better binding capacity at 3.1 mg IgM/ml and 
DEAE and EDA being 1.6 and 1.7 mg IgM/ml, respectively.  While DEAE and EDA are 
identical for the complex sample, DEAE has a 2-fold higher capacity than EDA for 
the pure IgM sample.  This reflects that other proteins competitvely bind IgM. 
A QA CIM column would be more appropriate for a rapid separation of IgM and IgG 
in this case, in order to recover IgG.  But an EDA column would be more 
appropriate for IgM purification if albumin removal (HSA) is also required.

Inital acute infection can find reoccurrence with chronic infection.  Rarely
is the acute a fulminant type with fatal results.  Chronic infection can lead
to cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
<p>
The virion has a 42 nm diameter composed of ~3.2 kb rc DNA in nucleocapsid core
with lipid bilayer envelope studded with different viral glycoproteins.  Stripped
of envelope the nucleocapsid is 27 nm icosahedron made with 240 viral capsid
proteins (core antigen) with one copy of genomic DNA and the polymerase (P)
gene product covalently linked to 5&prime; end of minus (&minus;) strand.
Some cellular host proteins such as chaperones and protein kinases may also be
packaged (see Hu et al EMBO J 16: 59, 1997).  The nucleocapsid becomes 
enveloped by budding from ER membranes, and three glycoproteins L or LHBs, M or
MHBs, and S or SHBs tranlated from different in-frame start codons are in the
envelope.  Multimeric associations of just the SHBs, sometimes complexed with
MHBs, are formed in spherical or filamentous shapes, and these are formed 100-
to 1000-fold more than virions.  It is suspected that these empty multimers
of the S protein are involved in immunoevasion.  If these proteins are detected
in the circulation for &gt; 6 months, it usually indicates chronic infection.
<p>
Viral transmission is usually by blood, sex, and needles, and vertically from
infected mothers, which accounts for most carrier states.  Insect vectors are
suspected of also aiding in transmission.  Infection <i>in vivo</i> might occur
with as few as 100 infectious particles on a contaminated needle.  Dilution
studies with chimpanzees and ducks indicate a single infectious particle can
establish infection.  Attempts to infect cultured cells such as transformed liver
cancer cells and primary human and chimpanzee hepatocytes is very difficult.
However, once achieved, infectious particles can be produced from cultured cells.
This gives rise to suggestions that hepatocyte culture causes a loss of receptors
or other physiological factors not found in vivo.  Transfection of plasmids which
code for competent HBV genomes into hepatoblastoma HepG2 and hepatoma Huh7 cells 
produces and secretes enveloped virions.  These permit study of transcription
and DNA synthesis and assembly and secretion, but it is not possible to study
receptor binding, entry, capsid disassembly, and first round cccDNA formation.
Recently a HepaRG cell lines was described that can be infected with serum-derived
HBV, so this may cover the losses.
<p>
Because HBV creates an RNA intermediate from which it reverse transcribes to make
the DNA genome for the virion, it is an retrovirus.  It has no known oncogenes,
but can cause cancer.   Its replication cycle is shown in the figure below.
<p>
<img src="images/HBV/HBV-replication-cycle.png"
 alt="HBV replication cycle">
<p>
<b>Attachment and entry</b>.  Because HBV does not infect liver-derived cells
in culture, it is clear that these cells have lost the ability to be targets
of infection and the virus requires specific receptors.  The Pre-S1 region
(intact L form of surface antigen, LHBs) is required for receptor binding and
essential for infection.  Peptides derived from PreS1 and coincubated with HBV
in HepaRG cells inhibits infection; control peptides do not.  The virus thus
attached is endocytically taken into the hepatocyte.  The viral capsid is
released into the cytoplasm from the endosome after fusion between viral envelope
and endosomal membranes, which might be triggered by low pH and/or proteolytic
cleavage of envelope protein.
<p>
<b>Viral RC DNA Genome to Nucleus</b>.  In the cytoplasm, the genome must be
brought through nuclear pore complex into the nucleus.  The capsid moves along
microtubules to the nuclear pore.  Viral capsid proteins (core antigen) contains
nuclear localization signals in the C-terminus, which interact with nuclear
import receptors importin &alpha; and &beta;.  Entry into nucleus is cell cycle
dependent (see Yeh et al J Med Virol 55: 42, 1998), occurring in the G<sub>1</sub>
phase.  Disassembly of capsid and release of the genomic DNA probably happens
in nuclear basket of the pore complex.
<p>
<b>cccDNA Formation</b>.  The rcDNA form in the virion must be converted to the
cccDNA form.  The minus strand (non-transcribing) contains the whole genome while
the plus strand is only partial, varying in length and as small as 50% of the full
length.  Moreover, the plus strand has on its 5&prime; end an 18 nt RNA oligo
which probably served as the primer for plus strand synthesis and remains part
of the viral genome.  The steps for completion of plus strand synthesis are not
known.  It is possible that host cellular DNA repair enzymes remove the RNA
primer, fill it the missing plus strand DNA, and then ligate to complete the
circle.  However, the removal of the polymerase would be unusual for host
cellular enzymes.  The deproteinization might be achieved using a nuclease that
is close to 5&prime; end of minus strand, or possibly by a endonuclease or 
hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond between Tyr of polymerase and 5&prime;
phosphate of the minus strand.  Polymerase removal could even occur before
localization in the nucleus.   Retroviruses usually integrate into the host
chromosome before replication, but this does not occur with HBV:  the cccDNA
is a episomal minichromosome.  HOwever, integration may occur and account for 
oncogenesis of the virus.  The cccDNA form is stable indefinitely (in the life
of the hepatocyte); its mutation and repair may account for chronic infection
symtpoms.  With hepatocyte mitosis, cccDNA may be lost to some progeny cells.  
However it can remain dormant against treatments inhbiting its replication and
expression.
<p>
<b>RNA Transcription</b>.  Four transcripts are made from the cccDNA.  One is a 
3.5 kb transcript that is the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) from which virion DNA will 
be reverse-transcribed.  It is also the transcript for the polymerase (P) gene 
and the pre-core antigen (preC) which will make the core (C) and e antigens. 
Another is the 2.4 kb to be processed for large (L) form of the surface antigen, 
a 2.1 kb transcript to be the mRNA for the middle (M) and small (S) forms of the 
antigen, and then a 700 bp transcript for the X protein. These transcriptions 
are shown in the figure below.  No intron processing occurs or other sort of 
modification.  The host RNA polymerase mediates the transcription; more
details can be found in Moolla et al, J Viral Hepat 9: 323, 2002 and 
Henkler et al, J Viral Hepat 3: 109, 1996. 
<p>
<img src="images/HBV/HBV-cccDNA-Transcription.png"
  alt="RNA transcritpion of the cccDNA">
<p>
<b>Translation and Post-Translational Activities</b>.  The PreC mRNA is 
translated to a pre-C form which is then proteolytically processed (by the X 
protein) into a what becomes the HBeAg.  HBeAg is not found in viral or subviral 
particles, but is secreted and elicits antibodies.  Its detection in EIA 
indicates active viral replication at high levels.  Clinically negative results 
on HBeAg assays and positive anti-HBe results indicates evidence of reduced 
viral replication. Alternatively, chronic HBV carriers losing HBeAg do so 
because of mutations in preC region and HBeAg mutant viruses may be more 
patholgenic than other forms. It is essential to do viral DNA tests when an 
HBeAg test goes negative since it may have an unfavorable prognosis.  Suspected 
roles for HBeAg are that it helps in infection or in immunosuppression. 
Reduction of HBeAg may be achieved naturally by the immune system or by drug 
therapy; it is believed that pharmacological control of viral replication to 
reduce HBeAg may aid the immune system in being able to exert antiviral 
suppression than no treatment at all.
<p>
<b>Reverse Transcription of Progeny Genomes</b>.  The P gene (polymerase) 
product covalently associates with the 5&prime; end of the pgRNA, which forms a 
stem-loop structure.  The pgRNA represents the sense (plus, coding) strand of 
the genome. The following steps occur inside an immature nucleocapisd, with the 
polymeras and pgRNA located inside.  The polymerase begins by extending 3 nt to 
start the minus strand synthesis. and nascent DNA then translocate to the 
3&prime; codpy of the direct repeat (DR1). Minus strand synthesis continues on 
the pgRNA strand.   During the minus strand synthesis, the pgRNA is degraded by 
the polymerase using a RNase H activity. Upon reaching the 5&prime; end of 
pgRNA, an RNA primer containing the DR1 seqeunce and 6-7 nt at 5&prime; end of 
DR1 is left undegraded.  This is translocated and annealed to the direct repeat 
2 (DR2), which then primes the plus strand synthesis to produce the final rcDNA.
After rcDNA formation, the capsid coat maturation completes and the envelope
put around it.  In some cases, encapsidated genome is not enveloped, but returned
to the nucleus where the process of cccDNA formation occurs again, possibly 
increasing its levels.  This may be because cccDNA is not replicated by host
DNA synthesis mechanisms; studies with duck HBV indicate that the L envelope
protein regulates intracellular DNA traffic and cccDNA formation in that low
levels of L protein cause encapsidated rcDNA to be forced back to the nucleus.
<p>
<b>Viral Particle Assembly and Secretion</b>.  Capsid assembly and packaging
in the cytoplasm with maturation then leads to budding near the ER membrane.
The three envelope proteins are probably in the ER membrane and attract capsid
to them.  They then hook to the capside and draw the membrane around the capsid.
The ratio of LHBs:MHBs:SHBs is 1:5:100.   The oligomerization of the envelope
polypeptides to form subviral particles probably makes them resistant to 
proteasomes.  Proteasome degradation is a step required for MHC Class I presentation
to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and evading this mechanism may in part be responsible
for chronic infection.  It has been believed that the L protein is essential for
infection and has an external toplogy, but studies may indicate that the PreS1
sequences are membrane- or internally located.  Some of the membrane embedding
may occur because of partial membrane translocation of pre-S domain during
particle assembly and ER budding into lumen.  Some Pre-S domains may be docking
sites for the capsid and needed for assembly and budding.  The myristylation of
the LHBs form has been shown necessary for viral assembly, but not for infection.
The role of the MHBs form is not well understood since it is not found in duck
HBV, and is not required for secretion.
<p>
With other retroviruses, DNA intermediates are used to generate single-stranded
RNA genomes.  But with hepadnaviruses the rcDNA form is the genome, although
the cccDNA generates the pgRNA which becomes each genome.  It has been shown
that encapsidated pgRNA cannot be enveloped and budded out.  This is because the
capsid is not processed to maturation unless the rcDNA form has been produced.
The signals of capsid maturation may be related to phosphorylation.  In the 
duck HBV, capsid proteins are phosphorylated (although heterogeenously) when
intracellular, but those in virions are dephosphorylated.  With the completion
of rcDNA formation, a dephosphorylation may occur, signaling that the capsid
can be bound to envelope proteins.  One complication is that there are large
number of empty capsids, so dephosphorylation may not depend on rcDNA formation.
If pgRNA is present, this may inhbit dephosphorylation.  If no pgRNA is present,
either because rcDNA was formed, or the capsid is empty, it can occur.
<p>
<b>Chronic infections and how they occur</b>.  1-5% of adults and 90% of infected
neonates fail to show an immune response. They develop lifelong infections.
Both humoral and cytotoxic responses have been shown in productive immune
responses.  Other than cytotoxic killing of infected hepatocytes, cytokines
such as IFN-&gamma; and TNF may also be used to stop infection.  The chronic
infection state may be related to inadequate T cell response, both in numbers
and types of T cells.  HBV has elements that enable it to not activate innate
and adaptive response genes as HCV does.  One possiblility is that HBV envelope
proteins aggregate and are not retrotranslocated back to the cytoplasm from the
ER lumen via the translocon pores (size limits of 10 nm or less), so they would
not be processed by proteasomes to elicit MHC I class immunity.  These products
become lipoproteins which are resistant to ER-associated degradation.  All this
may indicate the poor CTL response.  Thus it appears that there is an immune 
tolerance.
<p>
<b>Oncogenesis in chronic infections</b>.  Worldwide there are a half million
death each year due to HCC, third leading cause of cancer death and fifth most
common cancer.  This is usually due to combined HBV/HCV infection.  Studies of
tumor cells seem to indicate HBV integration into the host genome near cellular
proto-oncogenes.  A role for the X protein may be involved.  Although its function
is not completely understood, it is required for <i>in vivo</i> infection, althoug
not for replication or expression.  Transgenic mice given the X protein are 
predisposed to develop liver cancer.  The protein may be involved in the
trans-activation of cellular gene functions:  c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, EDG and 
MHC I, although it is not a DNA-binding protein.  It may bind to other host
cellular proteins involved with gene expression.  The X protein can interact with
the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) involved in the PI3K-Akt
signaling, and also with p53 and proteins that control DNA damage repair and
degradation.  HBV envelope proteins may also play a role in oncogenesis:  large
concentration of L protein in ER have been associated with fulminant severe acute
disease and with predisposition to transformation.  A truncated form of the M
protein also appears to activate the c-raf-1/ERK2 signal pathway.  A more likely
case is that chronic infection may create an enviromment in which host factors
lead to transformation:  mitogenesis is stimulated more than usual, and the 
buildup of errors in replication may lead to aberrant proliferative cells.
<p>
<b>Vaccination, Serology, Genotype</b>.  Current vaccines make use of a 
recombiant form expressed in yeast.  A series of three injections confirms 
long-term immunity.  The <i>a</i> determinant is defined by two loops of 
amino acids between positions 120-163, recognized in commercial assays and
neutralizing antibodies.  Natural variations in sequence define 
subdetrminants as either <i>d</i> or <i>y</i> and <i>r</i> or <i>w</i>.
Mutations in the <i>a</i> determinant region would complicate many detection
assays or vaccinations.
<p>
<b>Treatments</b>.  Current treatments are the usual antiviral medications,
IFN-&alpha; and use of nucleotide or nucleoside analogues.  IFN-&alpha;
stops the assembly of pgRNA capsid assembly in studies with mouse hepatocyte-derived
cell lines.  Interestingly it only modestly inhibits HBV replication in human
hepatoma cell lines.  Some genotypes (like C) resistant IFN-&alpha; more than
others.  A nearly year-long (48 wk) treatment can reduce viral load 30-40% and 
cause HBeAg conversion.  As for nucleoside analogues, lamivudine (Epivir),
entecavir (Baraclude), and telbivudine (Tyzeka) and the nucleotide analogue
adefovir (Hepsera) are FDA approved for chronic HBV infection.  Their mode of
action is premature chain termination of viral DNA synthesis.  In addition 
drug resistance is emerging.
<p>
An interesting thing about HBV is that all transcripts are from one sense 
strand, all the reading frames are used, and the genes overlap each other.
The coding region for the polymerase gene overlaps the envelope and X genes.
The X gene also overlaps with the start of the pre-core transcript.  Mutations
in the polymerase have altered amino acids in the envelope protein.  The effect
of this is uncertain.  The figure below shows how overlapping genes occur in the
genome.

?Laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in TB and HIV endemic settings
and the contribution of real time PCR for <i>M. tuberculosis</i> in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
<p class="Para1">
This study looks at HIV and TB in an endemic setting to compare different
laboratory methods: AFB smear, culture, real time PCR, and using sputum and
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and teh MycoDot serological test (Mossman
Associates)> All patients showed signs and symptoms of chest infection. 120 HIV
patients in Kilimanjaro Tanzania with a respiratory problem were and had
received therapy for pneumonia provided sputum samples. Multiple tests were
done to assess their states. Bronchoscopy included lavage collection.
Decontamination with 4% NaOH and then centrifugation was done. 200 &micro;l of
BAL sample was treated with MagNA Pure Isolation station using Total Nucleic
Acid Isolation kit (Roche), with 50 &micro;l final volume, of which 10 &micro;l
was used in PCR. The target was the IS6110 element (Savelkoul et al, 2006)
using sense primer 5&prime;-GGGTAGCAGACCTCACCTATGTG-3&prime; and antisense
primer 5&prime;-CCTTTGTCACCGACGCCTA-3&prime; to produce an 88 bp amplicon.
The probe had a minor groove-binding agent that was FAM-labeled:
5&prime;-TCGCCTACGTGGCCTTT-3&prime;.   Amplification was in 30 &micro;l using
and ABi PRISM 7700.  Primer was 333 nM, probe was 150 nM.  An internal
control MSM1008 was also amplfied by the same primer set, but the probe is a
VIC-labeled TAMRA oligo:  5&prime;-CAGCTGCTACATGCCGGCGC-3&prime;.
<p>
The several tests were performed on each sample and the series produced a set
of both positive or negative results.  With a <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> value of
40 as the cutoff threshold for PCR positive-negative results in a test with
45 cycles, 73 samples were scored positive.  27 of these were culture-positive,
42 wer culture-negative and 4 were contaminated.  One culture-positive was
PCR-negative, and 46 samples were negative by both culture and PCR.  PCR with
respect to culture is 96.4% sensitive and 52.3% specific.  If the
<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> cutoff is 32, then sensitivity is 85.7% and specificity
is 90.9%.  For the 27 BAL TB culture-positive cases the <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>
median is 24 (interquartile range: 22-32) and for the 42 BAL TB culture-negative
cases the <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> median = 35 (IQR: 34-37), a difference significant by
Spearman's correlation coefficient).  For 17 AFB smear-positives cases the
<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> median was 24 (IQR: 22-27);  and for 56 negative cases
median <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> = 35 (IRQ: 32-37).  IN 25 or the 28 BAL MTB-positive
culture spoligotyping showed all 25 belong to MTBC; 16 had different pattersns
with two patterns found in two strains, and one pattern in three strains, and one
pattern in five strains.  Six of 28 samples were rapid growers in culture
(&lt; one month).
<p>
46 patients were PCR-postive and culture-negative.  14 of these had been put
on anti-TB treatment before PCR results were known (3 of these had died).
<p>
BAL samples may have a higher sensitivity than sputum and should be preferred.

Chap 1 Forensic Science: Scope and Perspective.  Forensic science is the application
of scientific knowledge to legal problems according to Webster.  Criminalistics
is forensic science pertaining to criminal matters.  Forensic science is about
<b>physical evidence</b> which is largely what this book is about.  <b>Locard's
Exchange Principle</b> states the testing of associative evidence is that every
time someone enters an environment something is added or removed from it.  Locard
was among the first (in the 1920s) to understand the value of physical evidence.
<b>Inceptive evidence</b> is that which shows whether or not a crime has been
committed;  it does not always provide indentification or associative evidence.
<b>Identification evidence</b> is physical evidence that identifies a person:
fingerprints and DNA are of that kind.  Firearms and questioned documents are
also identifying:  not of a person, but of a weapon, or perhaps the devices used
to create documents.  <b>Associative</b> evidence is that which links a person
or object to some effect or conditon.  When evidence does not provide exclusion
of a association, it might be <b>corroborative evidence</b>, supporting testimonial
or other physical evidence.  At the <b>crime scence</b>, standard procedures
are followed:
<ul>
<li>Protection of the scene against contamination degradation, loss of evidence
 <ul>
 <li>Crime scene personnel might wear special clothing and gear (Tyvek paper
suits, mouth masks, hair nets, latex/nitrile gloves, sleeve protectors, shoe
covers.
 </ul>
<li>Documentation:  photography, videography, crime scene sketches, laser-computer
assisted surveying; knowing the relationships of objects to each other spatially.
<li>Systematic search for identification and collection of relevant evidence:
common patterns are the spiral out from a focal point or lanes for dividing
scene as a lateral or lengthwise segments.
 <ul>
 <li>Smaller outdoor or indoor scenes (house) might be searched by areas or
rooms, starting from perimeter access point.
 <li>Vehicle searches might be on-site (at scene) or after transport to garage
or workshop.  Even a minimal on-site search should be done before transport.
 </ul>
<li>Collection:  biological samples collected dry or placed in paper bags;
do not place in plastic (molds form).  Weapons handling must be such that no
accidental discharge of firearms occurs.  <b>Evidence bags</b> are made of plastic
and are suitable for everything but biologicals; bags have tamper-evident tape
and chain-of-custody forms.
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Most fragile evidence should be collected first after photography.
<li>Fingerprints are then collected.
<li>Small and microscopic items are then collected.
</ol>
<p>
Forensic laboratory services are delivered on a jurisdictional basis.  Most
criminal or forensic sciences fall under control of municipal police or
county sheriff departments.  Some are under control of prosecutor offices, while
others are part of medical examiner or coroner's offices. Forensic
crime/science laboratories are urged to be accredited, certified, or tested
for proficiency for quality assurance.  Accreditation is offered using the
ISO 17025-based system through the American Society of Crime Laboratory
Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB).  Forensic Quality Services
is an international program founded in 1999 that also offers accreditation.
The American Board of Forensic Toxicology offers certification for toxicology
laboratories, while the National Association of Medical Examiners does the same
for medical examiners.  Certification is more for individuals than for laboratories
or organizaitons, and so the American Board of Criminalistics provides certification
programs.  Proficiency testing can also verify whether a laboratory is operating
properly:  blind samples or cases are presented and the laboratory asked to
go through the motions to provide evidence.
<p>Section II:  Pattern Evidence
<p>Chapter 2:  Introduction to Pattern Evidence:  Tool Marks and Impressions.
<b>Class characteristics</b> is a kind of physical evidence showing identifying
traits shared by a group of similar objects.  <b>Individual characteristics</b>
is physical evidence showing identifying traits unique to a specific object
and distinguish it from other members of the class.  Newly manufactured shoes
might all show the same pattern evidence, but over time, the wearers of the shoes
create wear patterns that can identify a particular shoe from others made by
its class.  In working up individual characteristics for identification, the
investigator will make use of a known sample (<i><b>exemplar</b></i>) to show
class characteristics, but the unique features identify the particular sample.
Note that the conclusions of these studies are called <q>opinions.</q>  These
conclusions of the investigator are at three levels:
<ol>
<li>identification:  criminalist has sufficient data to associate the evidence
with specific person or object
<li>inconclusive:  there is insufficient data to identify or exclude a person
or object with evidence
<li>exclusion:  sufficient evidence shows that a person or object is not
associated (exclude) with the evidence
</ol>
<p>
<b>Tool Marks</b>.  These are artifacts left from tool:  might be impression,
scrape, or cut.  It might be 2- or 3-dimensional.  Ink from rubber stamp is
a positive 2-D impression.  A negative 2-D impression is when a shoe removes
wax from a freshly waxed floor.  3D tool marks are positive impressions casued
by different actions:
<ul>
<li>compression marks are caused by tools pressed into softer material
<li>sliding markes are tools scraped across a surface
<li>cut marks are deep compressions combined with sliding
</ul>

Microfluidics and Their Applications to Lab on a Chip
<p class="Para1">
Microfluidics is science of fluidic behaviors on micro/nanoscale and design
engineering, simulation and fabricatins of fluidic devices for transport,
delivery and handling of fluids on order of microliters or smaller.
It is backbone of biological/biomedical microelectromechanicals systems
(BioMEMS).   A 100 &micro;m<sup>3</sup> (0.1 mm<sup>3</sup>) is 1 nanoliter.
<p>
<b>Materials for Device and Micro/Nanofabrication Techniques</b>.
<b>Silicon</b> is very popular for the following properties:
<ul>
<li>ease of micromachining
<li>good mechanical properties
<li>excellent chemical resistance
<li>well-characterized processing techniques
</ul>
<p>
Microfluidic channels in silicon formed by either wet (chemical) or dry
(plasma) etching.  The rate of etching of crystalline silicon is
slowest for the &lang;111&rang; crystalline plane, with a 100:1 etch rate
anisotropy compared to &lang;100&rang;:&lang;111&rang; or
&lang;110&rang;:&lang;111&rang;.   With isotropic etching, the profile is
semi-circular, with long-term anisotropic etching, it is triangular, and with
short-term it is trapezoidal.  KOH, tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH), and
ethyleen diamine pyrocatechol (EDP) are anisotropic etchants.  SiO<sub>2</sub> and
Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (silicon nitride) can be used as masks.
Isotropic etchants include a mixture of HF, HNO<sub>3</sub> and
CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, the <q>HNA</q> etchant.  <b>Reactive ion etching</b> (RIE)
is a dry etching process to make channels and deep trench structures on
silicon:  radiofrequency energy excites ions in a gas to an excited state
(plasma).  RIE can generate isotropic and anisotropic profiles.
<p>
<b>Glass</b> is also used as a substrate as it has excellent opticla transparency
and creates electro-osmotic flow (EOF).   Chemical wet etchants for glass
include HF, buffered HF, and HF/HNO<sub>3</sub>/dH<sub>2</sub>O mixtures.
Gold with chrome adhhesion layer often used as a mask.  Only isotropic etch
profiles are obtained because glass is not crystalline: hemispherical-shaped
channels.  Pre-etching is done with glass to release stress in the structure
that can cause etching artifacts in glass.  Channel etching can also be
improved by annealing glass wafers prior to etching.  Anisotropy has also been
introduced into glass by making glass photosensitive using lithium/aluminum/silicates
in the composition.  Chips for capillary electrophoresis are among the most
successful with glass subtrates.
<p>
<b>Plastic polymers</b> provide low cost, ease of fabrication, and favorable
biochemical reliablility and compatibility.  Polyimide, poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA), poly(methyl siloxane) (PDMS), polyethylene, and polycarbonate provide
wide range of physical and chemical parameters.  Casting, hot embossing, and
injection molding are fabrication processes.  Mold masters must be made to
produce good replicates.  Photolithography, silicon/glass bulk etching and
metal electroplating have been used for mold master production.  Photolithography
includes LIGA (German words Lithografie, Galvanoformung, and Abformung for
lithography, electroforming, and molding) and UV-LIGA which are used to fabricate
mold masters for hot embossing replication.  Electroplated metallic mold masters
are preferred for injection molding.  Casting or soft lithography with a
poly(methyl siloxane) (PDMS) offers flexible access to microfluidic structures.
Elastomer precursor and curing agent are poured over master mold; after curing
replicated elastomer is released from mold master, transferring reverse structure
of mold master.  Casting can be done at room temp, and hot embossing up to
a hotter temperature which is glass transition temp of plastic substrate to
be replicated.  In hot embossing, mold master is placed in chamber of hot
embossing system with plastic substrate, and heated plates press the plastic
substrate and mold master.  After 5-20 min (depends on plastic substrate), plates
are cooled to release replicate plastic.  With injection molding, polymer
microstructures are fabricated at low cost and high volume.  Plastic in granular
form is filled into the mold and melted in cavity where mold master is.  The
system is cooled down and the plastic ejected.  Plastic with low or medium
viscosity are preferred to ensure good flow in filling the mold.  Factors influencing
the injection molding process are plastic viscosity, injection speed, molding
block temperature, and nozzle temperature.  Cycle time is several seconds for
most applications.  Metallic mold masters recommended because of high shear
force on mold master.  PMMA, PE, PS, PC, and cyclic olefin copolymers (COC) are
common for hot embossing and injection molding.

Microfluidic devices include the basic structures of valves, pumps, mixers, and
so on.  These devices are classed as active or passive.  Passive devices are
easier to fabricate, but don't have same functional diversity.  Passive
microvalves based on surface tension can operate a few times to hold liquid
acceptable for disposable format.  Passive check valves depend on pressure of
the fluid.
<p>
<b>Microvalves</b>.  Active microvalves are valves that deal with either liquid
or gas as fluid; are composed of many materials such as silicon, polysilicon,
glass, and polymer; use air (pneumatics), heat (thermopneumatic), electrostatic
mechanisms and more; and have different constructions of the valves, such
membrane, flap, ball and other types.  Pneumatic type use an external air line
to actuate a flexible diaphragm, and it has high force and displacement and
rapid response time.  Schomburg et al. gave a good demonstration of such a
valve.  Hosokawa et al have shown a 3-way microvalve on PDMS platform.  The
microfluidics and pneumatic channels are made on separate layers.  With
thermopneumatic actuation, a confined cavity containing a fluid (usually gas)
is heated to close the valve, often a membrane-type.  While slower, it produces
better forces than other types.  Many substrates and diaphragm materials have been
used.  With electrostatic actuation, structures are simple and easy to fabricate,
but issues such as stiction and release problems of membranes and valve flaps
must be addressed.  The membrane design of Sato et al uses a propagation of
deflection throughout the membrane rather than deforming it.  An S-shaped
design allows relatively large gaps across two surfaces, as the electrostatic
force need only be concentrated at the edges of the S-shape where the membrane
is deflected.  With piezoelectric actuation it is more difficult since they are
more challenging to put into MEMS devices.  Watanabe et al and Stehr et al showed
piezoelectric actuators for valve applications.  Piezoelectric material is
deposited as a film on movable membrane, and then a voltage potential is applied
to create a small deformation in the piezo film which is transmitted to valve
membrane.  With electromagnetic actuators, a high force and range of motion is
possible.  Electromagnetic microvalves are insensitive to external interference.
The drawback is a complex fabrication process.  Soft electromagnetic material
such as NiFe (permalloy) is the membrane layer, while an external electromagnet
actuates the layer.  Other actuation schemes for microvalves include the use
of shape memory alloys (SMA), electrochemical actuation.  When the SMA is heated
to original state, it can generate very large forces.  Neagu et al have also
presented an electrochemically actuated microvalve.  The electrolysis generates
oxygen in confined chamber which is sealed by deformable membrane which becomes
deflected in the increased pressure.  Yoshida et al had a novel microvalve
design, which is a micro-electrorheological valve: an electrorheological fluid
is loaded into the microchannel and an electric field applied to change the
ER fluid viscosity considerably.  When the electric field is applied perpendicular
to the flow direction the viscosity is increased.  With higher viscosity the
flow rate drops, allowing ER fluid to act as a valve.  See Kovacs for ideal
characteristics of a microvalve.
<p>
<b>Micropumps</b>. Efficient and reliable micropumps development is a
challenging task. Peristaltic, vacuum-driven, Venturi-effect pumps exist on the
macroscale. In the microscale, most mechanical pumps put pressure on the fluid
to force it through the system. Practical vacuum pumps are not available on
microscale. Electro-osmotic pumping is only available on a microscale.
Generally mechanical micropumps can be classified as check valve-controlled
microvalves or diffuser pumps. Either mechanism can use actuation schemes such
as electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and so on. There are
micropumps driven by direct electrical controll and are a different category.
The typical mechanical micropump has a pump set between inlet and outlet check
valves to prevent fluid return. The pump is a chamber with deformable membrane
that deflects to create low pressure to draw fuild in, and returns to original
state to drive fluid out the outlet in a pumping cycle. Jeon et al created a
pump with PDMS flap valves. Koch etl, Cao et al, Park et al have shown how to
create piezolectrically driven micropumps. Xu et al and Makino et al present
shape memory alloy-driven micropumps. Chou et al present a novel rotary pump
with soft lithography approach. Valves can be created on a PDMS layer with
separate liquid and air layers. Pressure on the air lines causes membranes to
deflect and seal fluidic path. By implementing a series of valves in a loop,
with deflections in a set sequence, liquid in the ring is pumped by peristaltic
motion.

Specific versus Nonspecific Isothermal DNA Amplification through Thermophilic
Polymerase and Nicking Enzyme Activities
<p class="Para1">
Isothermal nucleic acid amplification includes nucleic acid sequence-based
amplification (NASBA, Compton, Nature 350: 91, 1991), transcription-mediated
amplification (TMA, Hill, Expert Rev Mol. Diag 1: 445, 2001),
strand-displacement amplification (SDA, McCartney et al, Br. J. Biomed Sci.
58: 235, 2001), loop-mediated amplification (LAMP: Notomi et al, NAR 28: e63,
2000; Nagamine et al, Clin Chem 47: 1742, 2001), rolling circle amplification
(RCA: Demidov, Expert Rev Mol. Diag. 2: 242, 2002), helicase-dependent
amplification (HDA: An et al, J. Biol. Chem. 280: 28952, 2005; Vincent et al,
EMBO Rep. 5: 795, 2004). and exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR:
Van Ness et al, PNAS 100: 4504, 2003; Tan et al, Anal Chem 77: 7984, 2005;
Tan et al, Clin Chem 53: 2017, 2007).    Most of these methods take 30 min to
several hours whereas EXPAR does 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>9</sup>-fold amplification
of short oligos in minutes.  The short oligo ix Trigger X and can be generated
from genomic target.  Trigger X primes the amplification template consisting
of two repeats of the complementary X&prime; with a 9-nt separation for the
nicking enzyme substrate and cleavage site.  Trigger X can be generated from
the genomic DNA by a reaction called Fingerprinting:  this is single-strand
nicking at adjacent nicking enyme recognition sites within the genome, followed
by polyermase extension and linear amplification.  The Fingerprinting reaction
occurs in same mastermix and under same conditions as EXPAR and generates
trigger oliogs specific for target DNA.  Visual detection (color-based) can be
achieved by coupling a two-stage EXPAR with DNA nanosphere aggregation.
Proof of principle was shown by coupling trigger generation by fingerprinting
with 2-stage EXPAR and visual detection with functionalized gold nanospheres,
using recombinant plasmid with insert containing fingerprint size derived from
HSV-1 genomic DNA.  One problem with EXPAR is non-specific amplification in
absence of trigger, making limit of detection high.  To characterize the product
of nonspecific amplification, this study uses MS, gel electrophoresis, and
DNA sequencing.  Results show novel DNA synthesis by polymerase which is a feature
of EXPAR design.
<p>
<b>Mamp;M</b>.  Nt.BstNBI nicking enzyme, <i>Bst</i> large fragment polymerase,
thermopol buffer, nicking buffer are from NEB.  Other chemicals from other vendors.
Template and trigger oligo sequences are given in supplemental Table 1; 3&prime;
ends are capped with amino-C6 blocking group.  Standard A and Ran2 templates
were synthesized both capped and uncapped:  also obtained desalted, and once-
and twice-HPLC-purified.  Randomer templates (Ran1-Ran24) were once-HPLC purified.
Triggers were ordered from MWG to avoid cross contamination with IDT oligos.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  The intercalating fluorescent reagent SYBR Green II was used to
track double-stranded synthesis by the polymerase.  Normally SYBR Green II is
a single-stranded RNA stain, its intensity also increases when bound to dsDNA
also.  Fluorescence intensity changes are sigmoidal during amplification while
partial or complete synthesis forms the double strands.  The point of inflection
in the curve has a similar determination of amplification as the threshold cycle
in real-time PCR.  There is a linear correlation between the time at point of
inflection and the log [trigger] over a dilution series from 10 pM to 1 fM.
Background amplification also occurs in no-trigger controls and appear dependent
on mastermix composition and the template sequence.  On the possibility that
background amplification was caused DNA or RNA contaminant sequences priming
the reaction, enzymes and mastermix included DNase or RNase A which were activated
before the reaction, but this had no effect on eliminating amplification.  EXPAR
was also done with 60 ng human genomic DNA present, either intact high MW ds
form or sheared from cycles of heating (95&deg;), freezing (&minus;80&deg;),
and sonication:  but the presence of sheared (avg length 200 bp, with distribution
from 100-500 b) or intact high MW DNA was not a factor.
<p>
Another possibility is that the 3&prime; end of the template itself is the source
of amplification. forming template dimers (primer-dimer type) as with PCR.
As the template is 3&prime;-amine capped to avoid this, the yield is still only
99.0-99.5%, leaving template that is uncapped.  Experiments were done to look at
capped and uncapped templates, both HPLC purified:  the uncapped would be expected
to accelerate background amplification, but results showed no statistically
significant difference.  Comparisons of template purity (desalted vs. once-only
HPLC vs. twice-HPLC-purified) showed that there is only a minor effect.
<p>
Interestingly nonspecific amplification shows two phases:  an early phase
observed within 5-10 min which interferes with specific trigger generation
an amplification, and a late phase appearing after &ge; 20 min and depending
on template sequence and mastermix composition, and results in final intensity
that is much larger than the early phase of background amplification.  The late
phase amplification does not interfere with specific amplification; specific
amplification in presence of trigger with most suitable templates occurs in &lt;
10 min even for low trigger X copy numbers.
<p>
EXPAR templates were synthesized containing at the 3&prime; or 5&prime; ends
different or same trigger complement sequences (X&prime; or Y&prime;).  These
were joined by the correct complement of Nt.BstNBI followed by a 4-nt <i>r</i>
spacer or a scrambled (<i>s</i>) version of <i>r</i>.   Mixtures with
X&prime;rX&prime; or Y&prime;rY&prime; following the EXPAR design rules show both
early and late phase amplification.  Templates with X&prime;rY&prime; or
Y&prime;rX&prime; structures do not have early phase background amplification,
nor do templates having repeated triggers but having scrambled nicking recognition
site X&prime;sX&prime; or Y&prime;s&prime;.  This proves background amplification
depends both on the repeated sequence triggers and the nicking enzyme recognition
site.  However, the non-repeat + nicking template and the repeat+scrambled templates
did show late phase background amplification.  It is clear that for late phase
background amplification only mastermix with polymerase, nicking enzyme, and
dNTPs are necessary, without template or other oligos.  There is no amplification
of the mastermix has only polymerase and dNTPs, so it is not the case that
template-free synthesis occurs.
<p>
Trigger-template sequences SNP1-SNP10 are based on an original X&prime;-X&prime;
template Standard A:  these each had one base change at each position of the
10 bp trigger complement within the template.  Other templates Ran1 to Ran24
are made from trigger complements and postrecognition site spacer sequences
derived using random sequence generator.  An additional T is added in all cases
in the trigger complement located in the 3&prime; part adjacent to the nicking
enzyme recognition site, so that a 3&prime;-A because of TdT activity in some
polymerases (not true of <i>Bst</i> polymerase however).

Structure and Mechanics of Integrin-Based Cell Adhesion
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Integrin-based cell adhesion plays roles in formation and remodeling
of tissues and organs in multicellular organisms.  Integrins bind
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by a large ectodomain, and their short
cytoplasmic tails connect with the intracellular cytoskeleton.  The cytoskeleton
will control affinity and avidity of integrin ectodomain and modulate the ECM,
and the ECM binding will change shape and composition of cytoskeleton.  The forces
generated on either side of the membrane are transduced.  Integrin-dependent
adhesions includ focal complexes/podosomes, focal adhesions, and fibrillar
adhesions, and vary with cell type, matrix, and integrin.  High affinity integrin-based
focal complexes form into protrusive lamellepodia in motile cells.

Molecular Dissection of the Human &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-Macroglobulin Subunit 
Revelas Domains with Antagonistic Activites in Cell Signaling
<p class="Para1">
The conformational change that occurs with &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin 
(a2M) upon protease interaction also exposes access of its binding site for the 
endocytic receptor LRP-1, to which it interacts and is cleared from bloodstream. 
a2M also carries TGF-&beta; (TGF-B), PDGF-&beta;&beta; (PDGF-BB), nerve growth 
factor-&beta; (NGF-B), and neurotrophin-4.  These interactions are reversible: 
it can modulate growth factor action by inhibition or releasing it.  The 
LRP-1/a2M complex may also be a cell signaling.  a2M may also bind to 
glucose-regualted protein-78 (Grp 78). a2M shares extensive homology with 
complement C3, and thus has multiple independently folded domains.  Previously 
GST-fusion of overlapping segments of a2M subunit were constructed.  Fusion 
protein-3 (FP3) was of residues 591-774 and is involved in growth factor 
binding.  FP6 has residues 1242-1451 and contains LRP1 binding:  the 
&alpha;-helix containing Lys-1370 and Lys-1374 are important.  Mutagenesis of 
full-length a2M subunit confirms these activities.
<p>
GST fusion constructs a2M segments containing domain or functional features were 
FP3 (aa 591-774: growth factor binding), FP4 (aa 775-1059), and FP6 (aa 
1242-1451: LRP-1 binding); transfected into host BL21.  Extracts were 
fractionated using detergents and purified on GST-Sepharose.  FP6 was 
radioiodinated using Iodo-Beads to specific activity of 2.5 &micro;Ci/&micro;g. 
PEA-10 and MEF-2 cells are cultured in 24-well plates until nearly confluent 
(the former express LRP-1, the latter do not). Cells are washed in Earle's 
Balanced Salt Solution buffered with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5 + 1.0 mg/ml BSA, and 
then equilibrated in it.  <sup>125</sup>I-FP6 at 0.1 nM is incubated 4&deg; for 
4 h with or without 50 nM FP6 or 200 nM GST-RAP, and then washed with 
supplemented Earle's twice, then once with Earle's alone. Incorporated 
radioactivity is extracted with 0.1 M NaOH + 1% SDS.  Six experiments were set 
up:  For the PEA-10 and MEF-2 cells, they were incubated alone with labeled FP6 
(5 nM), or with excess (50 nM) of unlabeled FP6, or with GST-RAP (0.2 &micro;M), 
which also competes with binding for LRP-1.  Counts were low in 5 of the 
experiments:  in all MEF-2 cells, which have no LRP-1, and in PEA-10 cells with 
excess unlabeled FP6 (which competes with labeled), and with the presence of 
RAP, which also competes with FP6 to bind LRP-1.  FP6 was also mapped by trypsin 
digestion on SDS-PAGE:  trypsin was added to 0.5 &micro;M (40:1 mol/mol) and 
inactivated using pNPGB after times 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 min (the 0 min contains 
pNPGB before trypsin was added).  The construct in a control lane shows a 53 kDa 
band which is quite pure.  A major fragment was seen at 24 kDa, which was 
trypsin-resistant and could indicate a highly ordered compact structure not 
exposing proteolytic sites.  An anti-a2M polyclonal Ab (Dako) detects both 
intact FP6 and the 24 kDa band on western.
<p>

The silencing of LRP-1 in Schwann cells leads to decreases in basal level of Akt 
activation, presumably by inhibiting autocrine signalling pathways involving 
endogenously produced LRP-1 ligands.  Does a2M by binding LRP-1 and 
internalizing as a complex activate Akt and ERK/MAP kinase?  Its activation may 
be due to transpot of growth factors rather than intrinsic complexing with 
internalized LRP-1.  Since FP6 binds but does not carry growth factors, it was 
compared to activated (by methylamine) a2M.  Schwann and PC12 cells were treated 
50 nM MA-a2M, or varying concentrations (50-200 nM) FP6 for 10 min (control is 
serum-free medium alone). Additional controls include 0.1 &micro;g/ml PDGF-BB or 
1 nM Epo (positive controls) or 50 nM FP4 (negative) for Schwann cells, while 
PC12 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml NGF-B or 50 nM FP4.  Cell protein extracts 
are then analyzed by western using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling 
Technologies) to phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), phosphorylated ERK/MAP kinase 
(pERK), total ERK/MAP kinase, total Akt, and &beta;-actin  (Sigma mAb, as a 
control), with three replicated experiments.  Blots show that both FP6 and MA-a2M
were shown to activate Akt in Schwann cells; control Epo and PDGF-BB also activated
Akt.  FP4 did not activate Akt, showing it to be an adequate negative control.
As for ERK/MAP, FP6, MA-a2M, Epo, and PDGF-BB all activated ERK/MAP kinase in
Schwann cells, but FP4 has no effect.  FP6 also activate Akt and ERK/MAP in 
PC12 cells, as did MA-a2M and NGF-B control, with FP4 having no effect.
<p>
To determine if FP6 acts through LRP-1, instead of independently or by other 
receptors (Grp 78 or TrkA [NGF receptor]), several approaches were tried.  An 
FP6 form in which the two important Lys residues are converted to Ala, shown to 
be essential for LRP-1 binding, was shown not to lead to Akt and ERK 
phosphorylation in either Schwann or PC12 cells.  GST-RAP fusion will also 
competitively bind LRP-1 without causing Akt or ERK/MAP kinase phosphorylation.
Preincubating GST-RAP 15 min before addition of FP6 or MA-a2M effectively
inhibited the phosphorylation of the Akt and ERK/MAPK targets in both Schwann
and PC12 cells (see figure 4 for details).  Finally Schwann cells were transfected
with a rat LRP-1-specific siRNA L2 (5&prime;-CGAGCGACCUCCUAUCUUUUU-3&prime;) or 
pooled non-targeting control (NTC) siRNA (Dharmacon):  FP6 treatment did not
lead to Akt or ERK/MAPK phosphorylation in these transfected Schwann cells.
Epo- and PDGF-BB-treated cells showed phosphorylation, since they function
not through LRP-1.  With NTC siRNA-transfected cells, FP6 treatment led to
phosphorylation, indicating that siRNA specific for LRP-1 inhibited expression
was involved.  All these results demonstrate that FP6 alone (not growth factor
bound) works through LRP-1 to induce signaling.
<p>
With the growth factor binding domain subclone FP3, PC12 cells were serum-starved,
and then tested with different mixtures and agonists.  When cells were
treated with NGF-B, FP6, NGF-B + FP6(K&rarr;A), and FP6 + FP3, phosphorylation
of Akt and ERK/MAPK was seen.  In serum-free medium, FP4, FP6(K&rarr;A),
FP3, and FP3 + NGF-B, no phosphorylation is observed.  Note that FP3 was
incubated 15 min at 37&deg; with either FP6 or NGF-B prior to these mixtures
being used to treat the cells.  These results show that FP3 blocked the activity
of NGF-B, and it might be concluded that FP3 binds in a way to inhibit this
activity.  See Fig 5 for details on concentrations/method.
<p>
PC12 cells that are stimulated through ERK/MAPK or Akt show neuronal differentiation
and neurite outgrowth.  These were incubated FP6, FP3, FP3 + NGF-B, and NGF-B
alone in serum-free medium for 48 h.  With FP6 and NGF-B, neurite outgrowth is
observed, but not with FP3 alone nor FP3 preincubated with NGF-B, which again
blocks the stimulation by NGF-B.
<p>
PC12 cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 5 h and were then treated with
control medium, NGF-B, NGF-B + FP3, FP3, or FP6 for 4 h and 8 h.  Total RNA
was extracted, and expression of GAP-43 mRNA determined using qPCR, with
both time periods analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's posthoc test.
Results show FP6 stimulated GAP-43 expression significantly at a magnitude
greater than for NGG-B.  FP3 had no effect but was able to block NGF-B stimulation.
<p>
GST fusion constructs can form dimers.  A dimeric FP6 could permit crosslinking
of LRP-1 to Grp 78 as a coreceptor, or linking another LRP-1 as a homodimer.
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of a2M is an 18 kDa long segment that can be
purified according to an established method

Novel Wide-Range Quantitative Nested Real-Time PCR Assay for <i>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</i> DNA: Development and Methodology&Del;
<p class="Para1">
This follows up on the QNRT-PCR method developed earlier.  The improvement here
is to increase the range of quantitation and to include a new internal control
for use as a calibrator.  (See the Takahashi and Nakayama 2006 paper above).
<p>
Two standard curves and a new internal control characterize the improvement
in this assay.  The standard curve plots <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> value vs.
log of copy number of the plasmid standards to high precision for quantitating
copy numbers of unknowns.  PCR efficiency can be calculated from these standard
curves as 10<sup>(&minus;1/slope)&minus;1</sup>.  For the assay done here,
this was 99.7 and 101.8% for the two std curves.
<p>
Two parameters can be optimized for this assay.  One is the number of cycles
used for the first step PCR and the other is the starting copy number of the
internal control.   Five serial sets of 10-fold diluted W-plasmides (1 to
100,000 copies) were used as template DNA instead of actual bacterial genome
and then the <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values are statistically analyzed.  Thus the
first step PCR was tested at 5-cycle intervals at 20, 25, 30, and 35.  Results
showed that 25 cycles was the optimal number.  In the previous report,
35 cycles were optimal, but the slope of the curve here indicated
overamplification, 384.1%.  To determine optimal internal copy number,
1000, 10,000, and 100,000 copies of the NM (new mutation) plasmid were tested.
One-way ANOVA was used to examine the data it could be determined that 1000
copies was sufficient for use as a calibrator.
<p>
The W-plasmid was constructed using the pCR2.1 vector in which a 239 bp insert
from the MPB64 protein was used.  The NM-plasmid is an improvement on the
M-plasmid.  Four segments of bases representing the outer and inner set of
primers were replaced with random sequences added to the TaqMan probe
annealing region in the M-plasmid.  Four primers were used in the replacement:
a forward and reverse <i>Avr2</i> outer and inner primer set, and forward
and reverse sets featuring <i>Mlu</i>I and <i>Sal</i>I.  All primers had bases
overlapping MPT64 and also additional random nucleotides which included the
restriction site on the 5&prime; end.  None the three restriction sites were
in the pCR2.1 vector.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR Is Not More Sensitive than <q>Conventional</q> PCR
<p class="Para1">
<b>Guest Commentary</b>.  While qrtPCR has many advantages such as speed,
broad dynamic range and reduction in contamination, it is not more sensitive
than conventional PCR (cnPCR).  Many comparative studies between qrtPCR and
cnPCR use in-house or lab-developed assays for both, and there is considerable
interlaboratory variation among those publishing the reports.  The cause of
these variations are as follows: (i) PCR is not a single technique but rather
a method involving a number of techniques, each with variable outcome and
depending on variety of factors; (ii) qrtPCR is a sophisticated technological
advance of PCR but with many limitations with respect to interlab variations.
The sensitivity of PCR for detecting a microorganism depends on three factors:
reaction physicochemical conditions, concentration and nature of DNA target,
and the primers and probes selected for PCR.  In method development reaction
conditions are varied as part of the optimization of the PCR which including
checking annealing temperature, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, enzyme, and primer concentration,
a process that might take 3-6 months in cnPCR, aimed at enhancing sensitivity
and specificity.  Use of universal master mix preparations reduce the ability
to optimize the particular method being used.  Template preparation methods
and sample matrix types considerably influence sensitivity.  The presence of
non-target template DNA (host aside from pathogen) represents an environment
affecting sensitivity.  These can affect particularly the [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] that
are free ions, so non-target template DNA can alter Mg<sup>2+</sup> necessary
for activity.
<p>
Consider protozoan parasite <i>Leishmania donovani</i>.  It has a highly
reiterated sequence (5000 &times;)  called the kinetoplast minicircle in its
mitochondrial genome and PCR assays developed for it are called <q>ultrasensitive</q>
compared to assays with less repetitive targets.  Primer selection is crucial
however, since it has been shown that sensitivity can vary two orders of
magnitude with different primer pairs.  In other cases, the &lt;20-fold-repeated
rDNA has been found to be more sensitive than the &gt;100-fild reiterated spliced
leader RNA gene of <i>Leishmania</i> although as a rule, reiteration of sequences
in a target improves its detectability.  Primer selection for the same <i>B1</i>
gene target in <i>T gondii</i> has also resulted in a 200-fold factor difference
in sensitivity, from 0.05 to 10 genome equivalents in a reaction tube.
<p>
Importantly detection approaches can cause changes in sensitivity.  The use
of SYBR Green I vs. FRET probes can account for 1000-fold variation.  Often
qrtPCR assays are not always more sensitive than cnPCRs for the same target.
<p>
The proportion of the volume of template DNA added to the master mix balance
is also critical.  Sensitivity can be improved by adding more volume of DNA
extract, but this will not occur if the extract contains PCR inhibitory
substances.  If the total reaction volume of the assay is higher, this could
reduce the effect of inhibitory materials.  Analytical sensitivity in
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> were compared for qrtPCR and cnPCR and it
appeared proportional to template DNA volume input.

Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assay for Rapid Identification of <i>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</i> Complex Members to the Species Level
<p class="Para1">
The ability to type <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex at the species
level is of little consequence to commercial assay producers, whose assays
only identify the complex and not species.  Species differentiation is
important however in determining therapy  Spacer oligotype analysis
(spoligotyping) can distinguish at the species level but it is challenging,
interpretation uses an advanced nomenclature, and is accessible only to experts,
and there is no public database. 99.9% of the members of the complex are
similar at nucleotide level and have identical 16S rRNA sequences.
<p>
Comparative genomic analysis shows members of the complex evolved from common
ancestor through sequential DNA deletions with precise genomic locations.
A species-differentiating PCR was developed based on these results and it
incorporates a melting curve analysis in two PCR tests to detect presence or
absence of regions of difference RD9, RD4, and RD1.  RD9+ indicates
<i>M tuberculosis</i>.  Both RD9- and RD4+ indicate <i>M. africanum, M. caprae,
M. pinnipedii</i> and <i>M. microti</i>.  The result of RD9-/RD4-/RD1+ indicates
<i>M. bovis</i>, and a typing of RD9-/RD4-/RD1- in a positive mycobacterial
reading is <i>M bovis BCG</i>.

In developing the multiplex assays, primer sets were tested in individual

In the next phase, primer sets are combined into two reaction mixtures:
reaction 1 detects presence of RD9 and absence of RD1, permitting identification
of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and <i>M bovis</i> BCG, respectively, as well as
the 16S rRNA gene detection, a control for extraction efficiency and reaction
inhibitors.  Reaction 2 contains primer sets to control for present or absence
of RD4.  These two reactions validated against <i>M tuberculosis</i> H37Rv,
<i>M africanum</i> ATCC 25240, <i>M bovis</i> Ravenel, <i>M bovis</i> BCG Pasteur.
A melting curve with <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 76.4&deg; indicates RD9, and a
peak at 79.4&deg; indicates a mycobacterial genus.  The RD1 primer set is
present, but the melting curve indicates no amplification.  With <i>M bovis</i>
BCG template in reaction 1, a peak at <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 86.5&deg; shows
an RD1 deletion and the 79&deg; peak for genus control.  Other figures show how
to interpret the results.

Molecular-Beacon-Based Real-Time PCR for Detection and Quantification of
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> DNA in Clinical Samples
<p class="Para1">
<b>Letter To The Editor</b>.  The implementation of molecular beacon approaches
in a real-time PCR of <i>M tuberculosis</i> is not extensively reported.
1019 samples (417 of them respiratory) obtained for TB testing of which half
of each sample was immediately stained for acid-fast bacteria and cultured
and the other half frozen at &minus;70&deg;.  TB-positive samples were tallied
and the other half of the sample and an equal number of TB-negative samples were
thawed and DNA extracted by QIAmp DNA Mini Kit.  The gene target was IS<i>6110</i>
and the primer set is TB2F 5&prime;-GTCCACGCCGCCAACTACG-3&prime; and
TB2R 5&prime;-GTTAGGTGCTGGTGGTCCGAAG-3&prime;.  The beacon is
and TB2B 5&prime;-FAM-CGCGATCGCCACAGCCCGTCCCGCCGATGATCGCG-(BASE)-3&prime;.  This
should produce a 161 bp fragment.  After 2 min at 95&deg;, 50 cycles of
45 s at 93&deg;, 90 s at 60&deg;, and 2 min at 72&deg;, with a final 7 min
extension at 72&deg;.  H37Rv DNA was extracted and used for producing a standard
curve.  Other complex and nonmycobacterial were used to control specificity.
Median and mean <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values were calculated, and results also
compared to single-step conventional PCR.
<p>
Results showed a signal only with <i>M tuberculosis</i>  and <i>M bovis</i>
strains.  Sensitivity was to 7 fg, about 1.4 genome equivalents.  32 patients
were TB-positive, and 40 specimens available from them, 10 respiratory.  The
conventional PCR performed better on the respiratory specimens, while the real-time
did better on the extrapulmonary specimens.  Combining the conventional and
real-time PCR produced 100% sensitivity.  Samples were then diluted 1:10 and
re-tested:  3 were found to be positive where they were negative, indicating
PCR inhibition: one positive with both assays, and two positive with PCR only.
The mean <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> value for real time assay was 33.5 cycles, ranging
from 19.3 to 40.7.  TaqMan and FRET probes have been used in many other assay
types.  The greatest median DNA loads were in pulmonary and pus specimens, whereas
with lymph nodes had much less.  Other sample types include tissue, urine,
bone marrow aspriate, gastric fluid, CDF, pericardial aspirate, and a prostatic
specimen.

High-level expression of SAG1 and GRA7 gene of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> 
(Izatnagar isolate) and their application in serodiagnosis of goat toxoplasmosis
<p class="Para1">
<i>T. gondii</i> is obligate intracellular parasite (protozoan) infecting 
domestic and wild animals.  In particular infection in pregnant females leads
to abnormalities in the fetus, including abortion.  It often induces abortion
in sheep or goats. HIV-AIDS patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis die. 
Cats are a major reservoir.  They excrete oocsysts 3-10 days after ingesting
tissue cysts (bradyzoites), 18 days after ingesting unsporulated oocysts,
and 15 days after ingesting tachyzoites.  Kasper et al (1984) found that surface
antigen 1 (SAG1) is expressed in the tachyzoite stage while Jacobs et al (1999)
determine granule protein 7 is expressed in acute phase of infection.
<p>
Genomic DNA  Izatnagar isolate of <i>T gondii</i> was obtained using standard
phenol:chloroform with EtOH precipitation.  The DNA sequences of SAG1
(P30) and GRA7 came from GenBank.  SAG1 was obtained using primer pairs
to get the 1183 bp open reading frame and cloned into pGEM-T.  In addition
a 958 bp truncated SAG1 was prepared with the same forward but different reverse
primer which includes HindIII restriction site.  This truncated product was
digested with BamHI and HindIII &rarr; 814 bp, and this inserted into pET-32b(+).
BL21(DE3)pLysS E coli were made competent and transformed.  Expression is
induced at 37&deg; for 7 h with 1 mM IPTG.  The fusion has N-terminal thioredoxin
and His-tag both on N- and C-terminals.  A 657 bp region inside GRA7 is amplified
and contain NcoI site in the forward prmier.  This is cloned into pGEM-T
and sequenced in both directions.  The vector with GRA7 insert is digested 
with NcoI and SacI, yielding a 703 bp fragment which is inserted into pET-32c(+).
The plasmid is then put into same E coli host and induced with IPTG.
Only the N-terminal contains thioredoxin and His-tag.  Positive colonies 
containing insert are grown in 100 ml LB containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin and
32 mg/ml chloramphenicol at 37&deg; with vigorous shaking.  IPTG is added when
OD600 = 1.0.  Cells are grown for additional 7 h then collected by centrifuge:
mass is 500 mg of the rSAG1 cell pellets and 450 mg rGRA7.  Pellets are 
freeze-thawed at &minus;80&deg; and 37&deg; then lysed in 
0.1&nbsp;M&nbsp;NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM TrisHCl, 6 M guanidine HCl,
pH 8.0, which is then sonicated.  Lysate is microcentrifuged 30 min at 4&deg;.
The pellet is resuspended the phosphate/Tris buffer, but GuanHCl is replaced
with 8 M urea, and this vortexed for 1 h.  The resuspension is centrifuged
as before at RT.  The supernatant is passed over a Ni-NTA column equilibrated
in the phosphate/Tris/GuanHCl buffer.  Column is then washed three volumes
with phosphate/Tris/urea adjusted to pH 6.3, and then eluted with 
phosphate/Tris/urea in pH 4.5 buffer.  SDS-PAGE was used to assess protein
purity, and concentration determined by Lowry.  The rSAG1 is diluted to 
50-100 mg/ml in 50 mM sodium phosphate + 0.1 NaCl pH 8.0.  Diluted sample is
dialyzed against 0.5 M urea, 20 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, then in 
20 mM TrisHCl pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM glutathione-SH (GSH), and 0.2 mM GSSG
at 4&deg; 24 h.  25 ml of the dialysate is concentrated in the dialysis tubing
(10 kDa cutoff) with PEG-20,000 to one-third original volume.  A different
batch is concentrated by centrifugal evaporation.  This is called re-folded
SAG1 (FrSAG1).   Another batch of rSAG1 is dialyzed against PBS pH 7.2 at
4&deg; for 48 h with 5 buffer changes and called misfolded rSAG1 (MrSAG1).
<p>
500 ng of recombinants, folded and misfolded are transferred to nitrocellulose
after SDS-PAGE (semi-dry apparatus) and probed with several primaries:
rabbit antiserum against whole tachyzoite Ag, chronically infected human
serum, and experimental goat sera at 1:100. HRP-labeled anti-goat, -rabbit,
and -human were used at 1:500 and developed with DAB.  The goats were 
inoculated subcutaneously with 10 million fresh tachyzoites and tracked weekly 
for 120 days.  Test sera were evaluated using the MAT-based T gondii assay:
a total of 56 of which 30 were MAT positive and other MAT negative, with 
further testing by ELISA.  Negative controls were verified by IFA and MAT.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  After PCR amplification of genomic DNA, SAG1 (<a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/DQ872517">GenBank DQ872517</a>) and 
GRA7 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/DQ872520">GenBank 
DQ872520</a>) were inserted directionally into pGEM-T and sequenced.  The
Izatnagar isolate has 98.8% homology for DNA sequence and 96.7% amino acid
homology with SAG1, and 97.5% DNA and 95.6% amino acid homology with GRA7.
Ten residues were different in SAG1, and 8 were different in GRA7 in deduced
sequence.  After growing in selective LB medium using pET vector, the 
recombinant is now a fusion with thioredoxin (109 amino acids) plus the
His tag in both N- and C-terminal.  After affinity purification, rSAG1
is a band at 47 kDa and rGRA7 at 43 kDa; no bands are seen in uninduced culture.
SAG1 is estimated to be 15% of total cell protein in inclusion body.  6 mg
of His-rSAG1-Trx-His fused is yield from 100 ml culture.  The rGRA7 is about
20% of cell protein and 7 mg from 100 ml culture is obtained.

Naturally occurring MHR variants in Turkish patients infected with hepatitis B 
virus
<p class="Para1">
ABSTRACT. Major B-cell epitopes are located at the major hydrophilic region 
(MHR) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg). The genotypes, 
subtypes, and naturally occurring amino acid (aa) substitutions of MHR were 
analyzed in 81 Turkish adult patients (41 inactive HBsAg carriers and 40 
patients with chronic hepatitis B) by direct sequencing of the S gene fragment. 
All the isolates were genotype D according to the phylogenetic analysis. The 
most common HBsAg subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 while one isolate specified 
ayw4 by encoding Leu127. MHR variants were detected in 22 of the 81 (27.2%) 
isolates. The prevalence was significantly higher in the chronic hepatitis B 
group (42.5%) compared to inactive HBsAg carriers (12.2%). Twenty-two samples 
had a total of 26 amino acid substitutions involving 14 positions. The majority 
of the patients had a single variation. Most of the amino acid substitutions 
were located at the HBs1 region of the MHR, while 9 of the 26 were in the 
classic "a" determinant (aa 124-147). When samples with "a" variants were 
evaluated by two different commercial HBsAg tests, only the isolate with 
Ser143Leu variation had a decreased reactivity in the assay using monoclonal 
antibodies for capture and detection. In conclusion, the findings of the study 
was in accordance with previous studies showing HBV genotype and subtype 
homogeneity (genotype D/ayw) in Turkey. Naturally occurring MHR and "a" 
determinant variants were common, especially among chronic hepatitis B patients. 
The influence of detected "a" variants on diagnostic assays was limited.

RT-PCR did not show changes in LRP1 transcription (also controlled using
GADPH transcript levels).  Insulin-treated cells washed free of insulin
had LRP1 expression fully restored in 24 h.  From these data, there is the
strong possiblility that insulin affects protein stability rather than controlling
gene expression.
<p>
LPR1 and Tf-R are endocytically removed from the cell surface via clathrin-coated
pits.  Insulin induces adipocyte LRP1 and Tf-R in low-density microsomes to
translocate to the cell surface, and protein levels remain constant.  J774 cells
were insulin treated for 24 h in 10 nM insulin on coverslips.  After fixing
cells and incubating in antibodies to LRP1 and Tf-R followed by fluorophoric
2nd antibody, cells showed a loss of LRP1 but no Tf-R.
<p>
Previous reports indicate that insulin activates the PI3K which mediates
the traffic and expression and proteasome degradation of intracellular proteins.
J774 cells were incubated first in 10 &micro;M LY294002 (Sigma), known to inhibit
the PI-3K/Akt pathway.  Cells were then  treated 24 h in 10 nM insulin.
Production of phospho-Akt (pAkt) and changes in LRP1 were checked by immunblotting,
and blots show that pAkt levels increased significantly with insulin alone,
with the expected reduction of LRP1 levels.  When pre-incubated with LY294002,
there was still a pAkt presence but at a much lower level, while LRP1 was
clearly detectable, although less than in the untreated.  PI3K inhibitor added
by itself had no effect on either pAkt expression (hardly detectable) or
LRP1 levels.  Clearly insulin induces LRP1 reduction through PI3K pathway.
<p>
J774 cells were treated with 20 &micro;M MG132 in the presence or absence of
10 nM insulin for 24 h. MG132 can inhibit proteasomal activity and prolong
LRP1 half-life.  Immunoblotting shows that MG132 clearly blocks the insulin-induced
degradation of LRP1, which is induced through proteasome activation.  In another
study, MG132 was used to demonstrate that the &alpha;-chain of LRP1 was
conjugated to ubiquitin in macrophages, and thus it is likely that LRP1 is
brought into the proteasome via this ubiquitination. J774 cells incubated in
MG132 on coverslips were fixed and the probed with anti-LRP1 &beta;-subunit
and anti-ubiquitin antibodies using confocal microscopy.  None of the images
showed overlapping fluorescence in cells not treated at all, or treated
with MG132 or insulin.  MG132 induced increases in LRP1 but there was no
overlap with ubiquitin.  But when MG132 was incubated with insulin, cells
did show an overlapping brightness, indicating that LRP1 was associated with
ubiquitin, and its processing through the proteasome was blocked.
<p>
J774 cells macrophage-derived cells were treated with insulin for 24 h
and then placed at 4&deg;, after which FITC-labeled activated (by methylamine)
&alpha;<sub>2</sub> macroglobulin was added.  Cells were then placed at 37&deg;
for 10 min to allow for internalization of any &alpha;2M bound to the cell
by LRP1 and then visualized by green epifluorescence.  Captured images were
analyze for granulated appearances, indicating internalized &alpha;2M into
endosomes.  Insulin-treated cells clearly reduced the ability of J774 to
internalize labeled &alpha;2M.  Thus LRP1 degradation induced by insulin
also affects the ability of receptor to internalize specific ligands.

&alpha;<sub>2</sub>-Macroglobulin and Haptoglobin Suppress
Amyloid Formation by Interacting with Prefibrillar Protein Species
<p class="Para1">
<b>Intro</b>.  More than 40 human degenerative disesases associated with
deposition of amyloid (proteinaceious fibrils or plaques).  Include Alzheimer's
and Parkinson diseases, Creuztfeldt-Jakob (transmissible prion disease),
type II diabetes, and systemic lysozyme amyloidosis.  Formation of amyloid
has been characterized to occur in three distinct phases:
<ol>
<li>an intial <b>lag</b> (nucleation) phase which is time required to
form prefibrillar soluble oligomers or nuclei to seed fibril growth
<li>rapid <b>exponential</b>
</ol>
<p>Aggregation of these proteins to form amyloid deposits in vivo might occur
when protein <q>quality control</q> is <q>overwhelmed</q>.  Amyloid deposition
however tends to occurs in the extracellular space, and proteins that are
misfolded or aberrant in structure cannot be cannot be processed by proteins
designed to deal with structural deformation or functional loss, such as
molecular chaperones or the ubiquitin machinery.  Intracellular chaperones
are known, but recently an extracellular chaperone was found: <b>clusterin</b>.
Cluterin inhibits amyloid formation in the fibril-forming process early stage.
It binds no proteins in its native structure nor to mature fibrils: it binds
instead to some partially unfolded protein forms known to be important in
nucleation of fibrils. a2M and haptoglobin are plasma glycoproteins that may
be have chaperone activity similar to clusterin, suppress amorphous aggregation
of many proteins.  a2M is 10% oligosaccharide by mass.  Its antiproteinase
activity is well known and not discussed here.  a2M will bind also to many
protein involved in amyloid deposition diseases:  A&beta;, prion,
&beta;<sub>2</sub> microglobulin, all linked to Alzheimer disease,
spongiform encephalopathies, and dialysis-related amyloidosis, respectively.
a2M native form also binds to cytokine and growth factors, and to many hydrophobic
structures: endotoxin, phenyl-Sepharose, and liposomes.  Hughes et al
reported that a2m can inhibit formation of A&beta;.  a2M also protects cells
from A&beta; toxicity in a LRP-dependent fashion.  a2M also appears to stabilize
misfolded proteins as an ATP-independent chaperone, which is why it cannot refold
proteins probably.  Can a2M prevent amyloid formation in other proteins and
petpides other than A&beta;?
<p>
Haptoglobin (Hp) is an acidic glycoprotein secreted from liver and found in
bodily fluids of most mammals.  Its plasma levels rise 8-fold in inflammatory
processes and other stresses (it is thus described as <q>acute phase protein</q>.
The gene has two alleles, <i>HP</i><sup>1</sup> and <i>HP</i><sup>2</sup>, and
this produces three phenotypes, Hp1-1, Hp2-2 and Hp2-1.  The heterozygous
phenotype occurs in blacks and may be functionally reduced in ability.  The
Hp1-1 form is 100 kDa composed of two &alpha; and two &beta; subunits which
are really products of proteolytic processing of a single polypeptide precursor.
Hp2-1 and Hp2-2 have a distinct &alpha;<sub>2</sub> chain with extra Cys residue
and this form disulfide links in an &alpha;&beta; polymeric chain from
~100 to ~500 kDa.  Hp has a high hemoglobin affinity and likely prevents free
Hb from generating lipid peroxides and hydroxyl radicals which would occur at
inflammatory sites.  Complexed with Hb, CD163 and Mac-1 receptors take up the
complex in receptor-mediated endocytosis for degradation.  Hp may play a role
in immune regulation and inhibit cathepsin B activity.  Hp likely has multiple
roles in suppressing inflammation.  Similarly to clusterin, Hp it can
inhibit precipitation of many proteins induced by range of stresses and
it forms soluble high MW complexes with misfolded proteins and does not refold
them.  Moreover, removing Hp from human serum (by immunoaffinity depletion
increases proteins precipitated in response to stresses.  This precipitation
inhibitory effect is likely to be necessary/relevant in vivo  Hp effects
on amyloid deposition is unknown, although the protein is found in vivo in
amyloid deposits.
<p>
A&beta;(1-42), calcitonin, and lysozyme are all porteins seen in amyloidoses,
seen in Alzheimer's, localized amyloidosis, and familial systemic
amyloidosis, respectively.
<p>
<b>Experimental</b>.  a2M and Hp2-1 were purified from plasma.  Hp concentration
was determined by OD280 (&epsilon; = 51000/M-cm (a 50 kDa &alpha;&beta; dimer);
a2m was determined using &epsilon; = 8.93 for 1% solution (the 720 kDa tetramer).
I59T is a human non-natural lysozyme variant and is a recombinant.  Fibril
formation is done by resuspending A&beta;(1-42) in PBS and spinning out
undissolved or aggregated material (13000 <i>g</i> 10 min); 10 &micro;M peptide
is shaken 600 rpm 8 h at 37&deg; with 0.9 mM calcium chloride, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,
1 &micro;M CuCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.6 mM glycine.  The coiled coil &beta;<sub>w</sub>
peptide (60 &micro;M) and Calc (150 &micro;M) shaken at 600 rpm for 5 h in
physiological phosphate buffer.  Fibril formation is measured using Thio T
fluorescence with FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech).
I59T was made up 6.8 &micro;M in 100 mM sodium citrate pH 5.0 and incubated
60&deg; in stirred 1 ml cuvette, with 500 nm light scattering monitored;
aggregation was better in the cuvette than multiwell plate, and Thio T had
an adverse effect on aggregation.  15 &micro;M Hp was incubated with Hb in
1:1 for 2 h RT, then A&beta;(1-42) and cc&beta;<sub>w</sub> in concentrations
and buffes used above was shaken to produce aggregation.  Thioflavin T
(Thio T) fluorescence was added to 50 &micro;M in the A&beta;,
cc&beta;<sub>w</sub> or Calc mixtures and 440BP10 excitation and 490BP10
emission filters used.  End point ThioT fluorescence was used for I59T and
440 nm excitation and 450-600 nm emission scan.  In other experiments
amyloid fibrils were formed first and then Hp or a2M added so that ratios
were 1:10 (a2m/Hp):A&beta;, 1:15 (a2M/Hp):Calc, and also for coiled-coil &beta;<sub>w</sub>
peptide.  Samples are analyzed by ThioT fluorescence.  the 30000 g pellets are
washed in PBS several times, dissolved in DMSO, diluted 10-fold in PBS and then
a BCA protein assay done.  For EM work, end point samples are applied to Formvar
and carbon-coated nickel EM grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate.
Additional endpoint aggregates were centrifuged 30 min 10000 g and pellet
washed several times in PBS: A&beta; samples were run on 15% SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with WO2 mAb.  Calciton was spotted directly on NC and probed
with rabbit polyclonal.  I59T was immunoblotted after 10% SDS-PAGE with rabbit
polyclonal.  Detection with chemiluminescecne.  For time course, 1 &micro;g
A&beta; samples are removed and kept at &minus;20&deg; then spotted to dryness
on NC paper.  Incubation with a2M or Hp (10 &micro;g/ml) after washing and blocking,
and Glut-S-transferase (as control) and polyclonals to a2M and Hp used to probe
for binding.  Sandwich ELISA:  aggregation reactions with enough a2M or Hp
to inhibit aggregation (1:10 a2m or Hp:A&beta; or I59T and 1:15 for calcitonin)
were taken at typical midpoint aggregation time and spun 13000 g /10 min and
analyzed by sandwich ELISA using biotinylated peptides in case of A&beta;
and cc&beta;<sub>w</sub> (ability to aggregate not affected) in which anti-a2M
or -Hp rabbit polyclonal are used for adsorbent coat (10 &micro;g/ml) followed
by PBS:1% BSA blocking and then aggregates reactions added to 50 &micro;g/ml
amyloidogenic protein (or a2M or Hp alone at same concentration as controls)
followed by strepavidin then biotinylated HRP for detection in case of A&beta;
or cc&beta;<sub>w</sub>. Calc and I59T are detected using antibodies to them.
All plates are washed and developed in o-phenylenediamine 2HCl with 0.03% peroxide
in pH 5 citrate-phosphate and A490 taken.  Negative controls:  rabbit
anti-dinitrophenol with no specificity to any proteins, and wells treated only
with strepavidin and HRP.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  With no a2M or Hp present, all amyloidogenic proteins/peptides
show the triphasic fibril formation:  lag, rapid growth, then plateau.
Variable lag times seen:  A&beta; 25-50 min, cc&beta;<sub>w</sub>, cc&beta;<sub>w</sub>
5-20 min, Calc 20-30 min, I59T 75-150.  Increasing levels of added a2M show
dose-dependent decreases in Thio-T positive aggregration

Transcription Factor TFII-I Causes Transcriptional Upregulation of GRP78
Synthesis in Prostate Cancer Cells
<p class="Para1">
The 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein  (GRP78):
<ul>
<li>is a biological sensor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by
variety of conditions that trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR)
and anti-apoptotic signaling
<li>involved in translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides across ER
membrane and their subsequent folding, maturation transport, or retrotranslocation
<li>is located on cell surface
<li>is located on cell surface on various cell types where it is co-receptor
for viruses and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation
system
<li>is signaling recetpr for activated &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin
(a2M*).
</ul>
<p>Activation by a2M* of a complex composed of GRP78, MTJ-1, G&alpha;q11, and
other factors on surface of mouse peritoneal macrophage  and human 1-LN
prostate cancer cells triggers pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic.
a2M circulates at a concentration of 2-5 &micro;M, of which 10% of of that
is a2M*.  The binding of a2M* to GRP78 has <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 50-100 pM.
PSA is actually a proteinase that activates a2M and converts it to a2M*.
Prostate cancers also produce matrix metalloproteinases which also produce
a2M*.  GRP78 autoantibodies found in sera represent a biomarker of aggressiveness
of the cancer and a poorer survival.  The autoantibodies bind to GRP78 on the
same site as a2M* and function as receptor agonists, triggering signaling
cascades.  Multiple copies of the ER stress element are found in the promoter
region of the <i>GRP78</i> gene.  Several transcription factors including
TFII-I interact with the ER stress elements and upregulate GRP78 synthesis.

Transcriptional effects of transfection: the potential for misinterpretation of
gene expression data generated from transiently transfected cells
<p class="Para1">
Transcription of exogenous genetic material into cells results in changes in
transcript levels based on many factors.  Expression of the gene of interest
however can affect regulation of other (endogenous) genes.  Of course this is
desirable, but the factors not expected include the vector itself (which is why
transformations must include non-insert vector-only controls) and the
transfection means or mechanism (reagents, etc), which is often toxic,
traumatic, if not lethal.
<p>
MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were transfected with a secreted alkaline
phosphatase (SEAP)-insert (pM1-SEAP) and only its vector (pM1-MT). Transfection
reagents/kits were FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) or
Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen).  After 8, 24, and 48 h,
cells were then frozen at &minus;80&deg; after washing out medium and RNA was
isolated using RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen), each well then processed with RNeasy
Mini-Spin Columns (Qiagen).  A NanoDrop (ND-1000) was used to assess RNA quantity
and purity; the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 was used to check RNA integrity.  1 &micro;g
RNA from each sample was labeled with GeneChip One-cyle Target Labeling kit
(Affymetrix) for making cRNA:  cRNA amount and quality assessed on ND-1000 and
Agilent 2100.   cRNA was fragmented and hybed to Human U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix)
for 17 h to analyze &gt; 47,000 transcripts, then washed and scanned.  Gene
expression data was then loaded on Rosetta Resolver Gene Expression Analysis
System v 7.1.0.1.11 (Rosetta Biosoftware) using Rosetta error model for analysis.
Error-weighted average of biological replicate samples was calculated using
Rosetta Resolover, and ratio comparisons constructed in which transfected samples
for given transfection reagent at specific time point was in numerator, and
untransfected control in denominator.  Differential expression was considered
an absolute-fold change of &gt; 1.3, with log ratio <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.001,
and log intensity &gt; &minus;0.5.  Gene ontology enrichment analysis was done
using High-Throughput GoMiner.
<p>
At the 48 h time point, 74 transcripts were found to be up-regulated and 2
down-regulated under all conditions of transfection (reagent, vector with
or without insert).  Only 6 transcripts were up-regulated and 1 down-regulated
with pM1-SEAP with either transfection reagent used.  SEAP is generally only a
reporter gene with very little biological activity in the cell.  The seven
genes who regulation was altered were identified as
<ol>
<li>alkaline phosphatase placental-like 2 (ALPPL2): up
<li>alkaline phosphatase placental (ALPP, Regan isozyme): up
<li>rac17 g11.x1 NCI_CGAP_Bm23 Homo sapiens cDNA clone | IMAGE 3277652, mRNA
sequence (FLJ3/C78): up
<li>chromosome 20 open reading frame 148 (C20orf148): up
<li>tripartite motif-containing 56 (TRIM56): up
<li>Scctir (SCOTIN): up
<li>neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 3 (NBPF3): down
</ol>
<p>
Two of the genes correspond to SEAP.  Three are not annotated to known genes,
but have no sequence similarity to SEAP.  SCOTIN and NBPF3 were consistently found
to be regulated by SEAP expression.
<p>
The changes in expression of 74 up and 2 down genes are experiments in which the
only thing in common are vector backbone and the transfection reagents.
59 different genes were found in the 76 probes.  The Gene Ontonlogy enrichment
analysis identifies biological themes.  A GO Category indicates a biological
process, and the total genes involves, the genes changed in expression, and a
log enrichment <i>p</i>-value are assesed to determine the effect.  The top
seven categories were
<table>
<tr><th>GO Category <th>Total Genes  <th>Changed Genes <th>log enrichment <i>p</i>-value

<p>
The categories suggest something like a viral infection or the introduction of

Complete discrimination of six individuals based on high-resolution melting of
hypervariable regions I and II of the mitochondrial genome
<p class="Para1">
Short tandem repeats (STRs) of nuclear DNA often used for forensic identification.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an alternative because of high copy number per cell.
Most mtDNA sequence variation condensed within hypervariable regions I and II
(HVI and HVII) of non-coding displacement loop (D-loop).  SNP variation is
analyzed within this region.  But method is laborious and time-consuming and
a pre-screen of crime DNA would facilitate mtDNA analysis.  Rapid genotyping
of mtDNA polymorphisms are either destructive or open-tube, or require costly
allele-specific probes or expensive mass spectrometers.
<p>
High-resolution melting (HRM) can be used to analyze genetic variation in PCR
amplicons.  HRM applications have been reported for SNP genotyping, mutation
discovery, DNA methylation.  Although thought to require new generation of
saturating DNA dyes, it has been shown to work with SYBR Green I (non-saturating
dye).  HRM-capable instruments show changes (decreases) in fluorescence in
dsDNA &rarr; ssDNA transitions resulting from increased temperatures, and using
custom software for melting curve analysis. <q>SuperConvection is a novel
[patented] technology to minimize thermal heterogeneity within samples by inducing
enhanced mass-transport in the reaction mixture.</q>  This has been implemented
into the QuanTyper-48 real time PCR instrument (AlphaHelix Molec Diag AB, Uppsala),
with in-tube temperature measurement system.
<p>
The QuanTyper-48 was compared to a leading HRM instrument, the Rotor-Gene 6000.
High speed centrifugation and directional heating, called SuperConvection,
increase intra-sample homogeneity.  A challenging task for any HRM-capable
instrument is to be able to detect a single A/T SNP.  The A/T and T/A genotype
differences in temperature are about 0.1&deg; C in the melting curve.  Such
a comparison was done the QuanTyper-48 and the result was slightly better than
on the Rotor-Gene 6000.  Plots of fluorescence vs. temperature were done for
both instruments in duplicate.
<p>
HVI and HVII mtDNA samples from six individuals were sequenced and then used
as templates in PCR assays.  Amplification showed Ct values of ~15-18 for HVI
PCR and ~18-22 for HVII PCR (agarose gels show single bands).  The HVII
was analyzed first since it has a larger number of variable positions than HVI
(11 positions in HVII vs. 8 positions in HVI).  Three distinct HVII HRM curves
were observed and could be grouped so.  Each curve contained two melting
transitions (thus two melting domains).  HVII HRM Type I curve was represented
by three individuals (B14, B15, C5) and HVII HRM Type II by two (B18, B20).
A single person (C2) represented Type III curve, with a late second melting
transition.
<p>
For discriminating between type I and II HVII curve individuals, the curves for
the HVI amplicons are analyzed.  The three type I individuals could then be
distinguished in the HVI HRM profiles.  The same for the two type II HVII
individuals: their HRM in HVI showed clear temp difference.  HRM of HVII amplicon
alone lets 50-100% of individuals be excluded (depending on reference sample)
with 11 of 15 sequence combinations being ruled out in forensic suspicion.
When combining the HVI and HVII, it was possible to exclude 100% of individuals
who would be rule out using other methods.  Another group used sequencing of the
HV mtDNA regions to rule out 7 in 10 samples for 90 samples involving 16 cases,
where there were &ge; 2 base pair differences.  Identical HVII curves are seen
even in SNP differences:  e.g., B14 has a TnC sequence from position 150-152 while
B15 had a CnT in that sequence, thus having identical curves.  Variations at
amplicon ends probably have a smaller effect compared to variations in the center.
B18 and B20 have similar HVII melting curves although they differ at seven SNP
positions on the ends of the amplicons.  This may have more to do with the
3' domain of the HVII region amplified than of the HRM technique.  Table 4
shows that where samples differ by two SNPs in the HVII, one in two samples
are resolved.  HVI amplicon resolved two individuals based on two SNP positions.
<p>
Generally amplicon length should be preferred to contain sufficient sequence
variation, but short enough to avoid complex melting behavior.  The possibility
exists of dividing the HVII amplicon into two parts and analyzing the two melt
domains separately.  GC content is a big factor in discrimination/resolution,
evident for HVI and the first domain of HVII.
<p>
<b>Heteroplasmy</b> also exists:  this is where different mtDNA genome variants
are present in the same individual as a result of mutations.  This can complicate
interpretation.  In HVII, one poly(C) stretch results in length heteroplasmy.
Use a primer pair that avoids the poly(C) stretch.  Primer design cannot avoid
point heteroplasmies that are mutation hot spots.  When the assay is set for
a detection threshold of &ge; 2 SNPs, this avoids this problem.  In two of two
cases the HVII amplicon did not permit individal discrimination based on a single
difference.  Point heteroplasmy will not present a problem if the threshold can
be set at the &ge; 2 SNP level.  As a confirmatory test, matched samples will be
subjected to sequencing anyway.
<p>
In previous work, melting analysis using PCR-based methods for genotyping mtDNA
were done but amplicons only distinguished if Tm differed by 3&deg; or more.
It was also open tube (risk of contamination).  In another costly allele-specific
probes were used, with one probe for each SNP detected.  Combining qPCR and HRM
with the QuanTyper-48 ($40-45K cost) is much less costly compared to use of
mass spectrometry at 3-10 times the cost.  In the QT-48, after amplification
melting analysis is complete in 3-4 min.
<p>
As to the Rotor-Gene 6000, while curves were quite similar,, the HVII curves
could not be grouped with larger spread among replicates.  The RG6000 also
is more stepwise rather than continuous in monitoring signal fluorescence,
probably giving the QT-48 higher resolution.

<p>Good DNA coding methods require economical use of nucleotides per character.
The bases-to-character ratio is ~3.5 here.  The comma or alternating codes
used 6 b/ch, and sequential encryption uses ~5.3 b/ch.  Other approaches had
low b/ch ratios but also were limited to number of characters (English alphabet).
<p>Storing DNA in living organisms comes with a drawback in that the biology
includes mutation, deletion, and insertion of other DNA.  An alignment-based
solution has been described for storage in living organisms; it allows
for sufficient recovery of stored data even for damaged DNA.
<p>
This method proposes use of plasmid library with up to 10,000 bp worth of
information inserted into each plasmid.  An <q>index</q> plasmid provides
general information about the library (title, authors, plasmid number,
primer assignments).  Primers to the index plasmid are used to sequence
its DNA insert to retrieve this metadata.  The primer sequences for the
library members are then recovered to sequence the member inserts.
Bancroft et al have described information storage utilizing two DNA classes:
information-containing DNA and polyprimer (PPK) DNA.  PPK contains entire
sequences of the primers.  In contrast the index plasmid only has information
for structure of information library, with sequencing primers embedded in this
info library.  The Huffman code for DNA encryption by Smith et al only
encodes 26 characters, but this method covers the entire standard computer
keyboard (all its scan codes).  At 5' and 3' ends contain GC bases and the
Smith et al codons are also GC-rich; so C is replaced with A and G with T
and GC-containing codes moved when possible down frequency table.  For text
coding a <q>tx*</q> [GTG TTCT TACCA] precedes 3 columns headed by low-base
number DNA codons (G,TT,TA) with subsequent bases corresponding to character.
In addition there are musical (<q>mu*</q>, [TAAC TACT TACCA]) and image
(<q>im*</q>, [GCG TAAC TACCA]) codings.  At 500 bp intervals sequencing
primer sequences of 20-30 bp length are inserted; the repetitive structure
permits pattern identification.

Singlet-oxygen-mediated amino acid and protein oxidation: Formation of 
tryptophan peroxides and decomposition products
<p class="Para1">
Singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>&Delta;<sub>g</sub>; <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>)
is formed by visible light on a range of sensitizers, including porphyrins
and dyes like Rose Bengal.  Also mediated by peroxidase enzymes using 
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and peroxynitrite
(ONOO<sup>&minus;</sup>/ONOOH).  Proteins/amino acids are targets either by
direct chemical reaction or physical quenching (latter results in energy
transfer and de-excitation of singlet state but no chemical change in 
energy acceptor).  Only Trp causes significant physical quenching.  His,
Tyr, Met, Cys, and Trp all react chemically rapidly at physiological pH.
At high pH, Arg and Lys react as deprotonated forms.  Effects are 
side chain oxidation, backbone fragmentation, dimerization/aggregation,
unfolding and conformational changes, enzyme inactivation, cellular handling
and turnover of proteins.  Formation of cataracts, sunburns, and skin cancers
are probably a result.  No markers possible:  Met sulfoxide forms from singlet
oxygen, but OH<sup>&minus;</sup>, HOCl, and peroxynitrite also cause it.
With His, the imidazole ring can undergo 1,4-cycloaddition to form endoperoxides,
with ring opening forming hydroperoxidees and this can form Asp, Asn, and 
urea.  However, singlet oxygen treatment of cytochrome c  causes 
2-imidazolone which hydrates to form hydroxyimidazolone or reacts with Lys
amino side chain to form His-Lys crosslink, which might be a biomarker of
singlet oxygen activity.  Free Tyr reacts with <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>
to produce 3<i>a</i>-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,3,3<i>a</i>,6,7,7<i>a</i>-hexahydro-1<i>H</i>-indol-2-carboxylic acid
(HOHICA), through 1,4-cycloaddition to phenolic ring, forming endoperoxide
opening to hydroperoxide.  With Trp residues hwoever, there is a proposed
mechanism involving initial dioxetane on the heterocyclic ring across C2-C3
bond, or hydroperooxide on C3.  Decomposition results in C2-C3 bond cleavage
to produce N-formylkynurenine (NFI.  Alternatively, the free amine of Trp
can react with dioxetane or hydroperoxide on C2, with closure of a new ring
to form 3&alpha;-hydroperoxypyrrolindole or 3&alpha;-hydroxypyrroloindole.
These latter two products can decompose to produce NFK in several steps.
Both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i>-Trp hydroperoxide isomers.  The potential of

Receptor-associated protein (RAP) has two high-affinity binding sites for the 
low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP): consequences for the 
chaperone functions of RAP
<p class="Para1">
LDL-R family members bind and internalize wide range of structually unrelated
proteins.  Clusters of a complement-like repeat domain on the receptor bind the
ligands; this domain is a 40-residue formed from three disulfides and which 
coordinated calcium.  A chaperone is required to fold  the domain efficiently
(typical for high density of disulfides).  This chaperone is the 38 kDa 
endoplasmic reticulum protein RAP (receptor-associated protein) with three 
equal-sized domains and has a termination HNEL sequence, retaining it on the 
membrane.  RAP works on VLDL-R, LRP, and other family members.  RAP likely
(1) ensures correct folding of CR domains and (2) prevents tight binding of
other ligands to CR clusters in ER.  Binding sites with RAP for LRP include
two sites; another RAP domain D3 binding was compared to intact RAP, and this
had same affinity as RAP, meaning other two sites probably are not involved 
in binding.  A CR tandem construct CR56 (CR<i>xy</i> is LRP fragment with domains
CR<i>x</i> and CR<i>y</i>) from ligand binding cluster II of LRP was tested
for binding by ITC to RAP D1, D2, and D3 domains:  D3 affinity was 0.2 &micro;M,
D1 was 3 &micro;M, and D2 19 &micro;M.  Another study verifies the D1 low affinity
to CR56.  The table below shows the sequences of LRP and RAP used in this study:

<b>Methods</b>.  CR of LRP cluster II are constructed into pGEX-2T, which has
the tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site code, expressed as GST fusion in
BL21 cells.  Constructs include CR34, CR56, CR78, CR567.  After IPTG induction
and growth, and cell lysate purified on GSH-Sepharose;  Dialyzed overnight in
2-mercaptoethanol, TEV cleavage is done and any GST and uncleaved GST-CR fusions
are passed over a GSH column to remove them.  Another set of contructs (CR89,
CR345, CR456, CR678) are inserted into pQE-30 with a GB1 fusion and TEV cleavage
site.  CR45 also cloned into pQE-30 with a NusA fusion + TEV; constructs expressed
in SG13009 which has pRARE plasmid.  The His6 tagged constructs then purified
on Ni<sup>2+</sup> or TALON chromatography, then TEV cleaved to remove fusion
during dialysis in PBS + 14 or 7 mM 2-ME.  CR constructs further purified on 
Q-Sepharose HP column (0-1 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris pH 8, 6 M urea).  <i>Refolding</i>:
Proteins diluted to 100 &micro;g/ml in 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and either 14 mM 2-ME or 8 mM 2-HED; except for CR78, a
GST-RAP fusion was added to CR at 1:1.25 (CR:GST-RAP) for 24 h at 22&deg; with
nitrogen bubbling, then 24 h at 4&deg; no bubbling. <i>Fluorescence spectroscopy</i>:
A PTI Quantamaster spectrofluorimeter with double monochromators on excitation
emission used with 1200 &micro;l quartz cuvette with 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% PEG-8000.  Cuvette is thermostated at 22 and 37&deg;
in some experiments; 20 mM MES pH 5.5 is used for low pH.  Emission spectra
taken from 300-450 nm (4 nm resolution) at excitation = 295 nm.  All proteins have
Trp; protein concentration is 100-2000 nM.  To cuvette is placed 100-4000 nM CR,
and RAP D1, D2, or D3 added in 2 &micro;l aliq up to 40-60 &micro;l to a final 
ratio of ~3.5:1 (350-12,500 nM).  Flourescence measured at 338 nm for 60 s for
each addition, titration curve corrected for ligand w/o CR.  Curve then fitted
to standard 1:1 binding isotherm with floating <i>F</i><sub>max</sub>, 
<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> and CR concentration by non-linear least-squares fit. 
When pH 5.5 / 37&deg; experiments were done, CR56 was instead titrated into RAP.
A fixed concentration of RAP (100-1000 nM) was titrated with CR up to 3500 nM and
data fitted to find stoichiometry of complex formation with full-length RAP.
<p><b>Results</b>.  All but two CR domain constructs forming cluster II of LRP
(CR9 and CR10) will bind RAP domain D3, all with similar affinities (constructs
expressed as ubiquitin fusions).  Andersen et al showed using quantitative SPR
and ITC shows a Ubq-CR56-to-D3 binding of ~170 nM.  Figure 1 shows a fluorescence
emission spectrum and relative fluorescence vs. RAP D3 concentration.  The spectrum
plot is of intrinsic Trp fluorescence (excitation = 295 nm) and five plots are
shown:  controls CR45 RAP-D3 (at 200 nM), the mixture of them, the difference
between the mixture and RAP-D3 values, and the CR45 bound-unbound difference
spectrum.  In these binding studies, non-conugated CR tandem doubles and triples
from CR34 to CR89 are mixed with RAP-D3.  Relative fluorescence was followed at
338 nm emission to examine effects of binding:  the Rel F vs. RAP-D<i>x</i>
concentration curve used to calculate <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> and from this 
&Delta;<i>G</i><sup>0</sup> calculated from the &minus;<i>RT</i> ln <i>K</i>
relation (accounts for all Table 1 values).  In the study with Ubq-CR56 to D3
binding the values were 170-700 nM, but in this tag-free study the values are
<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>= 37 nM, 5-19-fold greater affinity.
<p>
In an X-ray structure of two CR domains binding RAP D3, the domains bind at an
acute angle to long axis of elongated D3, although less than two-thirds D3 length.
This structure indicated that more than two CR domains can bind D3.  So the 
triple CR constructs were made, and these had increased affinity to D3 (indicating
another CR provides more affnity), although the increase was about 3-11% increased
binding energy.  Data show that triple tandem CR domains do not improve binding
energy and two is sufficient.
<p>
In study of Ubq-CR56 binding with RAP D1 and D2, there were good binding affinities
of <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> 2.8 and 19 &micro;M, respectively.  Since D3 to CR binding
was higher valued using Trp fluorescence.  When CR did not contain domains 7 
and 8, the CR construct was even higher affinity for D1 and D2 than D3.  8% native
PAGE gels were set up with CR56 and D1, D2, D3 to look for gel mobility shift
related to binding: results confirm the fluorescence findings.  With two-CR domain
constructs, Kd values range from 19-54 nM; with three CR domains, affinity tightened
to D1 and D2 (6-18 nM).  CR78 and CR678 had signficantly weaker binding (Kd values
of 44-930 nM), although much more affinity than others studies for these RAP 
domains.
<p>
Another study reported that when pH is lowered, as would occur in ER&rarr;Golgi 
transitions, causing His ionizations in the domain would affect LRP-RAP binding.
The RAP D3 has a <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> ~42&deg;.  Temperature was increased from
22&deg; to 37&deg; at pH 7.4 between CR56 and D1, D2, D3.  Though the most stable
of the domains, D1 showed reduction in affinity (&lt; 2-fold), but D2 and the
least stable D3 showed increases in affinity by 2- and 5-fold.  In another 
experiment, the pH was lowered from 7.4 to 5.5 at 37&deg; and D2 and D3 showed
affinity reductions (2- and 6-fold, respectively); there were no changes in D1
affinity binding.  Another experiment asks:  how many double and triple tandem
CR fragments bind to <em>intact</em> RAP?   A gel shift assay reveals that 
two equivalents of (CR)<sub>2</sub> and (CR)<sub>3</sub> saturate the protein.
Quantitative binding studies to assess the binding of the first (CR)<sub>x</sub>
and second (CR)<sub>x</sub>.  CR456 and CR345 binding to RAP shows saturable 
binding, fitted to two tight binding sites.  CR56 also gives saturable binding
to two tight binding sites.
<p>
To examine the CR domain binding to RAP, excess CR56 or CR345 were added to RAP
and fractionated by size.  Isolated fractions were studied by sedimentation 
velocity.  Size-exclusion chromatography is able to separate complexes from 
unbound CR constructs, and elution suggests that RAP:CR56 = 1:2.1 and RAP:CR345 =
1:1.8.  Sedimentation coefficients <i>s</i><sub>20,w</sub> for the complexes
of 3.79 and 4.26 compared to 2.7 for RAP by itself are determined.  Molecular
masses of 53 kDa for RAP-CR56 complex, 66 kDa for RAP-CR345 and 38 kDa for RAP
alone which all consistent for 2:1 complexes for the CR:RAP binding.
<p>
Flourescence emission spectra have an advantage compared to ITC studies since 
latter experiments require higher protein concentrations.  Nonetheless to get 
another quantitative analysis that D1, D2, and D3 each bind tightly to CR 
fragments and that there are two high-affinity binding sites are present in 
intact RAP.  CR56 was chosed because ITC data exist form other studies (although 
it is a Ubq-CR56 construct).  Using a MicroCal VP ITCmeter at 25&deg;, CR56 is 
titrated with D1, D2, or D3 in 25-55 &micro;M concentrations added in 7-12 
&micro;l volumes.  A plot of changes in &micro;Cal/s per time is produced as the 
instrument as temperature is measured.  Both integrated and progressively summed 
heats are evaluated, and these are used to make Fraction Saturated vs. Molar 
Ratio plots that are fit by nonlin least squares assuming one-site binding model 
for just RAP domains, and two independent site for intact RAP using MicroMath's 
Scientist software.  From the ITC values, Kd values of 62, 270 and 77 nM for 
D1-D3, respectively are seen; compares to 20, 54, and 37 nM from the 
fluorescence data.  Lower affinities from ITC indicate the need to use higher 
protein concentrations and significant correction to raw heat data that must be 
made for the control titration of titrant into buffer.  However, for the 
UbqCR56-RAP Dx studies, the D1 value here is 62 nM compared to 2650 nM in other, 
D2 is 270 nM compared to 16,700 nM in other study, and 77 nM for D3 compared to 
126 nM.

TmPrime: fast, flexible oligonucleotide design software for gene synthesis
<p class="Para1">
PCR methods for long DNA seqeunces and their assembly are thermodynamically
balanced inside-out (TBIO), successive PCR, dual asymmetric PCR (DA-PCR), 
overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR), and PCR-based two-step DNA synthesis 
(PTDS).  With LCR assembly, nongapped consecutive oligos are ligated, while
with PCR assembly, the DNA fills in gaps and extends the oligos.  Uniform
annealing temperatures are the goals to prevent mismatched anneals.  For DNA
lengths &lt; 1 kb, DNA Works, Gene2Oligo, and Assembly PCR OligoMaker work
well.  Genes with long sequences are usually broken into 500 bp fragments,
assembled in separate pools, and then each fragment brought together in a final
PCR step for full length product.  GeneDesign and GeMS work for these multibase
gene syntheses.  This paper presents TmPrime optimized for very long gene
sequence (&le; 40 kb) using LCR and gapless PCR assembly.  Pairwise alignment
analysis is done to examine mis-annealing, hetero- and homodimer and hairpin
formations.  To reduce mispriming highly repetitive DNA seqeunces are assembled
using LCR.
<p>
The software divides input sequence into fragments.  In an Equi-space module,
the focus is on making fragments have close to equal length.  The average and
deviation of <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values are determined using nearest neighbor
model with SantaLucia's thermodynamic parameter using corrections for [salt]
and [oligo DNA].  Fragment lengths are then adjusted using using the 
Equi-<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> approach within user-specified limits.
<p>
In the analysis by modules, secondary structures (hetero- and homodimers,
hairpins), scores computed on matched bases and GC content using local pairwise
alignment are analyzed.  The window is 18 bases, iteratively calculated with
one base shifts.  Reports of location and type of structure are made on user-defined
threshold.  Mispriming reduction is done by constructing genes with highly
repetitive DNA using LCR assembly.  LCR requires stringent annealing before 
assembly can occur.

Changing From a Standard qPCR: Experiment to a Fast qPCR Experiment
<p class="Para1">
<b>Technical Article</b>.  In qPCR, which finds many applications across
many disciplines, is the use of a target sequence of cDNA or genomic DNA
is amplified quantitatively.  Steps are being taken to engineer this technique
for high thoughput.  Standard reaction times are 105 min but a fast protocol
has been developed which enables 45 min runs.   Optimization has involved
combining annealing and extension steps, improving tools for design of amplicon
and primers, and improving reagents that work under many reaction conditions.
No specialized equipment is required other than
<ol>
<li>thermal cycler with optical detection
<li>fast qPCR master mixes, specially designed
<li>PCR plates with uniform thin walls capable of rapid consistent heat transfer
</ol>
<p>Thermo Fisher Scientific's Genomic Business unit (UK) have been testing
reduction in protocol times using amplicons such as RNase P (80 bp target
from human genomic DNA), ApoB (74 bp), human albumin (104 bp), GADPH (226 bp).
Data show that reductions in assay times has not affected Cp values.
Factors which must be controlled for standard&rarr;fast conversion are
<ul>
<li>primer annealing rate
<li>GC percentage
<li>2ndary structure
<li>enzyme actitivy
<li>amplicon length
</ul>
<p>Amplicon length and 2&deg; structure are correlated, both affecting
amplification efficiency.  Most targets are designed to be &lt; 150 bp,
so the complications are less.  Standard qPCR is a three-step program 
after a 15 min 95&deg; activation in which the cycle is 15 s of denaturation
at 95&deg;, 30 s of annealing at 55&deg;, and 30 s of extension at 72&deg;.
With 45 cycles, including other times, the process takes more than 2 h to 
complete.  The standard two-step protocol merges steps
2 and 3, with no changes to the initial activation and denaturation step.
Steps 2 and 3 are 60 s at 60&deg;, again for 45 cycles, for a total time
of about 105 min.  A chemical modification to <i>Taq</i> polymerase enables
the ability of enzyme to work at lower temperature.
<p>Now with Fast qPCR improvements have been made to reduce the dwell times
(time once temperature is reached) such that activation is reduced from
15 min to 5 min, denaturation is done for only 1 s instead of 15 s,
and annealing/extension is 20 s instead of 60 s. The run is less than 1 h.
In doing fast qPCR, the following must be considered:
<ol>
<li>Primer design must be optimal or annealing will be rate-limiting.
Computations as to length and base content must strive for a 
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 60&deg;.  Use of modified bases in primers can be
done to increase <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> where possible.
<li><i>Taq</i> polymerase is chemically modified to enable activity at the
lower temperature.  Amplicon size has a significant effect on ability to
combine anneal and extension.  Amplicons are generally 75-300 bp by design,
and Taq often completes its work in far less time than the standard protocol
gives.  In general, the 20 s time set should be adequate for most well-designed
setups.  It has also been shown that denaturation often occurs well before
the 95&deg; limit has been reached, so a 15 s total time (5-7 s dwell) is
excessive.
</ol>
<p>
A primary concern is the temperature ramp rate on cycler blocks.  These 
engineering specs are crucial to time savings.  However work at the Genome
Business unit shows that reduced ramping rates are insignificant.  Instead
the more important factor was the master mix, and time savings were still
seen with a standard qPCR system.
<p>
The fast protocol can be used with qRT-PCR too using well-designed reverse
transcription kit.

Transport pathways for arsenic and selenium: a minireview
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  Arsenic from anthropogenic sources include herbicides and pesticides, wood
preservatives, animal feeds and semiconductors. Exposure to arsenic can lead to
cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease, neurological disorders,
diabetes mellitus and various forms of cancer. Water supplies in Bangladesh and
West Bengal have catastrophic levels. Inorganic arsenic, e.g. chromated copper
arsenate (CCA) has been used to treat wood against attack by fungi and insects.
If wood is not sealed the arsenic gets into food and water supply. Arsenic acid
(H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>) is sold as Dessicant L-10 and was called <q>
harvest aid for cotton</q> because it defoliates cotton to allow planting for
the next crop. Inorganic arsenic is found throughout the fields of the southern
U.S. although no longer in use. Now used for planting rice, it is the largest
non-seafood source of arsenic in the U.S. diet. Methylarsenate (MAs) and
dimethylarsenate (DMAs) salts (sodium and calcium) are used widely as
herbicides and pesticides. Weed-B-Gone Crabgrass Killer has an active
ingredient in calcium MAs. DMAs and MAs are used as a fungicide in golf courses
in Florida, and this arsenic enters the water supply.  DMAs is cacodylic acid
and defoliates cotton fields.  Roxarsone (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylarsonic acid)
is a growth enhancer and feed supplement for animal husbandry.  Because it is
ubiquitous, bacteria to humans have detoxification mechanisms that usually
have pumps to remove from the cytosol.  In bacteria the genes are usually under
operon control (<i>ars</i> resistance operons).  Usually they are three genes
<i>arsRBC</i>, and ArsR is the As(III)-inducible repressor, ArsB is a
As(OH)<sub>3</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter, and ArsC is a reductase to
convert As(V) to As(III) to include resistance against As(V).  Other <i>ars</i>
operons have the arrangement <i>arsRDABC</i>, for instance in the <i>E coli</i>
plamsid R773.  ArsA will complex with ArsB to catalyze an ATP-driven
As(III)/Sb(III) efflux and is more resistant to As(III) and As(V) than organisms
without ArsA.  ArsD is an arsenic metallochaperone transferring As(III) to
ArsA and increases its ability to extrude arsenite.  Note arsenicals and
antimonials are chemotherapeutic drugs to treat parasites and cancer, so
resistance is commonplace.
<p>
Selenium is also considered an environmental pollutant.  WHO indicates that the
maximum allowable concentration (MCL) in drinking water is 10 ppb (0.1 &micro;M).
It has chemical properties similar to arsenic in its valence shells, electronic
structure, and atomic radius.  Much of the selenium enters the environment
as SeO<sup>2</sup> produced by burning coal and fossil fuels.  Selenide and
the dioxide can cause respiratory tract injury when inhaled, as well as damage
to many other tissues (cardiovascular system, brain, muscle, kidney, liver).
Soluble forms of selenium are selenite and selenate [Se(IV) and Se(VI)], more
toxic and mobile than elemental selenium.  Despite toxicity at high concentation,
selenium is a micronutrient with an RDA ~ 0.8 &micro;g/kg body mass, and depending
on age and sex.  Acute Se deficiency (seen in China) results in Keshan disease,
involving enlarged heart and impaired cardiac function.  It is required for
thyroid hormone production, and deficiency affects thyroid function.
There are about 25 selenoproteins where selenocysteine substitutes for Cys.
These enzymes are peroxidases and oxidoreductases protecting from oxidative
stress:  human RBCs have a selenoCys-containing glutathione peroxidase that
catalyzes 2 GSH + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2 H<sub>2</sub>O +
O<sub>2</sub> + GSSG.  Selenium may protect against prostate cancer.  It also
protects against toxic metals and organics such as Pb, Cd, As, Hg, and parquat.
Note that Se may interact with As in cellular metabolism including uptake,
reduction, methylation, conjugation with GSH, and excretion.
<p>
Arsenic has no known nutritional or metabolic role and is toxic.  Uptake of
As(III) and As(V) is usually adventitious by existing uptake systems.  Arsenate
is a phosphate analogue and taken up by phosphate transporters in bacteria
and eukarya.  The Pit and Pst phosphate transporters in E coli take it up
(Pit is the major system), and yeast transporters are identified too.
Arsenic trioxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is a solid arsenite that will
dissolve to form arsenous acid [As(OH)<sub>3</sub>] at physiological pH.
The aquaporins are a family of proteins in pro- and eukarya that transport
arsenous acid.  More specifically the aquaglyceroporin branch is involved.
This is because the GlpF glycerol facilitator in <i>E coli</i> was identified
as the uptake system for As(III) and Sb(III).  The homologue in yeast
is Fps1p.  The human pathogen <i>Leishmania major</i> has the LmAQP1
aquaglyceroporin.
<p>
The S. cerevisiae Hxt glucose transporter permease family also advetitiously
facilitates arsenite uptake.  A total of 18 of these transporters in
<i>S. cerevisiae </i>, Hxt1p to Hxt17p, Gal2p, and two glucose sensors
Snf3p and Rgt2p, also facilitate.  When glucose is present transport is mostly
by Fps1p, but in the absence of glucose, 75% of transport is by Hxts.  These
fungal Glc transporters have the GLUT permeases as mammalian homologues, and
both human and rat GLUT1 and GLUT4 have been shown to catalyze As(III) and
methylAs(III) when heterologously expressed in yeast and frog oocytes.
GLUT1 is the major Glc permease in RBCs and epithlelial cells forming the
blood brain barrier.  GLUT4 is an insulin-responsive isoform which causes
uptake of As(III) and the methylated form.  Neither AQP9 nor GLUT1 can be
detected in adult cardiomyocytes by western analysis, the uptake of
inorganic and methylated arsenicals into cardiac cells by GLUT4 could be a
contributing factor in disease.
<p>
Selenium metabolism involves uptake/transport, reduction, methylation, and
then integration into selenoenzymes.  Se(VI) (selenate) is less toxic than
Se(IV) (selenite), just as As(V) is less toxic than As(III).  Just as
arsenate is moved by the phosphate ABC transporter in E coli, it is moved
by the sulfate ABC transporter complex encoded by <i>cysAWTP</i> operon.
The complex has two CysA ATP-binding proteins, two transmembrane proteins
CysT and CysW, and the periplasmic sulfate-binding protein CysP.  As
physiological pH, selenite is a divalent ion:  SeO<sub>3</sub><sub>2&minus;</sub>.
In yeast, S cerevisiae has Sul1p and Sul2p, identified from mutants resistant
to selenate.  Selenite transporters have not yet been identified in eukarya.
There is a low affinity selenite uptake system with K<sub>m</sub> = 0.44 mM
and a high affinity system with K<sub>m</sub> = 54 &micro;M, both inhibited by
glucose.  Yeast handle As(III) by forming As(GS)<sub>3</sub> glutathione complex
and moving them into yeast vacuole; the same is true for selenite detoxification
by sequestration into intracellular compartments.  Of interest is that
the mammalian aquaglyceroporins AQP7 and AQP9 are not channels for selenite
although they are for arsenite.

Aquaglyceroporins and metalloid transport: Implications in human disease
<p class="Para1">
<b>REVIEW</b>.  The sources of arsenic and antimony and the pathologies
they cause as well as their use as antiparasitic and chemotherapeutic
medicines has been described elsewhere in this document.  As(V) in solution
is found as H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub> (arsenic acid) and is a substrate
analogue of phosphate and thus a competitive inhibitor of phosphate-interacting
enzymes.  In most cases, phosphate concentration is multi-log fold greater than
arsenate so does not interfere.  Arsenate uptake occurs through phosphate
transporters in both pro- and eukarya.  As(III) forms are more toxic than
As(V).  Arsenate forms strong nearly covalent interactions with the thiols of
closely arrayed Cys residues and can inhibit protein function.  When
hydrated, arsenic trioxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) forms As(OH)<sub>3</sub>
and the hydroxide has a pKa of 9.2, so it is unionized in physiological solution.
<p>
Sanders et al (1997) tried to determine how the trihydroxy form (the most toxic)
was taken up on <i>E coli</i> by using the transposable element containing code
for alkaline phosphate gene, Tn<i>phoA</i>, to create insertional mutants.
Insertions generate blue colonies when the gene product of <i>phoA</i> is
exposed to the periplasmic space, which enriches for insertions in genes for
transporters.  A signle mutant OSBR1 was isolated that was resistant to Sb(III)
and also had a 90% reduction in the rate of As(III).  The glycerol transporter
GlpF was found to be involved, which has broad specificity for a wide range
of polyols, and as these metalloids at neutral pH in the environment likely
exist as triols, they are imported in this way.
<p>
Lin and coworkers discovered the glycerol uptake system in <i>E coli</i> in
the late 60s and early 70s, showing uptake is by faciliated diffusion.  In
1989 the <i>glpF</i> gene was sequenced and the next year is was cloned.
GlpF is a member of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) superfamily in which
water and small solutes (glycerol, urea) are transported without use of energy.
The MIP superfamily divides evolutionarily into aquaporins and water-specific
channels.  The aquaglyceroporins involve small uncharged molecule transport
(water, glycerol).  Both groups are expressed widely in all living organisms.
<p>
As(III) in inorganic form is believed to be an anion in solution, so how can
GlpF which takes up neutral species be a transporter?  As the pKa of arsenite
is 9.2 and is expected to be protonated, studies using X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) were used to determine nearest neighbor coordination
environment under many solution conditions.  Extended X-ray Absorption
Fine Structure (EXAFS) found three oxygen ligands at 1.78 &Aring; from arsenic
atom, indicating the major species is As(OH)<sub>3</sub>, and thus neutral
and a molecular mimic of glycerol.  Other structural thermodynamic, and
electrostatic comparisons of As(III) and Sb(III) showed both compounds
have similar conformation and charge distribution, with slightly smaller
volume than glycerol.
<p>
A legume symbiont <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> has an aquaglyceroporin that
is novel in arsenic detoxification.  With As(V) taken up in the cell by phosphate
transporters, it is reduced to As(III) by arsenate reductase ArsC, then extruded
by a downhill movement using AqpS, a homologue with sequence similarity to
GlpF.  This is the only example of an aquaglyceroporin with a physiological
role in arsenic resistance.
<p>
It was work to understand As(III) uptake in <i>E coli</i> that led to
understanding of chemical nature in solution and then uptake pathway in humans.
In yeast S. cerevisiae Fps1p is the GlpF homologue  glycerol channel involved in
osmoregulation.  Disruption of Fps1p led to As(III) and Sb(III) resistance,
as it mediates influx of metalloids in yeast.  In contrast cells with a
modified Fps1p that is constitutively open show sensitivity to arsenic and
antimony.  With high osmolarity, the Fps1p would be closed, and wild type
and <i>fps1&delta;</i> mutants have same degree of metalloid tolerance.  These
studies show that metalloid uptake is mediated by Fps1p and it plays a role
in tolerance.  Phosphorylation of Fps1p sites in N-terminus by MAPK homologue
Hog1p regulate As(OH)<sub>3</sub> influx in <i>S. cerevisiae.</i>.
<p>
Thirteen AQPs (designated 0 to 12) have been found in mammals so far.  The four
classical proteins are AQP3, 7, 9, and 10.  A Fps1p-deficient yeast was
use to express rat AQP9 showed a higher rate of uptake of the trihydroxides
of As and Sb than for the cells expressing <i>fps1</i> on a plasmid and for
cells resistant because they lacked functional Fps1p.  The ability of AQP9 and
to a lesser extent AQP7 to conduct As(III) was shown for cRNA injected into
X. leavis oocytes.  Little or no transport was shown by human AQP3 or AQP10.
Site-directed mutagenesis was doone in AQP9 to examine whether glycerol and
As(OH)<sub>3</sub> share a common channel.  Examination of the crystal
structures of bovine AQP1 and <i>E coli</i> GlpF using the homologue server
suggested that AQP9 F64 and R219 residues might be a selectivity filter.
The mutants R219A, R219K, F64A, F64T and F64W were generated.  The highly
conserved R219 was shown such that R219K did not alter function, so a positive
charge and not the arginine is required.  The Phe residue is thought to position
substrates near the Arg residue, but is not required for As(OH)<sub>3</sub> or glycerol
uptake.  Thus glycerol and arsenic trioxide use same pathway.
AQP9 is the primary liver isoform and the liver is the main detoxification organ.
Within liver As(OH)<sub>3</sub> is methylated by As(III)-S-adenosylmethionine
methyltranferase (AS3MT).  The methylated form is excreted in urin and feces.
The question arises as to how these forms find their way to other tissues
and the routes of efflux.  Studies of rat AQP9 shows that it does transport
the methyl-As(OH)<sub>2</sub> at an even higher rate than As(OH)<sub>3</sub>.
It is known that once

Expression of HBsAg and preS2-S protein in different yeast based system: a 
comparative analysis
<p class="Para1">
In HBV, S gene encodes the 226 amino acid S protein, the preS2-S gene encodes 
the 281 amino acid M (for middle) protein, and the 389 or 400 amino acid 
(depending on subtype) L (for large) protein.  All proteins share same reading 
frame and stop codon, but have different initiation sites.  All the proteins are 
antigens that cause protective neutralizing antibodies.  It has been shown that 
an <b>a</b> determinant induces the immune response and is common to all viral 
subtypes; this determinant is formed by amino acid 110-160 in the S protein, a 
hydrophilic region. Two pairs of mutually exclusive subtype determinants:  these 
are <b>d</b> or <b>y</b> and <b>r</b> or <b>w</b>.  Thus the possible 
determinant types on the S protein are <b>adr</b>, <b>adw</b>, <b>ayr</b> and 
<b>ayw</b>.  Finally there are nine major subtypes: <b>ayw1, ayw2, ayw3,
ayw4, adw2, adw4, ayr, adrq&minus;, adrq+</b>.  HBsAg assembles into 20-22 nm
Dane particles to be immunogenic:  this has been done in mammalian cell culture,
and as recombinants in <i>S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris</i> and <i>Hansenula
polymorpha</i>.  HBsAg vaccines have been made in Saccharomyces and Pichia and
in CHO cells.  It is believed that preS2 region inclusion can overcome
the problem with non- or slow responders to vaccines:  one report shows it
is immunogenic to B and T cells and produces neutralizing antibodies.
<p>
PreS2 contains polymerized albumin receptor site, involves in virus attachment
to human hepatocytes, and anti-preS2 occur earlier than anti-S Abs.

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/7208417">S</a> and 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/6907057">PreS2-S</a> genes
belonging to <i>ayw2</i> subtype (Group D) were cloned into yePDP1-8
and YEpiPT:  the former has a Gal10/cycl1 promoter inducible by galactose,
while the latter is under the control of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)
which is constitutive.  Strains are designated as IS, IP, CS, CP for
inducible and constitutive production of S and PreS2-S genes.  For 
Pichia host, a BamH1-KpnI fragment with S sequences (700 bp) and 
preS2-S sequences (850 bp) were purified and cloned into pPICZA (Invitrogen).
The four recombinants are cultured ind 100 ml minimal and rich media with
different carbon sources: glucose, glycerol, galactose, or EtOH.  Rich
media always produce better expression.  EtOH was a better substrate for
producing HBsAg and M proteins in constitutive and inducible systems.
With inducible strains, 2% galactose was better than 0.5%.  HBsAg (S protein)
in constitutive control is was optimal in 2% EtOH after 48 h; also true
for preS2-S (M) protein.  Inducible system gave higher levels of expression
compared to constitutive (as much as 50% higher).  Both IS and CS recombinants
produce 27 kDa on western, while the preS2-S recombinant in the IP strain
shows a proteolysis product (this has been noted in previous reports).  There
is no product see in the CP strain.
<p>
Recombinants produced in two Pichia host strains, GS115 (Mut<sup>+</sup>) and
KM71 (Mut<sup>S</sup>) were constructed into pPICZA expression vectors and
selected on zeocin.  Clones SG9 (S) and PG1 (preS2-S) in host GS115, and
clones SK4 (S) and PK6 (preS2-S) in host KM71.  To estimate gene copy number
Southern blot and Q-PCR was done on selected Mut<sup>S</sup> and Mut<sup>+</sup>
clones.  (Method: 1.5 cultures of Pichia transformants grown and cells
washed with 1 M sorbitol, 50 mM citric acid, 150 mM dipotassium hydrogen 
phosphate [SCP], then incubated in SCK + 10 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol,
0.3 mg/ml zymolyase pH 7 for 2 h 37&deg; to generate spheroplasts.  These
then lysed in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA at pH 8, 1% Sarkosyl.
Phenol-chloroform extraction with recovery by EtOH.  Equal quantities are DNA
digested with HindIII run on 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N+ nylon
probed with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled pPICZA/S plasmid, then autoradiographed.)
All clones but one showed single copy presence.  Confirmation of Southern blot
data was done using Q-PCR, with relative comparison to a &beta;-actin reference.
The SG9 clone was chosen as calibrator because Cot value of target (S) and
reference were about equal.  Using the &delta;&delta;Cot  the gene copy
values were found to be (strains in parentheses): 1 (SK3), 2.3 (SK4), 1.93 (PK2),
4.7 (PK6), and 8.8 (PG1).
<p>
The relationship between gene copy number and expression level in Pichia is
significant.

Multi-Probe Real-Time PCR Identification of Common <i>Mycobacterium</i> Species
in Blood Culture Broth
<p class="Para1">
Automated broth culture of infected blood is used to evaluate <i>M tuberculosis</i>
complex but takes considerable time.  PCR analysis of 16S rRNA gene and make
genus- and species-specific identification.  Mycobacterial isolates from
AIDS patients showed 38% were <i>M tuberculosis</i> and the rest non-tuberculosis
mycobacteria.
<p>
To design the primers and probes, the region of the 16S rRNA gene corresponding
to 18 mycobacterial species (some have alternate names) was isolated and subjected
to nucleotide alignment against an <i>E coli</i> 16S rRNA gene reference.
All accession numbers are in the text of article.  The entire aligned sequence
is 323 bases, and the forward and reverse primers span that border.  The FRET
probes Tb-fl, anchor with 3&prime;-FAM for <i>M tuberculosis</i> complex or
M-fl, anchor with 3&prime;-FAM for <i>M avium</i> and <i>M intracelluare</i>;
705-T, detection with 5&prime;-LCred705 for <i>M tuberculosis</i> complex,
640-A, detection with 5&prime;-LCred640 for <i>M avium</i>, and
610-I, detection with 5&prime;-LC-610 for <i>M intracellulare</i>.  All detection
probes have 3&prime;-phosphate and the synthesis of the 610-I probe is
degenerate at base 15 with both A and G present as a wobble.  The PCR
was in a LightCycler Real-Time PCR system version 2.0.  4 &micro;l LightCycler
FastStart DNA MasterPLUS Hybridization Probes kit was used so that there is
500 nM primer, 100 nM probes and 2 &micro;l DNA extract in final 20 &micro;l
volume.  A postamplification melting analysis is also possible.  In addition a
2% agarose gel is run to examine products.
<p>
A BLAST search was done to check if <i>M tuberculosis</i> TB-fl and 705-T were
sequence-specific.  GenBank database has 11 <i>M tuberculosis</i>, 7 <i>M bovis</i>,
3 <i>M africanum</i>, 2 <i>M microti</i>, 1 <i>M canetti</i> and 1 <i>M pinnepedii</i>
genomes.  There are 39 <i>M avium</i> strains in the database and the
M-fl and 640-T were 100% specific.  Three types of <i>M intracellulare</i> are
are collected in this analysis, although type differences cannot be determined.
<p>
As to sensitivity for detection in the broth cultures, limits for <i>M
tuberculosis, M avium,</i> and <i>M intracellulare</i> are 350, 600, and
650 CFU/ml or 0.7, 1.2, and 1.3 CFU per reaction, respectively.  Sensitivity
for bacteria spiked in blood samples for <i>M tuberculosis</i> and <i>M avium</i>
is 800 and 2000 CFU/ml (1.6 and 4 CFU/reaction).  Sensitivity was not affected
by combining in one reaction mixture.
<p>
341 clinical blood specimens in the broth culture showing positive were tested
with this system.  Initial reaction identified <i>M tuberculosis</i> and
<i>M avium</i> which were 186 and 128 of the samples, resp., matches to
conventional identification assays.  Samples showing negative were tested for
<i>M intracellulare</i>:  13 were positive with 8 having <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>
of type 1, 3 having type 2, and 2 of type 3.

<b>REVIEW</b>
A small DNA virus with features similar to retroviruses and prototype of the
<i>Hepadnaviridiae</i> family.  Hepatotropic viruses also found in woodchucks,
ground squirrels, tree squirrels, Peking ducks, and herons.  Belongs to eight
genotypes classed as A to H, based on sequence comparison.  Most genotypes
occurs in geographic distributions.
<p>
Electron microscopy reveals three types of virally-derived particles. Two of the 
types are spherical structures with 20 nm dia and filaments having various 
lengths but with a width of 22 nm.  The spheres are made of HBsAg and 
host-derived lipids, have no nucleic acid and are not infectious. The Dane 
particle is a true HBV virion and infectious, spherical, and double-shelled 
structure of 42 nm diameter, having lipid envelope with HBsAg surrounding 
nucleocapsid made of core protein (HBcAg) and the genome which is complexed with 
polymerase and packaged.  Genome encodes four overlapping open reading frames: 
S, C, P, and X.  The <i>S</i> orf encodes viral surface proteins and is 
structurally and functionally divided into pre-S1, pre-S2 and S regions.  The 
<i>C</i> orf encodes the core and precore regions. Multiple in-frame translation 
initiation codones make up the <i>S</i> and <i>C</i> genes.  <i>C</i> encodes 
nucleocapsid (which is HBcAg) or the HBeAg depending on translation initiation 
start.  Core protein self-assembles into capsid and has a highly basic 
C-terminal ragion which binds RNA.  Precore ORF codes for signal peptide 
directing the translation to ER where protein is secreted at HBeAg; it is 
believed to help the virus combat immunity as a tolerogen, allowing persistent 
or chronic infection.  The polymerase (P orf) encodes large ~800 aa protein that 
has three domains:  terminal domain is involved in encapsidation and initiating 
minus-strand synthesis; a reverse transcriptase domain to catalyze genome 
synthesis; and ribonuclease H domain to degrade RNA during replication.  The X 
orf makes a 16.5 kDa HBxAg whose functions include signal transduction, 
transcriptional activation, DNA repair, and inhibition of protein degradation. 
Its mechanism and function in biological life cycle have many unknowns though.
<p>
The genome features two direct repeats (DR1 and DR2) at 5&prime; end of plus
strand, required for DNA synthesis during replication.  En1 and En2 are 
enhancer elements for liver-specific expression of viral genes.  There is a
glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE) within S domain, a polyadenylation signal
in the core gene, and posttranscriptional regulatory element overlapping the
En1 and part of HBxAg orf are reported.
<p>
<b>Infection</b>.  Mature virions attach to host cell and this likely involves
pre-S domain of surface protein.  As to the receptor, various receptors for 
cell factor have been proposed, but carboxypeptidase D has been shown to have
role in virus entry for duck virus.

Rapid Identification of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and Nontuberculous
Mycobacteria by Multiplex, Real-Time PCR
<p class="Para1">
Gen-Probe AccuProbe can identify isolates of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>
complex (MTC) and <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex (MAC) but has no
probe sets for rapid growers of the <i>M chelonae-M abscessus</i> (MCAG)
group or the <i>M fortuitum</i> (MFG) group, which are 30% of pathogenic
mycobacteria.  Biochemistry, HPLC, and DNA sequencing identify specifically
members of the other set.  Lim et al (2008) recently reported a multiplex
real-time PCR that can distinguish 18 mycobacterial species, althought it
is too complex for routine laboratory;  the best method is PCR-based
restriction analysis.  This reports development and validation of multiplex
PCR to identify MTC and NTM of clinical value.
<p>
Hundreds of clinical isolates are part of the validation of the method.  Reference
strains with known <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values were obtained from ATCC;
a total of 20 reference strains are studied.  DNA extracted from loopful
cultures grown on Middlebrook 7H11 are suspended in 500 &micro;l type I water.
Mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT) (Becton-Dickinson) were subcultured
on blood agar to control for contamination and on 7H11 agar for purity and similarly
put in water.  Cells are spun down in 2 min at max microfuge speed and the
pellet resuspended in same volume water.  Sample is heated 95&deg; for 10 min
and then recentrifuged and supernatant PCR-tested.  Target sequences for this
PCR are the internal transcribed spacers (ITSs) of MTC ancd MCAG, the 16S rRNA
gene of MAC, MFG, and <i>M mucogenicum</i>, region of 16S rRNA common to all
members of <i>Mycobacterium</i>; IS<i>1311</i> of <i>M avium</i>, and the DT1
sequence of <i>M intracellulare</i>.  Primers from these are designed by
Clone Manager Professional Suite (Science &amp; Educational Central).   Some
primers are common on the reverse (anti-sense).  Primers are given in Table
2.
<p>
Primers are mixed into one of two reaction tubes.  The real-time PCR is
in a 25 &micro;l volume.  1.25 &micro;l of 10&times; multiplex primer mix
is added, then 3.75 &micro;l water, 12.5 &micro;l of 2&times; FastStart
SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche), and 7.5 &micro;l extracted mycobacterial DNA.
The Cepheid SmartCycler II real-time PCR is used and it monitors SYBR green
fluorescence.  After amplification is complete, a melting point analysis is
performed and melting curves analyzed to get <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> values.
Amplifications where fluorescence <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> is between 20-35 are
considered positive (max 40 cycles); melting curves are taken only from this
range.  The peak intensity was also evaluated:  if &lt; 20 U, reaction considered
negative.  Intensities &ge; 40 U are positive, while those between 20-40 U are
judge indeterminate.  The possible results are given in the methods and how
to evaluate whether MTC, MCAG, or MFG is involved.  In addition, samples were
amplified with primers common to the 16S rRNA gene and the 1.5 kb amplicon
visualized on 1% agarose on an ABI 3730 genetic analyzer.
<p>
This particular configuration can identify 93% of all pathogenic mycobacteria.
MTC and MAC are identified in a single tube.  The three most common rapidly
growing mycobacteria MCAG, MFG and <i>M mucogenicum</i> are identified in a second
tube.  The multiplex analysis is based on <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>.  Blind testing
of clinical isolates was done: cultures were 7H11 agar or MGIT cultures.
1559 targets were evaluated and PCR gave congruent results for 99.8% of these.
The multiplex PCR had 100% sensitivity for MTC, MCAG, and <i>M. mucogenicum</i>
(one indeterminate result was excluded), 99% for MAC, and 95% for MFG.
Specificities were 100% for MTC, MAC, MCAG, and MFG, and 99.7% for
<i>M mucogenicum</i>.  For MGIT cultures, sensitvity and specificity were 100%
for all groups and complexes.
<p>
Aside from evaluating ribosome gene targets, multiplexed primers for
IS<i>1311</i> for <i>M avium</i> and <i>M intracelluare</i> were examined.
The IS<i>1311</i>- and DT1-specific primers were 76% sensitive for identifying
MAC isolates and DT1-specific primers failed to identify 13 isolates shown
to be <i>M intracellulare</i> using the 16S rRNA primers.   The <i>M kansasii</i>
speicificity was tested as well with both reaction 1 and 2 and only the
<i>Mycobacterium</i> gene control peak was seen.

Twenty-five years of quantitative PCR for gene expression analysis
<p class="Para1">
qPCR was originally intended to quantitate DNA as for viral load, but can be
used to quantitiate RNA as well.  Determinations were end-point at first, but
with fluorescent tags, <em>real time</em> qPCR determinations are now the norm.
qPCR is adept at many applications, such as looking for gene deletion and 
duplication.  Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) can measure 
mRNA, miRNA, and other RNA species levels.  RT-qPCR is the gold standard with 
respect to validating microarray discoveries, in part because it is high throughput
(rapid, dealing with large count of samples).  It is also useful for monitoring
biomarkers.  When referring to <b>gene expression</b> this generally means the
determination of mRNA levels, but with micro RNAs (miRNAs), other regulating
RNAs have been included, and small nuclear and nucleolar and piwi-interacting
RNAs.  Northern blotting was developed in 1977 for analyzing denaturing gel
electrophoresis and had been used to quantify RNA levels semi-quantitatively.
The Northern remains useful for study of RNA degradation and transcript size,
with the possibility that nonspecific hybridization can complicate data 
interpretation and radiolabeling is often necessary.  Detection, quantification,
and characterization of RNA species by RNase protection provides both specificity
and sensitivity.  With PCR and assuming 100% efficiency in replication, 20 cycles
produces 10<sup>6</sup> copies (amplification).  Unfortunately this also can 
magnify errors as well.  In fact, a 95% efficiency of amplification means 
amplification is only 600,000 over 20 cycles, a 40% difference over the fully 
efficient.  At a minimum, the amplification should be equal, if not perfect.
<p>
With end point qPCR, products can be visualized on EtBr-stained agarose gels
adding a time-consuming method lacking a large range of quantitation as well as
sensitivity.  PCR itself to the end point shows an exponential/linear and plateau
phase where substrates become exhausted and/or enzyme activity is lost.  In
general endpoint qPCR might be useful to show an on-off/yes-no/expression-no-expression
relationship.  The advantage of real time PCR is that quantitation occurs with
each PCR cycle.  Strategies for increasing the signal of fluorescence with 
amplification vary according to manufacturer (there are multiple methods):
<p>
Applied Biosystems' TaqMan produces fluorescence from a hydrolysis of
the formed double stranded product.  :  <i>Taq</i> DNA polymerase has a 5&prime;&rarr;3&prime;
exonuclease which degrades a nonextendable fluorescent DNA probe after hybridization.
Sequence-specific TaqMan probes are labeled with fluorophore (fluorescein [FAM]
and quencher [rhodamine TAMRA] at 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends, respectively, 
and FRET is responsible for quenching.  With hybridization, the exonuclease 
cleaves away the fluorophore and quencher, freeing the flourophore to show its
fluorescence.  With different probes and different fluorophores, the quantitation
can be multiplexed to show multiple genes in a single reaction.
<p>
The Roche LightCycler technology uses a probe at both 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends
with 3&prime; phosphorylated to prevent extension.  Primers hybridize to target
in head-to-tail configuration and bring fluorophores to close proximity.  An LED
excites a <q>donor</q> fluorophore whose emission excites an acceptor via FRET
again.  The difference between LightCycler and TaqMan is that the former does
not require probe hydrolysis;  in addition, PCR is done in glass capillaries 
for more rapid air-controlled cycling and reaction times are cut in half.  However
Roche recently created a thermal block for 96- and 384-well microplates with 
multiplexing to increase throughput.
<p>
Invitrogen developed the LUX (Light Upon eXtension) system with a fluorogenic
hairpin primer.  The 3&prime; end features the fluorphore and the 5&prime; the 
quencher which are mated as a single strand hairpin.  During hybridization, they
unfold either to be part of the amplification cycle (fluorescence increases)
or to refold into the hairpin (fluorescence does not change).  This is a very 
sensitive approach compared to other qPCR methods, and can detect less than 
100 copies of the targets.  Melting curve analysis needs to be done with this
technology to identify genuine products vs. reaction artifacts.
<p>
<b>Molecular beacons</b> form stem-loop hairpins where the loops are 
complementary to the gene target and stems forming the ends are complementary to
each other.  Design of beacons is such that formation of a quenching hairpin is
favored thermodynamically over hybridization to inexact matches.  Compatible with
multiplexing but needs performance evaluation characterization before experimentation
since thermodynamic and hybridization properties vary; melting curve analysis is
also necessary to verify the product.
<p>
Like ethidium bromide, SYBR Green fluoresces when binding to ds DNA.  Intercalating
dyes show now sequence dependence and are inexpensive.  They can not be used in 
multiplexing since they do not discriminate gene sequences as fluorophoric probes 
do
<p>SYBR Green and other intercalating dyes associate with double-stranded product,
increasing fluorescence signal as the product increases

Overlap extension PCR cloning: a simple and reliable way to create recombinant 
plasmids
<p class="Para1">
This method clones without prior use of restriction endonucleases or T4 DNA
ligase.  A primer is used that is chimeric in that contains both long stretches
of vector plasmid sequence and the insert sequence, to create the insert in
PCR amplification that contains vector plasmid sequence on both ends.  The 
double-stranded vector and the insert-with-vector-sequences molecules are
mixed in denaturing conditions, allowed to anneal with the insert-with-vector
also annealing with the vector to create a loop, and then a special <i>Taq</i>
polymerase is present to elongate the sequences.  After cycle 1, a plasmid
is formed which essentially is the vector + insert.  As the cycle is repeated
more molecules are created.  The vector alone is not really present, since it
has no primer to replicate it.
<p>
This system has been tested with genes for GFP (<i>gfp</i>), &beta;-D-glucuronidase
(<i>gusA</i>), &beta;-galactosidase (<i>lacZ</i>), and the entire <i>luxABCDE</i>
operon.  A second PCR using circular plasmid template is done with the original
templates destroyed using the <i>Dpn</i>I enzyme.
<p>
Many PCR-based cloning approaches include TA cloning, ligation-independent cloning,
and PCR-mediated cloning.  TA cloning and LIC require end modifications that
cannot be monitored by gel electrophoresis.  These also require proprietary 
recombinases, and optimizing the in vitro recombination reactions is usually not
done.  This method makes use of overlap extension PCR cloning.
<p>
The first PCR done is basically to add vector sequences to both ends of the 
insert.  These will serve as primers for the vector itself, as it is wholly
replicated.  The trick involves using a DNA polymerase that shows good fidelity
and life in replicating a large vector sequences.  The NEB Phusion DNA polymerase
(Cat F-530) can do that.  It leaves a nicked double-stranded plasmid which 
is then transformed into the bacterial host.
<p>
In a test, chimeric primers complementary to pQE30 vector amd <i>gfp</i>
(5&prime; ends vector, 3&prime; ends insert) were tested with five different
DNA polymerases.  It is important to use high concentrations of the insert+vector
as primer sequence, and to use annealing temperatures that are 5-10&deg; below
estimated melting temperature of the primer/plasmid complex.  The pQE30 vector
itself is then digested with <i>Dpn</i>I.  Phusion DNA polymerase proved the
best with its superior processivity and fidelity; it is 10-fold more processive
than native <i>Pfu</i> polymerase (Stratagene 600135), producing 46-fold more
positive colonies.  It produced 35-fold more colonies than Roche Expand Long
Template DNA Polymerase mix (Cat 11681834001).  <i>Taq</i> polymerase is relative
processive (60% to that of Phusion) but fidelity is only 3.8% that of Phusion.
&gt;98% of colonies transformed from Phusion were green and had minimal cloning
error or carryover of original vector.
<p>
The number of recombinant clones peaked at 17-18 cycles, and further cycles result
in decrease of quantity of clones.  Different ratios of vector:insert were tried
(1:5, 1:50, 1:250) in the overlap extension cloning.  All three produce amplicon
but the 1:250 produced the most clones.
<p>
The next step was to examine amplicon length.  GFP (<i>gfp</i>, 1 kb), 
&beta;-D-glucuoronidase (<i>gusA</i>, 1.9 kb), &beta;-galactosidease (<i>lacZ</i>,
3.2 kb) and the <i>luxABCDE</i> operon (6 kb) were tested.  All of them worked
as tested by restriction analysis and by reporter protein function.  Colony
number did however relate to insert length, decreasing with the increase in 
insert length.  The plot line is linear and suggest there is an upper limit of
6.7 kb for inserts using this technique.
<p>
In troubleshooting, yields might be poor if conditions are too stringent 
(primers do not anneal) or too relaxed (non-specific priming).  These lead to
empty lanes on agarose gels, although nonspecific priming might also show as
smears or unwanted bands.  Factors affecting success include template and
primer concentration and ratio, annealing temperature, buffer components
(magnesium, pH, DMSO), and cycle count.
<p>
Primers were made by IDT.  Insert DNA sources were from <i>Photrhabdus
luminescens</i> ATCC 29999 for the <i>lux</i> operon, amplicons for <i>lacZ</i>
and <i>gusA</i> from <i>E coli</i> K12, the vector pCA24N to obtain <i>gfp</i>.
0.8% Seakem LE agarose gels (Lonza Rockland) were used to examine amplicons with
NEB 1 kb ladder as markers.  Enzymes were from NEB.  Gel purification of DNA
were done using QIAquick-gel extraction kits (QIAGEN).  BioBricks were assembled
using NEB BioBricks.
<p>
The Inoue et al method was used to make chemically competent <i>E coli</i>.
1 &micro;l of overlap extension PCR was used with 20 &micro;l of competent cells.
Transformants in 250 &micro;l transformation medium are spread on LB agar with
antibiotic and 0.1 mM IPTG.  Constructs conform to BioBricks standard.
<p>

A custom BioBrick-accepting vector (pIMBB) was created by cloning an mcs 
composed of 
<i>Eco</i>RI-<i>Not</i>I-<i>Xba</i>I-<i>Sph</i>I-RBS-<i>Nco</i>I-<i>Eco</i>RV-<i>Hin</i>dIII-<i>Spe</i>I-<i>Not</i>I-<i>Pst</i>I 
into <i>Dra</i>III and <i>Afl</i>III sites of pSL1880 (Amersham).  It features 
the ColE1 origin and &beta;-lactamase and sites for <i>Eco</i>RI, <i>Not</i>I, 
<i>Xba</i>I, <i>Spe</i>I, and <i>Pst</i>I only in the mcs. BioBricks cloned into 
plasmid can work with BioBrick-standardized constructs.
<p>
The table below shows synthetic oligos and primers used for this study of
OE-PCR. Primers 278 and 279 are used for amplifying <i>gfp, gusA, lacZ</i>
and the LUX operon from pIMBB for cloning into pQBAV3Cam.  Primers 278 and
280 were used for amplifying <i>gfp</i> from pIMBB-gfp into pQBAV2ACam.  
The cycle program is (1) inital:  100&deg; for 2 min (2) 94&deg; at 30 s
(3) 60&deg; for 30 s, (4) 68&deg; for 90 s per kb for 30-32 cycles, then (5)
68&deg; for 10 min.  These amplicons are gel-purified before using as megaprimers.
<p>
For the overlap extension PCR phase, primer design should be tested with 
Primer3, Primer Design, or Primer-BLAST.  Desirable insert points on the vector
are selected.  They might be close in proximity to each other, or better is
50 to several hundred bases apart.  Select 30-40 bp upstream of the left point on
the top strand of the vector.  Copy the sequence and estimated its <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>,
edit it so that the <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> falls to between 60-65&deg;.  Do the
same for the right-side insertion point.  Call the left and right vector hybridization
sequences as primers C and D, respectively.  Primers A and B will be the 5&prime;
and 3&prime; seqeunces of the insert ends, similarly optimized for the temperature
range.  For synthesizing the oligo, the 3&prime; end of primer C is attached
to 5&prime; end of primer A, and 3&prime; end of primer D is attached to
5&prime; end of primer B (the reverse complement).
<p>
In particular, the vector-hybridizing part of the chimeric primer should have
a high GC content and relatively low annealing temperature.  Also high molar
excess insert:vector (&gt; 100:1) should be used.  An acceptor vector of about
3-30 ng is mixed with 250-fold excess of insert in 10 &micro;l reaction containing
Phusion DNA polymerase.  Denaturation is 30 s at 98&deg;, 30 s at 60&deg;, and
68&deg; for 90 s per kb for 5-30 cycles.  10 min at end of program for exitension
is also done.  Note that at the end, the <i>Dpn</i>I enzymes is added to break
down unaltered vector (it is compatible with Phusion polymerase buffer, 10 U
is enough) for 1 h 37&deg;.  This enzyme targets methylated DNA and cleave 
template isolated from <i>E coli</i>.  It does not target PCR products.
<p>
To test whether repeated elements affect the OE-PCR.  Chimeric primers were
used to amplify the <i>gfp</i> gene in tandem with T5 promoter/lac operator.
This T5 promoter/lac operator is present in pQE30 vector.  The insert had
three regions identical to those on the vector.  Primers were placed so that
the ampicillin resistance gene was eliminated from the construct.

Plastic versus glass capillaries for rapid-cycle PCR
<p class="Para1">
<b>Short Technical Report</b>.  Rapid cycle PCR first shown in 1990s with cycle 
times of 20-60 s and usually completing 10-30 min.  These instruments use 
circulating air to control temperature and glass capillaries.  Denaturing and 
annealing times are effectively near zero.  Air-heated glass capillaries usually 
control temperature using tubular thermocouple monitors.  New plastic 
capillaries were evaluated recently in a compariso to glass.  The Schott glass 
capillaries have an diameters of 1.53 (o.d.) and 1.17 (i.d.) mm, with wall 
thickness range from 174-187 &micro;m and a 2.8 surface area to volume ratio, 
with a thermal conductivity of 0.5-1.4 / Wm K. The Topas Advanced Polymers 
plastic capillary have a base and tip with diameters of 2.42 (o.d.) and 1.81 
(i.d.) mm at the base, and 2.12 (o.d.) and 1.53 (i.d.) mm at the tip;  wall
thickness ranging fro 235-327 &micro;m in the bse and 220-405 &micro;m at the
tip;  surface area-to-volume of 2.17/mm, and thermal conductivity of 0.12-0.15 /
Wm K.  Wall thicknesses vary at a much higher level in plastic because they
are tapered for injection molding.  A 23% less SA-to-V ratio in plastic is
attributable to variations in diameters as well.  In addition plastic has
7-fold lower thermal conductivity.
<p>
The rapid cycle program was such that temp was 95&deg; and 55&deg; with no
hold time, and 75&deg; for 5 s for extension.  Plots of the temperature monitor
shows that glass reach the temperature highs and lows much more rapidly, while
plastic never does reach the extremes its response is much slower.
<p>
In a performance test, human genomic (<i>ACVRL1</i> and <i>APOE</i>) and plasmid 
(pBR322) DNA were tested.  These are tested because they represent moderate 
lengths (225-300 bp) and moderately high GC content (61-75%).  Real time PCR 
plots with glass and plastic under same cycle conditions show a threshold rise 
about cycles 20-25, but plastic shows nothing for the human genes and only a 
late rise at cycle 35 for pBR322.  In addition melting point analysis 
(fluorescence vs. melting point temperature) and agarose gel electrophoresis of 
products revealed that the products were absent in plastic capillaries, present 
in the glass. If 5 and 10 s holding times were added to the denaturation and 
annealing, only the <i>APOE</i> targets were successfully amplified in plastic 
capillaries.
<p>
A plot of temperature vs. holding time was done for both denaturation and
annealing, and it essentially reveals that a minimum of 20 s is required to
reach target temperature for the plastic.  It might be the case that plastic
performs better in a truly rapid cycle program with products having lower
GC content, but slower annealing could affect specificity.  Rapid cycle PCR
provides shorter turnarounds (10-30 min) and enhanced specificity.

done on all isolates.  DNA is extracted by getting loopful from L-J agar
and suspending in 100 &micro;l sterile water, and 100 &micro;l 10% Chelex
suspension is added and the tube heated 45 min at 45&deg; then 5 min at
100&deg;.   Samples are microfuged 5 min and supernatant used for PCR.
Resistance genotyping was done using the setup of Marin et al (2004).  Method
of Torres et al was a single reaction tube that can detect RIF and INH.
All PCR conditions were the same except that 45 cycles were done from the
Torres et al method.  Negative control was water and positive was H37Rv
DNA.  The instrument is a LightCycler.

A review of HIV testing and counseling policies and practices in the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region
<p class="Para1">
Eastern Mediterranean Region of World Health Organization (WHO/EMRO) has a low
coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for many reasons, in part because 
country-specific policies and practices contribute to limited coverage.  There
is also limited coverage for prevention, treatment and care services at risk
of HIV.  There are 22 states who are WHO members in EMR, all of them Islamic.
From 1995-2008, these countries reported to WHO/EMRO a total of 55 million HIV
tests performed, of which 36 million were done to assess blood transfusion 
safety.  Nearly 60% of tests were done on migrant and foreign workers; 4%
were done on most-at-risk populations, usually injecting drug users (IDUs),
men having sex with men (MSM), sex workers, and prison inmates.  8.1% were
done in healthcare settings, usually services providing TB, sexually transmitted
infection, and antenatal care.  2.1% of those tested were suspected of having
AIDS.
<p>
Of HIV cases 23.4% were from at-risk populations, and 21% were suspected AIDS
cases.  Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) detected 17.5%, and TB/STI/ANC
and blood recipients were 17.3% of cases.  Migrant worker testing found cases
that were 13% of total.  Counts of health testing and counseling services varied
between these countries, with a low of 8 individuals per service in Saudi Arabia
to a high of nearly 9000 per service in Oman.  17 of the 22 EMR countries had
national policies on HIV testing and counseling.  Mandatory testing is widespread
in all countries.  Testing for visa application was required for foreign residents
and migrant workers.  Similar testing was done for sex worker, MSM, and IDU
upon arrest, admission to healthcare facility or prison intake.  Other policies
included screening donated blood (w/ donor consent) and confirming status of
blood and organ donations screening positive (no donor consent).
<p>
A policy for rapid HIV testing was not prominent in EMR countries.  Lab-based
ELISA and western blot confirmation were typical.  Pakistan, Morocco, Egypt,
and Lebanon introduced rapid testing in point of service settings such as VCT
sites.  These countries do a rapid test on site, then follow with ELISA and
western blot at central labs if the screen is positive.

Rapid Detection of Multidrug-Resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by Use
of Real-Time PCR and High-Resolution Melt Analysis
<p class="Para1">
WHO estimated that 1 in 3 of world's population is infected with <i>M
tuberculosis</i>.  In 2007, est. 1.77 million died from this disease.
Multi-drug (MDR) resistant <i>M tuberculosis</i> is defined as resistant to the
two best first-line drugs, RIF and INH. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR)
strain is additional resistance to a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin,
moxifloxicin, etc.) and an injectable (kanamycin, capreomycin, or amakacin),
the two best classes of second-line drugs.  5% of new TB cases are MDR,
and 1 in 10 of those is XDR.  In the past 30 years no new drugs have been
developed or approved. RIF targets the &beta;-subunit of the RNA polymerase
encoded by <i>rpoB</i> gene.  Most resistance is due to an 81 bp region
of the <i>rpoB</i> called the <b>rifampcin resistance determinant region</b>
(RRDR).  98% of RID resistance is found in this region.  As for INH resistance
the most common feature is mutations in the <i>katG</i> catalase-peroxidase
gene which activates INH, in which 50% of the resistance is attributable to
codon 315 mutation.  Less common is a mutation in the promoter of the
<i>inhA</i> gene encoding enoyl-ACP reductase required for mycolic acid
biosynthesis, which account for 34% of resistance.  These mutations can be
seen as SNPs falling into four classes.  Class I SNPs are transitions which
are purine&rarr;purine or pyrimidine&rarr;pyrimidine base changes.  Class II,
III, and IV are all transversions from purine&rarr;pyrimidine and vice versa:
Class II are A/C&rarr;C/A or T/G&rarr;G/T, class III are C/G&rarr;G/C and
class IV are A/T&rarr;T/A.
<p>
Tests are being designed to look for drug resistance at the nucleotide level.
Direct sequencing is perhaps the most definitive but it is costly and not
easily available.  The Hain Lifescience GenoType <i>MTB</i>DR<i>plus</i>
assay is useful but requires 8 h to complete and excellent training for
interpretation.  High-resolution melting is another technique by which to
potentially identify drug-resistance.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>. <i>M tuberculosis</i> cultures were grown at 37&deg; and reached
saturation using FastPrep method. Primers for <i>rpoB, katG</i> and <i>inhA</i> 
promoter region were made for producing amplicons to be treated with ExoSAP-IT 
(Affymetrix) then diluted 1:10 for sequencing on ABi 3130xl genetic analyzer. 
Primers and probes for real-time PCR were developed for four targets: rpoB-F, 
5&prime;-GCCGCGATCAAGGAGTTCT-3&prime; and rpoB-R 5&prime;-ACGTCGC
GGACCTCCAG-3&prime; amplify a 152 bp fragment encompassing the RRDR. IS6110-F, 
5&prime;-CCACCATACGGATAGGGGA-3&prime; and IS6110-R, 5&prime;-TGGA
CCGCCAGGGCT-3&prime; amplify a 179 bp fragment within MTC-specific region of 
IS<i>6110</i>. SNP transversions within <i>rpoB</i> are identifed by a Beacon 
Designer-determined use of lock-nucleic acid probes to detect A&rarr;T changes 
in strains at Asp56 and His526. These are rpoB-LNA-D516V
5&prime;-Quasar705-aattcaTggTccAgaAcaa-BHQ2-3&prime; and rpoB-LNA-H5626L
5&prime;-CalRd610-gtTgaCccTcaAgc-BHQ2-3&prime; where capital letters are a locked base.
Note that the 5&prime; ends are fluorescently labeled. and the 3&prime; ends
have Black Hole Quencher 2.  The <i>rpoB</i> is a duplexed assay.
The <i>katG</i> and <i>inhA</i> promoter are singleplex assays.  Primers were
chosen to amplify 123 bp region of <i>katG</i> katG-F
5&prime;-TCGTATGGCACCGGAACC-3&prime; and
katG-R 5&prime;-CAGCTCCCACTCGTAGCC-3&prime;. The probe is designed to check
a G&rarr;C change causing a Ser315Thr change:  katG-LNA-S315T,
5&prime;-Q670-atcaCcaCcgGcaTcg-BHQ3-3&prime;.  Primers for <i>inhA</i>
promoter are inhA-F 5&prime;-CGTTACGCTCGTGGACATAC-3&prime; and
inhA-R 5&prime;-GTTTCCTCCGGTAACCAGG-3&prime;.    A 25 &micro;l reaction is
set up with a Invitrogen Universal SYBR GreenER qPCR kit using 12.5 &micro;l
of 2&times; master mix, 5 &micro;l template, and nuclease-free water (Promega).
All primers are at 100 nM, while <i>katG</i> LNA probe is 250 nM, <i>rpoB</i>
LNA 516 probe is 500 nM, <i>rpoB</i> LNA 526 probe is 1 &micro;M.  The
Qiagen Rotor-Gene 6000 is used to do PCR with 2 min at 95&deg; followed by
45 cycles of 15 s at 95&deg; then 30 s at 63&deg; with 4 channels read at
63&deg; (green, orange, red, crimson).  High resolution melting is then done
between 80 to 89&deg; at rate of 0.02&deg; per step.  Controls and unknowns
were necessarily diluted so that <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> were between 19 and 29.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  252 clinical isolates were obtained and subjected to resistance
typing.   There were 29 different types or combinations fo mutations in <i>rpoB</i>,
5 unique types or combinations for <i>katG</i> and two types or combinations
of <i>inhA</i> promoter mutations.  There is a workflow algorithm describes
how to do the assay and analyze results.   A SYBR Green-based amplification
is followed by HRM.  Transversions are likely to affect melting points
far more sharply than transitions.  HRM analysis cannot alone detect all
possible mutations, especially transversions.  LNA probes were used to target
the most common transversion SNPs.   Tube 1  is a multiplexed PCR with
primers specific for IS<i>6110</i> and the <i>rpoB</i> RRDR from MTC.  The
IS<i>6110</i> marker underwent melt curve analysis to confirm samples were
MTC strains.  Curves had to two peaks, one for <i>rpoB</i> and another for
IS<i>6110</i>.  The <i>rpoB</i> primers also amplify some NTM bacteria
such as <i>M avium, M chelonae</i> and <i>M abscessus</i>.  If there is
amplification, then only one melt peak is seen for IS<i>6110</i>.  In some
cases no IS<i>6110</i> peak is observed in samples confirmed to be MTC
and this is because there are sometimes varying amounts of insertion element
present between strains.
<p>
HRM profiling was done with RIF resistance by careful comparison to control
strains who transversions and transitions were established.  Generally the
wildtype melt curve is established and anything deviating from it is
considered a RIF resistant strain for the <i>rpoB</i> profile.  As SNP
transversions were less distinct, LNA probes were required.  Amplification
signal in one of the LNA probe color channels indicate this RIF resistance,
while no amplification shows RIF susceptibility.
<p>
After the determination that an isolate was MTC and that RIF resistance was
established, real-time PCR and HRM was done for <i>katG/inhA</i>.  If a
<i>katG</i> maker was found with HRM and positive amplificaiton with
LNA probe for S315T mutation, then INH resistance is established.  Samples
curves are compared to wildtype, G&rarr;A SNP transition mutation, and LNA
probe SNP transversion mutation (G&rarr;C).

High-Resolution Melting Curve Analysis for Rapid Detection of Rifampin
and Isoniazid Resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Clinical Isolates
<p class="Para1">
In this method high-resolution melting analysis is used to determine a genotype
of rifampin or isoniazid resistance without the use of probes.  DNA is amplified
and during melting in the presence of LC Green, SYT09, or Eva Green, these dyes
saturate DNA unlike SYBR Green.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b> Clinical isolates with a mix of RIF-resistant, INH-resistant
and susceptible samples were tested.  As references teh H37Rv ATCC 27294 strain
was a control.  All isolates had been subcultured on L-J medium slant and DNA
was extracted by suspending 10 &micro;l loopful into 400 &micro;l TE pH 8, heating
to 80&deg; for 20 min (to sterilize) adding lysozyme to 1 &micro;g/&micro;l and
heating 37&deg; for 24 h.  6 &micro;l of 10 &micro;g/&micro;l proteinase K
and 70 &micro;l 10% SDS are added in incubation done for 10 min at 65&deg;.
80 &micro;l of N-acetyl-N,N,N&prime;-trimethylammonium bromide is added.  Containers
are vortexed briefly then sit for 10 min at 65&deg;  An equal volume of
24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol is added with 10 s vortexing. After microfuging
5 min, 0.6 vol isopropanol added and tubes left in &minus;20&deg; for 20 min,
spun 15 min, and pellet washed once in 70% EtOH.  Resuspension is in 20 &micro;l
of 0.1 &times; TE.  The table below shows primers used.  The 109 bp amplicon
for primer set rpoB-F/R contains codons 516-539, and 121 bp amplicon is produced
by primer set rpoB-516F/R and contains codone 508-536.  For INH resistance
the katG-F/R primer set amplifies 120 bp fragment containg codon 315 and
inhA-F/R produces a 126 bp fragment with a C&rarr;T transition at nt &minus;15
of <i>inhA</i>. Template and primers are added to the Quantace Sensimix
HRM kit with Eva Green dye. A Corbett Life Science Rotor-Gene 6000 is used.
H37Rv serves as a negative control.

<b>REVIEW</b>. 
Abs are used for research by methods of Western blot (WB), immunoprecipitation 
(IP), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative immunofluorescence 
(QIF), and immunohistochemistry (IHC).  In clinical use ELISAs, flow cytometry, 
and IHC are used.  For example, IHC is used to assess the estrogen receptor 
&alpha; (ER-&alpha;) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). The 
importance of Ab validation is because it is used to determine the use of costly 
therapies.  This work focuses on assessmetn of prognostic and predictive 
cancer-related biomarkers using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues.
<p>
<b>Validation</b> is defined by FDA as a process demonstrating through use of 
specific lab investigations that performance characteristics of an analytical 
method is suitable for its intended analytical use.  In the case of Abs, this is 
a demonstration of specificity, selectivity, and reproducibility in the context 
in which they are used.  In case of FFPE, variables to be evaluated include 
fixation time and where it is inadequate, differences in fixative chemistry, and 
tissue processing affecting antigenicity (reactivity to antibodies). Michel et 
al recently showed 49 antibodies against 19 subtypes of G protein-coupled 
receptors lacked target specificity and called for more stringent antibody 
validation.  In one case, mice with no M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>3</sub> 
muscarinic receptor subtypes still stained positively with M<sub>2</sub> and 
M<sub>3</sub> receptor antibodies.  Antibody specificity is reliant on the
immunogen nature:  such as synthetic peptides or the purified protein.
Using synthetic peptide provides advantage of specific sequence, but many 
antibodes work well or better on the native 3D structure.  Anti-synthetic
peptide Abs may not work well for IP or IHC, but might work well in a denaturing
system like WB.

Part 41&mdash;Blanks
<p class="Para1">
In <i>Am. Lab.</i> Oct 2010 issue, two questions were asked in the previous
article:  how does an analyst know if positive response in a blank is low
enough to be ignored? and should an analyst ever constrain the <i>y</i>-intercept
in a signal to zero (the <q>forced zero</q>).  A first consideration is that
the concentration of a blank can never be estimated reliably in a positive
reading.  A judgement call about blank responses must be made within the context
of the dataset at hand.  Any calibration or recovery cuve or regression line
has bias and noise components.  The generic model is expressed as:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>y<sub>i</sub></i> = <i>f</i>(<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>) + 
<i>&epsilon;<sub>i</sub></i> + bias
<p>
where <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> = measurement <i>i</i>, 
<i>f</i>(<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>) = function which relates <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>
to <i>y<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> = true value, 
<i>&epsilon;<sub>i</sub></i> = noise or random error, and bias =
systematic error (may not be constant with respect to <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>).
Once an appropriate model and aequate fitting have been found, the associated
prediction interval reflects precision (<i>&epsilon;</i> term).

Short-Term Signatures of Evolutionary Change in the Salmonella enterica
Serovar Typhimurium 14028 Genome
<p class="Para1">
Several sequencing platforms (ABI-Sanger, Roche-454, Illumina/Solexa, ABI-SOLiD) 
were employed to assemble the complete genome of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> 
strain 14028s, and that was used to sequence genomes of three progenitor strains 
(60-6516, 14028s-o, 14028r).  ABI-SOLiD and Illumina/Solexa have very short read 
lengths and/or high error frequencies so are not iincluded in initial genome 
assembly of 14028s.  Roche-454 shows 372,340 reads for total of 82,619,725 bases 
(17-fold coverage), and the ABI-Sanger gives 10,752 reads for total of 9,958,592 
bases (2-fold coverage).  Combined assembly produces 259 contigs, of which 106 
are individual reads and removed from analysis. The 153 contigs are used for 
genome assembly and for alignment to LT2 genome. Results show that many 
sequences are homologous or identical between LT2 and 14028s and there are some 
that are unique to both.
<p>
Comparison of genomes show 55 insertions or deletions (indels) where there are 
frameshifts in annotated genes.  The 454 sequencing techology is prone to errors
in long homopolymeric runs and this can generate indels.  Using other sequencing
tech, 25 of the 55 single base indels were attributable to sequencing errors;
six were due to run of three or fewer mononucleotides (not all long homopolymeric
runs).
<p>
There is over 98% sequence identity between 14028s and LT2:  greatest difference
atributable to four prophage distributions.  The two LT2 prophages Fels-1 and -2
are not present in 14028s.  Remmants of several Fels-2 genes indicate that prophage
is ancestral but that it was eliminated from 14028s.  Within tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>
is a prophage 40 kb longand &gt;99% identical to phage ST64B, and another prophage
near 3&prime; end of <i>icdA</i> gene about 51 kb, most of which is identical to
a prophage in <i>S enterica</i> serovar Newport; neither of these prophages are in LT2.
At the amino acid level, 30% of length is found in other prophages of other bacteria.
This phage has two virulence genes, <i>sspH1</i> and <i>pagJ</i>.  14028s and LT2
share four IS<i>200</i> elements, but six in 14028s and two in LT2 are unique to
strains.  One IS<i>200</i> insertion in 14028s disrupts putative periplasmic protein
STM1228 and other five in intergenic areas.  There are 11 indels &gt; 100 bp long,
three in protein-coding regions, with one 5.1 kb deletion nulling for genes 
STM3256 to STM3259.  142 indels &lt; 100 bp long were found comparing 14028s and LT2
which are mostly single-base indels (could be sequencing errors).  Only indels
within coding regions are confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing.
<p>
Analyzing sequence for base substitutions, there are 962, which are reduced to 
540 total between LT2 and 14028s when errors in multicopy regions of contigs are 
edited out, reflecting sequencing artifacts.  Substitutions in intergenic (1.58 
&times; 10<sup>&minus;4</sup>) and synonymous (1.61 &times; 
10<sup>&minus;4</sup>) sites occur about same frequency, expected if sites are 
neutral or nearly so.  The <i>K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s</sub></i> ratio 
(nonsynonymous to synonymous site substitutions) is 0.531, which is over 10-fold 
higher than observed in comparing homologous gens from <i>E coli</i> and <i>S 
enterica</i> (<i>K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s</sub></i> = 0.036).  This high ratio between
two closely related <i>Salmonella</i> strains is because of shorter duration of
purifying selection acting on slightly deleterious mutations.
<p>
13 of the 14028s genes contain potentially inactivating mutations (truncating).
Combined with genes having large indels, there are 19 pseudogenes in 14028s that
are intact in LT2.  Fimbrial protein <i>lpfD</i> and virulence factor <i>ratB</i>
genes are 20% shorter than LT2 counterparts.  Fumarase <i>fumA</i>, ribonuclease
Z <i>elaC</i>, and secreted effector protein <i>avrA</i> are slightly truncated
in 14028s compared to LT2.  38 of 39 pseudogenes in LT2 are found in 14028s (the other
is in a prophage not found in 14028s).
<p>
<b>Conclusions</b>.  Base substitutions and indels are much more frequent in regions
represented repeated DNA (rRNA operons, multicopy elements, duplicated genes).

The complete biosynthesis of the genetically encoded amino acid pyrrolysine
from lysine
<p class="Para1">
Previous proposed pyrrolysine biosynthesis pathways include the ligation of
a ring derived from metabolities such as the amino acids Orn, Glu, Pro. and
Ile to lysine.  In a pathway observed in <i>E coli</i> we show that two Lys
amino acids are used, with one used to form the pyrrole ring.  The <b>PylB</b>
product is <i>S</i>-adenosylmethione (AdoMet, SAM) enzyme that methylates
one of the lysines on C-3, forming stereoisomer that is
(3<i>R</i>)-3-methyl-D-ornithine (3Me-Orn) from the L-lysine.  The <b>PylC</b> product
is is an amide synthetase that joins the &epsilon;-NH<sub>2</sub> of Lys to the
&alpha;-COOH of newly formed 3Me-Orn, forming
(3<i>R</i>)-3-methyl-D-ornithyl-<i>N&epsilon;</i>-L-lysine (Lys-3Me-Orn).
Ring formation then occurs with the <b>PylD</b> product, which is an amino
oxidase that forms an aldehyde from the &epsilon;-NH<sub>2</sub> of the ornithyl
moiety of 3MO-Lys.  The aldehyde condenses spontaneously with the
&alpha;-NH<sub>2</sub> in the ornithyl moiety, forming a 5-membered ring closure
with a methyl end.  Two of the carbons in the ring are chiral (both having the
<i>R</i> configuration); they were C-2 and C-3 of the linear lysyl moiety.
<p>
The biosynthesis was studied in <i>E coli</i> transfected with <i>Methanosarcina
acetivorans</i> gene cluster <i>pylTSBCD</i> and with <i>M. barkeri</i> gene
<i>mtmbB1</i>, a methyltransferase employing Pyl in its sequence.  Metabolites
studied used stable isotopic labeling and mass spectrometry.  The host
<i>E coli</i> BL21 is not known to form Pyl itself:  lysine is incorporated into
proteins or decarboxylated to cadaverine.
<p>
Lys is used this experiments had been uniformally labeled with <sup>13</sup>C
and <sup>15</sup>N, so with six C and two N atoms, a mass shift of +8 amu was
possible compared with Lys labeled mostly with <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>N.
Chymotryptic digests of the MtmB methyltransferase product were done.  The peptide
AGRPGMGVOGPETSL corresponds to positions 194-208 of the protein, and O at position
202 is presumptively pyrrolysine.  Mass spectra contained peaks whose <i>m/z</i>
values were within 2.5-5.4 ppm of the calculated <i>m/z</i> value for a peptide
containing Pyl.  The labeled product had a mass shift of 15 amu to account for
the 12 atoms of <sup>13</sup>C and 3 atoms of <sup>15</sup>N.  This would verify
that Pyl is synthesized from two Lys, or else the mass shift would not be
as predicted.
<p>
Note that one of the amino groups is lost in the biosynthesis.  From the pathway,
it should be the &epsilon;-NH<sub>2</sub> of the lysyl moiety of 3MO-Lys.
To prove this, either [&epsilon;-<sup>15</sup>N]Lys or
[&alpha;-<sup>15</sup>N]lysine were used as substrate.  With the
&alpha;-<sup>15</sup>N, the mass shift indicated two labeled N atoms present.
With the &epsilon;-<sup>15</sup>N, only one labeled N atom was present, which
indicates the amino group lost was an &epsilon; group.
<p>
One report indicated that D-ornithine stimulates the UAG sense readthrough
in <i>E coli</i> that carries the <i>pylTSBCD</i> cluster and it was proposed
as an intermediate.  An experiment did show that D-Orn and not L-Orn did
increase the readthrough in <i>mtmB1</i> RNA.  It had been believed that
the absence of any one gene of <i>pylB, pylC</i> or <i>pylD</i> would stop
readthrough.  <i>E coli</i> containing <i>pylC</i> and <i>pylD</i> but not
<i>pylB</i> was capable of readthrough.  Ornithine has just one less methylene
group than lysine, so perhaps PylB is necessary to create a molecule with the
correct chirality in the carbon.  <i>E coli</i> was grown with D-Orn containing
the Pyl synthesis gene cluster, and the chymotryptic digest contained
194-AGRPG(M/M<sub>ox</sub>)GVOGPETSL-208, where M<sub>ox</sub> is methionine
sulfoxide. O202 had the expected mass of 237 Da for Pyl.  But the position
at 202 also had other residues:  one residue at 202 had a mass of 14.0 Da less
than the predicted, which would be if a proton substituent was substituted for
a methyl group.  This would be a product formed if just D-Orn was the substrate
for PylC followed by PylD activity.  The product is predictably desmethylpyrrolysine.
The tRNA synthetase appears to depend more on the lysylated ring moiety than
the D-ornithyl group in charging the tRNA.
<p>
For the next experiment, because isotopically labeled DL-Orn and D-Orn are not
available, isotopic dilution experiments were trying using
[<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>]Lys and D-Orn.  Recombinant
MtmB was produced in present of heavy labeled Lys and D-Orn, digested with
chymotrypsin, then analyzed on MS.  The peptide <i>m/z</i> fit the theoretical
value with an error of &lt; 0.8 ppm.  This is consistent with the joining of
Lys with just a D-Orn.
<p>
PylC is a member of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase family:  this forms
amide bonds using ATP.  It seems clear that PylC can utilize D-Orn and not
merely the 3-methylated group of PylB using AdoMet + Lys.  Extracts of
<i>E coli</i> containing pK18 (carrying only the <i>pylC</i> gene) and an
ion of monoisotopic mass of 261.1915 was obtained, which has a 2.3 ppm difference
from the predicted mass of C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>24</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
for D-ornithyl-<i>N&epsilon;</i>-lysine.  No such signal was found in
<i>pylC</i>-carrying bacteria not incubated with D-Orn; vector only controls
also indicated a dependence on the <i>pylC</i> gene.
<p>
Experiments with <i>E coli</i> containing only <i>pylD</i> show no evidence that
D-Orn was oxidized.  The code of PylD indicates it has a NAD-binding fold found
in dehydrogenases.  Iterative PSI-BLAST shows similarity with several amino
acid dehydrogenases, with some alignments being <i>E</i> &lt; 10<sup>&minus;95</sup>.
<p>
One question is how the methylated pyrrole ring occurs if D-Orn can be used to
form the nonsubstituted pyrrole ring in pyrrolysine.  One possibility is the
rearrangement of a lysyl chain via a lysine mutase to form the
(3<i>R</i>)-3-methyl-D-Orn, which can be ligated by PylC instead of D-Orn.
PylB is a radical SAM protein, which means it can function as a lyase,
reductase, or mutase.  PylB is proposed as the Lys mutase.  Some
vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyems have amino acid mutase ability with
inversion of chiral center configurations, and PylB could give rise to the
R chiral center of the pyrroline ring, in which AdoMet is used but with a
a free radical mechanism.
<p>
<b>Method</b>.  <i>E coli</i> BL21 Tuner(DE3) was transfected with pK13, pK14,
pK15, or pK16 or with parent vector pACYCDuet-1 (Novagen).  The transformed
<i>E coli</i> were then transformed with pDLBADHis<sup>14</sup> which was
carrying the <i>M bakeri mtmB1</i> gene, and codes for a protein with C-terminal
His<sub>6</sub> tag.  In labeling experiments, exponential cultures are grown
in defined medium with 20 common amino acid are resuspended in fresh medium
w/ and w/o 5 mM D-Orn and heavy forms of Lys.  Expression of the <i>pylTSBCD</i>
cluster and <i>mtmB1</i> are induced.  Immunoblotting was done to detect MtmB1.
The MtmB1 was solubilized in urea and purified by metal chelate, the digested
with chymotrypsin.  LC-MS/MS was done with Thermo-Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL
system:  ionization was at 2000 V with a capillary temperature of 175&deg;.
MS scanning is based on the Top 10 method with a range of <i>m/z</i> 300-2000
and then ten consecutive MS/MS scans of the 10 most abundant peaks.  Scanning
was set to get a 30,000 resolution.  MS/MS mode was set to increase sensitivity
which reduces mass accuracy.  RAW data was converted to mzXML and MGF (with
MassMatrix tools).  MassMatrix was used to search for Pyl and derivatives.
PylB deletions were made by digesting pK16 with <i>Eag</i>I and religating
the larger segment to make pK18, which are transfected to <i>E coli</i>;
transfectants are grown in 10 mM D-Orn + Lys and induced with IPTG, then
extracted with hot MeOH/water at 70&deg;.  Extracts are analyzed on LC-MS/MS.

Combining ion pairing agents for enhanced analysis of oligonucleotide 
therapeutics by reversed phase-ion pairing ultra performance liquid 
chromatography (UPLC)
<p class="Para1">
Oligos used here are ds siRNA molecules, but the methodology applies to oligos of
all kinds. The double-stranded molecule is denature on-column which helps in 
sense and antisense strand analysis.  Gilar et al have shown that column particle
size reduction helps mass transfer and peak capacity.  Retention with ion-pair
reversed phase is usually affected by number of phosphate groups.  There is a 
balance between the dominance of ion-pairing vs. reversed phase.  Under partially
denaturing conditions, peaks for both single-stranded forms and the double-stranded
form are observed.  Column temperature and organic modifier presence control 
strandedness.
<p>
Four different ion pair agents were evaluated at 20 mM in water, all mobile phases
adjusted to pH 8 for solvent A.  Solvent B was neat (100%) MeOH.  The four agents
were dibutylamine (DBA), triethylamine (TEA), diethylamine (DEA), and propylamine
(PA).  A 1.7 &micro;m C18 UPLC 2.1 &times; 100 mm column is used with 0.25 ml/min
flow rate, 5 &micro;l injection, 60&deg; temp, and starting mobile phase of
14-30% B depending on strength of ion pair agent.  Gradient slope is to increase
MeOH by 0.25% per minute.  Results show that DBA reduces sense vs. antisense
strand separation based on hydrophobicity differences (also coeluting with other
impurities).  As the ion pair hydrophobicity is reduced there is better separation,
and this is because the hydrophobility of sense and anti-sense is not masked by
the ion-pair agent.  Baseline noise in the chromatograms was attributable to 
impuirities in the ion-pair agent, so supplier product quality is quite significant
here (seen in DEA and PA products particularly).
<p>
Ion-pair agent concentration as well as the molecule itself was important.  Use
of a 10 mM DBA improved sense/antisense strand resolution compared to 20 mM 
concentration.
<p>
PA at 20 mM provided the best resolution and peak symmetry compared to other
ion-pairing agents.  This was not entirely consistent.  So ion-pair agent mixes
were evaluated.  The basis for trying this is that some oligos may have more
intra- or intermolecular secondary structure interactions during separation and
this microheterogeneity leads to broader peak shapes.  More hydrophobic ion-pair
agent increases mass transfer to the stationary phase and the time for secondary
struture formation is reduced and peak shape improved.  Use of a less hydrophobic
ion pair where the steric shielding around the amine would be minimized (as the
case for PA) would enable stronger bind and slower on-off kinetic between ion pair
and oligo, providing more direct interaction between oligo and C18 stationary 
phase.  A TEA/PA combination showed the most promise.  Several experiments showed
a 10 mM TEA/10 mM PA gave the best chromatography.  The pH was then tested between
8.2 and 6.9:  there was no change in selectivity, but peak shape and reproducibility
was best at pH 7.1.
<p>
Characterization of impurities was the next step with the optimized method.  As it is
analytical and the mobile phase additive 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol is
used in oligo analysis, it was used within the whole of the mobile phase and also
postcolumn.  Within the mobile phase HFIP causes poor peak shape and reduced
resolution.  Added postcolumn, significant HFIP adducts are seen in spectra and there
is no increase in ionization efficiency for the oligos in the MS.  Use of this 
reagent is thus unwarranted.  Of the impurities identified was the loss (as HF)
of the adduct at the 2&prime;-ribose of fluorinated cytosine.  The defluorinated
impurity cannot be chromatographically resolved from its desired fluorinated form
however if the binary ion-pair reagents are not in the mobile phase, but with the
TEA/PA, at least five impurities (isomeric defluorinated forms positionally related)
were resolved.

Chromatographic Behavior of IgM:DNA Complexes
<p class="Para1">
Shukla et al recently reported that &gt; 95% of cell protein contaminants 
carried through protein A affinity were complexd to IgG during cell culture. 
Luhrs et al have shown core histones and DNA from dead cells participate in 
complexes with IgG.  The presence of these contaminants can cause elevated 
background interference, even false positives.  Complexes from cell culture 
supernatants are isolated by hydroxyapatite and anion-exchange, and retention is 
character by size exclusion, anion- and cation-exchange, hydrophobic 
interaction, and bioaffinity chromatography.  Experiments done here are with a 
AKTA Explorer 100 (GE Healthcare) using 0.34 ml axial flow CIM QA and EDA 
columns.  Also a Fractogel TMAE HiCap (EMD Biosciences) porous particle column 
was used.  In addition a wide pore weakly hydrophobic PPG Toyopearl HW75 medium 
(Tosoh BioSicence) was used.  Ceramic hydroyxapatite CHT type II (40 &micro;m 
from Bio-Rad).  For affinity, a CaptureSelect Lambda Fab (BAC, Leiden NL) 
immobilized anti-lambda light chain camelid VHH medium. A TSKgel G5000PWXL-CP 
analytical SEC (0.78 &times; 30 cm) column (Tosoh BioScience).  Water for 
injection-grade was used as solvent, and all buffers filtered with 0.22 &micro;m 
before use.  Salmon sperm genomic DNA (Sigma) was dissolved to 100 &micro;g/ml 
in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0.  DNA-depleted IgM was obtained according to Gagnon et al 
(March Suppl of Biopharm Int 2008):  this is done by eluting IgM from HA with 
10-500 mM NaP<sub>i</sub> pH 7.0 linear gradient, then applying IgM pool to CIM 
QA, which is eluted with linear gradient of 1 M NaCl in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0. 
This IgM pool is then purified to SO3 CIM colum and purified with linear 
gradient to 0.5 M NaCl in same buffer.  This produces &gt;99% pure IgM, with 
&lt; 0.5% aggregates and DNA &lt; 1 ppm as determined using qPCR.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  As a first attempt, 8 L hybridoma cell culture supernatants
were filtered (0.22 &micro;l) and applied to 400 ml HA (XK50 GE Healthcare) at 
200 cm/h and then eluted with phosphate gradient.  The IgM peak was then placed 
on 110 ml Fractogel TMAE HiCap (XK26, GE Healthcare, 200 cm/h) and eluted with 
gradient to 1 M NaCl in 20 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0 buffer.  Fractions were analyzed by 
SDS-PAGE to observe IgM and DNA peaks.  Also as control purified IgM was mixed 
with purified DNA.  The OD254 and OD280 nm and conductivity was followed for 
TMAE.  Four chromatographic zones (three of them with clear peaks) were 
observed.  The first peak is IgM, followed by multiple small peaks that are 
IgM-dominant, followed by a clear DNA-dominant peak and then by a narrow DNA 
peak.  These can be observed because of changes in the 254/280 ratio, which is 
lower for protein and higher for DNA.  A plot can be constructed of the ratio of 
OD254/OD280 using the Warburg equation: A254/A280 = [<i>e</i>254<sub>p</sub> 
&times; (%<i>P</i>) + <i>e</i>254<sub>N</sub> &times; (%<i>N</i>] / 
[<i>e</i>280<sub>p</sub> &times; (%<i>P</i>) + <i>e</i>280<sub>N</sub> &times; 
(%<i>N</i>], where <i>e</i> is extinction coefficient, <i>P</i> is protein and 
<i>N</i> is nucleotide.  This basically says that the contributions of 
absorbance are the sum of their component absorbances of protein and nucleotide. 
Using this equation, the percent of DNA purity can be assessed in each of the 
four chromatographic zones described above:  1.0, 6.8, 69.4, and 100% DNA 
respectively.  The pools of each zone as fractions were running on reducing 
SDS-PAGE.  In the first three pools, the gel shows light and heavy chains
of IgM clearly.  The 2nd zone shows large amounts of IgM, but there are 
other protein contaminants seen quite clearly.
<p>
IgM is a cyclic pentamer with hydrodynamic radius of 20 nm and a micro-BCA
and qPCR assay show a complex of 700 &micro;g/ml IgM and 167 &micro;g/ml
DNA (24% of IgM value).  If IgM is 960 kDa and the total mass is 1190 kDa,
then 229 kDa is doubel-straned DNA.  If there are 660 Da per base pair, then
the DNA is about 347 bp complexed with IgM.  If a base pair has a length
of 0.34 nm, the DNA has a total length of 118 nm, or three times the 
hydrodynamic diameter of IgM.  The SEC elution indicates that IgM was complexed
with DNA which had fragments not larger than 115 bp.  These fragments could
span the pentamer disk without increasing hydrodynamic diameter.
<p>
For a cation-exchanger, DNA should not bind.  If high 254/280 ratio peaks
are found, it must be because DNA is complexed.  Under these conditions
DNA-depleted IgM binds to a CIM sulfo column.  Unretained is a high amount
of DNA-dominant protein, perhaps indicating that DNA interferes with binding.
A particular spike of 254/280 high material elutes at the end of sample loading
as the conductivity of the equilibration buffer occurs:  this means that 
the presence of salts creates a weak affinity of DNA-dominant IgM to the
column, which is lost as the ionic strength decreases, although this does
not occur with DNA-depleted IgM.  A model of binding would indicate that a
lower buffer pH would eliminate this spike at the end of the sample load,
and this is found.  Complexes are chromatographed at pH 6.0 instead of 7.0,
and 10 mM EDTA is included or not included, 1 h before injection (note EDTA
absorbs at 254 and 280 nm, higher at 254).  Analysis using Warburg equation
shows that with EDTA is 2.6% vs 3.3%, indicating some DNA dissociation.
This might be due to a strong possibility that IgM is complexed to DNA by
metals.  Proteins can in general bind metals via their multiple carboxylate
side chains or through histidine coordination.  The presence of EDTA should
thus eliminate any IgM-metal-DNA complexes.
<p>
HIC media should have no affinity for DNA, thus any 254 nm-high peaks 
indicating DNA presence in bound fraction must come from IgM.  With the loading
of the column necessarily in high salt, it can be observed that the HIC-bound
fraction has a lower 254/280 ratio, suggesting that the loading conditions
probably dissocated DNA from IgM (thus high ionic strength may interfere with
this associations).  The HIC experiment indicates that DNA-dominant complexes
can exist at 3.2 M NaCl and 1.0 ammonium sulfate.  High salt may therefore
stabilize DNA complexing to IgM.
<p>
IgM:DNA complexes were applied to a anti-lambda light chain column at three
different NaCl concentrations: 0.3, 1.5, and 3.0 M.  DNA-dominant complexes
failed to bind in every case, which refutes the notion that complexes are in
fact stabilized by high salt.  Serial loading of unbound material on succeeding
columns rather indicates that higher salt destabilizes IgM and DNA.  The 
wash of the affinity column was a urea-NaCl-EDTA buffer with the hope of removing
and/or dissociating DNA.  This removed some but not all DNA.
<p>
With anion exchange monolithic columns CIM EDA gives better dissociation than
does CIM QA.  Why would anion-exchange support dissociation at all?  DNA might
displace weaker binding IgM from anion-exchange columns.  A theory proposed here
is that EDA and QA actually compete with IgM for binding of DNA, and so the IgM
is released free.  A figure shows a TMAE HiCap, CIM QA, and CIM EDA columns.
As the salt gradient increases, there is better separation between DNA-dominant
and protein (IgM)-dominant peaks.  If AX columns work by charge competition,
then how does one weaken the complex without altering electrostatic interaction?
<p>
What are the differencs in monoliths compared to particle-based media?
In monoliths, there is convective mass transport, while in particles it is 
diffusive, at least partially.  With smaller DNA fragments, mass transport
efficiency by diffusion should not be significantly lowered.  Density of QA 
ligans is higher 0.9-1.1 mEq/ml than particles.  EDA ligand density is 1.5-1.7
mEq/ml and EDA has two charged groups per ligand, thus has 3 times higher
charge density than QA.  The more intense binding in fact may be due to hydrogen
bonding combined with electrostatic interaction.
<p>
So while EDA does a good job of dissociating DNA from IgM, does it do a better
job of binding to uncomplexed IgM?  QA was found to bind more IgM per ml medium
(29, 51, and 24 mg/ml on QA vs 21, 36, and 16 mg/ml on EDA at pH 6.0, 7.0, and
8.0 with ionic strength of 6 mS/cm).

Comparison of DNA Extraction Protocols for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in
Diagnosis of Tuberculous Meningitis by Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction
<p class="Para1">
CNS involvement of tuberculosis is a most devastating manifestation of the
disease.  The diagnosis of tubercle meningitis (TBM) is complex because
manifestations are inconsistent and a rapic, sensitive, and specific test
is lacking.  At the start of the century PCR techniques were developed for
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB).  To extract MTB DNA in CSF samples
for establishing a positive PCR result requires the following steps:
<ol>
<li>shock treatment by heating and freezing to weaken mycobacterial cell
wall and use of lysozyme to dissolve proteinaceous debris
<li>lysing cell wall with appropriate chemicals
<li>purification of the DNA
<li>elution of DNA
</ol>
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>.  MGIT BACTEC 960 tubes of H37Rv MBT showing positive on 1st
day have about 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml and were diluted using CSF from healthy
individuals to 1000, 100, 30, and 10 CFU/ml.  After spiking the CSF with MTB,
samples were centrifuged 24,000 <i>g</i> for 60 min.  200 &micro;l of material
was processed through four extraction protocols:
<ol>
<li>The QIAmp mini spin column kit is used.  200 &micro;l of CSF is pelleted and
pellet treated with lysis buffer with proteinase K and guanidine HCl, followed
by EtOH precipitation.  Ppt is resuspended and passed through mini spin column;
the spin column is washed and DNA eluted with TE.
<li>The AMPLICOR respiratory specimen prep kit is used: step 1 is a freeze-thaw
treatment with incubation with lysozyme followed by washing with TE; step 2
is to lyse the centrifuged pellet in NaOH with EDTA and sodium azide present;
step 3 is to add a neutralizing agent of TrisHCl with MgCl<sub>2</sub> with
sodium azide.
<li>The Roche MagNA Pure extraction kit uses magnetic glass particles.  Samples
are first treated with proteinase K and special buffer with chaotropic salt,
then magnetic glass particles (MGPs) are added to immobilize nucleic acids on
on MGP surfaces.  Washing steps are repeatd to remove unbound materials.  Then
the nucleic acids are eluted from the MGPs
<li>This protocol combines first a noncommercial step with a commercial kit.
First the pellet is heated to 95&deg; 5 min then frozen at &minus;80&deg;
for 5 min, then thawed.  Sample is then treated with 50 &micro;l of lysozyme
solution and incubated for 30 min at 37&deg;  Sample is then run through
the MagNA Pure extraction kit.
</ol>
<p>
The Roche COBAS TaqMan 48 instrument is used for real time PCR.  The COBAS
system for MTB targets the 16S rRNA gene and uses an internal control to verify
amplification.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  A detection limit of 1000 copies of MTB genome per reaction
for all the commercial kits.  When copies were &lt; 100 no amplification was
observed.  For the combined protocol, detection reached 100 copies per reaction.

Rapid and Accurate Detection of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in Sputum
Samples by Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF Assay&mdash;A Clinical Validation Study
<p class="Para1">
There is no rapid, point-of-care test currently allowing early detection of
active TB at the peripheral health clinic level.  Many patients are treated
based on clinical findings without establish proof of TB infection, or they
are untreated because they are undiagnosed.  WHO wants new TB diagnostic
policies that are evidence-based.  An automated molecular test for TB,
the eXpert MTB/RIF Assay was codeveloped in part by the Foundation for Innovative
New Diagnostics, Cepheid, and has been CE-approved in 2009.  Within 2 h
a sputum sample can be identified as TB positive or negative.  Everything is
contained with respect to DNA preparation and real time PCR amplification.
WHO recommends use of this test in cases of MDR-TB and HIV-associated TB.
This study validates the eXpert MTB/RIF assay against sputum smear and culture
cases of suspected TB with or without HIV involvement.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>  292 patients each submit three sputum samples (a spot, a morning,
and another spot sample after).  Each sputum sample portioned for Z-N stained
microscopy and culture on Lowenstein-Jensen and BACTEC MIGT 906 liquid culture.
AFB smear is graded according to Int. Union against TB and Lung Disease:
1-9 per 100 fields, scanty;  10-99 / 100 fields, 1+;  1-10 / field, 2+; and
&gt;10/field, 3+.  A smear-positive is any smear graded scanty or higher.
Determination at species level was done using Genotype Mycobacterium MTBC, CM
and AS tests (Hain Lifescience).  The SIRE test kits in the BACTEC MGIT system
were used for RIF susceptibility.  Patients are classed into five groups
based on microbiology, radiology, and clinical findings:
<ol>
<li><b>TB (S+/C+)</b>:  Pulmonary TB confirmed by microbiology with smear- and
culture-positive (S+/C+)
<li><b>TB (S-/C+)</b>:  Pulmonary TB confirmed by microbiology with

<li><b>no TB (C-)</b>:  Chest infection case that is smear and culture negative;

<p>
Patients usually followed up to two months.  Frozen sputum samples prodcessed
by the eXpert MTB/RIF assay.  Semi-quantitative results based on <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>
values with a cutoff of <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> = 40 for negative samples.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  50 of 51 S+/C+ patients were detected by the eXpert MTB/RIF
assay (98% sensitivity).  11 of 18 S-/C+ were found positive by the MTB/RIF
assay, with a sensitivity of 61% compared to the culture technique.  Of 103
C- patients the sputum of one patient was positive by eXpert MTB/RIF, showing
a specificity of 99%:  this patient was HIV infected had a previous TB history
and had received anti-TB treatment.  There were 77 clincal TB (C-) cases
and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay found 7 of them (~10%) as positive, although the
<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> values were high (from 22-28) or very high (&gt; 28), indicating
low mycobacterial load.
<p>
Sample-to-sample analysis for each patient was performance-tested.  Generally
if one sample of the three is positive, the patient is considered positive.
Sensitivity was better for the morning sample than the spot sample, although
there was no significant difference.
<p>
No data could be obtained as to drug resistance and none of the strains was
found resistant.

Analytical Performance of the Roche LightCycler<sup>&reg;</sup>
<i>Mycobacterium</i> Detection Kit for the Diagnosis of Clinically Important
Mycobacterial Species
<p class="Para1">
In 2009 5.8 million new cases of TB were found of which only 58% were
smear-positive.  Those with HIV show samples with nontuberculous mycobacteria:
<i>M avium</i> complex, <i>M kansasii, M. abscessus</i> and <i>M fortuitum</i>.
Smears are rapid but have low sensitivity, while cultures the gold standard
but not rapid for <i>M tuberculosis</i>.  Nucleic acid amplification is still
not fully optimized with full sensitivity, although the Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid)
has been endorsed by WHO.  Roche has marketed a LightCycler Mycobacterium
Detection Kit with its real-time PCR for use on respiratory samples.  It can
detect <i>M tuberculosis, M avium, M kansasii</i> inside 90 min and targets
the 16S rRNA in the hypervariable region.  Probes are used in the assay and
species identification using melting curve analysis.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>.  Both mycobacterial reference standards and simulated respiratory
samples are NAc-Cys/NaOH decontaminated and sediment suspened in 1.5 ml
phosphate+0.5% Tween 80.  For sputum 100 &micro;l aliquot of decontaminated
sample is mixed with COBAS AMPLICOR kit wash, microfuged 10 min, and lysis agent
added to pellet and heated 60&deg; for 45 min.  This is neutralized with agent
to 200 &micro;l and 4 &micro;l of that used for PCR.  PCR with melting curve
is done on LightCycler 2.0 with <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> established.  Amplification
is monitored at 640 nm for the ~200 bp amplicon.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  Plasmid standards for target gene were used to show limit
of detection.  Probit anlaysis of the limit of detection at level of 95%
probabilility indicates 28 copies per &micro;l, or 112 copies per reaction.
The tests were 100% specific in that no nonmycobacterial organism showed
cross-reactivity with non-mycobacterial organisms.  Coefficient of variation
for <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> and postamplification <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> for
identification of the three mycobacteria from run-to-run, day-to-day, and
lot-to-lot were &lt; 2%.  Majority of samples had a CV of &lt; 0.4%.

Evaluation of Cobas TaqMan MTB PCR for Detection of <i>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</i>
<p class="Para1">
406 samples from 247 patients.  Specimens were all cultured, stained, and
NAA-tested.  96 respiratory: sputum, pleural and bronchoaleolar lavage.
310 nonrespiratory: body fluids include joint fluids, ascites, drainage,
and tissue.  24 specimens culture-positive, and 14 of 24 positive by
TaqMan and AMPLICOR PCR test, and 5 positive by TaqMan alone, leaving 5
of these negative by both tests.  Of the 382 culture-negative, two were
found positive by both PCR and 5 showed positive by TaqMan MTB PCR.  The
two PCR-positive but culture-negative from patients with a history of TB.
Three false negatives for nonrespiratory specimens.
<p>
10 specimens were discrepant between TaqMan and AMPLICOR, in which these
were positive by TaqMan.  Of these 5 were culture-positive.  Of the 5 culture-negative,
one was from a patient with history of TB and treated 6 months earlier, and this
specimen should be considered true positive if nonviable organisms persisted.
One culture-negative specimen as positive by both PCR and AFB smear.  Four
TaqMan results were false positive and were tissue, joint fluid, bone marrow,
and respiratory specimens with <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> of 46.2, 44.0, 33.3,
and 20.7.  Tissue and joint fluid were from patients with no signs of TB,
and bone marrow was from patient with Kikuchi disease.  The three nonrespiratory
specimens showed increasing fluorescence signal during amplifcation and good
<i>C<sub>t</sub></i> values for the internal controls consistent with a positive
result.  The respiratory specimen showed the early <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> value
had a very premature increase in fluorescence followed by flat signal, and the
internal control had a <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> of 43.6; it was culture-positive for
a NTM.  5 culture-positive isolates were negative by TaqMan PCR:  the growth
was considered low grade however.  Any specimens with good growth (&gt; 50 CFU),
and grade 1+ to 4+ were positive by TaqMan PCR.

Rapid First- and Second-Line Drug Susceptibility Assay for
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Isolates by Use of Quantitative PCR
<p class="Para1">
Rapid molecular diagnostistics includ INNO-LiPA Rif TB kit, GenoType MTBDRplus
assay, Cepheid MTB/RIF assay.  If MDR TB is identified then what is the
second line drug?  Several drugs treat TB for which drug susceptibility desired:
pyrazinamide (PZA), ethambutol, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, amikacin, capreomycin,
streptomycin, kanamycin, ethionamide, <i>p</i>-aminosalicylic acid, cycloserine,
linezolid.  Standatd testing uses culture+drug (solid or liquid) but takes
8 d to &gt;1 month to complete.  GenoType MTBDRs1 offers information on the
<i>gyrA, rrs</i> and <i>embB</i> genes for predicting susceptibility to
quinolones, aminoglycoside, and ethambutol, resp.  Sensitivity is restricted
to the common mutations however.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  The H37Rv strain was used for protocol development.  qPCR is
done on 16S rRNA gene: unacceptable background DNA in drug-treated cultures
did not allow difference in <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values between INH- or RIF-treated
and control cultures, which means quantiative differences in this gene do not
reveal susceptibility.  An RT-qPCR for highly abundant 85B protein transcript
was tried but no quantitative differences with INH- or RIF- H37Rv.  Cultures
were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) which binds to DNA of damaged
cells and free DNA and makes it unamplifiable; as a control heat-treated (killed)
cells were treated with varying concentrations to determine the most effective
level, and 50 and 100 &micro;M PMA were found to completely inhibit amplification,
although the <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> was higher by about two cycles at 100 &micro;M,
indicating excessive chemical can inhibit.
<p>
The &Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> for INH- and RIF-treated was statistically
similar at 10 &micro;M for both drugs and so this concentration was used for
further studies; there was no complete inhibition of real-time PCR with
10 &micro;M PMA and the <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> was in the 20s despite the killing
of all <i>M tuberculosis</i> cells and indicating that perhaps PMA did not
fully penetrate all killed cells.  With H37Rv, &Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>
was 3-4 for INH and 4-6 for RIF, but drug-resistant strains showed little or
no &Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> after culture with INH or RIF.  Statistically
significant differences in <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values that increased more and
more occurred with more days of culture.  Use of ethidium monoazide (EMA) as
amplification inhibitor did not improve the results.  Protocol then uses a
3-day culture with 10 &micro;M PMA.
<p>
38 isolates had first- and second-line drug susceptibilities tested by
standard agar proportion method and MGIT method for PZA.  11 susceptible
strains, 25 MDR TB, 2 XDR, and 14 drugs.  For each isolate a
&Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> = <i>C<sub>T</sub></i>(control) &minus;
<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>(drug) was computed.  The average &Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>
for susceptible strains is significantly lower than that for resistant strains
for each drug.  While the &Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> is expected to be &lt; 0, for
some resistant strains, &Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> &gt; 0 indicating that
DNA replication was improved by presence of drug.  Differences (decrements)
in <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> were smaller for INH than for quinolones (&minus;2.8 vs
&minus;5.7).  ROC analysis provided a &Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> cutoff
as asccurate as agar proportion or MGIT level susceptibility:  values
above &Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> were resistant, those below indicated
susceptible.  15 results (2.8%) were different between agar proporition method
and PMA-qPCR>:  4 were false resistant for ethambutol, 1 false susceptible
for streptomycin, 2 false resistant for kanamycin, 1 false susceptible and
1 false for capreomycin, 2 false susceptible and 1 false resistant ethionamide,
and 3 false resistant for pyrazinamide.
<p>
A single unit decrease in <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> means that the starting material
is double a reaction whose <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> is one unit lower, or rather
&Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> (control &minus; drug) =
2<sup>&Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i></sup>.  A &Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> = 0
or 2<sup>0</sup> = 1 means no difference between control and drug, while &gt;1
means an increase in DNA from drug vs. control. while &lt;1 means decreases in
DNA.  The 2<sup>&Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i></sup> metric correlated to
percentage of resistant colonies and MIC for each drug except capreomycin,
<i>p</i>-aminosalicylic acid, linezolid, and cycloserine.  The correlation
coefficient <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> was higher for
2<sup>&Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i></sup> related with percent resistance than
between 2<sup>&Delta;<i>C<sub>T</sub></i></sup> and MIC;  correlation with
latter highest for rifampin, ofloxacin, and amikacin.

Comparison of Diagnostic Performance of Three Real-Time PCR Kits for Detecting
<i>Mycobacterium</i> Species
<p class="Para1">
Two real-time PCR kits in Korea will discrminate between MTB and NTM, but may
not be as specific and sensitive as conventional PCR.  Three kits and an
in-house PCR are evaluated and results further confirmed by DNA sequencing
and genotyping chip analysis.
<p>
91 clinical specimens and 37 samples of DNA from other sources were used.
82 clincal specimens were pulmonary, of 61 were sputum and 9 sputum samples
were smear-postive. The other 21 pulmonary samples were bronchial washes, of
which 1 was smear-positive.  The 9 extrapulomnary specimens (blood, body
fluid, urine, tissue) had 1 positive for MTB.  Specimens are decontaminated
and precipitated and pellet resuspended in buffered 5% Chelex-100, then boiled
10 min, centrifuged and supernatant used for PCR.  For the COBAS Amplicor assay
its respiratory specimen kit was processed.  Primers for the in-house test have
been described in a previous article:  the test is a gel-based test with a 285
bp band amplifying the IS<i>6110</i> insertion sequences.  The Amplicor assay
is an assay in which absorbance of the solution of the amplified sequence must
cross a threshold 0.35 in order to score positive.  The COBAS TaqMan MTB is
part of the COBAS TaqMan 48 Analyzer (Roche).  The LG Lifescience SLAN
real-time PCR system was used with the AdvanSure TB/NTM real-time PCR kit.
The Biosewoom Real-Q <i>M. tuberculosis</i> kit is used with the Corbett
Life Science Rotor-Gene Q.  Where there are inconsistent results, the 16S-23S
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) was sequenced and results confirmed by BLAST.
The LG Lifescince AdvanSure Mycobacteria Genotyping Chip was used to reconfirm
results:  this chip uses a hybridization method with an ITS probe and identifies
both MTB and NTM.
<p>
Results of three real-time PCR, the Amplicor, and the in-house gel-based PCR
were all in agreement with each other for both positives and negatives.
TB culture found only 10 sample positive instead of the 11 positive by all PCR
methods.  Nonetheless, the culture-negative patient showed clinical evidence for
TB, confirmed by the PCR-positive results.  For AFB smears, only 7 instead of
11 were found positive.  The other 80 MTB-negative-by-PCR samples were analyzed
for NTM using AdvanSure and Real-Q tests.  1 sample was positive for <i>M.
intracellulare</i> (confirmed by DNA sequencing) in both kits.  Two other samples
had disagreement from the kits, with AdvenSure positive while Real-Q was negative
in both.  One of the AdvenSure results was false-positive while the other was
a NTM false-negative by Real-Q.

Evaluation of the Cobas TaqMan MTB Test for Direct Detection of
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Complex in Respiratory Specimens
<p class="Para1">
<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection is conventionally diagnosed by
AFB smear followed by a positive culture and identification of biochemical
feature in the isolate.  The COBAS Amplicor MTB test, the Gee-Probe
<i>M. tuberculosis</i> test, the BDProbe Tec ET System, the Cepheid GenXpert MTB/RIF
test are tests with usually very high specificity but widely varying sensitivity:
88-100% sensitivity for AFB smear-positives specimens, but 50-71% sensitivity
for AFB false smear-negative samples.  COBAS Amplicor has been evaluated widely
in both developing and developed countries and relies on amplification of the
16S rRNA gene with colorimetric detection of PCR product after probe hybridization;
it is FDA-approved for smear-positive respiratory samples.  The COBAS TaqMan
MTB test is supposed to replace Amplicor and has 98.3% agreement with Amplicor,
and is recommended for smear-positive and -negatives.  The previous study
by Kim et al (2011) was very limited in evaluating the TaqMan, and this study
uses more samples.

A Simple and Accurate Two-Step Long DNA Sequences Synthesis Strategy to Improve 
Heterologous Gene Expression in <i>Pichia</i>
<p class="Para1">
Total chemical synthesis of a long gene or translated region using assembly PCR 
(A-PCR) methods with a mixture of single-stranded oligos and primers might be 
complicated if the number of oligos and primers are too large (for the sake of 
using short length oligos because of oligo synthesizer limitations.  It becomes 
necessary to divide the long sequence into multiple assembly operations, and 
then joining the assembled units using an overlap extension polymerase chain 
reaction (OE-PCR).  The entire sequence is divided into fragments between 
200-500 bp long.  Single-stranded oligos which overlap the ends of each 
fragments from 20-25 nt long  are synthesized as well, and then used to join 
fragments.  For this work, the 1179 bp mRNA of <i>Rhizopus oryzae</i> HU3005 
lipase gene <i>ROL</i> (Accession <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/GQ502721">GQ502721</a>) and a 1335 bp 
synthetic construct of the <i>Aspergillus niger</i> CICC 4009 <i>phyA</i> 
phytase gene (Accession <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JN252710">JN252710</a>) were used, 
although only the translated regions were synthesized.  A-PCR is done with 0.2 
mM each dNTP, 100 &micro;M each oligo (5 nmol), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 U 
<i>Pfu</i> Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), in 50 &micro;l volume.  PCR 
condtions are 94&deg; for 2 min, then 30 cycles of 94&deg; for 30 s, 55&deg; for 
30 s, and 72&deg; for 60 s, and then 6 min termination at 72&deg;. 
Reamplification was then done by using the outer oligos (as primers) at 1 
&micro;M each primer (50 pmol), 3 &micro;l of the A=PCR product, 0.2 mM each 
dNTP, and 1 U polymerase in 1.25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.   For the overlap 
extension step, a final 50 &micro;l volume contains dNTP, 100 &micro;M outside 
primers, and 1 U polymerase.  Thermal cycling is 2 min at 94&deg; initially, 
then 28 cycles of 94&deg; 30 s, 55&deg; 30 s, and 72&deg; 60 s, with 6 min at 
72&deg; to terminate.
<p>
In vivo cloning was also done. Both total RNA from <i>R oryzae</i> and <i>A niger</i>
using Trizol according to GIBCO BRL protocol.  1st strand (cDNA) synthesis was done
with RevertAid First Strand cDNA Sythesis Kit (Fermentas), then PCR using 0.1 mM
primers, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 U <i>Pfu</i> polymerase (Takara); 28 cycles
of conditions as above (annealing = 55&deg;) was done.  Cloning was done pMD18-T
simple vector followed by sequencing.  Note that all oligos from Gene2Oligo are
given in tables below for the <i>ROL</i> lipase and <i>phyA</i> phytase genes.
All genes were cloned into <i>Pichia</i> for expression.
<p>
There is a significant difference between <i>R. oryzae, A. niger</i> and <i>P. 
pastoris</i> in codon usage.  The amino acid sequence of the translated region
were reverse-translated using <i>Pichia</i> codon usage tables.  However, the
four most frequently used amino  acids (Lys, Asp, Glu, and Asn) were not optimized
to avoid tRNA exhaustion.  High frequency codons were not always strictly used if
it caused an uneven distribution of  all four bases, or it formed AT- or GC-rich
motifs, and to maintain GC content between 45-60%.  mRNA secondary structure was
checked by RNAfold.  Codon optimization did reduce the minimum free energy to make
it less likely that secondary structure would be significant.
<p>
The translated parts of the <i>ROL</i> (810 bp) and of the <i>phyA</i> (1404 bp)
genes were divided into two and four fragments, respectively.

Sequence dependence of isothermal DNA amplification via EXPAR
<p class="Para1">
Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is less complex and permits less expensive
instrumentation for low cost POC diagnosis.  Design of the assay is more
complex than for typical PCR.  Current tools (e.g. Primer3) and those for
isothermal methods focus on thermodynamics of hybridization iusing nearest-neighbor
interaction energies.  Others use primer length, GC content, propensity of
primer to form secondary structure, and propsensity of primer pair to form
dimers of the 3&prime; overlapping ends.  Studies of the interaction of DNA
polymerase (<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> binding, crystal structures including an
active enzyme) show that enzyme has electrostatic interaction and H-bonding
with phosphate backbone, and by hydrophobic interactions with the bases.
Affinity between enzyme and homo-oligos is on the order of d(pC)n &lt; d(pT)n
&lt; d(pG)n &approx; d(pA)n, which might be a reflection of relative
hydrophobicity known to be C &lt; T &lt; G &approx; A.  Polymerization is also
known to be sequence-dependent.  Computational studies of protein-DNA are
different than DNA-DNA interactions.  To quantify sequence dependence of
polymerase-DNA template interaction, two complementary methods are used:
<ol>
<li>position-weight matrix (PWM)
<li>Naive Bayes machine learning technique
</ol>
<p>
The PWM has been used to identify other protein-DNA interactions with transcription
factor binding sites, splice sites, translational start sites.  The assumption
is that each base position contributes independently to protein binding.
Improvements have been made to this system however.  Machine-learning algorithms
such as Naive Bayes method are alternatives:  this classifies data based on
conditional probability, and its benefit is that it can classify motifs based on
multiple bases.  Studies in this report look at Exponential Amplification
Reaction (isothermal amplification method) that amplifies short oligos at
55&deg;.  Short trigger oligos called <b>trigger X</b> can be generated by
enzymes in from sites in targeted genomic DNA, and the triggers initiate
EXPAR.  Exponential amplification of trigger X occur when EXPAR amplification
template oligo is in excess in the reaction.  The EXPAR template has two copies
of the X&prime; trigger reverse complement separated by reverse complement of
a nicking enzyme recognition site pluse required post-cut site spacer. Trigger
X primes template and is extended by polymerase, generating 5&prime;-GAGTC-3&prime;
on top strand, recognition for Nt.BstNB1 nicking enzyme.  The strand gets nicked
four bases 3&prime; to recognition sequence (see <q>|</q> character).  This
creates another copy of trigger X which melts off or is displaced from the
amplification template.  Polymerase elongates the recessed 3&prime;-OH created
from departing trigger X, and process repeats.  New triggers prime other templates
creating true exponential chain reactions.  Note that templates with similar
thermodynamic characteristics have very different amplification rates, indicating
a sequence dependence with EXPAR.
<p>
Most amplification reactions show non-specific amplification when there is no
template (targeted) sequence, and this limits assay sensitivity.  This nonspecific
amplification is due to mispriming or primer-dimer formation.  Thermostable
polymerases carry out ab initio DNA synthesis in absence of templating or
priming DNA strands.  Ab initio DNA synthesis is accelerated in presence of
restriction endonucleases or nicking endonucleases, and ab initio synthesis
has been seen in late-stage EXPAR reaction conditions.  Even with all stages of
EXPAR nonspecific background amplification occur, but only with EXPAR template
which generates trigger sequence specific for template.  Much of this is sequence
related, so the sequence dependence of EXPAR was studied with a variety of
different sequences, applying these analytical tools.
<p>
<b>M&amp;M</b>.  384 template sequences were tested, although templates #1-64 had
been tested previously.  Design of templates #2-11 were based on #1 with single
based change in the trigger complement for positions 1-10.  For the other 373
sequences A, T, C, and G were assigned with equal probability to 14 variable
positions making up trigger complement.  Sequence #1 is
5&prime;-CCTACGACTG - AACA - GACTC - T - CCTACGACTG-3&prime;, a 30-base long
oligo divided into five regions, but labeled A, B, C, D, A because the 1st and
5th is a direct repeat.  A is the trigger X complement (X&prime;).  B is the
nicking enzyme post cut site, C is the reverse complement of the nicking enzyme
recogntion site (GAGTC), and D is the single base T and the end of the trigger
binding site.  Note that the 14 variable positions are in nucleotides 1-14 of
the oligo.  The reason for adding the T base is because polymerase appends
an A to newly generated triggers by non-template adenylation, although later this
as not the case (based on MS analysis of generated trigger).  All generated
sequences are designed to have <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> between 35-55&deg; for
the trigger/template duplex, and <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> template/template
hybridization of &lt; 25&deg; and &lt; 10 secondary structure bond in a
template-template interaction.  The trigger-template <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> is
&le; the 55&deg; reaction temperature in EXPAR:  thus the duplex is formed
transiently to template, but is stabilized by polymerase extension.  But newly
formed trigger readily dissociates, leading to rapid amplification.  In previous
work if trigger-template <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> &lt; 35&deg;, binding is too
weak to initiate reaction.  If &gt; 55&deg; newly formed triggers do not melt.
Templates with too much 2&deg; structure also amplify slowly or not at all.
Three values are determined using the Zuker-Turner algorithm via the UNAFold
application:
<ol>
<li>template-trigger <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>
<li>template-template <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>
<li># of bonds in template-template self-hybridization
</ol>
From the first 64 tested in previous study, 9 did not fit the criteria: two
had <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> of about 29&deg;, and both did not amplify, supporting
validity of criteria.  The other seven did not meet the 10-bond self-hybridization
limit, and their template <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> was &gt; 25&deg;
<p>
EXPAR templates were from IDT and desalted (based on cost reasons).  EXPAR reactions
with 3&prime;-NH<sub>2</sub> caps and HPLC-purified were consistent performers,
previous studies with capped vs. uncapped had shown no significiant result
differences.  Trigger oligos were obtained from Eurofins MWG Operon.  EXPAR is
done in 30 &micro;l reaction with 0.2 U/&micro;l Nt.BstNBI nicking enzyme
(NEB), 0.03 U/&micro;l <i>Bst</i> DNA polymerase (NEB), 0.24 mM each dNTP
(Fermentas), 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich), 1&times; SYBR Green I
(Invitrogen), 20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.9, 15 mM ammonium sulfate, 30 mM KCl,
0.005% Triton X-100, and 50 nM EXPAR template.  For positive control on trigger,
1 pM trigger oligo is present, none in the negative control.  A Beckman-Coulter
Biomek FX Liquid Handler is used to combine mastermix with template-only or
template-trigger mixes (all stocks done manually) in 96-well plates, and the
distribution is random to mitigate confounding effects.  Reactions are kept on
cold block during manual and automated liquid handling.   Plate is then
brought to 55&deg; for 50 min on Bio-Rad Opticon real-time thermocycler,
fluorescence monitored at 488 nm.  Six replicates are assayed for all sets
of reactions:  and two sets of three replicates done in separate experiments
on two different days;  some templates had ambiguous data, so an additional
triplicate in third experiment was done.
<p>
Data analysis was done with EXPAR Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) which does a nonlinear
least-square curve fit to sigmoidal curve:  this parameteriation of the curve
is required for machine learning-based classification.  For each curve, EDAT
determines and records time required for fitted data to reach 10-90% of
maximum plateau (time points P10 and P90 for +trigger reaction, and N10 and N90
for -trigger reactions.   A time difference is done between N10 and P90
(Diff = N10 &times; P90).  A normalized residual of curve is computed
as measure of data quality, and all fits confirmed by eye.  In cases of
no amplification, late amplification, or nonsigmoidal amplification, these
were classed unfittable and excluded.  Some curves were sigmoidal but only near
the plateau, and others had the plateau drifting up or down and these are partially
fitted:  in these cases, the 10% intensity value was considered reliably determined.
Outliers from evaluated set were removed:  these are values in a set of P90
or N10 replicates for template &gt; 1.5 times interquartile range below first
quartile or above third quartile.  Moreover, only templates with <i>n</i> &ge; 3
P90 and N10 values moved to the data set.  The mean and SD were computed for
P90, N10, and Diff for all plates computed.  Diff standard deviation is computed
on variances of P90 and N10 (stderr propagation method).  If the CV for P90 or
Diff &gt; 30%, then these templates are excluded.  307 templates met the final
exclusion criteria:  of the 77 excluded, 49 were because of late amplification,
no amplification or nonsigmoidal type.  17 templates were excluded because of
final plateau up/down drift in the replicates:  cutting off the sloping values
in the fit resulted in P90 values that could not be determined.  Computing
data with and without these 17 templates did not affect results anyway.  11
templates were excluded because of large standard deviations, likely due
to plate-to-plate differences, variation expected in large screening studies.
The 307 templates in the final set were divided into three classes,
Classes I to III and based on performance (well-performing: 102,
poor-performing: 102, and intermediate: 103).  Class I had Diff &gt; 1 min and
Diff &gt; 0.85 &times; P90 &minus; 15 min.  Class II had Diff &lt; &minus; 1.3 min
and Diff &lt; 0.85 &times; P90 &minus; 15 min.  Any other template was Class III.
<p>
<b>Position-Weight Matrix</b>.  Class I and II templates (204 total) were combined
(<q>total data set</q>)  and then randomly divided into 10 groups, and one
group became the <i>test</i> set for validation of the test (about 20 or 21
sequences).  The remaining nine groups (183 or 184 sequences) are the training
set, which was used to generate a PWM in which templates with P90 values were
in the lowest 30% of the P90 value range.  A second PWM was generated from
templates in training set whose Diff was in highest 40% of Diff value range.
The two PWM tables from training set are applied to compute scores for all
templates in the training set.  A support vector machine (SVM) algorithm
with sequential minimal optimization is used to obtain a linear classification
bound in the two dimensional space fo P90 and Diff socres that optimally
separates the two classes.  The two PWM tables are then used to check the test
set and calculate P90 and Diff scores.  Based on scores and classification
boundary, test set sequences are classed as Class I or II.  This analysis is done
10 times, rotating all groups in and out of the test or training sets.  Finally
in an unshuffled data set, the 204 sequences are randomly assigned one of the
204 performance metrics (P90 and Diff values).
<p>
<b>Na&iuml;ve Bayes Classification Approach</b>.  
A position motif count matrix based on the sequence motifs in the 204 Class I
and Class II EXPAR templates are generated.  Position motifs represent subsequences
made of all possible combinations of four bases, up to 4 nt long, starting at
defined positions in EXPAR template.  For example, motif 'ATG-7' is a 3-mer
ATG subsequence at 7th-base pair of template.  There are 14 &times; (4 +
4<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>3</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup>) = 4760  possible position
motifs, but only 957 motifs occurring at least 3 times in entire data set were
considered.  To determine which motifs occur in which template, a motif count
matrix <i>A</i>(<i>i,j</i>)  in which <i>i</i> is the template
(1&lt;<i>i</i>&lt;204) and <i>j</i> is the motif (1&lt;<i>j</i>&lt;957) is
produced.  If the motif is contained in template, then <i>A</i>(<i>i,j</i>) = 1,
otherwise = 0.  The matrix is input for the machine learning procedure,
using WEKA open source software.   A cross-validation set with 10 groups was
also done just as with PWM, with test set and larger training set.  The RELIEF
attribute evaluation was done to determiine important features in the training
set during training process.  The Na&iuml;ve Bayes machine learning to obtain
classifiers for selected features.  Features and classifiers are used to predict
sequences with the test set, falling into Class I versus Class II.
<p>
<b>ETSeq</b>.  A python tool with GUI called EXPAR Template Sequence analysis
tool was developed and source can be <a
href="https://github.com/expartools/ETSeq/wiki">downloaded</a>.   Input should
be user-defined EXPAR templates for analysis.  The UNAFold is used to predict
parameters for template-trigger hybridization and self-hybridization of
template.  ETSeq has defaults which can be changed.  It will classify in a
sequence-dependent way the templates, using PWM and Naive Bayes approaches.
The PWM tables of the 204 Class I and Class II templates are used and the
SVM-based boundary line used for classification.  The Orange module was used
for Naive Bayes because it was writtein in python and WEKA was not easily
incorporated.  A sequence is submitted, and if calculated probability is Class I
is higher than for caldc prob for Class II, then it becomes Class I.  As output
a single Excel file with three worksheets is prepared:  one for all sequences
considered well-performing, one for all sequences passing the thermodynamic
selection criteria, and one for all sequences submitted.  Sheet values include
computations for trigger-template Tm, template-template Tm, count of
bonds in self-hybridization, P90, Diff, PWM classification, and Navie Bayes
classification.
<p>
<b>Verification</b>.  100,000 newly designed EXPAR templates with nt positions
1-14 were populated randomly with A, T, C, or G with equal probability.
45,134 were excluded for thermodynamic selection cutoffs, and remaining were
classified by PWM or Naive Bayes.  23 of well-performers and seven poor-performers
were synthesized and characterized.
<p>
<b>Results</b>.  The basic data for this study are the plots of real-time
relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) vs. time of reaction.  Each reaction
contains trigger or no-trigger primer/oligo.  The rise in the no-trigger
reaction takes a longer time to observe (~35 min) whereas the rise in
RFI for triggered reaction starts at ~15-20 min and is complete ideally before
no-trigger RFI begins with the well-performing class.  For the poor-performing
class, the separation in time will be larger.  Note that trigger is present
at 10<sup>&minus;3</sup> of the template (1 pM vs. 1 nM).  Note that amplification
can differ even when the Tm are very close, indicating thermodynamics is not the
chief parameter.  The no-trigger amplification is too close in time to presence
of trigger, and this background amplification is not based on oligo contamination
or primer-dimer type extension, but might be based on the DNA polymerase
amplifying without primer-based replication.  Curves are normalized and then
the 10% and 90% intensity point values computed, along with other parameters.
In most cases, the nonlinear least squares fit was excellent.  Normalized
residuals are 0.03 and 0.04 for the positive and negative curves, respectively.
In some cases curves did not reach a plateau or were unstable and so only the
N10 value was of use.  Plots of Diff vs. P90 also indicate an important performance
parameter, with mean and standard error values are plotted for replicates on
different plates and overall.
<p>
Variability in the P90, N10, and Diff paramenters are not explained by
template-trigger annealing or template self-annealing.  Template-trigger annealing
has appreciable correlation to these three params and even this correlation is
low, indicating template sequences with same trigger-template Tm vary considerably.
When template-trigger Tm &lt; 40&deg;, amplification is slower with more
Diff &lt; 0 values, a reason to set Tm cutoff limit from 35-40&deg;.   There
are well-performers though with Tm &lt; 40&deg;, so this is not a perfect
predictor.  If the P90 on some curves was &gt; 20 min they could be rated
good performers if Diff was large: amplification can be hastened by modifying
reaction conditions.  Quite a few had P90 &lt; 20 min but the Diff &lt; 0,
poor-performers because of early-onset nonspecific amplification.  Class III
templates generally amplify rapidly but have no separation between
specific and non-specific amplification, but also include late/slow
amplifiers with good Diff values.

For classification systems, the first is the PWM with SVM.  Speed of amplification
is measured by P90 and the separation between specific and nonspecific
amplification by Diff.  Two PWMs were used, one which looked at low P90 and the
other at high Diff, both desirable factors.  These are used to obtain scores
for all sequences in training sets, and from these scores, a linear classification
bound derived using SVM algorithm.  The PWMs and SVM-made classification boundary
is used to categorize test set sequences as Class I or II.   After the cross-validation,
the entire shuffled set is tested.  If there is no information in the real data
set that correlates template sequence to template performance, the predictive
power of Classifier model from real and shuffled data should be similar.
Plots of Diff score (range 0 to 10) vs. P90 score (range 0 to 10) are made
for each template sequence for the real and shuffled data and the classification
boundaries produced from each of the 10 training-test set validations plotted
for these two plots.  Class I and II show clear segregation and the classification
boundary slope values quite similar:  this shows that it really did not matter
which test and training set data were randomly grouped.  With this real data,
68% of Class I templates correctly were classed as Class I (68% sensitivity)
while 80% of Class II templates could be classed as Class II.  A Fisher's
exact test measure show significance at <i>P</i> = 4.4 &times; 10<sup>&minus;12</sup>
compared to null hypothesis:  unbiased classification (50%).  A positive
predictive value of 78%  which is ratio of Class I correct identiification
vs. all Class I predicted sequences.  The negative predictive value is the
percent correctly predicted Class II to all Class II sequences.  With shuffled
data fewer templates were correctly classified.  These measures show that
PWM with SVM approach helps to determine good classification.
<p>
The Naive Bayes machine learning approach instead uses a training approach of
categorized sequences, in contrast to PWM approach requiring scoring by P90
and Diff.  Machine learning can analyze significance of multi-base sequence
motifs.  In this work motifs up to 4 bases long at specified positions within
EXPAR templates are looked at;  theh probability of motifs longer than 4 bases
is too low in data of this type. &lt;25% of the theoreitcally possible 4760
position-motifs up to 4 bases long occurred at least 3 times in our data set.
In the machine learning approach a feature selection method was used to identify
position motifs that are over-represented in either Class I or II templates,
and to weight the motifs relatively.  A classifier method derives a model that
categorizes templates as Class I or II based on significant position motifs,
using the WEKA program suite to test as many possible combinations of feature
selection and classifier methods available.  Best results were from the RELIEF
attribute evaluation, coupled with Naive Bayes classification.  Plots of
Diff values vs. P90 values of Class I and II templates for both the real and the
shuffled data were done.  71% of Class I templates were correctly classified
and 78% of Class II correctly classfied.  Despite a limited dataset, the
Naive Bayes classification did reasonably well:  significiance is
<i>P</i> = 6 &times; 10<sup>&minus;12</sup> by Fisher's exact test.  The
preditive power is similar to PWM with slightly higher sensitivity and slightly
lower specificity.   Significantly fewer templates were correctly classes with
shuffled data which is consistent with a null hypothesis of unbiased
classification.
<p>
These different methods were combined into the computational tool ETSeq for
facilitating EXPAR template selection based on thermodynamic and sequence
dependence criteria.  Input sequences first have template-trigger and template
self-annealing Tm values determined, and then the sequences are evaluated
through PWM and Naive Bayes classification.  In a test of the tool, 81% of the
Class I sequences were observed as Class I, 11% were predcited Class II, and 8%
were ambiguous.  It is interesting that there was greater sensitivity for ETSeq
than on the separate PWM and Naive Bayes, probably because the training set
did not use cross-validation.  For Class II, 76% were Class II, 5% were Class I,
19% were ambiguous.  Specificity is lower for combined method than each individual
possibly because of ambiguous results are a large proportion.  As for intermediate
Class III sequences they are not easy to predict, generally because they have
features of both Class I and II and fall into those sometimes.  They are close
to the borderlines within those classes.
<p>
30 additional sequences were synthesized, 23 of them Class I and 7 being Class II.
100% of the Class I sequences were correctly predicted, and 67% were predicted
to be Class II.  So of the 23 Class I templates, the experiemnts showed that
12 of them were Class I, 8 were Class III, and 3 were Class II.  The positive
predictive value of ETSeq is ~52% for well-performing, and 88% for good- and
intermediate performing.  For randomly seelcted sequences, it predicts 33% of
the well-performers and 66% of the good- and intermediate-performers.  ETSeq
was better at predicting Class II sequences.  Another computational tool was
produced to design EXPAR templates to identify  pathogens using a fingerprinting
2-stage EXPAR reaction.
<p>
Aside from helping assay design, the nature of the sequence motifs that perform
well in EXPAR were studied.  Position-depedent frequency maps were produced
for templates showing fast and slow amplification for templates with good Diff
values.  Entropy (randomness) of each position was calculated with Class I
and II templates only as well as both combined.  The Naive Bayes machine also
determined significant position motifs that help to classify Class I and II
templates.
<p>
Based on the results positions 7-10 appear to have the greatest amount of
information.  Of the top 25 significant position motifs identified, the
well-performers were overrepresented with cytidine (C) and some degree of
thymidine (T), while G and A are significantly underrepresented.  Bases
A and G are over-represented in Class II templates and C and T are underrepresented.
Similar trends are seen in other positions as far as base composition, but effect
more pronounced with the significant position motifs.   GC content is 63% for
top 25 motifs and 55% in the variable positions.  For poor performers the GC
content is 45% within top 25 and 50% in variable positions.  GC content
weakly correlates to template performance metrics (P90, N10, Diff).  The
better performance measures are the type and position of base in the template
than GC content.  Multibase motifs were identified using Naive Bayes as well.
The top 25 motifs for Class I include CC three times; top 25 motifs for class II
include AG five times, and GA three times.  Single base positions show A
occurs six times, but G occurs only once;  thus GA or AG  may be a poor
performer compared to just a G.  Motifs CC-8, CT-9, and CCT-8 were found in top
25 Class I.
<p>
What causes poor vs. good performance? Since EXPAR has direct repeats near the
3&prime; end, what about primer-dimer type template self-priming?  Examination
shows that Class II templates do not have higher degree of 3&prime; self-complementarity
compared to Class I.  The criteria for selecion is that Tm for self-annealing
must be &lt;25&deg;, unlikely to occur at 55&deg;.  Poor performers also have
GA-rich motifs near 3&prime; end and do not hybridize readily with themselves,
unlike GT-rich forming wobble pairs.
<p>
Preincubation of polymerase with EXPAR templates will significantly accelerate
nonspecific background amplification.  The polymerase will bind to the
single-stranded EXPAR template present in nanomolar concentrations.  Thus the
nicking enzyme is not required for initiating nonspecific amplification, but
is required to propagate it.
<p>
Cytidine has the lowest hydrophobicity of all four nucleotides.  DNA polymerase
has the lowest affinity for homo-oligonucleotides d(pC)n &lt;  d(pT)n &lt;
d(pG)n &approx; d(pA)n:  polymerase presence may cause interaction more strongly
with certain regions of single-stranded template of poorly performing sequences
compared to well-performing sequences.  The polymerase may synthesize cDNA
to the ss-EXPAR with priming not in a conventional way.  Unprimed synthesis
might occur in other templates, but unless efficient amplification occurs it
is unnoticed.  With a positive feedback loop in EXPAR, even small numbers of
short DNA sequences complementary to template have the general structure
X&prime;r&prime; will trigger a reaction and cause exponential amplification.
The priming mechanism is not clear, but a single dNTP to the post-insertion
site of the polymerase might be involved.  Polymerases interact with the
base present in the post-insertion site containing recessed 3&prime;-OH
to which incoming nucleotide is added.  For thermostable DNA polymerases a
single nt can be a primer, although it has lower <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> and
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> than with longer primers.
<p>
To design EXPAR templates, the UNAFold application with the Zuker-Turner
algorithm:  input params set to oligo, with Tm = 55&deg; and [DNA] = 50 nM,
[Na<sup>+</sup>] = 1 M, [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] = 0 M (although [K<sup>+</sup>] = 30 mM
and [Mg<sup>2+</sup> = 3 mM]).   Trigger-template annealing calculated on
predicted &Delta;<i>H</i> and &Delta;<i>S</i> and on EXPAR template concentration
based on the equation below (valid when the strand is in excess):
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = &Delta;<i>H</i><sup>0</sup> &div;
(&Delta;<i>S</i><sup>0</sup> &minus; <i>R</i> ln[template])
<p>
The self-annealing Tm for template is calculated this way:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = &Delta;<i>H</i><sup>0</sup> &div;
(&Delta;<i>S</i><sup>0</sup> &minus; <i>R</i> ln[DNA/4])
<p>
This assumes the total [DNA] represents both strands in equal concentration.
<p>
The fitting of the RTI vs time curves was done using nonlinear least squares
with MATLAB to a sigmoidal hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>y</i><sub>fit</sub>(<i>t</i>) = <i>y</i><sub>min</sub> + 0.5 &times;
&Delta;<i>y</i> &times; [1 + <i>tanh</i>{(<i>t</i> &minus;
<i>t</i><sub>0</sub>) &div; <i>&tau;</i>}]
<p>
The four parameters necessary for the fit are <i>y</i><sub>min</sub> =
normalized baseline value; &Delta;<i>y</i> = multiplicative scaling factor;
<i>t</i><sub>0</sub> = point of inflection on time axis; <i>&tau;</i> =
measure of steepness of the sigmoidal function near the <i>t</i><sub>0</sub>.
The raw fluoresence value is first normalized from 0 to 1 using
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>R&#785;</i> = (<i>R</i> &minus; <i>R</i><sub>min</sub>) /
  (<i>R</i><sub>max</sub> &minus; <i>R</i><sub>min</sub>)
<p>
The <q>trust-region-reflective</q> algorithm is used in the least squares fit to
find the four parameters over the entire set of discrete times <i>t</i>.  From
the fitted data, times required to reach 10% and 90% of maximum plateau are
determined for both trigger and no-trigger.  The data fit is also assessed
(resnorm).  No-Amp curves are those with no detectable amplification; Late-Amp
curves are those where amplification begins late and does not finish.  Some
curves are non-sigmoidal (NS).  Others almost reached final plateau and the
maximum was estimated.
<p>
<b>PWM</b>.  The first PWM is generated based on templates in training set
whose P90 is in lowest 30% of P90 value range. The second PWM is from templates
with training set who Diff is highest 40% of Diff value range.  For each of the
14 variable positions in EXPAR template, the probability to find any of the
4 nt at position <i>n</i> is <i>p</i><sub>i</sub><sup>(n)</sup>, where <i>n</i>
is the position index (1 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 14) and <i>i</i> is nucleotide
index (0 &le; <i>i</i> &le; 3).  The value <i>p</i><sub>0</sub><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup>
is the highest probability for any <i>p</i><sub>i</sub><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup> at
position <i>n</i>.  The <q>energies</q> for position <i>n</i> are:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>&epsilon;<sub>i</sub></i><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup> =
 ln [<i>p</i><sub>0</sub><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup> &div; <i>p<sub>i</sub></i><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup>]
<p>
the resulting matrix (PWM) <i>&epsilon;<sub>i</sub></i><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup> is
a 4-row &times; 14-column matrix corresponding to a nucleotide &times;
position parameter for the template.  The two PWMs are applied to calculate
scores for all other template sequences.  First generate a sequence matrix
<i>S<sub>i</sub></i><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup>, where <i>n</i> is position and
<i>i</i> is nucleotide:  if the position <i>n</i> has nucleotide with
index <i>i</i>, the <i>S<sub>i</sub></i><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup> = 1, else
<i>S<sub>i</sub></i><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup> = 0.  The P90 and Diff scores for
sequence <i>s</i> are then calculated as:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>E</i>(<i>s</i>) = &sum;(<i>n</i>=1&rarr;14)&sum;(<i>i</i>=0&rarr;3)
  <i>&epsilon;<sub>i</sub></i><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup><i>S<sub>i</sub></i><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup>
<p>
Correlations between trigger-template Tm vs P90 and vs Diff and vs N10 were done
and these values were <i>r</i> = &minus;0.40, &minus;0.25, and 0.33, respectively.
Correlations between template %GC content vs P90, N10, and Diff were <i>r</i> =
&minus;0.34, &minus;0.20, and 0.29, respectively.  Note that all three class
sequences were used to evaluate the correlations.

Chemical And Physical Basics Of Routine Formaldehyde Fixation
<p class="Para1">
Fixation preserves cellular architecture and the composition of cells in tissue
Proteins, CHOs and other bioactive moieties preserve relationship so they can
be studied.  Fixative must preserve mechanical rigidity (cause hardening) and
prevent decomposition, putrefaction, and autolysis.   Four major groups of
fixatives are known: aldehydes, oxidizing agents, alcohol-based fixatives,
and metallic group.  Aldehydes include formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde.
Oxidizing agents are osmium tetroxide and potassium permanganate, and these with
aldehydes, cross-link proteins.  Alcohol based (MeOH, EtOH, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH)
are protein-denaturing agents.  Metallic group will form insoluble metallic
precipitates like HgCl<sub>2</sub> and picric acid.
<p>
Formalin reacts with primary amines to form Schiff bases, and with amides to
form hydroxymethyl compounds.  The hydroxymethyl group condense with another
amide to form methyl diamides.  Alcoholic hydroxyls form acetals, and
sulfhydro groups form sulfhydral acetal analogs with HCHO.  Proteins have a
very strostrong affinity for HCHO.  Tyrosine side chains have a strong affinity.
SimilarlyArg, Phe, or Trp residues help to create the affinity.  The routine is
10% formalin (3.7% [v/v] HCO in water with 1% MeOH).  Undiliuted commercial
formaldehyde has 10% MeOH as a preservative.  Thus commercial formalin fixes
in two phases: (1) first with alcohol, (2) then crosslinking of the aldehyde.
The alcohol dehydrates the tissues to harden them.  If stored for a long time
formalin is oxidized to formic acid;  because the acid amount is unknown, its
presence can react with blood to form birefrigent crystal (<q>formalin
pigments</q>).
<p>
In solution, HCHO reacts with water to form the glycol (hydrated HCHO) which
is methylene glycol [H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)<sup>2</sup>].  These methylene
glycol molecules will polymerize as follows
<p class="eqn">
<i>n</i> H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)<sub>2</sub> &rarr;
H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)-[O-CH<sub>2</sub>]<sub>n&minus;1</sub>-OH +
(<i>n</i> &minus; 1) H<sub>2</sub>O
<p>
Addition of a small amount of base (hydroxide) will quickly restore the
formaldehyde.  Either the hydrated or non-hydrated form will be a fixative.
The equilibrium favors methylene glycol.  As HCHO is removed from solution,
such as reaction with biomolecular moieties, more will form.  IR spectra reveal
no HCHO form, and the major lines of Raman spectra reveal methylene glycol only.
Tissue diffusion of fixative is of methylene glycol and HCHO.
<p>
In the initial or primary stage, primary amines like Lys, purines and
thiols (Cys) form monomethyl, dimethyl, or hydroxylmethyl derivatives which
crosslink to form methylene bridges.  The Schiff base imine is reactive with
other functional groups.  The initial Schiff base formation occurs in 24-48 h,
while the crosslinking takes 30 d to form stable bridging.  Antigen retrieval
occurs because of using chemistry that reverses the intial Schiff base formation.
<p>
Many tissues have dehydrogenases that react with the HCHO to metabolize it
(to the acid).  In some cases, tissue fixed at the first depths of a block
will act as a barrier to methylene glycol and HCHO to the deeper tissues.
A 10% formalin solution is actually a 4% HCHO solution, and this is 1.3 molar
by definition.  Unbuffered HCHO with no MeOH present has an osmotic pressure
of 1300 mOsm at standard conditions.  Isotonic saline is 250-350 mOsm, and so
formalin should diffuse faster.  Fresh HCHO solutions will likely penetrate
faster, so formalin should not be too old to keep polymer formation low.
<p>
Generally tissue blocks should not be larger than 2 cm thickness:  at 25&deg;
penetration occurs in 24 h, while at 37&deg;, in about 18 h.  Fixation is
dependent upon buffering, penetration depth, temperature, concentration, and
time.  Naturally penetration is affected by Fick's diffusion laws:
flux <i>J<sub>i</sub></i> = (<i>DC<sub>i</sub> / RT</i>)
(<i>&part;&mu;<sub>i</sub> / &part;x</i>), where <i>i</i> is the molecular
species, <i>D</i> is diffusion coefficient, <i>C</i> is concentration in
mol/m<sup>3</sup>, <i>R</i> is gas constant (J / K mol), <i>T</i> is abolute
temperature (K), <i>&mu;<sub>i</sub></i> is chemical potential of species
<i>i</i>, and <i>x</i> is distance.  The diffusion constant <i>D</i> is
dependent on temperature, fluid viscosity, particle size and correlate by
the Stokes-Einstein law for solutions with low Reynolds numbers:
<i>D</i> = <i>K<sub>B</sub>T</i> / 6<i>&pi;&eta;r</i>.  Note that &eta; is
viscosity, <i>r</i> is molecular radius, and &mu; is particle terminal drift
velocity to an applied force.   If [HCHO] varies in small spaces, the
Fick's second law of diffision applies:  <i>&part;&phi;</i>/<i>&part;t</i>
= &Delta;(<i>D</i>&nabla;&phi;)  Generally temperature will play a large role
in seeing formalin penentrate the tissues.  A 1&deg; increase will cause a
change of 0.37.  The density of formaldehyde  &rho;<sub>m</sub> = &rho;<sub>w</sub>
+ (5.0950 &minus; 6.8166 &times; 10<sup>&minus;3</sup><i>T</i>)<i>W<sub>F</sub></i>
where <i>W<sub>F</sub></i> = weight percent of formaldehyde in solution.
<p>
pH clearly has a major role in the use of formalin fixative. More alkaline pH
favors depolymerization of polyoxymethylene glycol to the HCHO form.  Since
HCHO can oxidize to formic acid and lower the pH, it makes sense to buffer the
formalin at least to a neutral pH.  Unbuffered formalin at room temperature has
a pH of 4, and this can ionize amino and guanidinyl groups to a larger extent,
inhibiting Schiff base formation important in fixation.  As titration to increase
pH is done, there is a point where there is a sharper increase in pH, this point
being at pH 7-8.
<p>
One feature that may help in rapid penetration of fixative is the use of a
higher pressure.  Internal vasculature increases the surface area and enables
better penetration too.  Additionally a higher concentration of formaldehyde
might have an effect.
<p>
Increases in temperature cause depolymerization of polyoxomethylene glycol too,
and expectedly helping for fast fixation.

Arginylation-dependent regulation of a proteolytic product of talin is
essential for cellâ€“cell adhesion
<p class="Para1">
Cell adhesion fundamental in embryogenesis, cell motility, cancer, tissue
integrtiy and architechture. Two types of adhesions are seen at molecular level:
(1) integrin-based interactions between cells and extracelluar matrix (ECM)
and (2) cadherin-based interactions related to cell-to-cell contacts. Both 
require filamentous actin, but are mediated by different protein complexes 
intracellularly between actin and the transmembrane proteins. Integrin focal 
adhesions are mediated by talin. Composition of cadherin less clear. Genetic 
studies show talin-cadherin interaction, but there is no evidence of functional 
involvement. Talin is rod-like protein with binding sites for vinculin (the 
domain has three segments in the protein), actin (domain also has three 
segments) and integrin (domain has one segement). It also has a
kinase-interacting domain just after the first segement of the integrin-binding
domain, and a dimerization domain very near the C-terminus. Calpain-dependent
proteolysis between positions 433 and 434 release the N-terminal regulatory
domain. Other proteases also have talin as a substrate in vitro, but no in vivo
products are seen. Recent study of arginylated proteins identified talin, and
arginylation-deficient cells with Ate1 arginyltransferase knockout show
adhesion defects.
<p>
Mouse talin 1 has 2541 amino acids and is arginylated on A1903 in the last
quarter of the molecule. This means that proteolysis must occurs at position 
between 1902 and 1903. The C-terminal fragment has a mass of ~70 kDa. Mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts were used in the original arginylation study, so a study 
of lysates of confluent MEF cultures were probed with mAb C20 (Santa Cruz) 
specific for C-terminal talin (epitope 2490-2540, overlaps dimerization domain):
western blot shows the full length talin (250 kDa), a 180 kDa C-terminal 
fragment with the N-termInal FERM domain gone, and the 70 kDa fragment.
Immuno-pulldown with C20 anti-talin shows 70 kDa is present in all preparations
of cells (other fragments are absent or present and may be related to differences
in cell state in culture).  Peptide masses from MS identified as talin.  Any
disruption of arginylation or talin function causes defects in cardiac function
at multiple levels:  analysis of mouse heart tissue and blood cells (control)
showed on C20 blot that full-length talin is present in both, but only the
70 kDa fragment is present in heart tissue.  Cultured MEFs were treated with
calpain inhibitors (ALLN, calpain inhibitor 3, calpeptin, and EST, all at
50 &micro;M) and a control (3.3 &micro;M &beta;-lactone, a proteasome inhibitor)
and the solvent (DMSO) and lysates examined by immunoblot with C20:  only was
the 70 kDa fragment seen in the DMSO control and the &beta;-lactone, not in the
calpain-inhibited lysates, demonstrating a need for calpain.  In fact, the
level of 70 kDa fragment with proteasome inhibitor was increased, indicating
that proteasome may be involved in fragment turnover.  A calpain-4 deficient
cells line (CPN4 KO MEF) known to lack small regulatory subunit for calpain-1
and -2 (the major calpain proteases) showed a significant reduction in 70 kDa
fragment level, and this is rescued by reintroducing calpain-4.   Calpain-2
is found in the periphery and thought to be responsible for talin cleavage:
to test this, siRNA knockdown of both calpain-1 and -2 were done using
stable transfection of MEF, and the calpain-2 but not -1 knockdown reduced the
70 kDa VAD fragment below blot detection.
<p>
MEF cells were then grown in culture that was scarce and confluent to ascertain
effects of cell density.  Processing to 70 kDa was clearly dependent on
confluence:  the more confluence, the higher the expression level.  Cells plated
without cell contact showed little 70 kDa VAD fragment.  Cells were plated at
low density into serum-free medium (to inhibit proliferation and motility):
comparing scarce cells with and without serum did not show increased 70 kDa
VAD in either, so reduced cell motility or proliferation does not account for
its presence.  Different initial plating densities were then tried, and as the
density increased, so did 70 kDa expression,  and thus is a function of cell-cell
contact.  Disrupted cell contacts were made by trypsin treatment of confluent
cells:  70 kDa protein decreased in expression and then increased well after
cell subculture and proliferation to confluence.
<p>
Since cadherin has been identified in cell-cell contact, a VAD-GFP fusion
was transfected to cells and flourescent microscope shows plaques localized
to cell periphery and not center.  mAb 8d4 against the middle of the talin
protein and which does not react with 70 kDa fragment but does with full length
talin was co-localized to the VAD-GFP recombinant.  A subset of VAD spots did
localize to cell borders and the 8d4 mAb did not react, indicating that the
talin there was not full-length.  Co-staining with integrin showed its presence
where VAD-GFP was absent.  Co-staining with anti-cadherin and VAD-GFP does show
that cadherin is associated with VAD at cell borders.  This was also confirmed
by using fluorophore-labeled anti-C20 mAb with the anti-cadherin.  Note that
if talin were fused to GFP at talin's N-terminus, there is no colocalization,
indicating that cell-cell adhesion is related to the 70 kDa VAD product and not
the full length.
<p>
Knocking out Ate1 arginyltransferase reduces cell spreading and the size and
number of focal adhesions.  Ate1 knockout MEFs were shown in the microscope
to have fewer cell-cell adhesions along with a reduction in size and number
of cadherin-containing plaques although the level of cadherin, vinculin,
&beta;-catenin, and talin were normal compared to wild-type MEF cells (shown
in figure and in Kurosaka et al paper).  This was correlated to the reduced
level of VAD fragment in the knockouts as shown on immunoblot of cells that
were confluent and non-confluent cell cultures.  The fragment was also very
low in expression regardless of cell density, indicating that arginylation
is essential to maintain a high expression level.  Cells treated with
&beta;-lactone proteasome inhibitor did not show increased VAD fragment.
<p>
To test whether absence of arginylation affected calpain-dependent proteolysis,
immunoblot with antibody that detects spectrin products of calpain cleavage
were prepared and it was shown that spectrin proteolysis was significantly
reduced in Ate1 KO celsl compared to WT.  However, calpain-1 and -2 levels
were not different between KO and WT cells.  Arginylation KO thus appears to
affect calpain activity, and so absence of VAD is because of this inhibition.
<p>
An attempt was made to rescue Ate1 KO cells by transfecting with VAD-GFP
fusion (and GFP control).  Reintroducing VAD to the KO cells resulted in
large increase in cadherin-containing plaques.  Another rescue using RFP
(mCherryFP)-fused N-cadherin (major cadherin in fibroblasts) after photobleaching
showed rescue.  Cadherin punctae in Ate1 KO had shorter recovery half-time after
bleaching than in WT cells, a difference abolished by putting VAD fragment
back in, and indicating that cadherin cell-to-cell contact depends partially on
VAD.  Hence VAD is important in cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion.
<p>
Actin polymer is required for stabilizing adhesion complex mediated by cadherin.
VAD fragment has domains directly or indirectly promoting actin polymerizaiton.
Our experiments show that size of actin patches adjacent to cadherin plaques
in cell-cell contact sites in Ate1 KO cells was significantly reduced compared
to WT cells.  VAD fragment was reintroduced in a rescue experiment and the defect
was removed partially.  Proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased GFP-VAD fragment
cellular levels and this increased F-actin proportionally in the cell, indicating
VAD affects actin polymerizations.
<p>
Arginylation of VAD fragment could affect it by changing function, localization
or metabolic fate (all things shown with other arginylated proteins).  GFP
fusion constructs were created to look at arginylated and non-arginylated VAD.
The recombinants were made by putting GFP on the C-terminus of VAD and
ubiquitin on the N-terminus, with VAD either having just A1903 or R-A1903 to
build in the Arg.  The Ubq is then removed with a co-expressed De-ubiqutinating
enzyme, to have either the A- or the RA-N-terminus.  The R-VAD form was much
less abundant than non-R-VAD, and this difference could be prevented using
MG132 inhibitor.  Differences in stationary levels of arginylated and nonarginylated
might be due to differences in cotranslational processing:  not that VAD is
not produced by de novo translation but by posttranslational proteolysis, or
there could be differences in posttranslational degradation rates.  To test
if degradation is at work, changes in levels over time by adding cycloheximide
to inhibit protein synthesis.  Decreases in R-VAD were only moderaterly faster
than VAD, with half-lives of both &gt; 5 h and allow time for affecting physiology.
Both R-VAD-GFP and VAD-GFP showed similar localization to cadherin-positive
cell-cell contacts and this indicates arginylation does not affect VAD fragment
target to cell adhesion structures.
<p>
Effect of arginylation on VAD fragment physiological function was tested by
comparing phenotype rescue of VAD and R-VAD on cell-cell and focal adhesions
in Ate1 KO cells.  MG132 present for different periods of times to cause
accumulation of VAD and R-VAD:  this counters effects due to differences in
intracellular leves and test dose dependence.  Results show that neither
fragment had an affect on rescuing focal adhesion defects in the Ate1 KO cells,
but both the VAD and R-VAD caused increases in the size of cadherin-containing
cell-cell adhesions in a similar dose-dependent manner (compared to GFP controls).
Increasing R-VAD levels caused significant increases in cadherin plaque density
that were not seen with VAD fragment.  This improved rescue enabled cells to
improve in morphology of the confluent Ate1 KO cell monolayer, making it appear
like WT cells.  Arginylation thus faciliates talin VAD in establishing and/or
maintaining cell-cell adhesions.
<p>
<b>Materials and Methods</b>.  Mouse talin 1 isoform VAD fragment (A1903 to
Cterm) was cloned from full-length talin.  The arginylated and non-arginylated
were inserted between N-terminal ubiquitin and C-terminal eGFP by cutting
with <i>Sac</i>II and <i>Bam</i>HI.  A Kozak translation initiation site was
placed in front of the Ubq domain to ensure translation start.  One sequence
(CCACCATCAATG at nt 5890-5991) in talin 1 was replaced by another without
changing amino acids to minimize interference of internal translation start site.
These were inserted into pEGFP-N2 (Takara) between XhoI and NotI (transient
expression) or into pQC-XIP (Takara) between NotI and EcoRI for retroviral
infection and stable expression.  Full-length N-cadherin-eGFP fusion was a
gift from another lab:  the N-cadherin coding sequence and native upstream
5&prime;-UTR was amplified using primers (see sequence in text), the amplicon
digested with MluI and BclI, and this inserted into modified pBabe-puro vector
with a C-terminal mCherryFP fusion (not ATG start) that itself had been digested
with MluI and BamHi, and a linker sequence between N-cadherin and mCherryFP
integrated into construct (see text).  pSUPER.retro.puro carrying siRNA specific
for mouse calpain-1 and calpain-2 are retroviral vectors which are gifts from
another lab.  Ate1 KO and WT MEF cells were created earlier and immortalized
by primary cells.  Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (clone 17) are from
ATCC.  Floxed WT (PZ/PZ), calpain-4 KO, and rescued MEF cells ines that
stably express calpain-4 recombinant are gifts from another lab.  Mouse endothelial
line CLS1 is from U Penn Cell Center.  NIH 3%3 and mouse mammary epithelial
NMuMG are also gifts.  Cells are maintained in 1:1 DME-HG(Glutamax):F10 nutrient
(Invitrogen) are supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.  Cells are passaged
1:4 twice a week (3-4 d).  Plasmids are purified with Qiagen Endo-free Maxi Prep
kit if used for transfection.  Lipofectamine for HEK293T cells or Plus
Reagent for MEFs were used for transient transfection of those cells.  When
VAD fragments and GFP controls are to be stably transfected, retrovirus is
made using the plasmid constructs for pQC-XIP in combination with GAG-Pol and
VsvG vectors according to Takara protocol.  Then target cells are infected
with virus three times in polybrene presence.  Cells making GFP-fusions are
selected with puromycin, then sorted on flow cytometer.  For R-VAD-GFP
stably transfected cells, these are treated with MG132 for 5 h to inhibit
degradation before fluorescence sorting.  Where possible, GFP constructs were
enriched by fluorescence sorting, and selection using puromycin was also used.
<p>
Cultured cells are harvested by scraping and centrifuged 3000 rpm in 50 ml tubes
for 3 min RT.  Pellets are resuspended in PBS and washed twice in small conical
tube.  Pellets are weighed and lysed in 10 vol 1&times; SDS loading buffer boiling
5 min.  Pieces of ventricle of the hearts of C57BL/6J mice are minced with knif
and washed twice then frozen in liq nitrogen, which is ground to powder.  Powder
is treated with 2&times; SDS loading buffer and boiling 10 min.  Blood cells
are washed in ice-cold PBS 5 times and spun down and lysed.  For density
of cultured cells, cells are cultured for at least 1 week with repeated splitting
1:4 every 3 d to maintain exponential growth.  On day of test, cells are washed
with PBS with 0.25% trypsin (briefly), filtered through 40 &micro;m pore cell
strainers, counted on hemocytometer.  Cells were then plated according to the
counts.

The structure of an As(III) S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase: insights
into the mechanism of arsenic biotransformation
<p class="Para1">
Arsenic is an envirotoxin and human carcinogen, ranking 1st on EPA's 2011
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
Hazardous Substances.  An biogeocycle occurs as it come from geochemicals and
processed biologically.  Arsenite (AsO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>,
AsO<sub>3</sub><sup>3&minus;</sup>) is methylated in life domains from bacteria
to humans:  trimethylarsenite As(OCH3)3 [MAs(III)], dimethylarsenite
As(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O<sup>&minus;</sup> [DMAs(III)], and trimethylarsine
As(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> [TMAs(III)], which is volatile.  The enzyme
AS3MT in mammals is what methylates As(III), utilizing S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM).  Inorganic arsenate and arsenite are biotransformed in liver to
MAs(III) and DMAs(III) trivalents, which are carcinogenic.  Mammals including
humans excrete dimethylarsenate [As(=O)(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH), DMAs(V)]
and to lesser extent methylarsenate [As(=O)(OCH<sub>3</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>, MAs(V)];
it is uncertain whether the more oxidized [As(V)] species arise during enzymatic
methylation or by instability in the trivalent species.  It is important, since
the trivalent methylated products are more carcinogenic than the pentavalent
species.
<p>
In bacteria methylation of arsenic forms is intended to detoxify.  Genes for
arsenite S-adenosylmethyltransferase (ArsM) are found in bacteria, archaea,
fungi, and lower plants.  The gene CmArsM (AccNum ACN39191) is from a Yellowstone
Natl Park isolate of the acidothermophile red alga <i>Cyaninidioschyzon merolae</i>
and it methylates and volatilizes As(III) to TMAs(III), with 400 amino acids
(44,980 Da) and thermostable.  In this report the enzyme is crystallized
with and without SAM or As(III) to a 1.6 &Aring; resolution and the structure
reported.
<p>
CmArsM7B (CmArsM) from <i>Cyanidioschyzon</i> sp. 5508 has its 31 N-terminal
and 28 C-terminal residues deleted and is expressed in E coli BL21(DE3) and
purified.  An Se-Met labeled protein is also prepared.  Briefly BL21(DE3)
cells are grown in 1 ml LB overnight, spun 3000 <i>g</i> for 10 min 4&deg;,
suspended in same volume of M9 medium with 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2% glucose,
40 &micro;M kanamycin.  1 ml is suspended in 1 L M9 medium and grown to
mid-exponential at 37&deg;, and then 100 mg Lys, Phe, and Thr and then 50 mg
Ile, Leu and Val, and 60 mg L-(+)-Se-Met are added.  The culture is is grown
for 15 min at 37&deg; and 0.5 mM IPTG added to induce CmArsM.  After 6-8 h more
growth, it is then purified.  Crystalization has been described before using
hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20&deg; with a Wizard II from Emerald Biosystems
in a solution of 20% PEG-3000, 0.1 M TrisHCl pH 7.0, with 200 mM calcium acetate.
The best crystals from microseeding were transferred to 25% PEG-3350, 0.2 M
calcium acetate, 0.1 M TrisHCl pH 7.0 and 10% glycerol (w/v) and flash-cooled
in liquid nitrogen.  The crystallography revealed space group C2 with unit
cell <i>a</i> = 84.75&Aring; <i>b</i> = 101.68 &Aring;, <i>C</i> = 101.68 &Aring;
and <i>&beta;</i> = 115.67&deg; in the asymmetric unit.  Se-Met labeled protein
crystallized under same conditions.  CmArsM-As(III) crystals are obtained
by equilibrating 2.5 &micro;l protein mixed with 2.5 &micro;l of the
PEG-3000/Tris/calcium acetate containing 2 mM As(III).  Crystallization of
protein with SAM was not successful probably because Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupied
the binding site; so CmArsM was purifed with SAM present and then crystallization
done with 10 mM SAM present in the hanging drop AND reservoir, which was
20% PEG-8000, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1 M citrate phosphate pH 4.2; several rounds of
seeding by mixing eq. vol. protein with reservoir were necessary to obtain
crystals that could diffract at 2.75&Aring;.
<p>
For the SeMet-labeled crystals the diffraction is collected at the selenium
anomalous peak.  Structure is determined by single-wavelength anomalous
dispersion at Se peak energy and refined at 1.6 &Aring; resolution.  The
position of three SeMet sites are determined, heavy atom parameters refined
and single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phases calculated with PHENIX.
SeMet crystals had one molecule in asymmetric unit and a model containing
266 of 322 residues built with PHENIX.  Model with the remaining 56 residues
built with COOT and refined with PHENIX.  The final R<sub>work</sub> and
R<sub>free</sub> values are 17.0 and 19.6, respectively.  The ligand free
structure of CmArsM was determined as previously reported for ArsM.  The data
set had 372 residues (1-372) to 1.78 &Aring; resolution, solved by molecular
replacement (Phaser using SeMet modle and refined with REFMAC5 to R<sub>work</sub>
17.7 and R<sub>free</sub> 20.5).  For the CmArsM-SAM crystal, structure was
solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the ligand-free as the
search model and refined to final R<sub>work</sub> 20.6 and R<sub>free</sub> 28.3.
Ramachandran plots were made using MolProbity and only three residues in the
SAM-CmArsM crystal were outliers (E79, S2257, G372), which were surface residues
where electron density is poor.  Diffraction was done with ADSC Quantum 315r
(3 &times; 3 CCD array) detector at 100&deg; K in liquid nitrogen stream at
beam line 5.01/5.02 of the LBNL Advanced Light source.  Data integration and
scaling were done with HKL2000.  Coordinates and structure factor data are
entered into Protein Data Bank:  3P7E for CmArsM, 3QHU for CmArsM-SAM,
and 3QNH for CmArsM-As(III).  The diffraction images and validation reports
are also available.   Molecular models are generated using PyMOL.  Human models
of AS3MT and polymorphisms were constructed with SWISS-MODEL structure homology
modeling server (see the references).
<p>
Results. The 377-400 sequence of CmArsM7B was substituted with the sequence
AAALEHHHHHH featuring 11 residues with C-term His tag and the substituted
residues removed for crystallization of the 376 residues. The 3D structure does
not visualize the first 49 residues, while residues 50-372 were resolved at 1.7
&Aring; and in the SeMet-labeled at 1.6 &Aring;. Comparing the two shows near
identity. The N-terminal domain is residues 50-84, and the SAM binding domain
is formed from residues 85-173, 182-206, 231-253, and 270-280. The As(III)
binding is formed from residues 174-181, 207-230, and 254-269. There are 12
&alpha;-helices and 12 &beta;-sheets, four 3<sub>10</sub> helices, and long
extended loops. The SAM binding domain is a class I methyltransferase
Rossmann-fold structure, with a central, parallel seven-stranded &beta; sheet,
&beta;6-&beta;7-&beta;5-&beta;4-&beta;1-&beta;2-&beta;3, with all except &beta;
7 being parallel; additionally there are four helices (&alpha;1-&alpha;4) and
one 3<sub>10</sub> (3<sub>10</sub>1) helix on one side of the sheet and two
helices (&alpha;5, &alpha;8) and one 3<sub>10</sub> helix (3<sub>10</sub>2) on
the other side. Residues 174-181, 207-230, and 254-269 are inserted to generate
an arsenic binding pocket with three &alpha; helices (&alpha;6-&alpha;7, &alpha;
9) and one 3<sub>10</sub> helix (3<sub>10</sub>3) extending from the top of the
SAM binding domain. Between 1-2 of 100 entries in the PDB are methyltransferases
so they are well represented; in fact 488 nonredundant structures are present.
The CmArsM structure was submitted to the DALI server which identifies close
structural homologues. The top 25 structures scored <i>Z</i> = 19.7-15.4,
showing good relatedness.
<p>
CmArsM + SAM was determined at pH 4.2 to 2.75 &Aring; resolution.  SAM cofactor
binds between &beta;1/&alpha;2 loop with the highly conserved Gly-rich sequence
of D<sup>89</sup>XGXGXG<sup>95</sup>, a classic motif of the Rossmann fold
SAM-dependent methyltransferases.  Of the 25 closest structural homologues,
nine have SAM or the S-adenosylhomocysteine product, or sinefungin inhibitor
bound (the RMS deviation of SAM was 0.9 &Aring; for all atoms).  Both H bonds
and hydrophobic interactions are involved in SAM binding:  Met116 and Ile151
sandwich the adenine ring; adenine ring also H bonds Glu152 and Ile151.  The
ribose O2* and O3* hydroxyl atoms H-bond to Asp115 and Gln120 side chains.
A common feature of SAM-depedent methyltransferases are ribose hydroxyls
interacting with an acidic loop, such as that formed by &beta;2 and &alpha;4.
The Met S-methyl bonds to the backbone at the O atoms of Tyr70 and Cys174,
with distances of 3.41 and 3.64 &Aring; respectively.  The S atoms of the
three Cys residues at 72, 174, and 224 coordinate with the S-methyl group at
distances of 7.10, 5.18, and 4.59 &Aring;, respectively.  Cys72 and Cys174
S atoms are 2.08 &Aring; from each other, indicating a disulfide bond possibility.
Main chain carbonyl O atoms of Cys92 and Tyr70 H-bond with the carboxyl group
of SAM (distances of 3.47 and 3.66 &Aring; resp.  The SAM amide H-bonds to
the O atom carbonyl of Gly91 (2.75 &Aring;).  Calcium acetate at 200 mM was
required to crystallize the enzyme with a ligand, but not with SAM present.
Diffraction data showed a density at and fitting models indicated that
Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordiates well with O atom of Gly191 and with six H<sub>2</sub>O
molecules in pentagonal bipyramidal configuration.
<p>
The CmArsM + As(III) complex was determined at pH 7.5 to 1.75 &Aring; resolution.
Insertions of three sequences account for As(III) binding.  Unit M1 are residues
174-181 between &beta;4 and &alpha;5.  Unit M2 is an insertion of 24 residues
from 207-230 between &beta;5 and &alpha;8.  Unit M3 is an insertion of 16 residues
from 254-269 between &beta;6 and &beta;7.  The DALI server search for structural
homologues having similar domains gave zero results, indicating a novel feature.
The 25 closest methyltransferase structures differed in several ways:
the M1 insertion is generally a common fold but with a 3<sub>10</sub> helix in
the others.  With the M2 and M3 insertions, the other enzymes typically have
a combination of helices and &beta; sheets, nothing similar to CmArsM.
As(III) coordinates in a pyramidal way with thiols of Cys174 and Cys224
(avg. distance 2.21 &Aring;) and a third non-protein ligand at distance of
2.26 &Aring;.  The three atom liganding with As(III) have an average distance
of 3.34 &Aring; from each other.  The 3rd atom could be a sulfur or chlorine
atom.  It is unlikely to be a water molecule or hydroxyl ion, which would be
revealed with extra densities during refinement.  As the protein is purified
in 0.5 M NaCl and no inorganic sulfide is present during purification and
crystallization, the chloride is a strong possibility.
<p>
A big difference in reaction pathways among reports is whether a product is
trivalent or pentavalent in the partial reactions.  AS3MT is believed to
reduce pentavalent As to trivalent form with reductants, although the SAM
and As(III) binding sites show no structures indicative of reductases.  The
C-terminal 281-372 is novel but has no known reductase structural features,
consisting of three &alpha; helices, four &beta; strands, one 3<sub>10</sub> helix,
and long extended loops.  Sequence 373-400 have two Cys-Cys pairs that might
also bind As(III) but were not present in the recombinant.
<p>
Superpositioning the ligand-free and SAM-bound shows that sequence 50-79
undergoes a movement from 2.0 to 4.0 &Aring;.  The SAM-bound form is an
intermediate conformation of the catalytic cycle, and Cys72 could reorient
to become third ligand to As(III) during another cycle step.  Comparison of the
ligand-free to As(III) shows no global structual changes.  Cys174 side chain
reorients to form a bond with As(III).  All three conformations (ligand-free,
As(III)-bound, and SAM-bound) had the C&alpha; atoms superimposed.  The results
reflect the same, with the As(III) complex not varying from ligand-free, but the
SAM-bound undergoing a good shift.
<p>
Enzyme could not be crystallized as a tenary complex of SAM + As(III) or as
SAH + As(III).  A superimposition model was instead done.  This model shows the
methyl group directed towards the As(III) binding pocket.  Distances are
As(III)-methyl 4.22 &Aring;, Cys174-methyl 5.0 &Aring; and Cys224-methyl 4.50.
The As(III) lone pair orients to the carbon of the methyl group while the
chlorine is exposed to solvent on the As(III) opposite side.  The methyl transfer
is an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.  Cys72 is a conserved residue but not a ligand
to As(III); mutagenesis studies indicate it is required in methylation of
As(III) but not MAs(III), and it was thought to be a ligand to As(III).
The C<sub>&alpha;</sub> bond distance of Cys72 to As(III) is 8.23 &Aring; but
the SAM-bound structure show a loop &alpha;2-3<sub>10</sub>1 containing the
Cys72 moving toward As(III), with Cys72 C&alpha; closing to 6.58 &Aring;,
indicating it might participate in methylation.   There is also a suggestion
that Cys72 forms a disulfied with Cys174, but is that a crystallization
artifact or a true intermediate in catalysis?  Van der Waals contacts occur
with the SAM methyl and with Tyr70 and Cys174 carbonyl O atoms (3.41 and
3.64 &Aring; distances, respectively).  These may orient the methyl group
during approach to lone pair.
<p>
There was a positive density in the 3<sub>10</sub>2-&beta;4 loop, and with
side chains of Lys110, Arg145, and Glu160.  Using PHENIX automated ligand
search indicated either PEG or glycerol, which are present during crystallization
and freezing.  Building these moieties with either full of low occupancy
resulted in high temperature factors and excessive positive or negative difference
electron density, and the ambiguity was left out of the PDB submitted structure.
<p>
In aligning CmArsM and AS3MT from human, rat, and zebra fish, there is a
sequence identity of 42% and similarity of 60%.  CmArsM has 400 residues and
human AS3MT 375.  The longer length is represented in CmArsM as 12 residues
extending the N-terminal, and the other residues being small insertions.  The
three Cys residues are conserved, with the 72-174-224 positions corresponding
to 61-156-206 in the human enzyme.  Using the SWISS-MODEL structural homology
modeling server, the human AS3MT is built on the ligand-free CmArsM.  Modeling
quality showed QMEAN scoring function of 0.63 (within acceptable range).
Residues 50-363 from CmArsM was used as template and the model incorporated
291 of 323 residues in the final form.  Superposition of C<sub>&alpha;</sub>
backbone was excellent as was the secondary structure, indicating likely
equivalent reaction mechanisms.
<p>
Human AS3MT is a 32 kb gene with 11 exons and introns showing SNPs.  There are
also three SNPs in exons, R173W, M287T, and T306I in black and white American
individuals. Arg173 and Thr306 are conserved in the bacterium as Arg191 and
Thr327.  CmArsM Lys305 has same position as AS3MT Met287.  Note that Met287
and Lys306 are C-terminal domain residues, and Arg173 in in helix &alpha;5
of arsenic binding domain.  The M287T change appears to increase enzyme stability,
with the other two decrease it.  M287T individuals show increased urinary
production of DMA species and have higher risk for toxic ang genotoxic effects
of arsenic exposure.  Clearly the R173W polymorphism would have a predictable
effect on As(III) binding: the epsilon N atom of Arg173 H-bonds the epsilon
O atom of Glu170, distance ~3.0 &Aring; (note these residues are one turn of
a helix in apposition).  If this H-bond is lost, the loop connecting &alpha;5
helix to As(III) is moved.
<p>
There is not much agreement as to how arsenic is biotransformed in humans.
It produces mono-, di- and trimethylated arsenicals.  As(III) has been proposed
to be oxidatively methylated to MAs(V), then reduced to MAs(III).  This results
in a complicated reaction system involving reduction and methylation.
Mutagenesis studies showing a requirement of the three Cys residues for both
As(III) binding and methylation correlate well with the 3D structure findings.
Only Cys174 and Cys224 are required for binding of MAs(III) and its methylation
to DMAs(III).
<p>
There are multiple Cys residues in all methyltransferases besides the conserved
three involved with As(III) binding.  The others are rich in the C-terminal
domain, using in disulfide pairs.  While sequences are not conserved, the
Cys-rich feature suggests an importance in arsenic chemistry.  These residues
may be arsenic sensors or chaperones to move As(III) to catalytic site.  The
N-terminal also has four Cys residues and was not visible in the crystal
structure.  The role of Cys72 has been established with mutagenesis studies
and by sequence comparison for conservation.  Additionally, the 3D structure
shows it is moved toward As(III) when SAM is bound.
<p>
In the 3D structure studies, the 3rd ligand bound to As(III) was a nonprotein
ligand, likely chloride ion because of the high concentration of the ion.
But in vivo the third ligand is likely to be Cys72 thiolate, which is moved
closer to the As(III) when SAM is bound.  Another possibility is that it is
glutathione since three of them form a complex with As(III) and this is the donor
form to the methyltransferase.
<p>
The proposed catalytic steps are first the binding of As(III) to the three
Cys (72, 174, 224).  As the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction begins, the positive
charge on the sulfur atom must be transferred to the methyl group, and the
carbon must release the bonding pair in the C-S bond to the S atom.  This
allows the more positive methyl carbon to react with the As(III) lone pair,
forming the As-C bond.  SAH is produced on the other side.  At the As(III)
atom, the Cys72 on the opposite face becomes the leaving group as the bond with
methyl forms.  The MAs(III) form still remains abound to just the two Cys
coordinating it, having a higher affinity than As(III).  In a second methyation
reaction, one or the other of Cys174 or Cys224 then becomes a leaving group,
and the DMAs(III) then waits for another methylation.  The DMAs(III) has a lower
affinity to the enzyme.  Generally the product yield is DMAs(III) &gt; MAs(III)
&gt;&gt; TMAs(III), indicating that trimethylation is rarity.  The fact that
human urine shows oxidized, i.e. variously methylated As(V)=O products, could
be a problem of sample/specimen handling.
<p>
Questions to be answered are:
<ul>
<li>function of N- and C-terminal domains
<li>function especially the Cys residues in the tail domains
<li>participation of glutathione as a substrate
</ul>
<p>
The methylated trivalent forms are more carcinogenic, so it is vital to learn
whether the pentavalent forms are produced biologically.
