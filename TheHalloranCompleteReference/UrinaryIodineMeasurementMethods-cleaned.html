      <p>
        About 1 billion of world’s population at risk of iodine deficiency
        disorder (IDD). The ICCIDD was formed in 1986 with a cooperative mission
        with other UN agencies to eliminate this problem by year 2000. IDD can
        result in preventable mental retardation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clinical evaluation of IDD centers around estimating thyroid size,
        typically by palpating for goiter, and laboratory techniques, namely
        urinary iodine determinations. 90% of iodine is excreted in the urine
        and its level reflects the dietary intake of the mineral. Urine is
        obviously easier to collect than serum. The mineral is stable within the
        medium. Procedures with radioiodine and serum determinations of TSH and
        other hormones are more complex. This book includes a total of 7
        different methods in which iodine can be evaluated in urine medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 24 h urine sample is the most reliable, since iodine concentrations
        fluctuate in samples collected at random. This is obviously not
        practical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expressing the iodine as a normalized value (expressed usually relative
        to urinary creatinine determinations, since it is usual for individuals
        to excrete a constant amount of creatinine) is a way of understanding
        the value given in a sample. Others think iodine should be expressed
        merely as a concentration since creatinine is likely to be low in cases
        of malnutrition, which are areas likely to have IDD; it has been shown
        that iodine levels expressed in terms of creatinine appeared normal but
        were indeed in samples with true iodine deficiency. It is probably ideal
        for several collections to be taken during a 24 hour period to
        compensate for changes in urinary volume, dehydration, and fluid
        consumption which might affect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emphasis on measuring the urinary iodine is on measuring iodine
        levels semI
        <sup>−</sup>
        quantitatively in a large number of samples rather than focusing on
        precise determinations in small sample numbers. Correlation between low
        urinary iodine levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        IDD can be characterized in three stages related to determinations of
        urinary iodine and correlated to presence or absence of goiter and
        related disorders. Stage I (mild) may show goiter presence (prevalence
        is 5-19.9%) with 5.0-9.9 µg I/dL median urinary iodine. The need for
        correction is important. Stage II (moderate) is often seen with goiter
        (prevalance 20-29.9%) and a presence of hypothyroidism and a median
        urinary iodine of 2.0-4.9 µg I/dL; the need for correction is urgent.
        Stage III (severe) will be seen with obvious goiter and hypothyroidism
        in the sample population (goiter prevalence at least 30% and more), and
        the presence of cretinism in numbers, with median urinary levels &lt;
        2.0 µg I/dL; the need for correction is considered critical.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommended that urinary data be grouped as expressing proportions
        of the sample group for
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>≤ 2 µg I/dl</li>
        <li>≤ 5 µg I/dl</li>
        <li>≤ 10 µg I/dl.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It is thought that this manner of presentation gives a clearer picture
        of potential iodine deficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iodine in urine is usually present as iodide anion (I–). It is typically
        absorbed in the gut as that form. Present in the blood, the thyroid
        gland is the only organ which requires all of it, uptake being
        physiologically regulated by TSH and converted to thyroid hormones. The
        tissues serving as targets of thyroid hormones (T3 or T4) take up the
        hormone and destroy it to release the iodide. The urine is the principal
        excretory medium, but breast milk and feces make up the balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most methods for analysis of iodine involve preparing the urine sample
        by digestion in strong acid or by ashing at high temperature. Iodide
        appears to function as a catalyst in the reduction of ceric ion to
        cerous ion with arsenite serving as reducing agent (the Sandell-Kolthoff
        reaction,
        <i>Mikrochemica Acta</i>
        <b>1</b>
        : 9-25, 1937).

      <p>
        Iodide is effectively a catalyst since it is not consumed in the
        reactions. Ce
        <sup>4+</sup>
        is yellow in solution while the Ce
        <sup>3+</sup>
        ion is colorless, and the reaction is monitored spectrophotometrically
        by a change (reduction) in the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength.
        The sensitivity of this technique is down to several nanograms. The
        methods discussed are only variations on this particularly chemistry.
        Interferences with iodate, chloride, and bromide are considered to be
        minimal (they also function as catalysts). Sulfuric acid and chloride
        are necessary: the sulfuric acid affects the speed of the reaction and
        chloride protects against the oxidation of iodide to iodate. Arsenite
        should not be limiting, with recommendations that Ce
        <sup>4+</sup>
        :As
        <sup>3+</sup>
        be 1:20.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason for preparing urine (by digestion or ashing) is due largely
        to the elimination of other substances which can interfere with the
        reaction by causing the reduction or oxidation of ceric or arsenite ions
        (substances such as nitrite, thiocyanate, or ferrous ion). Thiocyanate
        can accelerate the reaction (artificially elevated values), and is
        likely to be present in urine where cassava is consumed. Cigarette
        smokers also have high levels of urinary thiocyanate, as high as cassava
        eaters. One method (F) does not make use of such a procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 7 methods (A through G) are now compared and the essential features
        described.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Removal of interfering substances</b>
          . All methods but F have a step to compensate for the effects of
          interfering substances. Most use acid digestion, while one employs
          alkaline ashing. Chloric acid digestion is mild in two methods, more
          vigorous in three others; the vigorous methods were adapted from the
          methods used to analyze blood iodide, but the more vigorous digestion
          does not seem to produce values different from the more mild
          treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Precision</b>
          . Reproducibility has never been really a problem. The use of
          automated equipment in some methods eliminates the potential for human
          (transcription) error. Precision may be greater for methods
          eliminating interfering substances, and is also affected by technical
          skill
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Speed</b>
          . The simpler the method, the faster. Three methods show a high rate
          of assay completion time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Technical Demands</b>
          . The three methods shown to be the fastest are the easiest to learn
          and to perform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Instrument complexity</b>
          . Two methods require rather expensive automated equipment, and the
          basic essential is something to measure color changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Safety</b>
          . Steps using chloric acid digestion represent the danger here. The
          digestion causes formation of perchlorate salts, which are explosive
          in their properties. It is important to vent samples being digested
          with these acids.
        </li>
      </ol>
