<h1 id="oil">Operating Instruction Letter (OIL)</h1>
<p>
Operating instruction letter (OIL) contains written instructions delivered
by Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to the Fiscal Intermediary
(Xerox at the moment) and its subcontractors to request a Medi-Cal policy or
system change, or both.
<p>
These changes in design or development are focused on an accurate implementation
and on timely bulletin changes.
<h2>Four Phases</h2>
The OIL goes through 4 changes:
<ol>
<li>Starts with the DHCS indicating that an Request For OIL (RFO) policy 
change is needed
<li>The CA-MMIS Division of DHCS then writes the OIL
<li>The OIL is implemented by the FI, which is Xerox (EPMO) or its File Maintenance
System Group subcontractors
<li>Providers are then notified of the changes by the FI: Xerox's Provider
Relations Organization (PRO)
</ol>
<p>
The OIL itself will be a letter with DHCS letterhead with the letter type
OIL #XXX-XX where #XXX-XX is a designation assigned when uploaded to SharePoint.
The letter must show the following elements:
<ul>
<li><b>Purpose</b> paragraph
<li><b>History</b>: list of communications relevant or related to the OIL
<li><b>Intent</b>: this is an explanation/justification of the Purpose
<li><b>Description of New Policy or Change in Policy</b>: this is a detailed
description of what is to be done in making the changes to the system or policy
<li><b>Update</b>: this specifies what information systems to update and what
components are updated
<li><b>Acknowledgment</b>: this may be a statement about how the OIL stays within
law or executive order.
<li><b>Publish</b>: this paragraph instructs the FI about what and how to make
the changes known to providers or beneficiaries
<li><b>Percentage</b>: This specifies how the federal government (FFP) will 
participate in the funding of the project as a percentage
<li><b>Contacts + Key Reference Info</b>: This section must indicate several
items:
 <ul>
 <li>Policy Effective Date: usually a month after publication
 <li>System Implementation Date: usually allowed to be set by FI
 <li>Policy Originator: the people who determined that policy should generate the OIL
 <li>OIL Contact: the person responsible for working the OIL through
 <li>ITMB Analyst: the analyst overseeing the project
 <li>References:  prior communications on the OIL
 <li>Applies:  programs this OIL affects
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Examples of Medi-Cal policy and system changes that initiate Phase I (RFO) are
maintenance updates to CA-MMIS tables or files or both, or which involve
minor programming or compiling of programs or both, to error codes, to 
the provider manual, or to provider bulletins.
<p>
Divisions within DHCS making RFOs include Medi-Cal Benefits Division (MBD),
Pharmacy Benefits Division (PBD), Fee-For-Service Rates Development Division
(FFSRDD), and others.
<p>
CA-MMIS Division receives the RFO.  Within the division either the 
Information Technology Management Branch (ITMB) or the Medi-Cal Policy
Evaluation Section (MPES) then prepares the OIL. CA-MMIS may also be told to 
request provider bulletin or changes to provider manual.
<p>
In writing the OIL, the writer will identify if a System Development Notice
(SDN) is needed.  After writing the OIL, the writer, policy department,
and CA-MMIS management must approve fo the letter.
