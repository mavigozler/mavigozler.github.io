			<h1 id="oil">Operating Instruction Letter (OIL)</h1>
			<p>
				Operating instruction letter (OIL) contains written instructions delivered
				by Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to the Fiscal Intermediary
				(Xerox at the moment) and its subcontractors to request a Medi-Cal policy or
				system change, or both.
			</p>
			<p>
				These changes in design or development are focused on an accurate implementation
				and on timely bulletin changes.
			</p>
			<h2>Four Phases</h2>
			The OIL goes through 4 changes:
			<ol>
				<li>Starts with the DHCS indicating that an Request For OIL (RFO) policy
					change is needed
				</li>
				<li>The CA-MMIS Division of DHCS then writes the OIL
				</li>
				<li>The OIL is implemented by the FI, which is Xerox (EPMO) or its File Maintenance
					System Group subcontractors
				</li>
				<li>Providers are then notified of the changes by the FI: Xerox's Provider
					Relations Organization (PRO)
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The OIL itself will be a letter with DHCS letterhead with the letter type
				OIL #XXX-XX where #XXX-XX is a designation assigned when uploaded to SharePoint.
				The letter must show the following elements:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Purpose</b> paragraph
				</li>
				<li><b>History</b>: list of communications relevant or related to the OIL
				</li>
				<li><b>Intent</b>: this is an explanation/justification of the Purpose
				</li>
				<li><b>Description of New Policy or Change in Policy</b>: this is a detailed
					description of what is to be done in making the changes to the system or policy
				</li>
				<li><b>Update</b>: this specifies what information systems to update and what
					components are updated
				</li>
				<li><b>Acknowledgment</b>: this may be a statement about how the OIL stays within
					law or executive order.
				</li>
				<li><b>Publish</b>: this paragraph instructs the FI about what and how to make
					the changes known to providers or beneficiaries
				</li>
				<li><b>Percentage</b>: This specifies how the federal government (FFP) will
					participate in the funding of the project as a percentage
				</li>
				<li><b>Contacts + Key Reference Info</b>: This section must indicate several
					items:
					<ul>
						<li>Policy Effective Date: usually a month after publication
						</li>
						<li>System Implementation Date: usually allowed to be set by FI
						</li>
						<li>Policy Originator: the people who determined that policy should generate the OIL
						</li>
						<li>OIL Contact: the person responsible for working the OIL through
						</li>
						<li>ITMB Analyst: the analyst overseeing the project
						</li>
						<li>References: prior communications on the OIL
						</li>
						<li>Applies: programs this OIL affects
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Examples of Medi-Cal policy and system changes that initiate Phase I (RFO) are
				maintenance updates to CA-MMIS tables or files or both, or which involve
				minor programming or compiling of programs or both, to error codes, to
				the provider manual, or to provider bulletins.
			</p>
			<p>
				Divisions within DHCS making RFOs include Medi-Cal Benefits Division (MBD),
				Pharmacy Benefits Division (PBD), Fee-For-Service Rates Development Division
				(FFSRDD), and others.
			</p>
			<p>
				CA-MMIS Division receives the RFO. Within the division either the
				Information Technology Management Branch (ITMB) or the Medi-Cal Policy
				Evaluation Section (MPES) then prepares the OIL. CA-MMIS may also be told to
				request provider bulletin or changes to provider manual.
			</p>
			<p>
				In writing the OIL, the writer will identify if a System Development Notice
				(SDN) is needed. After writing the OIL, the writer, policy department,
				and CA-MMIS management must approve fo the letter.
