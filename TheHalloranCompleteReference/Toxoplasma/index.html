<h1>Life Cycle</h1>

  alt="Life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii">
The image shows that a reservoir such as cats will excrete the unsporulated 
<b>oocysts</b> in its feces.  These oocysts then make their way into water or 
soil or the feed of farm animals (pigs, chickens, sheep, goats are among the 
prime examples).  Alternatively they might be consumed in contaminated food or 
water (particularly in areas of the world where hygeine does not conform to 
certain standards). <b>Tissue cysts</b> then form with the body (muscle, 
intestine). These then transform into <b>tachyzooites</b>, which can infect the 
placenta and the fetus, where prenatal abortion or at least severe developmental 
abnormalities can occur.  It is for this reason that <i>Toxoplasma</i> screening
of pregnant females is a high priority in medical diagnostics and prevention of 

<h2>Tachyzoites</h2>
<p>
Also called <b>trophozoite</b>, which is proliferative form, and 
<b>endozoite</b>, the feeding form. This form occurs in intermediate hosts.
<p>
This form is the most extensively studied of all forms of <i>T. gondii</i>.
Cells are crescent-shaped, about 2 &times; 7 &micro;m, with a slightly pointed
anterior end (<q>anterior</q> means the direction of motility).  Subcellular
components include visible by electron microscopy include:
<ul>
<li>Unique cytoskeleton:
 <ul>
 <li><b>subpellicular microtubules</b>:  two polar rings encircling top of 
resting conoid; outer ring composed of dense matter covering anterior
rim of inner membrane complex (IMC); inner ring anchors 22 subpellicular
microtubules extending underneath IMC for two-thirds of the body length;
the microtubules are 22 nm diameter hollow tubes making up 13 protofilaments
of tubulin
 <li><b>conoid</b>:  hollow, truncated cone composed of fiber wound into spiral
(like compressed spring), 400 nm dia at base, and 250 nm high.  Composed of
tubulin, but consisting of asymmetrical filaments of about 9 protofilaments
not at all like typical microtubules;
 </ul>
<li>Secretory organelles:
 <ul>
 <li><b>rhoptries</b>:  a group of club-shaped organelles extending from conoid
to nucleus, with a long narrow neck up to 2.5 &micro;m and sac-like body
about 0.25 &times; 1 &micro;m in posterior.  Electron-dense in the long
part but not so much in the sac.
 <li><b>micronemes</b>:  small rod-shaped (250 &times; 50 nm) located in
apical area behind conoid and homogenously electron-dense.
 <li><b>dense granules</b>:  found throughout cell but mostly in posterior,
these are spherical (300 nm dia.) with electron-dense contents
 </ul>
<li>Endosymbiontic-derived organelles
 <ul>
 <li><b>mitochondrion</b>:  A single branched and elongated mitochondrion
is observed, with typical apicocomplexan structure and bulbous cristae.
 <li><b>apicoplast</b>: anterior to Golgi, it is layered with multiple
membranes, it is a plastid-like structure; uniform in shape with 500 nm
diameter during infectious stage, it contains granular and filamentous 
content with observable ribosomes.  It has 4 membranes and is theorized
to be derived secondary phagocytosis of alga by an endosymbiont.
 </ul>
<li>universal eukaryotic components
 <ul>
 <li><b>nucleus</b>: takes a central or basal (posterior) location which
depends on stage of infection/invasion; features a centered nucleolus
and small clumps of heterochromatin in nucleoplasm; nuclear envelope has
multiple pores, and except there it contacts Golgi on its flattened side,
it is studded with ribosomes on outer membrane;  the nuclear envelope is
contiguous with rough ER that is in cytoplasm; on upper surface are layer
of clear 70 nm vesicles that appear to bud from nuclear envelope and these
are topped (enclosed?) by 3-4 Golgi cisternae
 <li>endoplasmic reticulum
 <li><b>Golgi apparatus</b>:  located next to the nucleus where the latter loses
its spherical shape and is somewhat flattened
 </ul>
<li><b>acidocalcisomes</b>:  ~200 nm dia vesicles containing one or more
electron-dense droplets or crystals against a clear background; found near
nucleus or posterior; the dark contents are thought to be calcium bound to
pyrophosphate and polyphosphates.
<li><b>pellicle</b>: a membrane closure for the whole organism, this consists
of outer unit membrane (plasmalemma), and inner layer of two closely formed
unit membranes which are about 15 nm from the plasmalemma.  The IMC derives
from ER-Golgi vesicles which flatten and then fuse to form a plate.  At the
anterior, the inner layer has circular apertures through which conoid protrues;
apertures also are found at posterior end.  Freeze-fracture EM reveals IMC
has an apical plate (a single truncated cone, about 1 &micro;m high)
<li><b>micropore</b>:  in apical half of cell just anterior to nucleus, it
consists of a circular invagination of plasmalemma through break in IMC,
with 115 nm dia.  the plasmalemma infolds to form electron-dense collar
around invagination; numerous during endopolygeny and gametogony; probably
functions as cytostome; parts of it bud off to form vesicles intracellularly
and may be like lysosomes (analogously the malarial parasite uses micropore
to ingest erythrocyte hemoglobin).
<li><b>polysaccharide granules</b>:  ovoid structures (major: 250 nm, minor: 180 
nm) found in apical and basal cytoplasm with variable electron density;
filled with starch that is more plant-like (amylopectin); much more numerous
in bradyzoites and sporozoites than tachyzoites and merozoites

</ul>
<p>
Two apical rings at apical tip are on cytoplasmic side of membrane.  Composed
of electron-dense material.  The upper one has a 160 nm and posterior one
is 200 nm diameter.
<p>
A pair of adjacent intraconoidal microtubules extends for &lt; 1 &micro;m into 
apical cytoplasm and ends next to apical vesicle of 40 nm, adhering to plasma 
membrane on which 6 longitudinal rows of rectangular plates attach; triangular 
plates form end of rows at posterior end.  These rows extend straight or twist 
helically. On both sides of protoplasmic face of IMC are lines of 
<b>intramembranous particles</b> (IMPs) with 22 lines of higher density (the 
subpellicular microtubules).  IMPs have 32 nm periodicity, spaced 30 nm apart. 
IMP organization in apical plate different than other plates.

<p>
Tachyzoites divide by <b>endodyogeny</b>, whose ultrastructal progression is 
described. Its ultrastructure was described in 1954.  Tachyzoites are destroyed 
by gastric juice (pepsin, HCl).  

<h2>Bradyzoites</h2>
<p>
Also called <b>cystozoites</b> and proposed calling is <b>tissue cysts</b>. This 
form developes when encysted in tissues of intermediate hosts.
<p>
Its ultrastructural features compare to tachyzoites as follows:
<ul>
<li>its nucleus is more basally located
<li>it has more numerous micronemes compared to just the few that tachyzoites
have
<li>the rhoptries number is about the same (5-10) compared to 5-12 for
tachyzoites
<li>its appearance is more <q>solid</q> compared to being <q>labyrinthine</q>
for tachyzoites
<li>it is numerous in dense granules, same as tachyzoites
<li>it has more numerous polysaccharide granules, unlike the few in tachyzoites
</ul>
<p>
These exist within a wall that stains densely with silver, and have a terminal 
nucleus.  The bradyzoites stain positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and 
enclosed in a thin wall that is PAS-negative.
<p>
The cyst wall is sensitive to pepsin and trypsin, however the contained cystic 
organisms resist gastric juice (pepsin + HCl).
<p>
When tachyzoites are given to mice, tissue cysts form within 3 days.  Cats will 
shed oocysts within 3-10 days if they ingest tissue cysts or bradyzoites, but 
will not do so until 18 days or more if they ingest tachyzoites or oocysts. This 
is likely because of the developmental phase between tachyzoite and bradyzoite 
to form occysts.

<h2>Merozoites</h2>
<p>
Like tachyzoites, this is a proliferative form, but within the definitive host.
<p>
Its ultrastructural features compare to tachyzoites as follows:
<ul>
<li>Nucleus is centered just as in tachyzoite, and it has few micronemes
<li>The rhoptries count is far less, 3-5, compared to tachyzoite
<li>Its appearance is more <q>solid</q> compared to <q>labyrinthine</q>
for tachyzoites
<li>it has very few dense granules compared to zoites in intermediate hosts
<li>polysaccharide granules are absent
</ul>


<h2>Sporozoites</h2>
<p>
Like bradyzoites, this is a somewhat dormant form created for transmission to 
new members of definitive hosts.
<p>
Its ultrastructural features compare to other zoites as follows:
<ul>
<li>Nucleus is basal as in counterpart bradyzoites, and it has numerous
 micronemes as in bradyzoites, compared to few in tachyzoite
<li>Rhoptries count is same for the zoites in intermediate host
<li>Its appearance is more <q>solid</q> compared to <q>labyrinthine</q>
for tachyzoites
<li>it has numerous dense granules and polysaccharide granules, just
as in bradyzoite
</ul>



<h2>Sexual and Asexual Stages</h2>
<p>
Frenkel and co-workers in the early 1970s described five asexual stages that
exist in intestinal epithelium (enteroepithelial asexual stages).  These are
designated A through E.  These have also been called <b>schizonts</b>.  
These are distinguished from bradyzoites and tachyzoites.  These transformations
are between tachyzoite and bradyzoite formation, occurring within 3 days
(about 66 hours) after ingestion of tissue cysts.

<p>
<b>Schizonts</b> are enteroepithelial asexual stages existing briefly (see
next section).
<p>
<b>Gamonts</b> are sexual stages.  <b>Sporozoites</b> are effectively 
sporulating forms of oocysts.

<h2>Endodyogeny</h2>
<p>
This process occurs in tachyzoites and bradyzoites in the intermediate
host.  Different processes are described in merozoites (in definitive
host) and in oocysts (sporozoite formation).
<p>
Much of what is known about <b>mitosis</b> in apicomplexans is from other 
members of the group, and not <i>T. gondii</i>.  Some unique features include 
retention of intact nuclear membrane.  Coccidian centrioles of 150 nm diameter 
are composed of 9 short (100 nm) tubules centered on central tubule.  The 
centrosomes, or spindle pole bodies,  consist of parallel-oriented centrioles, 
and are found associated with centrocones or mitotic spindle poles on apical 
side of nucleus (usually).
<p>
At earliest stage a transnuclear funnel forms with fibrous material, developing 
into invagination of nuclear envelope opened on both sides towards cytoplasm. 
The mitotic spindle likely polymerizes in the funnel.  The funnel opens in the 
nucleoplasm in its middle part. The poles give rise to centrocones: these are 
subspherical invaginations of nuclear envelope at start, opened toward 
centrosomes and through which spindle microtubules extend.  This intranuclear 
spindle is short, and transient (and thus is not able to be well characterized): 
kinetochores probably separate immediately after funnel opening and assemble on 
nucleoplasm side of centrocones.
<p>
Soon after centrosome separation and centrocone formation, adjacent to each
centrosome is a developing structure which are apical complex for each
daughter tachyzoite.  A bent fiber originating between the pair of 
centrioles and joining an area where conoid is being assembled appears.
An IMC and subpellicular microtubules form around the conoid, then grow
posteriorly in coordinated fashion.  There is no association with the plasmalemma
but appears to occur entirely within cytoplasm (classical schizogony as
happens in most Apicomplexa).  The Golgi also divides in association with
with the spindle formation, each new body on the upper nuclear envelope
near each centrocone.  Other organelles (rhoptries) also proliferate and
assemble.
<p>
This mitotic division occurs with the PV, and daughters remain connected
at the posterior end.  Additional rounds of division occur in which connected
daughter assume a rosette pattern.

            BIOCHEMISTRY
===================================================== -->
<h1>Biochemistry &amp; Metabolism</h1>
<p>
In belonging to Apicomplexa, <i>T. gondii</i> is an obligate intracellular 
parasite of eukaryotic cells.  Because the biochemical pathways of host cells
are supportive, it can be difficult to understand what pathways exist inside
the parasite and which exist outside of it.  With completion of a genomic 
sequence database, it is possible to clone individual enzymes and characterize 
them.

<h2>Carbohydrate Metabolism</h2>
<p>
The presence of amylopectin as a storage polysaccharide reveals the closeness or 
even origin of <i>T. gondii</i> from photosynthetic microorganism (blue algae, 
algae).  The apicoplastid organelle serves as additional evidence.  Plants will 
storage polysaccharide as branched amylopectin outside the chloroplast, while 
inside that organelle there is amylose.  Encysted bradyzoite and sporozoites of 
<i>T. gondii</i>, <i>Eimeria</i>, and <i>Cryptosporidium</i> accumulate 
amylopectin, a linear glucose polymer not found in <i>Plasmodium</i> and 
<i>Babesia</i>.  The loss of the ability to produce amylopectin in 
<i>Eimeria</i> sporozoites is attributed to its inability to infect mice. 
Bradyzoites of <i>T gondii</i> accumulate large amylopectin granules and numerous 
micronemes, while tachyzoites have no amylopectin and fewer micronemes.  It is
likely the amylopectin is consumed when encysted and dormant bradyzoites develop
into tachyzoites.
<p>
Bioinformatics analysis shows several candidate genes having enzyme function likely
to be involved in amylopectin metabolism.  Synthetic enzymes include 
<ul>
<li>amylopectin synthase (utilizes UDP-glucose)
<li>branching enzymes
<li>UPD-Glc pyrophosphorylase
<li>isoamylase
<li>indirect debranching enzyme
<li>&alpha;1&rarr;4-glucotransferase
<li>glycogenin
</ul>
<p>
Enzymes involved in catabolic degradation include
<ul>
<li>&alpha;-amylase
<li>dikinase or R1 protein
<li>phosphorylase
<li>&alpha;-glucosidase
</ul>
<p>
<img src="../images/toxoplasma/Tgondii-CHO-storage-metabolism.gif" 
  alt="carbohydrate storage metabolism in T gondii">
This complement is similar to that in unicellular green alge <i>Chlamydomonas 
reinhardtii</i>.  These genes are present in single copies, which defies a tenet 
that multiple copies are required for redundancy for crystalline starch 
synthesis.  A comparative genomic analysis against red alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon 
merolae</i>, green alga <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, and 
bacterium <i>E. coli</i> showed that <i>T gondii</i> and <i>C merolae</i> have 
UDP-Glc-utilizing glycogen/starch synthase-like sequences and glycogenins, and 
these are specific for a eukaryotic UDP-Glc pathway.  UDP-Glc-dependent glycogen 
synthase is present in extracts, while <i>Chlamydomonas</i> lysates have ADP-Glc 
dependent activity.  There is also an indirect debranching enzyme which has 
bifunctional activity:  &alpha;-1,4-glucotransferase and amylo-1,6-glucosidase,
also present in fungi and animals.
<p>
Thus a combination of plant- and animal-like metabolisms may be involved in 
amylopectin biosynthesis.  The apicoplast could signify the presence of secondary
endosymbiosis via engulfment of unicellular alga.  Amylopectin synthase shows
strongest similarity to red alga starch synthesis systems.  Presence of water
dikinase (called R1 protein), &alpha;1&rarr;4-glucotransferase (D-enzyme) and 
isoamylase are plant/green algae enzyme functions.
<h3>Stage-Specific Expression in Glucose Metabolism</h3>
<p>
Using RT-PCR, transcripts of R1, &alpha;-glucan phosphorylase, &alpha;-glucosidase,
and &alpha;-amylase, that is all catabolic enzymes, are found at hlgh levels in
bradyzoites.  Biosynthesis components, namely glycogenin, amylopectin synthase,
branching enzyme, are found at high levels in tachyzoites but low levels in 
bradyzoites.  This suggests that tachyzoite&rarr;bradyzoite differentiation 
requires amylopectin synthesis but mobilization of amylopectin is done during
bradyzoite&rarr;tachyzoite conversion.  Additional experiments using antibodies
to specific proteins are required to establish that the transcripts are not 
merely dormant.
<p>
<b>Glycolysis</b>.  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) exists in two forms:  LDH1
is expressed in tachyzoites while LDH2 is seen in bradyzoites.  LDH1 mRNA
is present in both bradyzoites and tachyzoites, while LDH2 is only found in
bradyzoites.  Both isoforms have different pI values, which allows them
to be separated electrophoretically.  LDH1 and LDH2 also contains a 5-amino acid 
insertion in the substrate sepcificy loop of the enzyme, a feature it
shares with <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (pLDH).  The LDH2 and pLDH sequence
are identical (KSDKE; LDH1 sequence is KPDSE).   Various substrate testing
shows that <i>T gondii</i> LDH1 and LDH2 have broader substratte specificity:
3-phenylpyrvate is even better than pyruvate in competitive assays.  3-acetylpyridine
adenine dincleotide (APAD) is a conveniennt NAD substitute.  Gossypol and 
its derivatives are effective at inhibiting LDH1, LDH2 and pLDH (LDH2 has slightly
higher sensitivity).  This is often exploited in inhibiting tachyzoite growth
in fibroblast cultures.  Knockdown studies show that tachyzoites and bradyzoites
have variable growth rates, and tissue cysts could not form in infected mice.
LDH is critical to cell cycle and differentiation.
<p>
LDH1 apoenzyme and LDH1-NAD<sup>+</sup> and LDH1-APAD with either the sulfate
or oxalate (which is inhibitory) have been (co-)crystallized and x-ray
structures obtained.  Sequences in the active site differ between LDH1
and human musscle- and heart-specific LDH isoforms, in which LDH1 has more
hydrophobic residues.  This difference could be used to develop anti-Toxoplasma
drugs that target its LDH without poisoning human enzymes, for individuals
with chronic infections due to being immunocompromised.
<p>
The glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Glc6P-I) which catalyzes Glc6P to Frc6P
is stage-specific also.  RT-PCR shows that a Glc6P-I transcript is present in
bradyzoites whereas only a small amount is present in tachyzoites.  Western
analysis with anti-Glc6P-I pAb shows enzyme only in encysted bradyzoites.
Other isoforms of enzyme have been revealed in <i>T gondii</i> searches, but 
function is not established.
<p>
ENO (2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolase) converts 2-phosphoglycerate to 
phosphoenolpyruvate.  <sup>&minus;</sup>OOC-C(OPO<sub>3</sub>H)-CH<sub>2</sub>OH 
&rarr; <sup>&minus;</sup>OOC-C(OPO<sub>3</sub>H)=CH<sub>2</sub>.  Two 
stage-specific isozymes are also described.  ENO1 and ENO2 are found on the same 
chromosome, separated by 1.6 kbp.  Amino acid identity is about 73%.  Comparison
of parasite to mammalian ENO sequences shows 5-amino acid insertion in ENO1
(EWGWS) and ENO2 (EWGYC, also found in <i>Plasmodium</i> enolase).  A dipeptide
insertion (EK for ENO1 and DK for ENO2) is also found.  The human and ENO1
and ENO2 3D structures show perfect alignments except for the insertions mentioned.
Alteration of the structure to delete EK in ENO1 shows that there is no effect
on <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>, while removing both loops increases <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>
13-fold.  Deleting EWGWC pentapeptide increases <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> by 5-fold.
Recombinant ENO2 has a 3-fold higher <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> compared to ENO1.
Temperature studies reveal that ENO2 (tachyzoite-specific) is more thermolabile.
<p>
Interestingly many carbohydrate metabolic enzymes provide other functions.
LDH crystallizes to affect vision in ducks and crocodiles; &alpha;-enolase
crystallizes in lamprey and turtles; and arginosuccinate lyase does for birds
and reptiles.  GAPDH interacts with rRNA, tRNA, hammerhead ribozymes, and the
3'-UTR of mRNA species: it might regulate helicase; tRNA and mRNA export; 
RNA unfolding; translation regulation; viral gene expression regulation; and
mRNA stability.  The N-terminal GAPDH domain mediates GTPase Rab2-dependent
recruitment to membranes in Plasmodium.
<p>
Interaction proteomics studies shows that aldolase binds to micronemal 
thrombospondin-anonymous related proteins (TRAP family) and the acto-myosin 
motor in parasite gliding and host-cell invasion.  Parafusin-related protein 1 
(PRP1) is ortholog of phosphoglucomutase that associates with micronemes.
<p>
Immunocytochemistry for ENO1 and ENO2 show localization in the nucleus,
both for bradyzoites and tachyzoites, but only actively dividing zoites.
These signals appear earlier than surface markers like P36 or SAG4 in bradyzoites.
Tachyzoite-specific ENO2 is expressed only in dividing sexual forms of <i>T gondii</i>
taken  from infected cat tissues.  Nuclear localization of ENO in human cells
was reported with association to c-Myc promoter and it is a transcription repressor
in cancer cells.  Why does enolase have a DNA-binding domain?

<h2>Glycolipid Anchors</h2>
<p>
Many membrane-bound proteins bound to the membrane via an inositol-containing
glcyophospholipid (GPI).  Many well known surface proteins attach via GPI anchors,
and this is more common in <i>Toxoplasma</i> and protozoa than higher eukaryotes.
In understanding the genesis of these GPI-bound proteins, metabolic labeling
(with [<sup>3</sup>H]Glc-NH<sub>2</sub>, Man, Gal, palmitic and myristic acids,
and inositol) and study of phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC) have
been done.  In addition, an anti-crossreacting determinant (CRD) produced
against trypanosomes and with soluble surface proteins of live parasites reveals
that proteins are connected by GPI anchors.
<p>
<img src="../images/glycophospholipid.gif"
  alt="structure of a core glycophospholipid">
The evolutionarily conserved GPI core is 
ethanolamine-PO<sub>4</sub>-6Man(&alpha;1&rarr;2)Man(&alpha;1&rarr;6)Man(&alpha;1&rarr;4)GlcNAc(&alpha;1&rarr;6)-inositol-1-phospholipid
for SAG1 (P30) and P23.  Four major glycolipids and intermediate forms have been
characterized.  It has been shown that the GPIs (free, not bound to protein) 
are immunogenic themselves, as a 4.6 kDa antigen was found to be a free GPI
reacting to early IgM.  GPI structures have been determind by metabolic labeling
and enzymatic digestion, chromatography, NMR, and FAB-MS.
Function of GPI are not fully known, although free and protein-bound may be 
involved in infection.  They elicit a strong inflammatory response, and maybe
an endotoxin.

<h2>Nucleotide Biosynthesis</h2>
<p>
Nucleotide biosynthetic pathways are fairly well detailed since they are potential
targets for drug therapy.  <i>T gondii</i> has both <i>de novo</i> and salvage
pathways for pyrimidines (thymidine, cytosine).  The de novo pathways are more
important since they are vital for growth, not just survival.  Mutants auxotrophic
for pyrimidines involving knockouts of the carbamly phosphate synthetase II gene
(CPSII) are not virulent in mice.  Pyrimidine starvation normally causes 
tachyzoite&rarr;bradyzoite induction.  
<p>
Six enzymes characterize the pyrimidine de novo biosynthetic pathway.  In mammals
the first three enzymes are a multifunctional protein complex (CAD) having
three enzymatic functions:  CPSII, aspartate carbamyltransferase (ATCcase),
and dihydroorotase (DHOase).  This complex shows allosterism, being activated
by the presence of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and being inhibited
by UTP (a product).  A large 150 residue C-terminal domain is responsible for this
regulation.
<p>
CPSII in <i>T gondii</i> is not associated with other activities and is a single 
540 kDa cytosolic protein.  The gene has 36 introns and its 37 exons code for a 
1687 residue polypeptide with apparent mass of 186 kDa, indicating that the 
native configuration is probably a homotrimer. Bacteria and plants similarly 
have enzymes with CPS activities with no associated downstream activities.
CPSII is inhibited by UTP in <i>T gondii</i> but is not activated by PRPP.
While there is a large C-terminal domain, it does not appear to function with
the regulation in mammals.
<p>
A bifunctional Gln-dependent CPSII is also present.  This incorporates a 
Gln amidotransferase in the N-terminus fused with CPS in the C-terminus.
This is present in many protozoal parasites.  In bacteria and plants, these
activities are not fused.
<p>
ATCase activity in <i>T gondii</i> is in a 140 kDa monofunctional cytosolic
enzyme.  The cloned orf of ATCase cDNA from <i>T gondii</i> encodes a 423
amino acid polypeptide predicted to be 46.8 kDa.  Recombinant possessing this
activity has a molecular mass of 144 kDa, and so this too is likely a homotrimer.
Plant ATCase is inhibited by UMP, and <i>E coli</i> ATCase by CTP and UTP.
<i>T gondii</i> ATCase does not seem to be inhibited by any product.
<p>
The DOHase activity in the parasite seems to be found in a monofunctionaly
cytosolic enzyme of 70 kDa, also with no regulation.  The gene has not been 
characterized.
<p>
The 4th enzyme is dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.  These come in two families.
Family-1 enzymes in some bacteria and lower eukaryotes are cytosolic while
family-2 are membrane-associated with the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
Given that DHO-DHase is recovered in particulate fractions of tachyzoite 
extract and inhibited by respiratory chain inhbitors, and the cloned cDNA
(with predicated polypeptide mass of 65 kDa) is similar to family-2 enzymes,
then DHO-DHase is likely family-2.
<p>
Enzyme #5 is orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase) and the last is
orotidylate decarboxylase (ODCase).  These are cytosolic and co-sediment in
sucrose gradients at about 70 kDa.  In higher eukaryotes the activities are
fused in a polypeptide.  In <i>Plasmodium</i> they are part of heterodimer
with 33 kDa OPRTase and 38 kDa ODCase, but in <i>T gondii</i> it is not clear.
<p>
For the pyrimidine salvage pathway, there are five enzyme activities:
<ul>
<li>cytidine deaminase
<li>deoxycytidine deaminase
<li>uridine phosphorylase
<li>deoxyuridine phosphorylase
<li>uracil phosphoribosyltransfer (UPRTase)
</ul>
<p>
All salvage comes through uracil and brought to nucleotide level by UPRTase.
UPRTase deficiency does not affect growth, so the pathway is not vital for
tachyzoites.
<p>
However the enzyme might be a therapeutic target nonetheless.  The enzyme
recognizes only uracil.  It is a 27 kDa homodimer when no substrate or GTP
activator is present, but forms an active tetramer stabilized by GTP binding.
<p>
<b>Purine salvage pathway</b>. <i>T gondii</i> and other parasitic protozoa and
intracellular pathogens cannot synthesize purines <i>de novo</i>. Instead there 
is a purine salvage pathway. Formation of hypoxanthine (H), xanthine (X), or 
guanine (G) can lead to their phosphorylation by the broadly specific 
phosphoribosyltransferase HXGPRTase. Adenosine is phosphorylated by an 
adenosine kinase (AK). Other enzymes involved in the salvage pathway include adenine 
deaminase (adenine &rarr; hypoxanthine), guanosine phosphorylase (guanosine 
&rarr; guanine), adenosine deaminase (adenosine &rarr; inosine, note this is 
not adenine deaminase), and inosine phosphorylase (inosine &rarr; hypoxanthine).
AK and HXGPRT have had crystal structure done and neither enzyme is required
for <i>T. gondii</i> to survive, although a double knockout mutant of both
is lethal, indicating it can depend on one of the two.  Other parasites actually
have only one of the two enzymes, not both.  AK is a 39.3 kDa monomer with
&lt; 30% identity with AKs in other organisms.  HXGPRT is present as two
isoenzymes which result from differentially spliced mRNA products.  Isozyme I
is a homotetramer with 26.4 kDa subunits, and isozyme II has an extra 49 aa
inserted 7 aa downstream from N-terminus.  Isozyme I is cytosolic, while
isozyme II localizes to tachyzoite inner membrane complex as the 49 aa sequence
has a membrane targeting signal.  When coexpressed in <i>E coli</i> as recombinants
or <i>in vivo</i> in tachyzoites, they will form heterotetramers, and at least
two isozyme II subunits in a multimer are needed for membrane association.
Strangely there are no differences in kinetic properties, so there must be other
reasons.
<p>
<b>Nucleoside Triphosphate Hydrolase (NTPase)</b>.  This enzyme was reported
nearly 30 years ago and has substrate specificity and divalent cation requirements
similar to E(ecto)-type ATPases.   The latter NTPases are ubiquitous in eukaryotic
cells and also in parasitic protozoans.  The NTPase in <i>T gondii</i> is
abundantly present in the tachyzoite, as much as 2-8% of the total tachyzoite
protein, whereas the E-ATPases are normally very low abundance, so low that
a purification would not be visible on gels.  The enzyme is dormant under
ordinary conditions: dithiols are essential to activate it, whereas no such
mechanism has been identified for E-ATPases.  When activated however, the ATP
hydrolysis activity it 5000 times that of any other cell.  The enzyme may not
function within the tachyzoite at all, in fact:  the tachyzoite secretes the
enzyme from the dense granule (the secretory organelle of the tachyzoite) which
goes into the intravacuolar space of the host cell and forms a membrane-associated
insoluble enzyme.  E-type ATPases are not so secreted (including in protozoan
parasites).
<p>
Type I strains of <i>T gondii</i> are very virulent in mouse host and they possess
two NTPase isoforms. NTPase-I prefers NTPs while NTPase-II works on both NTPs
and NDPs.  Both isoforms differ by 16 out of 628 amino acids based on cDNA
sequence analysis.  With native masses of 260 kDa, this suggests a homotetrameric
form with 67 kDa subunit.  The cDNA sequence suggests a 25-aa hydrophobic
secretion signal missing in the mature form, in which the signal places the
product in the dense granule;  other proteins in the dense granule have
similar sequences.  The isozyme NTPase-II form hydrolyzes both NTP and NDP at
about the same rate, similar to apyrase (EC 3.6.1.5) enzymes in other systems
(potato, <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>).
<p>
What role does this NTPase play? As protozoans are purine auxotrophs, these
NTPases are likely involved in salvage of purines from host cell. It hydrolyzes 
ATP to ADP and to AMP. But purines are salvaged through AK or HXGPRTase, which 
do not use AMP or ADP. Tachyzoites have no ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase that 
would cause AMP &rarr; adenosine for the AK activity.  So it is doubtful that
purine salvage is the reason.  When exposed to DTT, non-motile intravacuolar
tachyzoites show egress within 60 s if there is concurrent Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux,
which appears to happen when the generally oxidized inactive form is transformed
in this way.  What is the physiological means since DTT is not normally found
in nature?  As thioredoxin is the most abundant dithiol, the reduced form
was found to activate the enzyme, while the oxidized form deactivated it.
Glutathione had no effect, although glutathione promoters activate Ca<sup>2+</sup>
flux and they decrease ATP in tachyzoite-infected fibroblasts.  Glutaredoxin
is a small protein with active center disulfide; and it is this prortein in
the vacuole (where thioredoxin cannot enter) which may be reduced by glutathione
and which activates the NTPase.   Tachyzoites may also release glutaredoxin
in order to control their own egress.  Attempts to disrupt the gene have not
been successful and use of antisense depletion indicate the NTPase is required
for parasite replication.

<h1>Genomics</h1>
<p>
Pfefferkorn in the 1970s advanced studies on gene manipulation and parasite
culture.

<p>
The EUPathDB keeps a <a href="http://www.toxodb.org/">database and information 
site</a> as a genomics resource, aggregating information from other databases
and news sources.

<p>
Here is the NCBI genome page on <i>Toxoplasma</i>:  <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=genomeprj&amp;cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=9535">Genome 
project</a> on <i>T. gondii</i>.

<h2>Transient Transfection of <i>Toxoplasma</i></h2>
<p>
The typical technique of introducing genetic material is by electroporation
of tachyzoites.  The eletroporation buffer is constructed to resemble cytosol
(cytomix).  The RH strain (type I, virulent) and cyst-forming straisn (ME49
and Prugniaud, type II) have been used, with slight modifications.  Cyst-formers
are more difficult.
<p>
Transfection efficiency is monitored with reporters:  chloramphenicol acetyl
transferase (CAT), &beta;-galactosidase, &beta;-lactamase, alkaline phosphatase,
firefly luciferase (LUC).  Note that &beta;-lactamase and ALP have no activity
in the parasite (inhibitors) and instead might be used to study secretory
pathways.  LacZ is detected with CPRG (yellow &rarr; red color; check &lambda; =
570 nm) and useful in multiwell screenings.  Reporter gene expression depends
on 5' and 3' sequences in <i>T. gondii</i>.  Different vectors exist with 
difference in promoter strength and specificity of parasite stage.
<p>
Alterations of expression levels of <i>Toxoplasma</i> proteins can reveal 
mechanisms and aspects of biology:  overexpression of microneme proteins result in accumulation in early 
compartment of secretory pathway, or leakiness of parasitophorous vacuole.
<p>
<b>Constitutive expression</b>. For inserts to be turned on continuously,
vectors derived from &alpha;-tubulin (TUB1), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR),
rhoptry protein 1 (ROP1), microneme protein 2 (MIC2), many dense-granule proteins
(GRAx), and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT).  GRAx and
MIC2 are strong promoters, TUB1 and ROP1 are intermediate, and DHFR-TS is weak.
<p>
Stage-specific promoters are all upstream (5'), with no elements related to stage
in the 3'-UTR.  Vectors derived from SAG1 (surface antigen 1), ENO (enolase),
and lactate dehydrogenase 1 (LDH1) are specific for tachyzoites.  Bradyzoite
vectors have bradyzoite antigen 1 (BAG1), enolase 2 (ENO2), and SAG4.
<p>
The 3'-UTR of the mRNA contains important elements for transcription, which
drops to &lt; 10% of normal if not present.  Kozak sequences are present
at the start codon for translation initiation:  <i>gNCAAa</i>ATGg is similar
but not identical to Kozak sequence.  Transgenes like GFP require extra 
amino acids at the N-terminal to obtain expression (N-end rule):  amino acids
such as A, D, and E after initiator Met confer high expression level.

<h2>Stable Transformation of Positive &amp; Negative Selectable Markers</h2>
<p>
Because <i>T gondii</i> is obligate intracellular parasite, the ability to 
select transformants is more limited than for other organisms, since drugs
must not be toxic to the host cell as well.
Chloramphenicol is toxic to <i>T gondii</i>, so CAT transfection can be used
both as a reporter and to select for successfully transformed targets, although
three cycles of host cell lysis (about 7 days) are necessary to observe the
effect.  Then selection in multiwell plates for a period of 5 days can be used.
<p>
<b>Phleomycin</b> works by breaking DNA and the <i>ble</i> gene from 
<i>Streptoalloteichus</i> or Tn5 can be used for selection as well.  But the 
selection is applied to extracellular parasites.
<p>
Selection by Trp auxotrophy can be obtained by complementation with indole
added to medium and presence of bacterial Trp synthase (<i>trpB</i>). 
<p>
Uracil phosphosribosyl transferase (<i>UPRT</i>) is sensitive to a prodrug
5'-fluo-2'-deoxyuridine (FUDR).  Hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl
transferase (<i>HXGPRT</i>) also converts 6-thioxanthine (6-Tx) into an inhibitor
of GMP synthase.  When HXGPRT is absent, the drug mycophenolic acid can kill
parasites.
<p>
The table below shows various protocols used for transformation.

Higher frequency transformants are found exploiting PYR resistance vectors made
from the bifunctional DHFR-TS system.  The expression vector pDHRF*-TSc3 (no. 2584)
was designed with <i>dhfr-ts</i> gene and selection enables integration into
parasite chromosomes.  A restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) has also
been described.  Bacteriophage P1 <i>cre lox</i>P has also been adapted and enables
in vivo excision of any sequence flanked by <i>lox</i>P.

<h2>Homologous Recombination &amp; Random Integration</h2> 

<div class="figure"> 
  <img src="../images/insertional-tagging.gif" style="width:100%;" 
    alt="insertional tagging with DHFR">
  (A) Schematic representation of insertional genomic tagging using a DHFR-TS 
  plasmid (based on Roos et al., 1997). Plasmid DNA is indicated at top, genomic 
  insertions below. For insertional mutagenesis, expression of the DHFR-TS 
  pyrimethamine resistance gene is driven by its own promoter; the insertion 
  therefore is not necessarily within the open reading frame but might also act 
  through inactivating a regulatory region (e.g. promoter). In the case of 
  promoter trapping, DHFR-TS does not carry its own promoter, and expression of 
  the resistance gene depends on insertion close to an active promoter, or 
  in-frame fusion into an expressed gene. Tandem insertions can complicate the 
  identification of the tagged locus by plasmid rescue (using restriction enzyme 
  X) and/or inverse PCR (using restriction enzyme X or Y). However, 
  simultaneously applying restriction enzyme Z cuts the tandem into two 
  fragments incompatible with plasmid rescue or inverse PCR (Roos et al., 1997; 
  Sullivan et al., 1999).
</div>

<p>
Integration into chromosome of protozoans has generally been achieved by
use of short segments of homology, but <i>T gondii</i> does not work so well.
Vectors without long stretches of genomic DNA integrate into chromosome at
random in <i>T gondii</i>.  This has been used to determine which genes whose
mutation cause lethality in the tachyzoite haploid genome, and thus identifying
genes for suitable functional selection or screening.

    alt="double homologous recombination approach to directed gene change">
  (B) Schematic representation of gene knock-out through double homologous 
  recombination. The homologous regions destined for homologous recombination 
  are represented by white boxes. Restriction enzymes A and B are used to 
  generate fully homologous ends. In this case YFP is used as a negative 
  selectable marker to enrich for homologous recombination (YFP is lost and 
  parasites are FACS-negative).

</div>
<p>
For directed insertion by homologous recombination, several kilobases of 
homologous sequence at the targeted locus must be used, and even then the 
efficiency is low.  Use of a gene targeting system using <i>HXGPRT</i> as 
positive/negative selectable marker allows generation of knockout or allelic 
replacement.  Positive selection produces a duplication of the target gene at 
its locus by single-site homologous recombination; then negative selection 
resolves the pseudo-diploid to produce revertant (wild-type) or allelic 
replacement (gene knockout).  Also a 2nd negatively selectable marker can be 
inserted into knockout construct outside of homologous flanking regions to 
eliminate transformants produced by random integration or single homologous 
recombination.  HSV thymidine kinase (TK) is sensitive to ganciclovir and 
bacterial cytosine deaminase (CD) to 5-fluorocytosine: fused to CAT or DHFR-TS 
creates positive/negative selection.  Counterselection using FACS with GFP/YFP 
also works.

  functionally inactivated by the lack of a promoter.

<p>
Methods to achieve chromosome integration by homologous recombination by
insertional tagging and single and double homologous recombination are presented
in the figures <q>(A),</q> <q>(B),</q> and <q>(C)</q> in this section.

<h2>Studying <i>Toxoplasma</i> Gene Function Using Transgenes</h2>
<p>
Specific antibodies produced against purified subcellular fractions or 
homogenously pure proteins can be used to look at expression using light and
electron microscopy, but requires first purification of components and then
generation of antibodies, both time-consuming and technically not feasible.
Transfection experiments with genes fused to common tags for which antibodies
exist or by use of an autofluorescent protein can also be helpful.  GFP and
its variants are small enough not to alter biological function in most cases,
or at least can be used as transcriptional reporters.  Variants allow for
multi-color expression and multi-transformants:  CFP is a cyan variant, and
YFP is a yellow variant;  in addition tandem repeats of YFP produce a very
bright fluorescence used to track parasites in culture or infected animals.
The red (RFP) and bright red (DsRed) forms are also available.  Some
proteins targeted to organelles and tagged with fluorescent proteins are 
reported, but since GFP and variants can effect maturation, targeting or
function, it is not always successful.
<p>
Smaller epitope tags on the N- or C-terminus or within the gene might be used as 
alternatives.  Those successfully used include cMyc, HA, FLAG, and Ty-1.
<p>
xFP use permits use of a sorter for analysis and purification (usually requiring
two or more rounds of sorting).  Microplate readers can be used to quantitate
and identify transformants.

<h2>Essential Gene Analysis</h2>
<p>
Essential genes in the haploid requires the ability to control gene expression
without causing pleiotropic expression.  Transcriptional control is based on
the <i>E coli</i> tetracyline repressor.  This system inhibits transcription
and is coupled to T7 RNA polymerase as developed for <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>
(Wirtz et al 1997).  Meissner et al (2001) adapted it to other protozoa including
<i>T gondii</i>.  van Poppel et al (2006) fused the tet-repressor to target
proteins.  
<p>
Because of problems with revertants and loss of regulation, a screen was done
to identify a transcriptional activating domain for establishing a Tet
transactivator-based inducible system.  Two artificial transactivators were
found in the screen and are not functional in HeLa.  These transactivators
have short stretches of hydrophobic amino acids and also work in <i>Plasmodium
falciparum</i>.  This system has enabled the study of TgMyoA, TgAMA-1, TgMIC2,
TgACP, and profilin.  Two steps of selection are required:  a stable transformation
of an inducible gene copy, then a knockout of the target gene.  A scheme to generate
inducible knockouts by direct targeting of inducible construct into gene of interest
by knock-in replacing endogenous with tet-inducible promoter might work too;
a single or preferably double homologous recombination method (to avoid reversion
to wild-type) would be necessary.  Using anhydrotetracycline (ATc) to positively
select for complementing knockouts with either wild-type or modified form of gene
can be done.
<p>
Use of anti-sense RNA/oligonucleotides, ribozymes, or dsRNA interference (RNAi)
can modify expression quantitatively (knockdown vs. knockout of genes).

<h2>Insertional Mutagenesis and Promoter Trapping</h2>
<p>
Insertion at random sites as opposed to homologous recombinatin occurs at 
high frequency and simple plasmid constructs can be used, in a way that 
transposons work in other organisms.  Random insertion of DHFR-TS or HXGPRT
elements has identified non-essential genes, and the tagged locus identified
by plasmid rescue or inverse PCR.
<p>
Insertion can also be used to identify promoters or alter them (<q>trapping</q>
promoters and genes).  Stage- and differentiation-specific genes have been 
identifed:  selection is based on culture medium that favors a stage (tachyzoite
vs. bradyzoite).  For identifying transcription factors, a strain with YFP-YFP
marker under control of a Tet-regulated promoter would be randomly inserted:
tagging plasmid would have Tet-repressor gene lacking stop codon and 3'-UTR
and fusion of this with transcription factor would result in transactivation
and green fluorescence.
<p>
Identification of essential genes by insertional mutagenesis cannot be done with
haploids (tachyzoites).  But coupling random insertion with the Tet-inducible
system can be used to identify essential genes.  Also signature-tagged 
mutagenesis:  wild-type are tagged with unique oligonucleotide insertions
and then these are mutagenized either chemically or insertionally followed
by a cloning step.  Mutants are then treated under selective conditons (infection
into animal for example).  <q>Missing</q> mutants are identified by comparing 
tags present in pools before and after selection.
<p>
Conditional mutants have been used to examine biochemical pathways related with
growth. Heat- and cold-senstive strains produced by chemical mutagenesis using
N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) have proved effective:  defects in stage differentiation,
invasion, and egress and cell division and cycle progression have been obtained.
Physical mapping obtained by crossing and by complementation using wild-type
library are the means for identifying the gene.  The crossing approach produces
more problems in <i>T gondii</i> because of limited throughput, and the RH strain
cannot complete the sexual life cycle.  With the complementation approach, the
library should fully represent the genome and recovering the complementing 
sequence can be difficult.  A genetic element to maintain a stable episome
for complementation with rescue by Hirt lyssis and then transformation of bacteria.
Complementation of HXGPRT can be selected with mycophenolic acid.
<p>
However these plasmids can become unstable and revert to wild-type.  

<!-- ==================================================================
     PROTEOMICS
====================================================================== -->

<h1>Proteomics</h1>
<p>
First attempts at proteomic characterization started about <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=cohen%20wastling%202002">a decade 
ago by Wastling and co-workers</a>.  A major problem is the separation of
host cell from the parasite.
<p>
Now that a 10-times covered genomic database for <i>T. gondii</i> is available,
it is possible to search open reading frames using TgTwinScan, TigrScan,
and GlimmerHMM.

<p>
<b>MIC</b>.  Proteins present only in micronemes.
<p>
<b>GRA</b>.  Proteins present only in dense granules.
<p>
<b>ROP</b>.  Proteins present only in the bulbous region of the rhoptries.
<p>
<b>RON</b>.  Proteins present only in the neck region of rhoptries.



<h2>Transmission</h2>
<p>
It was thought at one time that <i>T. gondii</i> had an arthropod vector, but
never shown.  Transmission through host can be achieved congenitally (vertical
transmission) from generation to generation (at least 10 in mice).  At some point
a final generation become seronegative (fully immune).
<p>
Because congenital transmission could not explain widespread infection, it was 
proposed in 1954 that undercooked meat would explain human infection. In 1965 it 
ws found in a French sanatorium that barely cooked beef or horse meat in the 
daily diet resulted in 50% of children being infected. This was 100% infection 
when barely cooked lamb chops were in diet.

<h3>Cats</h3>
<p>
Infection in vegetarians and herbivores could not be explained by carnivorism or 
congenital transmission.  In 1965, cats were fed cysts which were infected by 
the nematode <i>Toxocara cati</i> and their feces collected.  Feces were floated 
in 35% ZnSO<sub>2</sub>  ans stored in tap water for 12 months and could still 
infect mice.  At first, it was believed that <i>T gondii</i> transmits its 
infection through the eggs of the nematode <i>Toxocara</i>, since infection 
could only occur wtih nematode-infected cats.  This was later found to be not 
so, as nematode-free cat feces can still cause toxoplasmosis.  So far, oocysts 
have only been found in the feces of cats, and not in the feces of any other 
species.  
<p>
When attempts have been made to vaccinate cats, toxoplasmosis incidence 
decreases. Toxoplasmosis does not occur in cat (felid)-free areas.


<b>Experimental infection</b>
<p>  
<b>K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub></b>.  2.5% solution is often used to detect
coccidian parasites, as it causes sporulation in oocysts of these organisms;
but this interferes with excystation of sporozites when oocysts fed to mice.
<p>
<b>Sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></b>.  Best medium to create
sporulation and storing oocysts of <i>T gondii</i>.  It can be neutralized
before infection and then administered.
<p>
Oocysts can be administered parenterally for <i>T. gondii</i> (other coccidian 
parasites need oral administration).

<h2>Mechanism of Transmission/Infection</h2>
<p>
Electron microscopy studies of cell (thin section and freeze fracture) cultures 
and red blood cells invaded by <i>T gondii</i> have revealed mechanisms at 
cellular level.
<p>
Principal means of invasion is by <b>moving junction</b> with same 
morphological features as <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i>.
<p>
The apical point of the parasite contacts the host plasma membrane.  The 
cytoplasmic face of the host membrane then thickens with rhomboidally organized 
IMPs, and a very tight junction forms, enough to exclude electron-dense tracers 
like Ruthenium Red.  Protein from the rhoptry neck along with AMA protein from 
the microneme appear to be involved during this phase of infection.
<p>
Exocytosis of microneme has not been observed but is suspected during gliding
motility and invasion.  Small clear vesicles align inside the conoid when 
microneme exocytosis is chemically triggered.  The vesicles could be a product
of microneme before or after their exocytosis.
<p>
Rhoptry exocytosis has been seen with invasion as an apical opening contiguous
with parasite plasma membrane, part of the development of parasitophorous
vacuole membrane (PVM).  The rhoptries open exactly at a rosette formed
by IMPs, which disappear with fusion.  The mechanism is similar to trichocyst
exocytosis in <i>Paramecium</i>.
<p>
Small vesicles bud from the PVM and enter host cell cytoplasm.  Rhoptries
appear to be emptied at this point.  If invasion is poisoned by cytochalasin
D, evacuoles form which are products of thwarted rhoptry exocytosis.
The PVM shows no IMP components.  Later IMPs form to indicate more parasite
membrane nature.
<p>
After formation of the parasitophorous vacuole (closure), posterior part
invaginates and tubulo-vesicular network (TVN) develops inside invagination.
Proteins exocytosed from anterior but before completion of invasion are
required for TVN.  GRA2 is required to organize network, with tubules contiguous
with PRMV.
<p>
<b>Post-invasion</b>.  The mitochondrion and ER surround the PV during
intracellular development.  Rhoptry protein ROP2 anchors host mitochondrion
to PVM.  The distance between mitochondrion and ER with respect to PV is
12 and 18 nm, respectively.  Mitochondrion associated to PVM has changes:
cristae are larger and irregular in shape, and stroma becomes electron dense.
With respect to host defense, the PV does not fuse to host cell lysosomes.
In contrast, parasites inside vacuoles of the host cell will fuse with
lysosomes, and parasites are killed and broken down.

<h1>Secretory Proteins and Invasion</h1>
<p>
<i>T gondii</i> is an obligate intracellular parasite so need to have ready
mechanisms to achieve invasion and infection.  In the Apicomplexa the invasion
mechanisms are generally preserved.  Most studies of the organism in vitro are
with tachyzoites, the most amenable to experimentation.  Unlike other phylum
members, <i>T gondii</i> is not limited by host specificity and can invade
insect, fish, and mammalian cells.  On plant protoplasts are resistant.  Other
Apicomplexa multiply by <dfn>schizogony</dfn> while <i>T gondii tachyzoites
multiply by endodyogeny, bypassing dedifferentiation in the schizonts.  Parasites
invade a subcellular compartment in order to settle and multiply.  The micronemes,
rhoptries, and dense granules that make up the apical complex play a role in
exocytosis of the contents of the complex in order to enable the living
environment.
<p>
<b>Invasion</b>.  The process is fundamentally distinct from phagocytosis or
endocytosis induced by intracellular pathogens (virus, bacteria,
<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>).  Invasion is complete in 20 s and occurs in a passive
host cell, in that there is no induction of host cell membrane ruffling,
actin microfilament reorganization or tyrosine phosphorylation.  Invasion is
done by the parasite in a very active way (active invasion) rather than an
induced invasion, as bacteria achieve.  First the parasite causes an invagination
of the host plasma membrane and then forms a tight-fitting vacuole around itself
after invagination:  the parasitophorous vacuole.  It is able to do this in
every cell type, including phagocytic types.  This vacuole neither acidifies
or fuses with lysosomes.  In contrast, opsonized parasites are internalized by
macrophages over a 2-4 min period in a spacious vacuole with the host cell
triggered in the same way as if a bacterium were involved.  This phagosome
acquires endocytic markers and fuses with endosomes/lysosomes, and quickly
acidifies.  The parasite is then destroyed.
<p>
There is a connection between motility and invasion.  Nonmotile parasites
are unable to penetrate the cell.  The motility is a gliding kind since the
parasite lack cilia and flagella.  There is no shape change in the gliding
motility; in contrast amebae and vertebrate cells using crawling motility
by producing pseudopods and lamellipods in direction of motion.  Apicomplexan
locomotion is 10-50 times faster (10 &micro;m/s in vitro) than for other cells.
The gliding follows certain patterns:  circular gliding in which the crescent-shaped
parasite lies on its right side and moves in counterclockwise direction;
upright twirling in which the parasite attaches to the substrate via the
posterior end and causes clockwise spinning; helical rotation with a horizontal
twirling movement resulting in forward displacement.  In vitro helical gliding
is the only means to produce long-distance productive movement, although
<i>Plasmodium</i> sporozoites lack this but can also move long distances during
liver invasion.  With helical gliding the apical end of the parasite contacts
the cell and a counterclockwise torsion of parasite body is observed sometimes
in entry.  Parasite attachment occurs by a different process than the invasion:
attachment is not affected by actin-disruptor cytochalasin D (cytD).  The conoid
is a thimble-shaped structure at the extreme apex, extending and retracting
repeatedly as the parasite moves along host cell surface.  Using a conoid
inhibitor it was found that conoid does not affect motility nor is it related
to microneme secretion. Conoid function may be related to bringing the apex
close to the host cell surface.  If the organism is pretreated with cytochalasin
D conoid extrusion is inhibited although no attachment is affected.  The conoid
is evident in motility and in invasion, and in apicomplexans initiating infection
in the gut.  It is not found in <i>Plasmodium</i>, so it might be necessary for
intestinal epithelium.  Area of contact between conoid and cell invaginates in
the host cell to create a <dfn>moving junction</dfn> in which zoites propel
into nascent parasitophorous vacuole (PV).  The moving junction ultrastructurally
is a rhomboidally arrayed set of particles and identical to that formed by
invading <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> merozoites.  A circumferental ring
expands then closes as the zoite body and posterior slides into the vacuole.
The vacuole membrane is basically the host plasmalemma.
<p>
The PV permits low MW (&lt; 1300 Da) molecules both ionized and uncharged to
diffuse freely, and this is likely mediated via a channel protein, and since
host integral proteins are excluded from the PVM, it is likely coded by the
parasite.  Proteins from the dense granule and rhoptries are known to associate
with the PVM.  In vitro sporozoite entry contains a single parasite and the
PV lacks molecular pores;  this parasite will not replicate in the vacuole
and within 24 h will form and exit into a secondary vacuole and secrete proteins
from the dense granule.  This type of two-step invasion process indicates that
the parasite must set up its environment in a way to survive and replicate.
<p>
The molecular details are less well known compared to the morphological details.
In particular we want to learn about the MJ and formation of the PV.  The apical
organelle is clearly involved:  first proteins of the microneme and then the
rhoptry are sequentially secreted in a space- and time-coordinated way.  Secretion
of dense granule occurs at end of invasion process, after PV formation, and
these are involved in PV remodeling.
<p>
In a study of gliding motility in <i>Plasmodium bergheri</i> antibodies were
used to cover the trailing end in order to track relocalization of surface-bound
molecules.  In a study of another sporozoite it was shown that cationized
ferritin was relocated to the posterior cap.  The capping phenomenon was
susceptible to cytochalasin D and affected by low temperature.  This led to
a model in which the gliding motility was based on a antero-posterior translocation
of surface protein interacting with cell surface or substrate receptors and coupled
to a submembranous actomyosin motor.  These proteins are not on the parasite
surface, but instead come from microneme exocytosis, a process induced by apical
attachment.

<h1>Human Pathology</h1>

<h2>Congenital Transmission</h2>
<p>
Toxoplasmosis was characterized in 1938 in the autopsy of a month-old female 
infant.  She had experienced convulsive seizure and the maculae of both eyes had 
lesions.  Encephalomyelitis explained the seizures: brain and spinal cord showed 
intracellular and free <i>T gondii</i>.  Parts of cerebral cortex and spinal 
cord were homogenized and inoculated intracerebrally into rabbits and mice.

which also developed lesions and encephalitis.
<p>
Common findings in all cases of infected neonates are:
<ul>
<li>hydrocephalus or microcephalus
<li>intracerebral calcification
<li>chorioretinitis
</ul>

<p>
Typically the infant dies with these developmental abnormalities.
<p>
Studies show the embryo and fetus is most susceptible during first two 
trimesters.  Women who become infected (show seroconversion) during pregnancy do 
not always transmit to fetus.  Women who are seropositive before pregnancy
do not transmit infection to the fetus.

<h2>Acquired Toxoplasmosis</h2>
<p>
<b>Strain RH</b>.  In a case report in 1941, 6-year old male was hit with 
baseball bat. Severe headache is seen 2 days later, and convulsions the day 
after. He is admitted on day 7 with no signs of parasite, although there is 
lymphadenopathy and enlarged spleen.   Neurological signs later develop, and 
death occurs on day 30.  Brain homogenate is injected into mice because of 
suspicion of polio virus:  <i>T. gondii</i> is isolated, and this is designated
RH, the initials of the boy.  Gross appearance of the brain showed no lesions.
Only microscopy revealed nonsuppurative lesions.
<p>
In the initial passage to mice, death did not occur until 3 weeks later.
But multiple passages caused death in much shorter time (3-5 days).
The pathogenicity in mice was eventually lost, and the <i>T. gondii</i> RH
strain cannot produce oocysts in cats.
<p>
In adults, infection causes <b>lymphadenopathy</b>.  Another target organ is
the retina of the eye (ocular disease).  The occurrence of neurological
invasion leading to encephalitis is rare, but it is fatal if not treated.
<p>
Other systems are rash, fever, and malaise.

<h2>Pathogenesis</h2>
<p>
Hydrocephalus appears to result when the aqueduct of Sylveus is blocked by 
ventriculitis resulting from Ag-Ab reactions to the parasite.  This clinical
sign appears unique for the disease in humans.

<h3>Cerebral Pathogenesis, Development of Host Resistance</h3>
<p>
Chronic (latent) infection is one of most common in humans: 10-25% of world's
population infected.  In acute stage, tachyzoites proliferate in nucleated
cells, proliferate in all tissues.  Then parasites form cysts (latent stage)
in various organs, esp. brain and muscle of heart and skeleton, and from their
establish chronic infection.  The chronic infection often emerges with 
immune function weakening or loss:  this leads to cysts forming tachyzoites
again.  Seen as an encephalitis, particularly as opportunistic infection in
AIDS patients.  Congenital transmission is usually obtained, and lies dormant
in brain.
<p>
Immunity is typically interferon-&gamma;-dependent cell-mediated and plays
the large role in host resistance.  Humoral immnuity is also involved. 
Microglia in brain produce IFN-&gamma; after activation to <i>T gondii</i>.
<p>
Since IFN-&gamma; is involved, production of IL-12 must occur as well by
some cell types.  When mice are treated with IL-12 antibodies, they have total
mortality when infected with avirulent <i>T gondii</i> strain;  this is associated
with loss of IFN-&gamma;.  The IL-12 source is CD8&alpha;+, CD11c+, and 
DEC205+ dendritic cells within T-cell rich populations in spleen, migrating
there probably because CCR5 is expressed on surface.  CCR5 deficiency also 
leads to impaired IL-12 production.  The presence of cyclophilin-18 on the parasite
triggers IL-12 production through CCR5.  Profilin-like protein might also bind
to Toll-like receptor 11 and stimulate IL-12 in dendritic cells.
<p>
In chronic infection, dendritic cells with CD11c and 33D1 markers are at 
inflammatory sites in brain in mouse studies.  These cells also show MHC class II
molecules, CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86 (indicating significant differentiation)
and trigger T cell responses in vitro.  Besides dendritic cells, macrophages
entering the brain may also be secretors of IL-12 since they produce it when
exposed to tachyzoites or tachyzoite antigens.
<p>
In acute peritoneal infections in mice by <i>T gondii</i>, neutrophils rapidly
infiltrate the peritoneal cavity and 85% of these cells had intracellular 
storage of IL-12.  If neutrophils are depleted in first 6 days of infection,
there is increased mortality:  associated with decreased IL-12 and IFN-&gamma;
production by splenocytes.  This infiltration also plays role in Th1-type
immune response.  Unknown if neutrophils are a factor in fighting brain infection
in chronic stage.
<p>
&alpha;&beta;  T cells control parasite in acute and chronic stages.  Other cells
produce IFN-&gamma;

<h1>Veterinary Pathology</h1>
<p>
Dogs infected with canine distemper virus appear to be susceptible to 
fatal toxoplasmosis.  This includes dogs vaccinated with an attenuated
live virus.
<p>
<b>Sheep</b>.  Ovine disease causes severe economic impacts for sheep
farmers.  Much of the problem is that the disease results in prenatal
abortion in ewes.  Disease occurs in other ovids too, such as goats.
<p>
<b>Marine mammals</b>.  <i>T gondii</i> infection of marine mammals
(sea otters) has been reported.
<p>
Clinical toxoplasmosis does not appear to occur in cattle or horses.

<h1>Medical Diagnostics</h1>
<p>
<b>Sabin-Feldman Dye Test</b>. Has high sensitivity and specificity.
Titer of 1:2 could indicate ocular disease.
<p>
<b>Cord Blood IgM Ab</b>.  Use of indirect fluorescent antibody test
(IFAT) and ELISA were tried on cord blood (IgM does not cross placenta).
<p>
<b>Indirect Agglutination</b>.  The IgM-ISAGA test is a variant on ELISA:
the enzyme conjugate is not used, but an agglutination is done.
<p>
<b>Modified Agglutination Test (MAT)</b>.  Quite sensitive and specific.
Direct agglutination was used in 1965, and later improved in 1980 and 1987
to a modified form.
<p>
<b>PCR</b>.  Primers to the B1 gene were used initially in 1989.  Other
gene tests have proven successful too.

<h1>Therapy</h1>
<p>
In the 1940s mice responded to sulfonamides.  A decade later, combination
of sulfonamides and pyrimethamine became standard therapy in humans.
<p>
<b>Spiramycin</b> has been used prophylactically in women during pregnancy with 
established infections. Use of spiramycin in pregnancy reduces congenital 
transmission, but does not stop clinical disease in infants.

<h1>Prevention</h1>
<p>
<b>Meat preparation.</b>  The freezing of meat overnight before consumption
for either humans or animals is the most economical method to reduce 
transmission of <i>T. gondii</i>.
<p>
<b>Agriculture</b>.  Keeping cats from entering areas where pigs are grown
and stored reduces infection in pigs.  Raising pigs indoors helps too.
Prevalance of viable <i>T gondii</i> in pigs has been reduced to &lt; 1%.
<p>
Vaccination in sheep with cystless strain of <i>T gondii</i> reduces abortion
of lambs.
<p>
No vaccine has been produced for humans yet.
