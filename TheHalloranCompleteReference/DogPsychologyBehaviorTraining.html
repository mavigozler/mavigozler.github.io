These notes are summarizations shamelessly taken from the book <i>Understanding
Your Dog for Dummies</i> by professor of animal psychology Stanley Coren at the
University of British Columbia and noted dog trainer Sarah Hodgson (of Simply
Sarah, Inc.)

<hr>

<h1>A Quick Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>Dogs were domesticated originally to be animals assisting in herding of
other animals.
  <br>You should understand this when trying to understand your dog.
Its origins are important.
<li>Dogs have identifiable personality types.
  <ul>
  <li>Dominant dogs watch all people who enter the room, and make an assessment
  of their ability to dominate the person.
  <li>Timid dogs run under the table when the door bell rings.
  <li>There will be discussion of this later.
  </ul>
<li>A dog's sense of smell may be its more significant sense.
 <ul>
 <li>they know if another animal was around
 <li>they may be able to detect human pheromones (like those related to fear or stress)
 <li>dog vision (the eyes) are weak compared to humans, and may be attuned to detecting motion
 <li>dog hearing is good: better than humans for fainter sounds and
  higher frequencees (the dog whistle is a very high frequency sound unheard by humans)
 </ul>
<li>Dogs may learn up to 165 different directions from their masters, but you
may only want to make sure they know 6 of them
 <ul>
 <li><b>follow</b><br>
   get them to look at you or walk alongside you
 <li><b>wait-okay</b><br>
   you teach your dog to be prepared for danger
   <br>you don't want them running into a busy street?
   <br>you want them to pause at an entrance or exit, make sure it is okay to proceed
 <li><b>no!</b>
  <br>what master does not want his dog to stop from doing something: jumping up, stealing food, chasing something
  <li><b>stay</b>
   <br>teach the dog to resist the desire to lose control
  <li><b>down (+ settle down)</b>
   <br>dog is directed to submissive relaxed pose (or to its bed)
  <li><b>come</b>
   <br>sometimes it's a natural impulse, until you own a Pekinese
  </ul>
 <li>Dogs act out
    <br>they can feel misunderstood, restless or needy
    <br>however, they do not act out of spite, or vengeance, or guilt
 <li><b>DOG AGGRESSION</b>:  when the dog bites
  <ul>
  <li>dogs will bite if they have been badly trained to do so (rescues from
  dog fighting rings), but also instinctively to protect territory
  </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Historical Origins of The Dog</h1>
<p>
The wolf, jackal, fox, coyote, and dingo have feature similarities to the
domesticated dog.  But all of these animals come from a common ancestor.
The dog does not descend from the wolf, but the wolf is a wild variant that
had its own evolutionary path distinct from the dog.  Dogs have about as much
similarity to wolves as humans have to other primates, like the chimpanzee.
<p>
Dogs were among the first of animals to be domesticated.  Cows, pigs, horses,
chickens...they all came later in humanity's desire to pen up livestock.
Before humans learned agriculture, they had brought dogs into their circle.
Dogs were probably domesticated between 14,000 and 17,000 years ago, while
sheep were made livestock 11,000 years ago.  And cats:  7,000 years ago.
Dogs were probably brought into human life in the regions of Asia and Russia,
then later into the Middle East, Europe, and North America.
<p>
Canines (wolves, dogs) are scavenging animals by nature: they will look for
food where they can get it.  It doesn't have to be a fresh kill.  So their
contact with humans probably occurred when canine animals could find leftover
food from human camps that were dumped outside the camp.  This probably brought
them into contact with humans earlier than other animals.  More importantly,
dogs may have warned their human camp members when outsiders (human or otherwise)
were coming into the territory.  This made human and dogs natural partners.
<p>
Dog domestication likely occurred over several breeding cycles.  The dog ancestor
would have been wild and would have been aggressive against its human neighbors.
The humans would have killed the more aggressive members of the pack.  This
preserved pack members who were less aggressive.  They would breed to create
generations of dogs also less aggressive.  Eventually after several generations
from the wolf-like ancestor, the domesticated dog would have emerged.  It is
also for this reason that it may be impossible to domesticate (tame) an animal
taken from the wild, because their "wildness" may have significant genetic
programming and there is no amount of nurturing one can do to remove these
wild elements.
<p>
This hypothesis of breeding out the wildness of animals was acceptably proved
by Russian geneticist Dmitry K. Belyaev, who purposely selected silver foxes,
also related to dogs as canines, which were very tame and not at all aggressive.
He bred these tame versus aggressive individuals.  After only six generations,
he found clear differences in his tame/friendly group versus the wild silver
foxes.  After 35 generations, the wildness of the silver fox in which it would
run from humans was gone, and they were just like pets.
<p>
<b>Dogs are Wolf Puppies</b>.  Dogs appear to share a lot of properties with
the puppy version of wolves but not the adult version of wolves.  For instance
wolf puppies do not show a fear of strangers to the pack but the adults do.
Adult wolves would challenge humans continuously for dominance, but not the
puppies.  Adult dogs and wolf puppies continually want to have playful activity,
but not wolf adults.  Dogs and wolf puppies bark continuously, but wolf adults
do it rarely and briefly (when in warning or surprise).  When engaged in group
howling, the adult dog bark and yelp is more like the pup, but the adult wolf
does it differently.

<h1>Dog Chasing</h1>
<p>
This is an instinctive activity in dogs.  In some breeds, it is very strong.
It persists from the days of the dog as a hunter.
<p>
Identify which type of dog you have as a hunter/chaser.  Take a toy or something
you know your dog chases, and throw it across the room.  What reaction do you see?
<ul>
<li><b>Ignores toy</b>:  no wolf in this dog, his hunting instinct is absent
<li><b>Runs to toy, but does not pick it up</b>: Has a chsase instinct, but low
overall hunting instinct
<li><b>Picks up toy, and carries part way or all the way back to you</b>:
Moderate level of hunting instinct, as chase and grab are present
<li><b>Pounces on toy, shaking and chewing it</b>:  Strong hunting instinct:
your dog is still a hunter.
</ul>

<h2>Controlling the Chase Drive</h2>
<p>
The best way to control this behavior is by distracting the dog to a behavior
you want.  The natural reaction is for the master to yell <b><q>Stop!</q></b>
or <b><q>Stop it!</q></b>  You will use a word that you choose that the dog
will respond to.  Better to choose a word carefully, perhaps one that you might
rarely use but makes sense to use, and keeping it to one syllable, say
<b><q>Hold!</q></b>.

<ol>
<li>The training requires two people (not including yourself) and at least
two of the dog's favorite chase toys.
<li>Have one person hold the dog.  Have the other person stand 15 feet
(about 4-5 meters) away.  You throw the chase toy <i><b>past</b></i> the
other person.  The dog is released from its hold with each chase of the toy.
<li>Now, every 3rd or 4th throw, have the other person catch the toy and quickly
hide it out of sight.
<li>When the dog starts to run to the person with the toy, the person hiding
the toy shouts the command word (<q>Stop it!</q> or whatever is decided).
The dog normally looks at the master when he realizes the toy has disappeared.
<li>When the dog looks at the master, immediately show him the other toy, and
throw that in the opposite direction.  Also run in that direction where the toy
was tossed to make the dog want to chase the other toy.  Why do you do this?
Because the command word and something good happening (chasing the other toy)
is being associated in the dog's habits.
<li>Put the dog on a long leash and take him to a place where the chasing
behavior occurs in public (take a treat with you).  When he begins any chasing
behavior, yell the command word, then bring him back and using praising words
and the treat too from time to time.
</ol>

<h1>Dog Sex and Reproduction</h1>
<p>
Dogs reach puberty after 7-10 months of age (wolves will take up to two years).
Smaller dogs reach puberty earlier than larger ones.
<p>
Unlike wolves, which are generally monogamous, dogs are promiscuous.  Yes, a dog
will have sex with any other dog and inanimate objects too.
<p>
Female dogs will <q>go into heat</q> (estrus breeding cycle) about twice a
year.  The female has a rush of hormones that affect her behavior about 8-9
days before ovulation.  This behavior is intended to find a mate.  The female
will not always choose the most dominant male (yes, the female chooses).
The female will seem to be very playful around males, but will be aggressive
against males they have ruled out.  If the female wants to reject the most
dominant male, she rolls on her back or side and refuses to stand (for mating).
For less dominant males, she growls or nips at them.  Females in heat will
also be aggressive towards other females, chasing them away, even if they are
not in heat.
<p>
Once mating is complete, expect a litter of puppies (about 6-10 on average per
litter) in about two months.  The average female reproductive period is seven
years.  At twice a year and with the average litter, the female could produce
a total of 4400 puppies in her life time, but of course never reaches that
number.

<h2>Spaying and Neutering</h2>
<p>
Responsible owners who have no clear plans to breed the dog should spay the
female or neuter the male.  This has very positive effects for everyone and
the dog.
<p>
<b>Neutering</b> the male will help in reducing the desire (not entirely stopping)
it to mark territory with urine.  It will also reduce its aggression as well
as wandering from home to look for sexual scents of females.   It does not appear
to have an effect on house guarding, fear biting, and predatory and territorial
aggression behaviro.
<p>
<b>Spaying</b> the females will reduce behaviors typically of being protective
of puppies, even if she has none.  However, in females that show dominance
behavior, aggression might be stronger since the ratio of male hormone is
up.

<p>
<b>When to Neuter/Spay</b>.  It is generally better to fix your dog
<b><i>before</i></b> puberty (sexual maturity) is reached.  It maintains
attractive puppy-like behaviors.  But fixing should not be done <i><b>too
early</b></i> as sex hormones are necessary for some aspects of healthy
development.  The dog should be allowed to reach its full size and show
some aspects of adult behavior.

<h1>Dog Language</h1>
<p>
<b>Giving your dog the look</b>.  It is actually better not to stare and to
minimize your eye contact with the dog.  It's like the pretty-girl phenomenon:
if you stare or give too much attention, they will come to believe that you
need them more than they need you;  if you pretend not to be interested, then
the pretty girl is perhaps indignant or shocked at your lack of interest, and
pursues you.
<p>
Well, maybe it's not that complex, but the rule is true for dogs too.
<p>
<b>When the dog stares at you</b> and does not obey your giving direction, it is
possible the dog is challenging your authority <i>or</i> may be too young and
inexperienced and is hoping for more direction.  With the former, it is staring
back;  don't you stare back, just ignore it and position the dog.  You can
tell if the latter is at work by see if the ears are back, and the body is
curved down into submissive pose.  Position the dog calmly and try a luring
technique.
<p>
<b>Ignoring bad behavior</b> might be the best approach.  When the dog does
something bad, the best thing may be to do nothing.  Show an unresponsive
face.  Do not make eye contact.  When the dog does good behavior, make eye
contact and gives words of praise or a treat.  Also when calling the dog, do
not look at the dog: instead look at a fixed point, perhaps somewhere on the
ground (as if finding something) or turn away when calling the name.
<p>
Look at the table (nearly reproduced from the book):
<table>
<caption>How Your Dog Interprets Eye Contact</caption>
<tr><th>Use of The Dogs' Eyes   <th>Translation <th>Conditions / Emotions
<tr><td>direct eye-to-eye stare
 <td><q>I challenge you!</q>
   <br><q>Stop that now!</q>
   <br><q>I am boss around here, so back off!</q>
  <td>active dominant/aggressive signal given by a dog having social confrontation
    with another 
<tr><td>eyes turned away to avoid direct eye contact
 <td><q>I don't want any trouble!</q>
   <br><q>I accept the fact that you are the boss around here.</q>
   <td>signal of submission, with some undertones of fear, or appeasement
<tr><td>blinking
 <td><q>Okay, let's see if we can avoid a challenge</q>
   <br><q>I am not really threatening you.</q>
 <td>Blinking adds a pacifying gesture to a dog's threat stare: it lowers
 the level of confrontation without giving up much status
</table>
<p>
The eyes of a dog give a lot of information about your pet.  When the dog's
pupil is larger, the dog is quite emotional and aroused.  When the eye widens
and has a pronounced round shape, your dog feels either dominant or threatened.
In contrast, a smaller eye or squinting signals your dog is submitting or wants
to be passive.  Look also at dog posture and tail position for other clues about
your dog's emotional state.

<h2>Your Voice To The Dog</h2>
<p>
Now look at how dogs interpret the human voice:
<table>
<caption>Interpreting Human Vocalization</caption>
<tr><th>Your Vocalization  <th>Your Intent   <th>What Your Dog Understands
<tr><td>Yelling
   <td>you are frustrated, and want your dog to stop whatever he is doing
   <td>you are barking too much and your dog will join in, or it will cause
     aggression or fear in your dog
<tr><td>You repeat a given direction
 <td>You are wanting your dog to respond to your instruction
 <td>Your dog is annoyed and learns to ignore your direction, or it will
   respond only to multi-syllable direction
<tr><td>You repeat a direction, but this time loudly
 <td>You are making sure that the dog heard your instruction
 <td>Your dog sees it as a demand, but the problem is that in the future you
    must always use a loud voice to get a response
<tr><td>sweet tone
 <td>you are being nice for some reason
 <td>dogs communicate with other dogs with submissive whining, and your sweet
   tone is similar; you are nonthreatening and approachable
<tr><td><i>Very clearly spoken</i> one word directions
 <td>you are giving a command
 <td>this is similar to a directional bark from another dog, and it will
    get the dog's focus and respect
</table>
<p>
Important points to remember:
<ul>
<li>Be to your dog like a teacher or coach is to their students or athletes:
do not use a dramatic or placating tone, but a firm tone with constant voice
level.
<li>Give the direction to the dog once:  if the dog does not know, position the
dog as if it is not paying attention.
<li>Do not yell, shout, and scream at the dog.  Speak sternly, but make it short.
<q>That's unacceptable</q> or <q>shame on you</q> properly timed and unvarying
in tone is good.
</ul>

<h2>The Dog's Voice To You</h2>
<table>
<caption>Understanding Barking</caption>
<tr><th>Dog Sound  <th>Translation  <th>Condition / Emotions
<tr><td>A midrange pitch with rapid sequence of 3 or 4 barks and pause in between
 <td><q>Gather together.  I think there is something we should look at</q>
 <td>This is an alerting call, suggesting more interest than alarm in the situation
<tr><td>A midrange pitch of rapid, repetitive barking
 <td><q>Call the pack!  Someone is entering our territory!</q>
  <br><q>We need to take some action soon.</q>
 <td>The basic alarm bark.  The dog is aroused but not anxious.  Note this is
 not a broken bark.  It happens when a stranger is near or the dog thinks some
 event might happen that is worrisome
<tr><td>A slower and lower pitch continuous barking
 <td><q>An intruder or other danger is close</q>
  <br><q>Get ready to defend yourself!</q>
 <td>The more worried form of the alarm bark, and indicating an imminent threat
<tr><td>Long sequence of single barks with notable pauses between each bark
 <td><q>I am lonely and need companionship</q>
  <br><q>Is there anyone there?</q>
 <td>The dog feels alone or confined, and wonders if people are around
<tr><td>One or two midrange to high pitch sharp, short barks
 <td><q>Hello there!</q><br><q>I see you</q>
 <td>A greeting or acknowledgment signal, done when a familiar person is seen
  or arrives.
<tr><td>One lower midrange pitch sharp short bark
 <td><q>Stop that!</q><br><q>Back off!</q>
  <td>This is an annoyance bark, heard when disturbed from sleep, or the fur
   is pulled, and so on
<tr><td>Higher pitched single short sharp bark
 <td><q>What's this?</q><br><q>Huh?</q>
 <td>The dog is surprised or startled
<tr><td>Mid-to-high pitch single bark, more deliberate in delivery, and not
as sharp or short as barks above
 <td><q>Come here</q>
 <td>The dog is trying to get the human to respond, such as getting the human
 to open a door, or to give food
<tr><td>The stutter bark (<q>ar-Ruff!</q>)
 <td><q>Let's play</q>
 <td>Combined with a dog posture with front legs outtstetched flat and the rear
   held high, the dog is inviting to play
<tr><td>A bark with rising crescendo sound
 <td><q>This is fun!</q><br><q>Let's go!</q>
 <td>The dog shows excitement in play or anticipating play, wants master to throw
ball
<tr><td>a soft low-pitched bark (coming from chest)
 <td><q>Back off!</q><br><q>Beware!</q>
 <td>Usually something a dominant dog gives to other dog to express annoyance
   or others to keep distance
<tr><td>Growl-bark (low pitched <q>grrrr-ruff!</q>)
 <td><q>I'm upset, and if you push me, I will fight!</q>
  <br><q>Pack mates, rally round me for defense!</q>
 <td>A somewhat less dominant sign of annoyance, asking for help from pack members.
<tr><td>Growl-bark (higher midrange pitch)
 <td><q>You frighten me, but I will defend myself if I must</q>
 <td>Worried threat from dog who is not confident, but will use aggression if
 pressed
<tr><td>Growl where pitch undulates (rises and falls)
 <td><q>I'm terrified</q> <br><q>If you come at me, I may fight, but I also might
 run</q>
 <td>Dog is unsure of what to do, and gives a fearful-aggressive sound
<tr><td>Yip-howl (yip-yip-yip-howl)
 <td><q>I'm lonely</q><br><q>Is there anybody there?</q>
  <td>The dog feels as if no one is around (no dogs or family)
   <br>The howl is prolonged
<tr><td>Howl (sonorous and prolonged usually)
 <td><q>I am here!</q><br><q>This is my territory</q><br><q>I hear your howls!</q>
 <td>Dogs use this to announce presence, socialize over a distance, and to
declare territory.  It might sound sad to a human, but the dog is content.
<tr><td>Bark-Howl ("ruff-ruff-howl")
 <td><q>I am worried and alone</q><br><q>Why doesn't somebody come here to be with
 me?</q>
 <td>Mournful sound of dog lonely and isolated, and who fears no one is around
 to respond to his call.
<tr><td>Baying
 <td><q>Follow me!</q><br><q>All together now!</q><br><q>I have the scent, so
 stay close!</q>
 <td>This is a dog's hunting call for tracking a quarry, and he alerts the members
 of the pack to be near for assistance
<tr><td>Whining rising in pitch at then end of the sound (sound like it is mixed
with a bit of a yelp)
 <td><q>I want...</q><br><q>I need!</q>
 <td>A request or plea for something.  Louder and more frequent means strong
emotion behind the plea.
<tr><td>Whining dropping in pitch at the end of the sound, or simply fading with
no pitch change
 <td><q>Come on now! Let's go!</q>
 <td>Usually indicates excitement and anticipation, such as waiting for food to
be served or a ball to be thrown.
<tr><td>Soft whimpering
 <td><q>I hurt!</q><br><q>I am really frightened</q>
 <td>A fearful passive/submissive sound seen in adults and also in puppies
<tr><td>Moan-Yodel (e.g., <q>Yowel-wowel-owel-wowel</q>) or
Howl-yawn (e.g., breathy <q>Hoooooo-ah-hooooo</q>)
 <td><q>I am excited!</q><br><q>Let's do it</q><br><q>This is great!</q>
 <td>Pleasure and excitement signals when something the dog likes is about to
happen.  Each dog settles on one of these sounds to express this emotion.
<tr><td>Single yelp (may sound like short high-pitched bark)
 <td><q>Ouch!</q>
 <td>Response to sudden, expected pain
<tr><td>Series of yelps
 <td><q>I am really scared</q><br><q>I am hurting</q><br><q>I am out of here!</q>
<br><q>I surrender!</q>
 <td>An active response to fear and pain, usually given when dog is running away
from a fight or painful encounter.
<tr><td>Screaming (might sound like child in pain combined with prolonged yelp)
 <td><q>Help! Help!</q><br><q>I think I am dying!</q>
 <td>A sign of pain and panic from a dog who is fearful for its life
<tr><td>Panting
 <td><q>I'm ready!</q><br><q>When do we start?</q><br><q>This is incredible!</q><br>
<q>This is intense!</q><br><q>Is everything okay?</q>
 <td>Simple sound of stress, excitement, or tense anticipation
<tr><td>Sighs
 <td><q>I am content and am going to settle down here awhile</q><br><q>I'll
give up now and simply be depressed.</q>
 <td>Simple emotional signal that terminates an action.  If action was rewarding,
it signals contentment.  Otherwise it is an end of an unsuccessful effort.

<h2>Dog Postures</h2>
<p>
Just as important as how the dog talks to you is how the dog shows its body to
you.  Humans have body language, and certainly dogs do as well.  I have
re-tabulated the <a href="http://www.pawsacrossamerica.com/interpret.html">excellent
descriptions of 13 dog postures</a> detailed by Bashkim (<q>Bash</q>) Dibra of
Paws Across America, because this re-tabulation shows the important body
parts and elements of the dog in a presentation that helps you distinguish
them better, hopefully.  I have re-ordered Bash's particular presentation
giving the ears and tail prominence, but you should really try to understand
all the elements.
