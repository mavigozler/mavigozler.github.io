		<h1>Animal Handling &amp; Care</h1>
		<p><b>Cages</b>.
			Caged animals must be given a comfortable environment. Cages must be
			constructed that allow each animal to move and make postural adjustments.
			Minimum space and height requirements are given in the table below, which
			may change as an animal grows if it is confined when first young.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cage materials can be constructed from stainless steel, polypropylene and
			polycarbonate. Surfaces should be smooth and not allow deposits of dirt
			to build up, and should be cleanable and disinfected. Cages should permit
			access to food and water and be viewable without need for disturbing the
			animal.

		<p><b>Feed</b>. Diets can be in pelleted, extruded or meal form with the
			proper nutrient requirements. Feed can be formulated from natural, purified
			or chemically defined ingredients. While the usual is to provide it ad libitum,
			restricted diets to reduce caloric intake may be more natural and increase
			life span.

		</p>
		<p><b>Bedding</b>. Animals can be kept in solid-bottom cages with contact
			bedding or suspended-wire cages with noncontact bedding beneath the cags.
			Contact bedding gives warmth, absorbs urine and water, and can be used by
			some species as nesting material. Bedding materials include ground corncobs,
			sawdust, pelleted peanut hulls, pelleted alfalfa, shredded paper, processed
			wood chips, and processed paper chips. As for wood-based beddings, aspen,
			birch, beech, and maple appear to be without side effects (unlike red cedar,
			or yellow and white pine).

		</p>
		<p><b>Water</b>. This must be provided at all times and be uncontaminated.
			Use of water than has been run through deionization, reverse osmosis,
			or ultrafiltration should be considered.

		</p>
		<p><b>Sanitation</b>. The frequency of cleaning the living environment
			(cage) depends on the type of caging and bedding used and the type of animal
			housed. Usually cleaning 2-3 times per week is to be done to prevent
			accumulation of waste and bacteria. Dirty bedding must be removed from the
			room where animals are housed. Cage cleaning and sanitation should be done
			once a week by either mechanical or hand washing. Daily mopping of floors
			with disinfectant should be done, and room surfaces should be cleaned at least
			once a month.

		</p>
		<p><b>Off-hour care</b>. Personnel should inspect the animals and call
			emergency numbers of veterinarians and personnel responsible for animal care.

		</p>
		<p><b>Environment</b>. Temperature, humidity, ventilation, and illumination
			must be controlled, especially to minimize variables of experimentation.

			For recombinants in <i>E coli</i> hosts, the big problems are poor
			expression and recombinant protein insolubility (formation of
			inclusion bodies).
		</p>
		<p>
			For low expression:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Maximize the A+T content of the 5′ end of gene to
				reduce 2° structure of mRNA in this region; this often increases
				translation efficiency
			</li>
			<li>Determine if there is transcriptional terminator, and if not,
				insert one. This likely helps to reduce nucleotide drain and mRNA stability.
			</li>
			<li>Check that codon usage is maximized for E coli hosts. Four codons
				in series that are rarely used can decrease translational efficiency.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			For insolubility problems:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Alter culture temperature: more proteins are soluble at lower than
				at higher temperatures. In the inital studies, it might be effective to
				do a temperature study at 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, and 41°, and see
				which does the best expression.
			</li>
			<li>Try different fermentation conditions. Different media and metal
				supplements (especially for metal dependent proteins) can be used.
			</li>
			<li>Expression rates can be controlled by use of plasmids whose
				copy number varies (using low copy plasmids will help). The pACYC

		<h3 id="polystyr-adsorp-prin">Principles of Adsorption to Polystyrene</h3>
		<p class="p-citation">
			Note from P. Esser (ThermoScientific Nunc Technical <a href="pdfs/en-579.pdf">Bulletin 06a</a>)
		</p>
		<p>
			Binding capacity is not merely the count of molecules thta bind to a surface,
			but those that bind and still retain their biological function. Adsorption to
			polystyrene is based on van der Waals attractions rather than strong covalent
			or electrostatic bonds. These attractive forces involve both oscillating
			induced polarizations and non-oscillating. The oscillating kind (also called
			alternating polarities, AP) are generally stronger, and increase with the size
			of the molecule. The nonoscillating polarities (stationary polarities, SP) are
			because of the inherent polarities in the molecular components. The attractive
			for of AP is ∝ 1/<i>r</i><sup>7</sup>. In general van der Waals forces are
			about 0.01 of ionic and covalent bonds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thermo Scientific Nunc PolySorp is modified to enhance hydrophobic interactions
			while the MaxiSorp brand is for hydrophilic groups. In aqueous medium, hydrophobic
			elements preferentially adsorb to PolySorb while hydrophilic molecules to MaxiSorp.
			It is generally the case with biomolecules that more binding events occur with
			MaxiSorp, and it tolerates a broad range of incubation conditions during coating.
			But it could also be likely that sites important for function are bound and thus
			impeded.
		</p>
		<p>
			In developing an assay, check the sensitivity and specificity with MaxiSorp first.
			If function is lost, then try PolySorb. When configuring a PolySorb surface-based
			assay, higher concentrations and more demanding incubation conditions might be
			required. Proteins and peptides binding with equal affinity to either. Where there
			is higher lipid component, prefer PolySorb; where there is higher glycan content,
			prefer MaxiSorb.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Small molecule coating</b>. Generally molecules must be above a certain
			size in order to adsorb/adhere noncovalently. Small peptides (especially
			synthesized epitopes) should probably be attached to a carrier protein or
			molecule.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Calculations</b>. A spherical/globular antigen will pack in in a monolayer
			on the well surface with the most efficient packing (hexagonal arrangement)
			according to:
		</p>
		<p class="eqnserif">
			binding capacity <i>Q</i> (g/cm<sup>2</sup>) =
			2/√3 × MW/<i>N</i> × 1/(2<i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
		<p>
			where <i>r</i> is the Stokes radius and this is
		</p>
		<p class="eqnserif">
			<i>r</i> = <i>RT</i> / [(6<i>π</i>)(<i>η</i><sub>20</sub>)(<i>D</i><sub>20</sub>)<i>N</i>].
		</p>
		<p>
			The final form of the equation is:
		</p>
		<p class="eqnserif">
			<i>Q</i> = (6√3)<i>π</i><sup>2</sup>(MW)<i>N</i>(2<i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup> / [<i>RT</i>]<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
		<p>
			If the constants are substituted <i>N</i> = 6.023 × 10<sup>14</sup> /
			nmol, <i>R</i> =
			8.314&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;g&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>−2</sup>&nbsp;°K<sup>−1</sup>
			mol<sup>−</sup>, <i>T</i> =
			293° K (20° C), with a water viscosity of <i>η</i><sub>20°
				C</sub> = 10<sup>−2</sup> g cm<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and
			a diffusion coefficient of the biomolecule with reference to water at 20° C
			being 4 × 10<sup>−7</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for
			IgG, then an antibody coating of about 300 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>, or
			2&nbsp;pmol/cm<sup>2</sup>. Note the result is multiplied by 10<sup>9</sup>
			to get a value in ng/cm<sup>2</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			An IgG molecule has from the F<sub>ab</sub> to F<sub>c</sub> distance of 15 nm,
			a F<sub>ab</sub> to F<sub>ab</sub> span of 15 nm, and an effective depth of 3
			nm. If adsorbed to F<sub>c</sub> alone, it occupies a surface area of 45
			nm<sup>2</sup>. This calculates to <i>Q</i> 3.7 pmol/cm<sup>2</sup>. If it
			packed effectively lying on its side, then the effective area is 225
			nm<sup>2</sup> per molecule, and this would give <i>Q</i> = 0.74
			pmol/cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore the packing of an IgG must be somewhere between
			lying down on the side and perfectly standing up.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a molecule's weight is proportional to its size and volume, plots of <i>Q</i> vs.
			MW show that <i>Q</i> does not change significantly compared to molecular weight,
			meaning that compact globular molecules do not signficantly take more area with the
			increase in size.
		</p>
		<p>
			Consider the differences in coating IgG with plastics of different types. IgG
			has glycan moieties on the F<sub>c</sub> portion. Since MaxiSorp wells show a
			preference for oligosaccharides, it would be expected that coating yields better
			antigen binding if the IgG molecule is oriented as expected. In the experiment
			both types of plates were coated with dilution series using e starting concentration
			<i>C</i> well above saturation. Both specific and nonspecific antibodies were used.
			A sandwich assay was done with Ag and anti-HRP specific Ab in excess. Results of
			OD vs. log [specific coating Ab] will show two sigmoid curves: the one on the left
			will be for specific IgG and the one to the right of it is nonspecific IgG.
			Two points are computed from the results: these points are the intersection of the
			straight line formed from the upper asymptote of the curve and the slope of the
			line tangent to the midpoint of the sigmoid between upper and lower asymptotes.
			Assume A is the intersection of lines of the specific IgG and B is for the nonspecific
			IgG. The ratio between the left (<i>S</i>) and right (<i>C</i>) sigmoid curves, has
			the relationship of <i>S / C</i> = <i>A / B</i>. Thus, <i>S</i> = (<i>A × C</i>)
			/ <i>B</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The actual data reveals that <i>Q</i><sub>MaxiSorp</sub> = (<i>A</i><sub>MaxiSorp</sub>
			/ <i>B</i><sub>MaxiSorp</sub>) × <i>C</i> × (<i>V / F</i>). This value
			was 650 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> for the MaxiSorp, and 220 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> for the PolySorb.
			The <i>A/B</i> ratio was 1/20 for MaxiSorp, and 1/60 for PolySorp. The max.
			IgG concentration <i>C</i> was 100 µg/ml, reactant volume <i>V</i> = 200 µl
			with a surface area <i>F</i> = 1.54 cm<sup>2</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The results indicate that the MaxiSorp seemed to obtain the theoretical binding
			of an IgG molecule fully upright. The PolySorp value of one-third of the theoretical
			capacity could be explained by an equal proportion of molecules lying flat and
			molecules fully upright. In the assay, antigens of different size were captured,
			AFP has a mass about half of IgG, whereas the other antigens (ferritin, fibronectin,
			thyroglobulin) range from 3-5 times more than IgG mass. A more dramatic reduction
			in the OD signal would be expected for small-sized antigens than for large-sized
			antigen.

		<h3>The Surface/Volume Ratio in Solid Phase Assays</h3>
		<p class="p-citation">
			Note from P. Esser (ThermoScientific Nunc Technical <a href="pdfs/TB10b.pdf">Bulletin 10b</a>)
		</p>
		<p>
			With a larger surface area-to-volume ratio of a liquid in a plate well, it is
			understood that adsorbing molecules bind to surface faster when the liquid
			is exposed to more surface. This reduces incubation times if so. With a
			finite incubation time, a higher sensitivity is also gained.
		</p>
		<p>
			The adsorption kinetics model can be described by the reaction and second-order
			rate equation:
		</p>
		<p class="eqnserif">
			A + C → B<br>
			<i>dB</i><sub>t</sub> / <i>dt</i> = [ (<i>A</i> −
			<i>B</i><sub>t</sub>) / <i>A</i> ] × [ (<i>C</i> −
			<i>B</i><sub>t</sub>) / <i>V</i> ] × <i>S</i> ×
			(<i>kDt/π</i>)<sup>½</sup>
		</p>
		<p>
			where <i>B</i><sub>t</sub> is count of molecules bound at time <i>t</i>,
			<i>t</i> is elapsed incubation time for adsorption (hr), <i>A</i> = capacity of
			number of molecules that can be bound (saturating number), <i>C</i> = number of
			molecules in solution (concentration), <i>V</i> = volume of liquid in well
			(cm<sup>3</sup>), <i>S</i> = adsorbing surface (cm<sup>2</sup>), <i>D</i> =
			diffusion coefficient of IgG =
			1.44&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>−3</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;hr<sup>−1</sup>,
			and <i>k</i> = constant (dimensionless) determined by data simulation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first two factors derive from applying second order kinetics theory,
			and express adsorption rate at time <i>t</i> proportional to the instantaneous
			fraction of surface available for adsorption (first factor) and instantaneous
			concentration of dissolved molecules (second factor). The first factor is
			valid only if molecules can be adsorbed to form monolayer. The third/last
			factor is derived from diffusion kinetics in which molecules adsorb to surface
			by diffusion during incubation time. The third factor may not follow assumptions
			unless the liquid is stirred to maintain solution homogeneity: pure diffusion
			transport may occur only in a thin zone (layer) next to surface. But exact
			modeling of unstirred systems is more complicated.
		</p>
		<p>
			At time <i>t</i> = 0, the rate equation looks like:
		</p>
		<p class="eqnserif">
			<i>dB</i><sub>0</sub> / <i>dt</i> = <i>S</i> × <i>C/V</i> ×
			(<i>kD/π</i>)<sup>½</sup> × (<i>∂t</i>)<sup>½</sup>
			molecules/h
		</p>
		<p>
			according to the rate equation, representing the <i>initial</i> rate, where
			for given concentration (<i>C/V</i>), the rate is proportional to the
			surface area <i>S</i>. Integration of the rate equation produces a
			saturation function
		</p>
		<p class="eqnserif">
			<i>E</i><sub>t</sub> = <i>B</i><sub>t</sub> / <i>A</i> =
			(1 − <i>Z</i>) / (1/<i>F</i> − <i>Z</i>)
		</p>
		<p>
			where <i>Z</i> = (<i>F</i> − 1) ×
			2<i>P</i>(<i>kDt/π</i>)<sup>½</sup>, the fraction,
			<i>E</i><sub>t</sub>, of the surface area is adsorbed for a given time, <i>F</i>
			= <i>C/A</i> represents a supply/capacity quotient, and <i>P</i> = <i>S/V</i> is
			surface/volume ratio. This equation can be used to determine the time
			(<i>t</i><sub>x</sub>) required to obtain a certain fraction (<i>x</i>%) of
			the maximum adsorption. Three equations are derived depending on the value of
			<i>F</i>:

		</p>
		<p class="eqnserif" style="text-align:left;margin-left:2em;line-height:1.4em;">
			<i>t</i><sub>x</sub> {<i>F</i> &lt; 1} = <i>P</i><sup>−2</sup> ×
			(4<i>kD/π</i>)<sup>−1</sup> ×(1 −
			<i>F</i>)<sup>−2</sup> × [ln{(100 − <i>x</i> − <i>F</i>)
			/ (100 − <i>x</i>)}]<sup>2</sup><br>
			<i>t</i><sub>x</sub> {<i>F</i> = 1} = <i>P</i><sup>−2</sup> ×
			(4<i>kD/π</i>)<sup>−1</sup> × [<i>x</i> / (100 − <i>x</i>)]<sup>2</sup><br>
			<i>t</i><sub>x</sub> {<i>F</i> &gt; 1} = <i>P</i><sup>−2</sup> ×
			(4<i>kD/π</i>)<sup>−1</sup> ×(1 −
			<i>F</i>)<sup>−2</sup> × [ln{(100 − <i>x</i>/<i>F</i>)
			/ (100 − <i>x</i>)}]<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
		<p>
			These equations show that <i>t</i><sub>x</sub> is inversely proportional to
			the square of surface/volume ratio (<i>P</i>). Thus a 4-fold increase in
			<i>P</i> means that the incubation time is decreased by half. A plot of
			<i>t</i><sub>90</sub> (as a percentage of the maximum <i>t</i><sub>90</sub>)
			vs the log <i>F</i> from <i>F</i> = 0.1 to 10 shows that the maximum time
			is when <i>F</i> = 1, and as <i>F</i> → 0, it has a nonzero minimum
			value. If <i>C</i> and <i>A</i> are equally large, the adsorption would take
			the maximum time.

<h3>Adsorption Kinetics</h3>
<p class="p-citation">
Note from P. Esser (ThermoScientific Nunc Technical Bulletin 10b)
<p>
It is logical that when the well surface area to well volume ratio increases, 
this should favor a faster adsorption rate to the surface.  This should bring 
the reaction involving adsorption to equilibrium (completion) within a shorter 
incubation time.
<p>
The molecule M that is adsorbed exists in two states or phases:  the solution
phase (M<sub>s</sub>) and the bound-to-surface phase (M<sub>b</sub>).
Assuming that binding is irreversible, then the following reaction scheme is
reflects adsorption:
<p class="eqnserif">
M<sub>s</sub> &rarr; M<sub>b</sub>
<p>
The rate of formation of the bound phase can be expressed by this rate equation:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>d</i>M<sub>b</sub>/<i>dt</i> =  <i>k</i> [M<sub>s</sub>]

		<h3>Edge Effect in Microplates</h3>
		<p>
			Absorbance readings on identical samples from the wells in the center of the plate
			to the edge of it can vary. These have two sources:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Temperature differences during substrate conversion between central and
				edge wells.
			</li>
			<li>Differences in illumination of the plate during substrate development.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			With respect to temperature variations, this is typically due to failure
			to make sure reagents are warmed to room temperature before using them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another possibility is plate stacking: those in the center of the stack
			are somewhat insulated from heat that it greater at the edges of a stack or
			the top and bottom plates of the stack.
		</p>
		<p>
			In other cases, there is an attempt to shorten incubation time either by
			using higher temperatures (or even at room temperature), and the development
			of the substrate is not distinct in critical ways.
		</p>
		<p>
			To avoid edge effect:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Let incubations occur in the dark (or at least in low light conditions)
			</li>
			<li>Place reagents and plates to be used should be placed in an incubator set at the
				temperate in which the assay plates will be incubated.
			</li>
			<li>Plates should be sealed with adhesive tape or put into humid chamber to
				prevent evaporation, which also causes temperature differences as well as
				concentration changes.
			</li>

		<p class="p-citation">
			Note from RP Pratt and B Roser (ThermoScientific Nunc Technical Bulletin 07a)
		</p>
		<p>
			Various blocking agents were tested with flat-bottomed 96-well polystyrene
			Nunc Immuno Plate MaxiSorp F96. BSA, newborn calf serum (NBCS), and casein
			(as sodium caseinate, with 25 g casein powder dissolved in 800 ml 0.3 M NaOH
			stirred overnight at 37° then titrated to pH 7.0 with HCl and brought to
			1.0 L) were used. Wells were incubated in PBS with a dilution series of the
			block agents overnight at 4°, then incubated 1:4 PBS diluted rat serum
			for 90 min 4°, and rinsed twice with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20. Then an
			anti-rat HRP-conjugated rabbit F(ab′)<sub>2</sub> was incubated, followed
			by washing and substrate (peroxide/tetramethyl-benzidine). This tests how
			much Ig from rat serum became bound because of a failure of blocking agent to
			block. The sodium caseinate proved to be the best blocking agent.
		</p>
		<p>
			In another test, either HRP or alkaline phosphatase were used to coat wells,
			followed by block with NBCS or casein, then incubated with dilution series of
			the other of the enzymes, followed by addtion of either peroxide/TMB or
			<i>p</i>-nitrophenylphosphate. Addition of substrate for the 1st stage enzyme
			detects displacement, while addition for 2nd stage detects penetration of the
			blocking agent. Results show that a failure to block is because of 2nd stage
			penetration of block rather than to displacement of 1st stage enzyme.
		</p>
		<p>
			A TSK HW 55S column was used to examine casein and NBCS in PBS. Most of the
			species in NBCS were proteins &gt; 60 kDa which casein represented a size
			heterogeneity &gt; 60 kDa and &lt; 10 kDa. Casein was ultrafiltered then on
			three membranes such that it occurred in three ranges: &lt; 10 kDa, from
			10 to 30 kDa, and &gt; 30 kDa. Blocking was re-tested and it was found that
			the smaller class of proteins in the fractions gave the greater blocking
			efficiency.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus the more effective blocking agents are peptides of &lt; 10 kDa, and
			particularly casein.

		</p>
		<h3>Detergents in Polystyrene ELISA</h3>
		<p class="p-citation">
			Note from P. Esser (ThermoScientific Nunc Technical Bulletin 8)
		</p>
		<p>
			Detergent use ensures that nonspecifically bound components are not retained which
			can increase background signal or otherwise produce reduced signal interference.
			The class/kind/type of detergent and its concentration and particular point of
			use should be determined to ensure no unwanted effect occurs. Because detergents
			generally allow dissolution of solutes which are soluble in one phase with another
			phase, there is hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. They can exert a blocking effect
			as well if incubated with the plastic before the biomolecule to be coated.
			Preincubation of detergents beore the coating molecule alters surface chemistry
			and thus subsequent coating chemistry, which may perform unexpectedly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Five detergents were studied: Tween 20 and Triton X-100 (among non-ionics), SDS
			(anionic), DTAB (cationic) and CHAPS (zwitterionic). PolySorp and MaxiSorp
			plates were tested. The method involved using detergents at different steps in
			the assay:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>MicroWell plates with MaxiSorp or PolySorp surfaces treated with 5 µg/l
				swine anti-rabbit antibody (Dako Z196) in PBS overnight or with nothing.
			</li>
			<li>Washing was done three times with PBS + 0.2 M extra NaCl and with our without
				one of the five detergents added to the wash at 0.05%.
			</li>
			<li>For two hours, wells were treated with <em>either</em> HRP-conjugated
				<b>rabbit</b> antibody <em>or</em> HRP-conjugated <b>swine</b> antibody. Antibodies
				were at 1.3 µg/ml and in PBS. The solution was also with or without
				one of the five detergents at 0.05%.
			</li>
			<li>Finally another wash with PBS + 0.2 M extra NaCl and with or without
				detergent was performed.
			</li>
			<li>OPD and peroxide were then added to develop color, which was measured.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The following codes apply: <q>−&nbsp;−&nbsp;−</q> means that
			steps 2−4 never contained any detergent in the wash or treatment. A code
			of <q>+&nbsp;−&nbsp;−</q> means detergent was used only in 1st wash.
			<q>+&nbsp;+&nbsp;−</q> means detergent was used in 1st wash and the rabbit
			or swine antibody incubation. <q>+ − +</q> means detergent was used only
			in 1st and 2nd washes. And <q>+&nbsp;+&nbsp;+</q> means detergent was used in
			every step.

		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Detergents show blocking effect against nonspecific adsorption only if
				present together with conjugates: only in these cases are no significant
				signals from nonspecific adsorption.
			</li>
			<li>Tween 20 is an exception to the above generalization: when used in first
				wash, it helps to reduce nonspecific adsorption. It could be due to large size,
				which means it is not washed away easily. The larger portion of it is hydrophilic,
				and so it is not consistent that it has a blocking effect on the PolySorb
				surface (hydrophobic).
			</li>
			<li>DTAB has a large nonspecific background, possibly because it binds to
				conjugates nonspecifically.
			</li>
			<li>Tween 20 and DTAB enhanced signals if used in 2nd wash: it might be because
				of detergent presence in the substrate solutions. A control was done with
				HRP-Ab directly coated to the well with and without detergent presence in the
				substrate solution: with Tween 20 or DTAB present, there was an enhanced signal,
				indicating their effect on conjugate. SDS and CHAPS negatively interfered,
				and TX-100 had little to no effect.
			</li>
			<li>Tween 20, TX-100 and particularly SDS produce small specific PolySorp
				signals, and only SDS gave small signals with MaxiSorp. This is related to the
				harshness of the detergent during washing, and that PolySorp would bind less
				native antibody in stable way than MaxiSorp.
			</li>
			<li>Where no detergent is used at all, there is no difference between specific
				and nonspecific signal, nor between MaxiSorp or PolySorp. A control of
				[<sup>125</sup>I]Ab was used as the first layer and equal amounts of Ab were
				present in MaxiSorp and PolySorp wells. This explains equal signal qualities
				on both types of plates, but not equally large nonspecific signals. This may be
				due to nonspecific adsorption.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Results show that detergent is necessary to remove nonspecifically or loosely
			adsorbed substances which themselves can sterically hinder reactants.
			When no blocking agent is used, detergent presence in post-coating reagents
			will generally avoid unspecific adsorption. Tween 20 is unique in that it
			can act like a blocking agent (BSA, casein), so it might be possible to use it
			once and omit it thereafter. Ionic detergents (SDS, DTAB) are clearly undesirable
			because of their interference with assay reactants. Triton X-100 and Tween
			20 nonionics worked well with MaxiSorp wells, while CHAPS might be a better
			choice for PolySorp.

		</p>
		<h3>Blocking Agent and Detergent</h3>
		<p class="p-citation">
			Note from P Esser (ThermoScientific Nunc Technical Bulletin 09)
		</p>
		<p>
			Blocking agents in ELISA include non-specific proteins and detergents.
			In this study, three detergents (from Bulletin 8) Tween 20, Triton X-100
			and CHAPS are used in combination with BSA and casein, using two-layer
			Ab sequence on MaxiSorp and PolySorp plates. In many cases it is preferable
			to use a protein blocking agent rather than a detergent since the latter might
			disrupt weak but specific interactions. BSA is commonly used as a blocking
			agent, but casein is heterogeneous and may be more effective. What about
			using blocking agent together with detergent?

		</p>
		<h3>(Binding) Activity of Adsorbed Antibodies</h3>
		<p class="p-citation">
			Note from P. Esser (ThermoScientific Nunc Application Note 11b)
		</p>
		<p>
			When complex and large biomolecules adsorb to surfaces, do they lose their
			function (biological activity)? In Bulletin 10, the proportion or percentage of
			adsorbed capture antibodies with functional activity could be estimated using
			mathematical model fitting to the data. In this study polyclonal antibodies
			(pAbs) [IgG] were adsorbed to MaxiSorp F96 (439454) and PolySorp F96 (475094)
			polystyrene surfaces and the estimation of adsorption by simulation of target
			IgG bidnd data using the model modified for non-monolayer binding kinetics.
		</p>
		<p>
			An affinity-purified swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dako Z400) at 5 or 0.5
			µg/ml in PBS (pH 7.2) was added to well in 200 µl volume as a
			capture antibody. Maximum antibody densities on the well surface have a value
			<i>Q</i> in ng/cm<sup>2</sup>, which have been determined in another bulletin
			study to be 650 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> for MaxiSorp and 220 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> for
			PolySorp under these conditions. A [pAb] = 5 µg/ml is effectively
			saturating and so the <i>Q</i> values will be attained. At [pAb] = 0.5
			µg/ml, the <i>Q′</i> will be less than saturating and have been
			found to be <i>Q′</i> = 65 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>. After coating, a dilution
			series of rabbit IgG antibody (Dakeo A008) [target Ab, or tAb] were incubated to
			be able to estimate the density. This was followed by HRP-conjugated swine
			anti-rabbit IgG (Dako P217) in PBS + 0.05% Tween 20. Washings were with PBS +
			0.2 M extra NaCl + 0.05% TX-100. Note that a 200 µ;l/well covers a
			surface of 1.54 cm<sup>2</sup> and there is a surface area/volume ratio of
			7.7/cm.

		</p>
		<p>
			The rate equation for non-monolayer binding kinetics of the rabbit IgG antibody
			is as follows:
		</p>
		<p class="eqnserif">
			<i>dB</i><sub>t</sub>/<i>dt</i> = [ (<i>qA − B</i><sub>t</sub>) / <i>qA</i> ]
			× [ (<i>C − B</i><sub>t</sub>) / <i>V</i> ] × [
			<i>S</i>(<i>kD/π</i>)<sup>½</sup> <i>t</i><sup>½</sup> ]
		</p>
		<p>
			where <i>B</i><sub>t</sub> = number of bound tAb molecules at time <i>t</i>,
			<i>t</i> = elapsed binding time (in hr), <i>A</i> = theoretical maximum
			monolayer density of tAb molecules (~650 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>), <i>q</i> =
			fraction of monolayer density that can be bound, <i>C</i> = initial count
			of tAb molecules in solution, <i>V</i> = volume of liquid in well (0.2
			cm<sup>3</sup>), <i>S</i> = covered surface area (1.54 cm<sup>2</sup>),
			<i>D</i> = IgG diffusion constant (1.44 × 10<sup>−3</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>
			hr<sup>−1</sup>), and <i>k</i> = 2π<sup>2</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			When integrated through time:
		</p>
		<p class="eqnserif">
			<i>E</i><sub>t</sub> = <i>B</i><sub>t</sub> / <i>qA</i> =
			{1 − exp(<i>Z</i>)} / {<i>q/F</i> − exp(<i>Z</i>)}
		</p>
		<p>
			where <i>Z</i> = (<i>F/q</i> − 1) ×
			2<i>P</i>(<i>kD/π</i>)<sup>½</sup> <i>t</i><sup>½</sup>,
			<i>E</i><sub>t</sub> = fraction of <i>qA</i> occupied at time <i>t</i>,
			<i>F</i> = <i>C/A</i>, and <i>P</i> = <i>S/V</i> (7.7/cm).
		</p>
		<p>
			It is assumed that <i>qA</i> represents the monolayer of capture antibodies
			adsorbed and that tAb maximal binding to form the 2nd layer represents the
			<q>active</q> proportion of the 1st layer.
		</p>
		<p>
			In determining the model, the active percentages were found to be quite low. For
			MaxiSorp at 650 ng/cm<sup>3</sup>, it is only 2%, lower than values determined
			by others in the range of 5-10%. For saturated PolySorb (220 ng/cm<sup>3</sup>)
			active fraction is 6%. When non-saturated (65 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>), MaxiSorp
			active percentage is 8%, while in non-saturated PolySorp (same value), it remains
			5%. This might possibly be explained differnt ways the IgG molecules beds to
			the surface, which has been discussed <a href="#polystyr-adsorp-prin">here</a>.
			In MS-650, molecules may be packed in tight palisades, while in PS-220, the
			packing is more loose, with less presumed steric hindrance. In the unsaturated,
			packing is much less and so is the reduced hindrance. The signal intensity and
			differences between plates in saturated and unsaturated is remarkable.
			Higher signals were seen in unsaturated which might be attributable to better
			access of substrate to enzyme, and the higher signals in MaxiSorp might be due
			to better bedding of the conjugate favoring enzyme accessibility. Thus
			using less than saturating concentrations of capture antibody will give better
			sensitivity in sandwich assay and reduce costs.
		</p>
		<p>
			If plate drying for storage is likely to alter activity, then blocking with
			inert material (albumin) may prevent loss of activity. It was found that with
			increasing target Ab levels, there seems to be more binding to the capture Ab,
			which was not found with MaxiSorp, where more target did not bind more.
			This might be because capture Ab on the more hydrophobic PolySorp surface
			are <q>pulled</q> preferentially to a binding orientation, whereas with
			the hydrophilic MaxiSorp, the surface bonding energy is stronger and no such
			concerted pull activity is possible.

		<h2>ELISA Validation</h2>
		<p>
			Note from <a href="http://www.millipore.com/immunodetection/id3/elisa">Millipore</a>

		</p>
		<h3>Internal standard recovery test</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare the assay target in three concentrations (low, medium, high), and
				prepare a blank solution using the buffer containing the assay target. If the
				assay target is antigen (as for sandwich assay), prepare an antigen
				standard. If assay target is antibody, prepare antibody standard.
			</li>
			<li>Obtain 8 unknown (biofluid) samples, and aliquot each sample to four tubes
				labeled 'B' (blank), 'L' (low), 'M' (medium), and 'H' (high). If the unkowns
				are numerically labeled for the assay, then make it '1B', '1L', '1M', '1H', and
				so on.
			</li>
			<li>Add 60% (or appropriate adjustment) of a microplate well volume of unknown
				to each tube.
			</li>
			<li>To each 'B' tube, add 60% (or appropriate adjustment) of blank solution.
				To each 'L' tube, add the same volume of low concentration standard.
			</li>
			<li>Perform the ELISA: when it is time to add the sample, instead add the
				prepared sample + spiked standard to duplicate wells.
			</li>
			<li>Perform the assay at least twice to check reproducibility and compute
				a mean.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Check the recovery and determine if plate optimization is required. Acceptable
			recovery values should be between 80-120%.

		</p>
		<h3>Linearity Test</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Use the same 8 samples from the recovery test.
			</li>
			<li>Dilute each of the 8 samples to at least 3 concentrations, that is,
				the undiluted 1:1 (and maybe two or three more: 1:2, 1:4, 1:8).
			</li>
			<li>Perform the assay and determine expected vs. actual.
			</li>
			<li>Repeat the assay again or more (twice, 3 times) to get mean values and
				measure of variation
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Values should occur between 80-120% of what is expected.

		</p>
		<h3>Intra-assay Variation</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Obtain 8 samples known to have varying concentrations.
			</li>
			<li>For each sample, use a whole row of 12 wells to assay that sample
			</li>
			<li>Determine the mean and CV. Acceptable variation is from 80-120%.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Inter-assay Variation</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Obtain 8 samples known to have varying concentrations.
			</li>
			<li>Perform duplicate well analysis on each sample using one plate.
			</li>
			<li>The next day using a new plate but the same lot reagents, perform the assay again.
			</li>
			<li>Repeat this a third day, different plate but same lot reagents.
			</li>
			<li>Determine mean and CV, and the acceptable range is 80-120%
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Sandwich Assay Validation</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Obtain three 96-well plates from the lot.
			</li>
			<li>To each plate, perform the assay with blank, and low and high concentrations
				of the assay target, using a total of 32 wells per plate for each. That is
				for blank, columns 1-4 can be used; for low, columns 5-8; and for high columns 9-12
				A CV of 10% or less is acceptable.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)</h3>
		<p>
			Do not confuse with clinical sensitivity.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Perform the assay with blank and the lowest standard curve point in
				20 replicates.
			</li>
			<li>Compute mean and standard deviation of the absorbance values for both
				blank and low standard.
			</li>
			<li>The sensitivity can be calculted as follows:

			Acid Digestion of Aqueous Samples and Extracts for Total Metals For
			Analysis by FLAA or ICP Spectroscopy</h1>
		<p>
			These notes are taken from the SW-846 manual of the methods of the
			Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the U.S. Dept. of Interior.
			The method below is Method 3010: <q>Acid Digestion of Aqueous
				Samples and Extracts for Total Metals For Analysis by FLAA or
				ICP Spectroscopy,</q> Rev. 1, July 1992.
		</p>
		<p>
			The digestion is not suitable for sample to be analyzed by graphite
			furnance atomic absorption spectroscopy: hydrochloric acid causes
			interferences during atomization (see method 3020A).
		</p>
		<p>
			Materials required, recommended, or which may be of use include the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Griffin beaker, about 150 ml, or the equivalent
			</li>
			<li>watch glasses, ribbed and plain, or equivalent
			</li>
			<li>qualitative filter paper and appropriately fitting funnels
			</li>
			<li>centrifuge
			</li>
			<li>graduated cylinders, 100 ml, or equivalent
			</li>
			<li>an electric hot plate that can maintain a temperature of 90-95°
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Chemicals are to be <b>reagent grade</b>: these should conform to
			specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American
			Chemical Society. Other grades are possible provided they do not lessen
			accuracy of determination.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>reagent water
			</li>
			<li>concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> (nitric acid)
			</li>
			<li>HCl (hydrochloric acid), made up as a 1:1 HCl:water dilution.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Reagent water that is organic-free is best produced by passing tap water
			through a carbon filter bed with 2 kg of activated carbon. A water
			purification system will also deionize it. Boiling water 15 min will
			also remove volatile organics; subsequent to that maintain at 90°
			and bubble an inert gas through it for 60 min.
		</p>
		<p>
			Samples are to be collected in containers that must be pre-washed with
			detergents, acids, and water. Plastic and glass containers are acceptable.
		</p>
		<p>
			To a 100 ml sample placed in a 150 ml Griffin beaker, 3 ml of conc'd
			HNO<sub>3</sub> is added. The beaker is covered with a ribbed watch glass
			or equivalent. Evaporation is done on a hot plate until the volume falls
			to a low volume (5 ml). The sample must never be allowed to go dry, or
			the sample must be discarded.
		</p>
		<p>
			The beaker is cooled, and another 3 ml conc'd HNO<sub>3</sub> is added.
			A nonribbed watch glass is placed on top and the sample is heated so that
			refluxing occurs gently. Digestion is continued (add more acid if necessary)
			until the digestate is light in color or the sample does not change appearance
			with continued refluxing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Remove the watch glass and let the volume evaporate to 3 ml (but never to
			dryness). The beaker is cooled. 1:1 HCl is then added to 10% volume
			(10 ml per 100 ml material). The beaker is covered and then refluxed an
			additional 15 min.
		</p>
		<p>
			The container is removed and then permitted to cool. The sample is
			then filtered or centrifuged, as necessary to remove silicates or insoluble
			material that might clog an instrument nebulizer. Prerinse all filters
			and apparatus with dilute HNO<sub>3</sub> prior to use, to prevent sample
			contamination.
		</p>
		<p>
			The volume is readjusted what it was (100 ml) prior to the hot acid digestion.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Controls.</b> A blank of water should be processed in a like manner to
			assure quality of analysis. In addition, known standards might be employed.
