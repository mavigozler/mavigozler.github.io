<p>
Bias is essentially determining the differences in the report
or response of a machine to known or standard references.
If the true cocenration is xt for a substance but the report
of a machine gives a population mean of m, the following obtains

<p style="text-align: center;">
bias = &mu; &minus; <i>x<sub>t</sub></i>

<h1>Operational Amplifiers</h1>

The diagram will illustrate the inputs and outputs.
&epsilon;<sub>&minus;</sub> and &epsilon;<sub>+</sub>
are input potentials and <i>V<sub>i</sub></i> represents
the difference between these potentials.  +PS and &minus;PS
refer to the power supply to the amplifier (usu. +15 and &minus;15 V dc).
The amplifier has a gain (&beta;) in which the signal
multiplicaiton factor is understood.  The output voltage
will therefore be <i>V<sub>o</sub></i> = &minus;&beta;<i>V<sub>i</sub></i>.
<i>Z<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>Z<sub>o</sub></i> represent the
input and output impedance to the amplifier.  Most opamps
are self-contained units containing ~30 transistors and
resistors put into an IC chip.  Capacitors and diodes may
also be part of the setup.  The properties shared by most
if not all opamps are:
<ol>
<li>large open-loop gains (&beta; = 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup>)
<li>high input impedances (<i>Z<sub>i</sub></i> &ge; 10<sup>6</sup> &Omega;)
<li>low output impedances (<i>Z<sub>o</sub></i> &le; 1 to 10 &Omega;)
</ol>

In addition, they should provide zero output for zero input
(ideally &lt; 0.1 mV output), but the zero output voltage can
be obtained by use of an offset trimming system that reduces
the voltage.

<P>
Measurement of voltages for both the input voltages and the
output voltage are made with respect to a common ground in
the circuit (the ground potential).  This is essentially a
conductor providing a common return of all currents to
their sources.  The &epsilon;<sub>&minus;</sub> and
&epsilon;<sub>+</sub> do not represent how voltage
potentials are to be connected but represent how potentials
to the opamp are to be treated.  Potentials connected to
&epsilon;<sub>&minus;</sub> will be <em>inverted</em>
(a positive becomes negative, a negative a postive,
and ac voltages are 180&deg; out of phase),
will those connected to &epsilon;<sub>+</sub> are unchanged
with respect to polarity.

<h1>Uses of opamps</h1>

<h2>Feedback circuits</h2>

These return a fraction of the output signal to the amplifier,
this being feedback.  The feedback loop has a resistor (R<sub>f</sub>)
which connects to the lead going to the opamp inverter input.
Note that voltage in this circuit is opposite in polarity (if dc)
or out of phase (if ac) with the input to the opamp.

The following from Ohm's law and Kirchoff's rules describe the
relationship:
