Fortified Wines

<p>
From Beedell, S., <i>Wine Making and Home Brewing</i>, (London:
Sphere Books, Ltd.), 1969.

<p>
The <u>must</u> and <u>fermentation</u>:
ill the must into the fermentation bottles two inches from the
bung.  Keep some in another bottle to fill in case of a violent
first fermentation.  Keep the fermentation jars at about 65ï¿½ F.
If the fermentation stops, possible reasons are
(a) the temperature was too high or low,
(b) the sugar was too little or much,
(c) there was too much acid,
(d) there was too much yeast starter, or
(e) too much alcohol was added if a fortified fermentation was intended.

<p>
When the fermentation is done, <u>rack</u> it several times to
begin to introduce clarity.  Siphon and then top it up in a
clean jar.  If there is no brew available to top it, water
and a little sugar will do.  Cork it and leave it for 2 months.
Rack it off again, leaving the sediment.  Top up the bottle and then
re-cork.  In three months, rack it into bottles and cork those.
If it is still hazy (unclarified), then there is too much pectin.
If a gallon jar is available, take out one pint and work in a
teaspoon of pectozyme.  Leave in a warm place for 4 days before
pouring it back into the jar.
<p>
Wine can be <u>fined</u> by using the store-bought variety or
by beating one-half of an egg white into one-half pint of wine,
which will clear 6 gals.  Alternatively, egg shells baked in a
slow oven until brittle, followed by crumbling them into a powder,
and then adding a pinch to a bottle will clear wine in a month.
<p>
<u>Bottling</u> is done in clean sterilized bottles. Fill by siphoning;
leave a 1 inch long air space in the neck so that a small gap
remains between the cork and the wine.  Corks should be dipped
and treated in 1 pint of boiling water with 1 teaspoon of glycerine added.
<p>
<u>Correction</u> and <u>blending</u> of the wine can be done with
dried bananas (1 lb./gal. wine).  Leave there for 4 days in the
first gallon.  The bananas can be re-used, but the racking should
be longer each time they are re-used.  Sometimes the wine
can be topped by blending with a wine of too acidic or too sweet quality.
<p>
Fortification of wine is done by adding brandy or gin before the
fermentation has quite finished.  If the fermentation has
finished, the added alcohol will not blend properly.
This is how imitation port and sherry are made.
<p>
Real sherry is made by deliberately allowing the air to
oxidize the wine;  a sherry yeast must be used as well.
Campden tablets are never used in this process.  Do not rack after
fermentation, but let the brew sit for 2 months, then rack and add
brandy, gin, vodka, or whiskey in 1 part to 15 parts brew.
Rack into an oak cask, tightly bunged, and leave as long as
possible.  Sweet sherry requires adding sugar in stages,
but not immediately after fermentation.
<p>
Port is made strong and sweet and red from adding elderberry,
blackberry, or black currant.  Add spirits during fermentation
to inhibit it, then rack and bottle.
<p>
Keeping records of the production process may help.

date of operation, the container, the specific gravity at the time,
and any remarks.

<p>
Wherever syrup of sugar is called for, boil 2 lb sugar in 1 pt water,
stirring consisently.<br>
Wherever acid is called for, juice 8 lemons or use 1 oz. of citrate
(must be slightly bitter).

<p>
For tannins, tea is usually added.

<table>
<caption>SACK</caption>
<tr><td>3 to 4 fennel roots
<tr><td>4 lb. honey
<tr><td>nutrient
<tr><td>3 to 4 sprays of rue
<tr><td>2 gals. water
<tr><td>general purpose yeast
</table>

<p>
Wash roots and leaves. Put them into gently simmering water for 45 min.
Strain the boiled material and add honey.  Boil two more hours,
skimming when necessary.  When the mixture is lukewarm, add nutrient
and yeast, and pour into fermentation jars.  Rack, mature, and bottle.

<table>
<caption>MEAD WINE</caption>
<tr><td>5 lb honey
<tr><td>2 oz dried hops
<tr><td>5 gal water
<tr><td>1 tbsp yeast
</table>
<p>
Dissolve the honey in water, add the hops, simmer for
1 hr.  Pour into a large container.
When lukewarm, then stir in the yeast.
Leave covered for 3 days and strain into
fermentation jar.  Rack, mature, and
bottle.

<table>
<caption>MEAD</caption>
<tr><td>5 lb honey
<tr><td>2 egg whites
<tr><td>&frac12; inch whole ginger
<tr><td>3 gal water
<tr><td>1 blade mace
<tr><td>3 cloves
<tr><td>1 tbsp yeast
</table>

<p>
Beat the egg whites, put into a large saucepan with water, honey,
mace, cinammon, clovers, ginger.  Stir frequently until it boils,
then simmer 1 hr.  When lukewarm, strain into a cask, and stir
in the yeast.  When the fermentation is done, bung tightly;
do not bottle the mixture until nine months later.

<table>
<caption>Another recipe</caption>
<tr><td>4 lb honey
<tr><td>1 gal water
<tr><td>1 orange
<tr><td>1 lemon
<tr><td>yeast and nutrient
</table>
<p>
Boil honey in water, pour into large container, cool
and add the fruit juice, nutrient and yeast.
After fermentation, rack, mature, and bottle.
Allow 12 months before drinking.

<h1>COWSLIP MEAD</h1>
For every gallon of water, add 2 lb honey and boil 45 min,
skimming occasionally.  Take 1 pt of the mixture, slice
into it a large lemon, and pour the rest into a large
container followed by 1 gallon of cowslip heads.
Stir well, cover, and set in a warm place for 24 h.
Stir in lemon liquor, 2 sprigs sweet briar
(optional), &frac14; oz yeast dissolved in a little honey.
Ferment for 4 days, strain into fermentation jars and cover.
Bottle when done.

<table>
<caption>DRY MEAD</caption>
<tr><td>3 lb white honey
<tr><td>juice and rind of 2 lemons
<tr><td>6 pt water
<tr><td>1 cup cold tea
<tr><td>2 tablets of yeast nutrient
<tr><td>(Maury?) yeast
</table>

<p>
Boil the honey in water for 1 hr, skim, and allow to
cool to lukewarm.  Add all other ingredients except
the lemon rind, and follow with yeast starter.
Put the must into a fermentation jar, drop
in the rind and allow to ferment in a warm room at even temperature.
Rack and bottle.

<h1>SWEET MEAD</h1>
Work up the same as dry mead, but use 4 and &frac12; lb
honey.  &frac12; lb of white sugar is added
as a thick syrup after about 10 days.

<table>
<caption>SPARKLING MEAD</caption>
<tr><td>4 lb honey
<tr><td>juice and rind of two lemons
<tr><td>6 pt water
<tr><td>1 cupful cold tea
<tr><td>2 tablets of yeast nutrient
<tr><td>champagne yeast
</table>

<p>
Made in the same fashion as dry mead until the
bottling stage.  Pour into champagne
bottles (this is absolutely necessary), prime with 1 tsp of sugar and a tiny
bit of yeast to start the fermentation in order to make gas.
Corks must be wired down. Care should be taken when re-opening.
12 month bottling is needed. Chill when serving.

<table>
<caption>METHEGLIN</caption>
<tr><td>4 lb honey
<tr><td>1 gal water
<tr><td>Maury yeast
<tr><td>yeast nutrient
<tr><td>acid or lemon juice
<tr><td>1 oz hops
<tr><td>&frac12; oz root ginger
<tr><td>2 cloves
<tr><td>&frac14; oz cinnamon bark, marjoram, balm, mace, etc.

<p>
Simmer herbs and spices in water for 30 min, pour on
to the honey.  Continue as for regular
mead by adding nutrient, acid, then yeast.
Ferment well covered for 1 day before straining into fermentation jar.
