<h1>Human Health Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>
[Ch 24 in Hodgson]
<p>
Definition: <dfn>Risk assessment</dfn> is systematic scientific characterization 
of potential adverse health effects following exposure to hazardous agents. Risk 
assessment activities designed to identify, describe, measure qualities and 
quantities from toxicology studies using animal models and doses/exposures not 
often encountered with humans.
<p>
Risk assessment results are then used in <dfn>risk management</dfn>. Risk 
management includes factors such as social importance, economic impacts 
involving risk reduction, legislative mandates. Making management information 
comprehensible to lawyers, politicians, judges, business and labor, 
environmentalists and community groups.
<h2>Risk Assessment Methods</h2>
<p>
Four broad but interrelated components:
<ol>
<li>hazard identification
<li>dose-response assessment
<li>exposure assessment
<li>risk characterization
</ol>
<h3>Hazard Identification</h3>
<p>
When a toxic effect is identified, its etiology (causality) must be determined.
Factors used in the quality of studies must be evaluated as follows:
<ol>
<li>validity of toxicity data
<li>weight-of-evidence summary of relationship between substance and toxic effects
<li>estimate of generalizability of data to exposed populations
</ol>
<p>
Structure-activity relationships (SARs) and short-term assays can suffice when
there is no in vivo toxicity data.  SARs assess relative toxicity of chemically
related substances, but have limitations.  Bacterial mutagen studies help to 
identify carcinogens and other tests can be used to assess neurotoxicity, 
developmental effects, and immunotoxicity with these in vitro studies providing
insight into mechanisms.
<p>
Animal studies involve two species, both sexes, and 50 subjects per dose group, 
with near-lifetime exposures.  Doses should be 90, 50, and 10-25% of maximum
tolerated dose.
<p>
Epidemiological studies involve
<ul>
<li>cross-sectional studies<br>
sampling done without regard to exposure or disease status, identifying risk
factors (exposure) and disease; they are not useful for cause-effect establishment
<li>cohort studies <br>
sampling is based on exposure status, targeting exposed and unexposed individuals
and monitoring development of diseases (also prospective studies)
<li>case-control studies <br>
sampling based on disease status: these are retrospective, with diseased
individuals matched to disease-free controls
</ul>
<h3>Exposure Assessment</h3>
<p>
This process identifies potential and completed exposure pathways resulting in
contact between agent and at-risk populations.  A demographic analysis of 
at-risk populations is done which includes magnitude, duration, and frequency
of exposure.  Exposure may be aggregate&mdash;single event added across all
media&mdash;or cumulative&mdash;multiple compounds sharing similar toxicity 
mechanism&mdash;or both.  Biomonitoring, model develop<sup></sup>ment, and computations
may be used as techniques to arrive at estimate of chemical dose (exposure).
<p>
For example, lifetime average daily dose (LADD) is a calculation for individuals
exposed at levels near middle of exposure distribution:

<p>
Blood and air sample monitoring and reduce extrapolation uncertainties.
Occupation exposure limits (OELs) are set to protect workers for a 40 year
working lifetime at 8 h/day, 5 days/week: OELs are given as time-weighted 
average concentration for 8 h day &amp; 40 h work week.

<h3>Dose Response &amp; Risk Characterization</h3>
<p>
Dose response is quantitative risk assessment which characterizes relationship
between chemical potency and incidence of adverse health effect.  These
characterizations involve LD50, LC50, ED50, no observed adverse effect
levels (NOAELs), margins of safety, therapeutic index.
<p>
A steep dose-response curve would indicate a homogeneous population response,
whereas a less steep or flat slope indicates greater distribution.
<h2>Noncancer Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>
Risk assessment identifies maximum subthreshold level where no adverse effect is
observed:  the NOAEL is highest dose level that does not produce a significant
elevated increase in the adverse response.  Biological and statistical criteria
establish significance and depend on dose levels tested.  Insufficient data is
often available for a NOAEL so a lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is
determined.  NOAEL is used to calculate <dfn>reference doses</dfn> <b>(RfD)</b> 
for chronic oral exposures and <dfn>reference concentrations</dfn> <b>(RfC)</b>
for chronic inhalation exposures (per EPA).  ATSDR, WHO and others use 
NOAEL to calculate <dfn>minimum risk levels</dfn> <b>(MRL)</b> and <dfn>acceptable
daily intakes</dfn> <b>(ADI)</b>.
<p>
EPA uses RfD as an estimate, uncertainty is order of magnitude.  RfD derivations
which are ADIs or MRLs, the NOAEL is divided by uncertainty factors (UF) per
EPA and ATSDR, and by modifying factors (MF) per the EPA.

<mspace width="1ex"></mspace></mrow><mrow><mtext>ATSDR</mtext></mrow></mstyle>
</math>
<p>
Any calculated RfD or RfC is based on a selected study and critical end point.
Numerous studies may show more than one toxic end point with many NOAELs to
choose from literature.  The MRL or RfD can be based on less serious effects
or no serious effects.  NOAEL would not be obtained from effects like these:
decreases in body weight &lt; 10%, induction of enzymes without pathological 
changes, organ weight changes without pathology, increased mortality over controls
that is not different significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and hyperplasia or
hypertrophy with or without changes in organ weight.

<h3>Default Uncertainty and Modifying Factors</h3>
<p>
Extrapolations using animal experimental data are difficult in risk assessment.
There is uncertainty about how to extrapolate
<ul>
<li>across species
<li>for most sensitive populations within species
<li>across duration
</ul>
<p>
The EPA and ATSDR automatically use an uncertainty factor of 10 (one order of
magnitude).  The value 10 is the approximated product of experiences showing
that toxicokinetics shows a 3-fold range of difference, and toxicodynamics
also shows the same 3-fold range.  A UF=10 also used across species from 
animals to humans.
<p>
EPA uses UF=10 when NOAEL derived from subchronic study instead of chronic study
to compute a RfD; ATSDR does not use this extrapolation but derives both chronic
and subchronic MRLs.  A UF=10 is used for RfD and MRL from LOAEL when NOAEL 
not available.  There are no RfD values for dermal exposure but when dermal
absorption data insufficient, EPA uses UF=10% to estimate bioavailability for
dermal absorption. MF values from 1 to 10 is used only by EPA to reflect
qualitative professional assessment of additional uncertainties in critical
study.
<p>
With inhalation routes of exposure, dosimetric adjustments are necessary and
can affect extrapolations of toxicity data of inhaled agents for human health
risk assessment.  Dosimentry modeling is used to determine RfC and depends on
physicochemical properties.  A dosimetric adjustment factor (DAF) reduces
uncertainty in extrapolation from 10 to 3.16.
<p>
Unless EPA can show different margins of safety, the 1996 Food Quality Protection
Act requires a safety factor of 10 be used where pesticides are involved to
protect infants and children.  Children are more suspectible to toxicants than
adults and have different dietary patterns.  Pharmacokinetics studies show that
drug elimination is slower in infants up to 6 months of age and so tissue levels
may accumulate more than in adults.  Quantitative differences in toxicity between
children and adults can sometimes be less than a factor of 2 or 3.

<h3>Derivation of Developmental Toxicant RfD</h3>
<p>
Developmental toxicity is about exposures during embryonic development.
Adverse effects include death, structural abnormalities, altered growth,
functional deficiencies.  Categories A, B, C and D is an assessment of the
evidence.  Ratio of minimum maternotoxic does to minimum teratogenic does, 
incidence of malformations, and shape of dose-response curve.  Uncertainty 
factors are utilized according to category:  Cat A = 1-400, Cat B = 1-300,
Cat C = 1-250 and Cat D = 1-100.  The RfD values are based on short duration
of exposure and not applicable to lifetime exposure.

<h3>Determination of RfD and RfC of Naphthalene with the NOAEL Approach</h3>
<p>
The napthalene inhalation RfC value is 0.003 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, one derived from
a chronic inhalation study in mice with exposures of 0, 10 and 30 ppm.  Mice
were exposed 5 days/week, 6 h/day.  A LOAEL = 10 ppm was identified.  Chronic
inflammation of nasal and lung epithelium was observe and found dose-related.
A LOAEL = 9.3 mg/m<sup>3</sup> was found by converting 10 ppm to mg/m<sup>3</sup>

then duration-adjusted levels computed assuming 6 h/d, 5 d/wk for 103 weeks.
A UF=3000 was used with factors being 10 for mice-to-human extrapolation, 
10 for intraspectific variation in humans, 10 for LOAEL instead of NOAEL,
and 3 for database deficiencies.
<p>
The oral RfD for naphthalene was 0.02 mg/kg/d based on a study.  Most sensitive
end point identified was decreased body weight.  Groups of Fischer 344 rats
were exposed to 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg for 5 d/wk for 13 wks; these
are duration-adjusted to 0, 17.9, 35.7, 71.4, 142.9 and 285.7 mg/kg/d.  The
NOAEL for <i>a</i> &gt; 10% decreased body weight is 71 mg/kg/d.  The UF=3000
for reasons given above.

<h3>Benchmark Dose Approach</h3>
<p>
A problem with NOAEL approach to estimating RfD and RfC values is that the 
NOAEL must be ond of the experimental doses tested.  Rest of dose-response 
is ignored once identified.
<p>
The Benchmark Dose (BMD) approach is developed by risk assessors as an alternative
to NOAEL to estimate RfD and RfC values.  It has no experimental design constraint
and incorporates sample size and shape of dose-response curve.  Can be used for
threshold and nonthreshold adverse effects as well as continuous and quantal 
data sets.  It requires dose-response to be modeled  and that lower confidence
bound for a dose at specified response level is calculated.  The dose is 
specified at the 1-10% response level, which corresponds to a dose associated 
with low level of risk such as 1-10%.
