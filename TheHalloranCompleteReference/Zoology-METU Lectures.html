		The reader should take care that this document is rather data and many
		changes in the zoological sciences have taken place. For example,
		the systematics of all kingdoms of living things were built on
		characters that included morphological, behaviorial, and physiological
		features. With the advent of molecular biology and the sequencing of
		many genomes of different species, along with bioinformatics, evolutionary
		biology has included data from these studies into the classification
		of animals. And probably to the objection of those who part with tradition
		with great difficulty, classification has been re-organized solely upon this
		data.

	<h1>Part I General Animal Biology</h1>

	<h2>Chap. 1 Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		meaning of zoology, science, scientific method. Specialized fields of science:
		natural history, botany, biology. Living vs. nonliving matter: form &amp;
		size, chemical composition, metabolism, irritability, reproduction.

	</p>
	<p>
		Animals vs. plants. Most animals generally capable of
		motion. Rarely do plants. Some appear intermediate. <i>Euglena</i> moves
		about and gathers food like an animal, but contains chlorophyll.
		In form &amp;
		structure for animals, the body is constant, organs internal, cells within
		delicate membranes bathed in saline-like medium. The plant body varies
		constantly, organs added externally, cells lined with rigid walls, and a
		NaCl-medium is toxic.

	</p>
	<h3>Historical background</h3>
	<p>
		Greeks made first contributions. Anaximander (611-547 B.C.)
		first proposes that living things emerged from mud. Xenophanes (6th C. B.C.)
		recognizes fossils as animal remains, and indicates that presence of marine
		forms on mountains indicates the sea was at one time there.

	</p>
	<p>
		Aristotle wrote <i>Historia animalium</i> of nine
		books (500 pages in a modern translation) which shows structure and habits of
		indiginous animals. He indicated some groupings of related animals but without
		a classification scheme. He followed chick embryo development, knew that drone
		bees develop by parthenogenesis, and that the young of sharks develop inside
		the mother. He also speculated on evolution.

	</p>
	<p>
		Among Romans Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23-79) produced his own <i>Natural
			History</i> which covered a variety of zoologically related topics.

	</p>
	<p>
		Works on natural history: Konrad Gesner (Swiss, 1516-1565) <i>Historia
			animalium</i>, patterned on Aristotle, but including illustrated work and
		many good figures. Guillaume Rondelet (French, 1507-1566) <i>De piscibus
			marinus</i> (1554) Mediterranean marine animals and first figure of dissected
		invertebrate. Georges, Comte de Buffon (French, 1707-1788) <i>Histoire
			naturelle</i>, a very comprehensive and famous work.

	</p>
	<h2>Chap. 2 The Frog As A Representative Animal</h2>
	<p>
		<i>Habits and external relations</i>. Live in water and
		most land areas (amphibious). Each kind has a particular set of surroundings
		(habitat) such as marshes, pools, streams. On land it jumps by hind legs when
		startled. Swimming in water is done by alternate hind leg extension and
		flexion. Food is live when consumed: insects and worms. Motionless animals
		and objects ignored; undesirable food rejected. Water is typical shelter
		against enemies, for moistening skin, and for ingestion of water (by skin). Mud
		is used to protect against freezing winters. Natural enemies are snakes,
		turtles, herons, raccoons, and man.

	</p>
	<p>
		<i>External features</i>. Head, trunk, and limbs are apparent.
		Soft smooth skin. Head has wide mouth. Behind the large spherical
		eyes is a flat eardrum (tympanic membrane). Eyes can be covered by large
		opaque upper eyelid and lesser lower eyelid. From a vent (anus) at the hind
		end, food wastes, liquid excetory waste and sex cells are discharged. Frogs
		show bilateral symmetry and can be considered to have medial, lateral,
		anterior, posterior, dorsal, ventral points of reference.

	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Mouth cavity</i>. The jaws form a wide mouth cavity
		which narrows into the pharynx, which connects to a gullet (esophagus).
		A flat tongue is attached anteriorly, and is notched posteriorly,
		flipping up from the back to catch its food. Taste buds are
		on the upper surface. A mucous coating
		permits a sure catch. Swallowing requires raising the mouth floor and
		depressing the eyeballs. Upper jaw has fine conical maxillary teeth, and the
		roof of the mouth also has vomerine teeth. Nostrils (internal nares) are found
		in the mouth cavity and external nares are also present. A glottis protects
		the entrance to the respiratory pathway; it closes during swallowing. A
		Eustachian tube connects the mouth cavity to the middle ear chamber behind the
		eardrum. Male frogs also have vocal sacs in the throat to obtain the croaking
		sounds.

	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Internal structure</i>.

	</p>
	<h1>Nature of Matter/Constituents of Living Material</h1>
	<p>
		Matter has atomic structure. Elements are indivisible units

	</p>
	<p>
		Electrons assume positions in atomic orbitals arranged in
		subshells arranged in shells. Electons have positions in
		probability density.

	</p>
	<p>
		Bonds can be ionic (electrovalent) or covalent. Water can form hydrogen bonds
		with other atoms. The O—H hydrogen bond in 1.77 Å, the H—O
		bond in water is 0.99 Å, so the O—O bond distance is 2.76 Å.

	</p>
	<p>
		Inorganic components of cells include water (function in solvent, metabolite,
		temperature stabilizer), salts, acids, and bases. Organic constituents are
		carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids. Note the terms primary,
		secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure were known in 1969. Miescher
		studying cell nuclei chemistry discovered nucleic acids in 1868; he found a
		phosphorus-rich substance he called nuclein.

	</p>
	<h1>Cells and Tissues</h1>
	<p>
		The <i>cell concept</i> or <i>cell principle</i>
		is that all living things are made up of cells. Their size ranges
		from 3 cm (hen's egg) in diameter, 3 feet in length (neurons).
		Most are microscopic between 10-100 µm. An RBC is 7.5 µm.

	</p>
	<p>
		First microscope matter of debate. Janssen brothers in
		Middleburg, Holland in 1590 made primitive microscope; they showed how lenses
		combine in tube to magnify objects. Leeuwenhoek played with lenses as a
		hobby; he reported first descriptions of protozoa and bacteria in 1674.
		Marcello Malpighi was prof. of medicine (U. Bologna) and showed in 1660
		capillary circulation in frog lung; studied also plant and silkworm anatomy.

	</p>
	<p>
		Robert Hooke was curator of instruments; published
		'Micrographia' in 1665 showing his microscopic work with cork; referred to word
		'cell' in his work, which means <i>hollow space</i>. Although several workers
		up to that time indicated the cellular nature of life, a botanist Schleiden
		announced in 1838 that all plant tissue is maded of cells, and a zoologist
		Schwann one year later said the same about animals.

	</p>
	<p>
		Cell parts include:

	</p>
	<p>
		Plasma membrane. Proof of its existence is that a barrier
		to the diffusion of the dye phenol red is found whether on the outside or
		injected inside.

	</p>
	<p>
		Cytoplasm. All material within the plasma membrane and
		outside the nuclear membrane. Outer portion (<i>ectoplasm</i>) near membrane
		surface more rigid (viscous) and lacking in granules; inner portion (<i>endoplasm</i>)
		less viscous and organelles here.

	</p>
	<p>
		Comparison of plant and animals cells: 1. Plant cells
		larger than animal cells as a rule. 2. Plant cells have a wall of rigid cells
		not found in animals. 3. Mature plant cells have large sap vacuole while all
		animal cell vacuoles are small. 4. Except in some protozoa, no chloroplasts or
		plastids in animal cells. 5. During cell division, animal cells form an
		equatorial plate which constricts around the cell midline; in plants, partition
		is by a nonconstricting cell plate.

	</p>
	<p>
		Viruses infect cells but are nonliving

	</p>
	<p>
		Flemming (1882) first outlined the <i>mitotic</i> stage of
		nuclear division, then the <i>cytokinetic</i> stage of cytoplasmic division.
		Spindle forms from fibers extending from centrioles.

	</p>
	<h2>Exceptions to the Cell Principle</h2>
	<p>
		Since cells defined as having cytoplasm, nucleus, and plasma membrane, what
		about blue-green algae and bacteria?

	</p>
	<p>
		Striated muscle fibers are multinucleate in that they do not
		form divsions using a plasma membrane. They are a <i>syncytium</i>.

	</p>
	<h2>Tissues</h2>
	<p>
		Five tissue types in the vertebrate.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Epithelial.
			Closely connected cells with little intercellular material between. Form body
			covering, line cavities, ducts and vessels in continuous layers. Types of this
			tissue: glandular (actively secreting substances); germinal (reproductive
			cells epithelial in nature). Shapes include cuboidal, squamous, columnar.
		</li>
		<li>Supporting. Types are
			<ol>
				<li>fibrous connective which includes ligaments, tendons, adipose tissue
				</li>
				<li>cartilage which include the hyaline cartilage,
				</li>
				<li>bone.
				</li>
			</ol>
			In (b) type the chondrocytes found in <i>lacunae</i> of matrix.
			Haversian systems typical of bone tissue.
		</li>
		<li>Muscle. Types are
			<ol>
				<li>smooth,
				</li>
				<li>striated
				</li>
				<li>cardiac.
				</li>
			</ol>
			Smooth muscle found in sheets at right angles;
			cells ovoid with single nucleus and organized myofibrils visible only by
			staining. Striated is found as multinucleate long fibers (a syncytium). All
			fibers bound by sarcolemma.
		</li>
		<li>Nervous. Irritable, excitable tissue.
		</li>
		<li>Vascular. The blood, a liquid tissue. Includes numerous cell types.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Organs and organ systems are the next greater levels of organization.

	</p>
	<h1>VERTEBRATES</h1>

	<h2>External Protection, Support, Movement</h2>
	<p>
		Invertebrates use an <i>exoskeleton</i>, vertebrates and endoskeleton.

	</p>
	<h3>Skin</h3>
	<p>
		Thin epidermis and thicker dermis. Epidermis is stratified epithelium with
		basal germinal layer. Melanocytes at the juncture between epidermis and dermis;
		they extend long processes and incorporate melanin into epidermal cells. Dermis
		largely fibrous and elastic connective tissue.
	</p>
	<p>
		Skin derivatives include hair, sebaceous glands (secrete <i>sebum</i> oil into
		hair follicle), smooth muscle which elevate hair during contraction
		(<i>arrector</i> <i>pili</i>). Sweat glands are <i>eccrine</i> found all over
		the body surface, or <i>apocrine</i> associated with hair follicles, these found
		primarily in armpits and regarded as scent glands. The eccrine produce a very
		watery sweat in humans all of the body, but in cats, dogs, and rodents, they are
		only in the foot pads. The skin serves a number of functions in protection,
		temperature regulation, excretion
	</p>
	<p>
		Frog skin has also a thin epidermis and thick dermis, but scales, hairs and
		sweat glands are absent. Numerous mucous glands are present however.

	</p>
	<h3>Skeleton--Comparison of Human and Frog</h3>
	<p>
		<i>Axial skeleton</i> is composed of skull, vertebral column, ribs (none in
		frog), and sternum. Appendicular skeleton is made up of the appendages and
		their girdles.

	</p>
	<h4>Skull</h4>
	<p>
		Primary function of skull is protection of brain; the <i>cranium</i>
		serves this function. Skull also protects organs of special sense: eyes, ears,
		nose, mouth. Human skull has 22 bones not counting the 6 ossicles. Bones
		joined by <i>sutures</i> in adult, with fontanelles present at birth to allow
		passage through the birth canal.

	</p>
	<h4>Vertebral Column &amp; Ribs</h4>
	<p>
		Vertebral column articulates with skull, support for soft parts of body.
		Girdles attached to it. 33 or 34 vertebrae in humans (varies at coccyx):
		subdivided into 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 fused sacral bones, and 4
		or 5 small, fused coccygeal bones. Coccyx is vestige of tail.
	</p>
	<p>
		Comparison of cat (quadruped) and human (biped) shows main arch in the vertebral
		column, which is used for building strength. Lumbar S curve in man is intended
		to increase strength in the anterior-posterior axis; weight is displaced
		dorsally and shocks absorbed better.
	</p>
	<p>
		In frog only 9 vertebrae, followed posteriorly by a long rodlike bone called the
		<i>urostyle</i>. All vertebrae similar in appearance except 1st (the atlas) and
		the 9th, which has extensive transverse processes for articulating with pelvic
		girdle. Tadpole has longer vertebral column with more vertebrae, but some
		resorbed in metamorphosis. Adult frog skeleton considered highly specialized
		because of this; frog adult has no ribs, but has sternum.
	</p>
	<p>
		In human 12 pairs of ribs, each articulating with thoracic vertebrae. 10
		superiormost ribs attach to sternum in front, lower two do not (called floating
		or false ribs). Sternum has manubrium, gladiolus or body, and xiphoid process
		from top to bottom.

	</p>
	<h4>Girdles and Appendages</h4>
	<p>
		The <i>pectoral girdle</i> forms the shoulder to attach forelimbs. In frog four
		bones forming the girdle are <i>scapula, suprascapula</i> (cartilage),
		<i>clavicle</i>, and <i>coracoid</i>. In humans, there is no suprascapula, and
		the coracoid is not a separate bone but reduced to a process (knob) attached to
		the scapula. The <i>glenoid fossa</i> on the lateral aspect is the point of
		articulation of the first limb bone.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <i>pelvic girdle</i> is made of 3 bones in humands and frog. The frog
		<i>ilium</i> is long and articulates with sacral vertebrae transverse processes.
		The <i>pubis</i> is in the anterior and ventral aspect, while the <i>ischium</i>
		is ventral and posterior to the pubis. In humans they fuse to form the
		<i>innominate bone</i> attached to the dorsal aspect of the sacrum and fused in
		front by the <i>symphysis pubis</i>. The three bones together form the cavity,
		<i>acetabulum</i>, for articulation of first hindlimb bone.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for the forelimb skeleton, the humerus is present in humans and frog, but in
		frog the radius and ulna are fused (radioulna) with the line of fusion
		noticeable. 8 small carpal bones arranged in two-by-four-bone rows in the human
		wrist, while only 6 carpals are in frog arraned in two rows. In humans the hand
		has 5 metacarpals and 3 phalanges in each finger, 2 in the thumb. In frog the
		thumb is vestigial with only a small metacarpal, the two outer digits have 3
		phalanges, the inner two only 2 phalanges.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hindlimb built on the same scheme. In human a femur articulates with the
		girdle, with tibia and fibula corresponding to radius and ulna, resp. The tibia
		and fibula are fused (tibiofibula) in frog. Humans have 7 tarsal (ankle) bones,
		5 metatarsals, and while the big toe has 2 phalanges, the other four toes have 3
		phalanges. Frogs have an elongated ankle with 2 rodlike tarsal, the other
		tarsals reduced in size, few in number; it also has 5 metatarsals, the 1st and
		2nd toe have two phalanges, the 3rd and 5th have three, and the 4th has four. A
		rudimentary sixth digit (<i>prehallux</i>) has two small bones.

	</p>
	<p>
		The primitive limb pattern is a five-digit limb.

	</p>
	<h3>Bone Growth</h3>
	<p>
		Living bone is a matrix of CaPO<sub>4</sub> and CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Lower
		vertebrates show mostly cartilaginous skeleton. Higher vertebrates start out as
		cartilaginous in embryos, proceed to ossification (this is <i>cartilage
			bone</i>). The facial, cranial and clavicle bones have no cartilaginous stage
		and are called <i>membrane bone</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ossification in long bones begins at centers in the middle and at both ends.
		Osteoblasts degrade cartilage and lay down bone. Increases in long bone length
		occur at end of bone in region called <i>epiphysis</i>. Growth here lasts to age
		20 in humans. A membranous layer (<i>periosteum</i>) is responsible for growth
		in bone thickness. Marrow serves vital role in circulatory system tissue
		production.

	</p>
	<h3>Joints</h3>
	<p>
		Evolved types include immovable (sutures of cranium). Of the movable are
		<i>ball-and-socket</i> (femur to pelvic girdle, humerus to pectoral girdle)
		which moves in all planes, <i>hinge</i> which moves in only one (human knee and
		elbow). At articulations is a special cartilage covering bones to minimize
		friction. A ligamentous capsule contains <i>synovial fluid</i>, similar to
		lymph, produced by cell in the <i>synovial membrane</i> in the joint capsule.
		The <i>bursae</i> are fluid-secreting sacs where tendons pass over a bony
		surface exerting pressure.

	</p>
	<h3>Muscles</h3>
	<p>
		Focus on striated (conscious control) muscle. Points of attachment are
		<i>origin,</i> which is the fixed portion during contraction, and the
		<i>insertion</i>, the part which moves a great deal during contraction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Easy to remove sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle in frog and study contraction.
		Once thought volume change occurred with muscle contraction when nerve pinched,
		but muscle place in fluid shows no up-and-down fluid movements.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nerve-muscle preparation can be attached to device to test contraction effect.
		Single twitch in frog muscle is 100 msec. Twitch defined in three phases: (1)
		<i>latent period</i> (10 msec) in which stimulus applied, a wave of changes in
		electric potential are seen, and the first indications of contraction; (2)
		<i>contraction period</i> (40 msec) when muscles show shortening; (3)
		<i>relaxation period</i> (50 msec) when muscles must return to relaxed state.
	</p>
	<p>
		In intact animal, contraction is not by single twitch but by a volley of
		impulses with increasing strength of contraction. Sustained contractions are
		called <i>complete tetanus</i>. This is largely because a muscle is composed of
		many fibers variously stimulated by nerve axons: while a single fiber will
		contract completely or not at all (<i>all-or-none</i>) when stimulated, it
		requires synchronous stimulation of all fibers to make the muscle contract at
		once, which does not usually happen.
	</p>
	<p>
		Muscle contraction depends upon ATP, formed from glycogen to lactate breakdown.
		Muscles also have reserve of phosphocreatine (in vertebrates) and
		phosphoarginine to provide ATP formation in intense exercise. At molecular level
		is a required interaction by myosin and actin. A. Szent-Gyorgyi placed a
		mixture of the proteins, which form an <i>actomyosin</i> complex, in
		K<sup>+</sup> and ATP solutions and observed contraction.
	</p>
	<p>
		EM work shows striated muscle composed of striated fibrils. The sarcomere is a
		particular unit of the syncytial muscle tissue shown below. Cross section shows
		<i>thick</i> and <i>thin</i> filaments; selective salt extraction removing
		myosin diminshes the A band, showing they are the thick filaments, while removal
		of actin affect the I band and they are therefore thin filaments.

	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="imagesZoologyHTML/sarcomere.gif" alt="illustrated sarcomere with A and I bands and H zone">
	</p>
	<p>
		During muscle contraction, thin filaments overlap with each other according to
		EM cross sections. Complete contraction involves the thick filaments touching
		the Z line. This confirm's the sliding filament theory put forth by H. E.
		Huxley. <i>Sarcoplasmic reticulum</i> extends a network of tubules parallel to
		the fibrils; transverse connections occur at H zone and Z line. Another system
		of fine tubules form from invaginations of sarcolemma at Z line (<i>T
			tubules</i>). Calcium is released and rapidly taken up by the SR and T tubules.

	</p>
	<h1>Digestion</h1>
	<p>
		Digestion is process of breaking down large complex molecules to smaller ones.
		Multicellular animals with only mouth have specialized cavity. Higher animals
		have tubular cavity or tract and a mouth and anus for effecient introduction and
		exit. Vertebrate tracts quite alike, and higher invertebrates show this
		feature.

	</p>
	<h2>Structures and Comparative features</h2>
	<p>
		In humans, tract is differentiated into mouth, pharnyx, esophagus, stomach,
		small intestine, large intestine. Salivary glands in mouth. Liver and pancreas
		important glands. Tract enclosed in <i>coelom</i> and held in place by
		<i>mesenteries</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tract cells specialized into layers: (1) <i>mucosa</i> is epithelial lining; (2)
		<i>submucosa</i> connective tissue, blood and lymph vessels; (3) <i>circular</i>
		muscle layer; (4) <i>longitudinal</i> muscle layer; (5) <i>serosa</i> in the
		peritoneum. Esophagus not in coelom and has no peritoneum surrounding it.
		Diagonal muscle fibers found in addition to the circular and longitudinal in the
		stomach. Chyme is moved by peristalsis (contraction of circular and
		longitudinal fibers contracting alternately in wave).

	</p>
	<h3>Mouth Cavity</h3>
	<p>
		In mouth, digestion begins with mechanical breakdown by <i>teeth</i>. Humans
		have 32 permanent in both jaws. Each side of one jaw: 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2
		premolars, 3 molars (3rd molars called wisdom teeth). First teeth (milk teeth)
		are 20 in number. Tooth constructed of crown (projecting from gum), neck
		(surrounded by gum), and root (into bone). Lower vertebrates (fish, amphibians,
		reptiles) have simple teeth, whereas in mammals they show the greatest diversity
		and development: herbivores have large grinding molars; carnivores large
		incisors (biting, flesh-tearing teeth). It is thought that tooth decay results
		from the modern lifestyle, in which a high sugar (sucrose-rich) diet has altered
		the bacterial flora in the oral cavity, since sucrose in such large amounts is
		not naturally occurring. Fluorine may fight this decay on two fronts: (1) it
		contributes to enamel hardness or resistivity to acid by forming CaF<sub>2</sub>
		and (2) fluorine is a natural inhibitor of enzymes necessary for bacterial
		growth.

	</p>
	<p>
		Tongue in humans serves to push food back into pharynx in addition to its
		functions in taste and control of vocal sounds (speech).

	</p>
	<p>
		In frog, tongue is used to catch food (unlike many mammals) and attached
		anteriorly for flipping over. Teeth are found only in upper jaw
		(<i>maxillary</i> teeth) and roof of mouth (<i>vomerine</i> teeth) and used for
		seizing and holding, not for chewing. Frog only has a primary (hard) palate and
		no secondary (soft) palate.

	</p>
	<p>
		Salivary glands located in mouth start chemical digestion processes. Humans
		have three glands in mouth cavity (submaxillary, sublingual, parotid glands).
		Saliva coats potentially dry food with moisture in preparation for swallowing.

	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Swallowing</i>. With water-dwellers (fish), water serves to deliver food an
		oxygen: it passes through the gill clefts and food travels a more direct course
		down the esophagus. When vertebrates developed lungs from the floor of the
		mouth cavity, it became necessary to develop system to prevent food from
		proceeding and potentially blocking air passageway. Food or water entering the
		pharynx triggers reflex nervous activity which brings the larynx forward and
		tips the epiglottis, opening esophagus. A rapid peristaltic pulse forces the
		bolus to the stomach.

	</p>
	<h3>Pharynx</h3>
	<p>
		Emerges from mouth behind soft palate. Besides mouth, pharynx connects to
		<i>internal nares</i> (from nasal cavity), two Eustachian tubes, glottis and
		esophagus. Tongue forces food into pharynx and reflex mechanisms close all
		openings but esophageal.

	</p>
	<p>
		In frog internal nares open directly into mouth since no soft palate. Lack of
		soft palate allows esophagus, glottis, and pharynx to be seen.

	</p>
	<h3>Esophagus</h3>
	<p>
		Muscular tube from pharynx to stomach. Peristalsis first seen. Cardiac
		sphincter maintains closed opening. Normally esophagus is collapsed structure.
	</p>
	<p>
		In frog esophagus relatively short and no boundary with stomach is evident.

	</p>
	<h3>Stomach</h3>
	<p>
		Anatomically distinguished by a <i>fundus</i>, <i>body</i>, and <i>pylorus</i>.
		Gastric mucosa composed of cells producing digestive enzymes, HCl, and mucus to
		protect mucosa from degradation.
	</p>
	<p>
		In frog, stomach is not bent as much as in humans.

	</p>
	<h3>Small Intestine</h3>
	<p>
		6 m in length in humans. Distinguished by 25 cm long <i>duodenum</i>, rest is
		<i>jejunum</i> (~3 m) and <i>ileum</i>. The jejunum is distinguished from the
		ileum by more numerous dramatic folds in the lining disappearing in the ileum.
		Duodenum is connected to the <i>common biliary tract</i> which is formed by the
		<i>bile duct</i> and <i>pancreatic duct</i> union. Villi are the folds of
		tissue which are a feature of the intestine. Length of intestine among mammals
		is shortest in carnivores (dog), longest in herbivores (rabbits), and of
		intermediate length in omnivores (humans), and compare amphibians below.
	</p>
	<p>
		Gut is supported by dorsal mesentery: this holds stomach and duodenum well in
		place, but gives more freedom of movement to the rest of intestine. Believed
		that a ventral mesentery at one time held the tract from mouth to anus, but
		gradually lost as gut increased in length. Gut is not adequately supported by
		dorsal mesentery in bipeds; in youth abdominal muscles hold it in, but with age
		the gut begins sagging, and a pot-belly ensues.
	</p>
	<p>
		Small intestine in amphibian relatively short compared to mammals, and has only
		a duodenum and ileum. The intestine in a tadpole is proportionally longer (it
		is a vegetable feeder) than in an adult (animal feeder).

	</p>
	<h3>Large Intestine</h3>
	<p>
		Small intestine connected to side wall of large intestine, controlled by
		ileocaecal sphincter, allowing a <i>caecum</i> (blind sac) to form.
		<i>Vermiform appendix</i> is attached. In herbivores, this sac is longer and
		functional, a site for bacterial digestion in the gut. Colon is about 1.5 m
		long; anatomically divided into ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid
		parts. <i>Rectum</i> is straight tube about 12-13 cm long.
	</p>
	<p>
		In frog the small intestine empties directly in without use of a caecum. At the
		end the large int. merges into a <i>cloaca</i> which itself empties via the
		cloacal opening or anus. Cloaca are not present in humans or placental mammals
		except in embryonic state.

	</p>
	<p>Function is absorption of water from chyme. Chyme passes
		through in 12-14 hours here. Large numbers of bacteria present and are part of
		normal flora.

	</p>
	<h3>Liver and Pancreas</h3>

	<p>Endodermally derived tissues. Liver produces bile, stored
		in gall bladder; function in fat emulsification. Bile composed of bilirubin
		and biliverdin, which contribute to stool color when mixed with chyme. Hepatic
		dysfunction related to bile changes marked by change in stool color.
		Gallstones occur as a result of changes in the solubility of cholesterol (kept
		dissolved by bile salts); these stones can produce blockage in the biliary
		duct, leading to jaundice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Liver also stores glucose, deaminates amino acids (produces urea). Liver stores
		vitamins A, D, and B<sub>12</sub>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pancreas serves dual function as endocrine and exocrine gland. Produces enzymes
		listed below.

	</p>
	<h2>Foods</h2>
	<p>
		Carbohydrates are the sugars and starches. Fats are utilized as sources of
		energy. Proteins give us animals essential amino acids (man and rat: Thr, Met,
		Val, Ile, Leu, Orn, Arg, His, Phe, Trp). Water: solvent, metabolite,
		homeothermic regulation. Inorganic salts and elements: Na, Cl, K, Mg, Ca, P, I,
		Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, Co (deficiencies in Ca, Fe, and I can occur).
	</p>
	<p>
		Vitamins essential. Nutritional deficiencies manifested as scurvy, beriberi,
		night blindness (xerophthalmia). Vitamin K in humans from gut bacteria. Vitamin
		A from colostrum in breast milk. Vitamin D is sterol derivative which covers
		wide class: D<sub>2</sub> (calciferol) produced by action of UV light on
		ergosterol and is necessary for Ca<sup>2+</sup> absorption in intestine.

	</p>
	<h2>Processes of Digestion</h2>
	<p>
		In humans it begins with oral cavity: salivary amylases (ptyalin) break the
		polysaccharides (starch) into maltose (glucose disaccharides). The amylase
		action continues during swallowing and for a brief period in the stomach.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the stomach: mechanical digestion continues as involuntary muscular
		contractions churn the food into liquid chyme. The chemical digestion begins
		with the enzyme <i>rennin</i>; activated by low pH, it digests milk protein
		<i>caseinogen</i>, converting it to whey and casein. The presence of Ca during
		this action cause curdling, permitting longer opportunity for action by
		<i>pepsin</i> in the stomach. Pepsin requires low pH; acts on short and long
		polypeptides. In addition to those two enzymes, a gastric <i>lipase</i> appears
		to hydrolyze fats into fatty acids and glycerol; these fats are typically the
		colloidal fats in milk and not those in tissues.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ingested fluids can pass stomach in a few minutes, while solid food can take 3-5
		hours to be emptied. Fats are digested more slowly here than other food types.
		Stomach emptying is by degrees: pyloric sphincter relaxes intermittently as
		chyme is spurted into small intestine. Parasympathetic fibers from vagus nerve
		control both stomach peristalsis and gastric secretions; sympathetic system can
		oppose this effect, prolonging digestion.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Vomiting</i>. Also called <b><i>regurgitation</i></b>. A safety feature of
		the body designed to eliminate ingested materials which are toxic. Considered
		reverse of swallowing. One moment before vomiting, a deep breath is taken as it
		hold diaphragm down. The abdominal muscles contract convulsively, pressing the
		stomach against the taut diaphragm; the cardiac sphincter relaxes; the contents
		are forced through the esophagus. Like swallowing, this is a reflex once begun
		fully committed to completion.
	</p>
	<p>
		In small intestine thorough digestion results since the pancreas secretes
		amylase, lipase, ribo- and deoxyribonucleases, and proteases (trypsin,
		chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidases). Trypsinogen is activated by
		<i>enterokinase</i>, while chymotrypsinogen is activated by trypsin. Intestinal
		epithelial cells may secrete additional proteases (aminopeptidases,
		tripeptidases and dipeptidases) and sugar-splitting enzymes (sucrase, lactase,
		and maltase). Digestion can proceed for 5-10 hours in the intestine.
	</p>
	<p>
		Churning movements in small intestine are of two types: <i>segmental</i> and
		<i>pendular</i>. Both are confined to mixing the food within a loop of the gut
		rather than moving it along.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the frog digestive system everything else works in the same way except that
		frogs have no salivary glands, and hence there is no salivary amylase to begin
		digestion of starch.

	</p>
	<h3>Regulation of Digestion</h3>
	<p>
		Salivary secretion built strictly on nervous reflex in which taste buds and
		end-organs in oral cavity are sensitive to presence of food and chewing action;
		these activate motor pathways in the salivary glands. As for gastric juice
		secretion described below, there is also conscious control affecting salivation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Gastric juices are controlled by nervous and endocrine systems; 400-800 ml
		produced with avg. meal. Flow begins with meal inception and ends when stomach
		emptied. Pavlov's work with dogs in which food is never permitted to reach
		stomach shows that when dog eats 25% of normal gastric secretion obtained.
		Shown to be under control of nerves innervating stomach. In another experiment
		Pavlov adds food directly to excised stomach without dog knowing food is
		introduced: he discovers 75% of normal level secreted, showing food contact
		with stomach lining is hormonally controlled since denervated stomach shows same
		response. 3rd experiment is by intermingling the blood of two dogs: one eats
		but the other does not, yet both dogs secrete gastric juice. Hormone called
		<i>gastrin</i>. Another hormone (<i>enterogastrone</i>) is secreted from
		duodenal mucosal epithelium to signal that gastric juice production and the
		muscular churning in the stomach are to be inhibited.
	</p>
	<p>
		Secretion of bile and pancreatic enzymes are also under hormonal control.
		Acidic chyme apparently stimulates cells in duodenum. These cells secrete
		<i>prosecretin</i> into chyme; this is converted by HCl present to
		<i>secretin</i>, which enters blood and stimulates the pancreatic enzymes to
		secrete. <i>Cholecystokinin</i> also secreted by duodenal cells into blood;
		hormone activates contractions of smooth muscle in gall bladder to deliver bile.

	</p>
	<h3>Absorption and Utilization</h3>
	<p>
		Epithelial cells arranged in <i>villi</i> to maximize surface area of intestine
		for absorption. Cells themselves show <i>microvilli</i> on lumenal surface to
		enhance even greater the absorption surface. Each villus accompanied by blood
		capillaries and central lymph vessel (<i>lacteal</i>). Much absorption by
		active transport apparently. Larger molecules absorbed more quickly than
		smaller. Only one-third of fat digested to glycerol and fatty acids; fat
		globules pinocytically absorbed and taken into lacteals. Vit. A, D, and K trace
		same path as fats.
	</p>
	<p>
		Liver controls blood glucose to 0.15%; fructose and galactose converted in
		liver. Special cells in liver process fats for storage in adipose tissue.
		Amino acids used in protein building and maintenance, but excess must be
		deaminated in liver which forms urea and organic acids.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basal metabolic rate is amount of energy necessary to maintain vital functions
		at rest and during postprandial state. 1 Calorie (large calorie) is heat
		necessary to raise 1 kg water from 15° to 16° C at P=1 atm. Average
		sedentary individual uses 3000 Calories, of which 1500-1800 maintain vital
		function. Carbohydrates yield 4 Cal per gram, fats 9 Cal per gram. Avg person
		gets 2/3 of energy from carbohydrate burning.

	</p>
	<h1>Respiration</h1>
	<p>
		Respiration may be defined as the system designed to permit gas exchange in the
		organism or between cell and its environment. In unicellular, just simple
		diffusion. In multicellular efficient systems bring specialized tissues to make
		sure all cells get efficient gas exchange.

	</p>
	<h2>Comparison of Systems</h2>

	<h3>Frog</h3>
	<p>
		<i>External nares</i> (nostrils) near nose tip lead into small nasal cavities,
		which connect to the mouth cavity by <i>internal nares</i>. Posterior to tongue
		in the pharynx is a slit which is the glottis which leads to the larynx (a
		cartilaginous box with membranous floor held in place between bony <i>thyroid
			processes</i> of the <i>hyoid cartilage</i>). Posterior to openings in the
		larynx is a short passage to the lungs.
	</p>
	<p>
		The lungs are covered by a peritoneum (<i>pleura</i>) and are in the body cavity
		with other organs, unlike in higher vertebrates which possess a diaphragm and
		separate the lungs from this cavity. Histologically lungs contain numerous
		small chambers called <i>air sacs</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The frog's skin is also an organ of respiration, and is only method of obtaining
		oxygen when frog buries itself in mud at a lake or pond bottom in the winter.
		Frog may also obtain oxygen via skin when out of water.
	</p>
	<p>
		Vocal sounds really occur in amphibians as first vertebrates to show it (some
		fish excepted). Vocal cords identifiable as elastic bands stretched across
		larynx. In addition male frogs have vocal sacs connected to the pharynx sides;
		these serve as resonators when distended.

	</p>
	<h3>Human</h3>
	<p>
		Air enters by nostrils but also by mouth. From the nostrils into the
		proportionally larger nasal cavities (relative to frog), bony turbinates direct
		air flow so it can be filtered by long hairs and sticky mucus, and also to warm
		and humidify it. It passes to the pharynx, through the glottis and into the
		larynx (the Adam's apple, larger in men than women). An epiglottis is present
		as a tissue flap to cover it during swallowing. Air proceeds through the
		cartilaginous trachea to the bronchi, which lead into the lungs.
	</p>
	<p>
		The function unit is the <i>alveolus</i>, which are clusters of cup-shaped
		cavities functioning like air sacs in frog. Lipoprotein surfactant lines the
		alveoli to reduce surface tensions that would otherwise collapse the alveoli.
		Human lung tissue also has extensive elastic connective tissue within it to bind
		the parts together.
	</p>
	<p>
		The lungs are enclosed by ribs, which are connected by intercostal muscles
		serving in the breathing function. A muscular diaphragm is situated inferiorly.
		Lungs are encased in <i>pleural</i> cavities while a pericardial cavity encloses
		the heart. Pleural membranes are two layers: a <i>visceral pleura</i> attached
		to the lung, and a <i>parietal pleura</i> forming the outer layer. Lymph is
		secreted between them to suspend the lungs in a relatively frictionless system
		during breathing motions. Lungs filled with air at all times; will collapse when
		removed because of constant tension in brochioles.

	</p>
	<h2>Breathing and Its Regulation</h2>
	<p>
		In-breathing is <i>inspiration</i>; out-breathing is <i>expiration</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Frog breathing is by a 'forced-pump' mechanism in which two
		movements are observed: (1) frequent up-and-down movements of the mouth;
		(2) less frequent body wall contraction followed by quick expansion
		of body wall is seen. In the first movement, the glottis is closed
		and nares open, and air enters and leaves the very vascularized pharyngeal
		chamber, where gas exchange likely occurs. In the second, air is forced
		from the lungs, out of the glottis, in which some reaches to the outside;
		the body wall expands and the tip of the lower jaw pressed against
		the upper to close the nares; subsequent
		elevation of the mouth forces air through the glottis into the lungs.

	</p>
	<p>
		In humans breathing is rather by a 'suction-pump'
		mechanism. No barriers to the passageways are even formed during breathing as
		in frog. All passageways are structurally reinforced to prevent collapse as
		well which is quite important. Any change in volume by expansion results in
		negative pressure buildup as the tubes leading to the aveoli cannot collapse or
		expand. When the diaphragm pulls on the elatic tissue of the lung, air rushes
		in. (This can be approximated by the rubber balloon, or lung, in a glass jar
		with tubes leading out of the jar connecting the balloon. The bottom of the
		jar has a rubber membrane, or diaphragm, which can be pulled: the balloon will
		expand.) The intercostal muscles participate by contracting and causing the
		ribs to rise and turn outward, which expands the chest cavity. If air is
		placed with pleural space say by trauma which involves puncture, the lungs will
		deflate (<i>pneumothorax</i>). <i>Atelectasis</i> is mere collapse of one lung
		or one of its lobes (can be by disease).

	</p>
	<p>Breathing rate is usu. 18 per min. Severing of either the
		phrenic nerve leading to diaphragm and cervical nerves leading to the
		intercostal muscles stops all breathing movements, since both intercostals and
		diaphragm are essential for breathing. All nervous control involved in
		breathing movements comes from respiratory center in medulla. Continuously
		transmitted motor impulses sent down the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and
		down the cervical sympathetics to the intercostal muscles stimulate their
		contraction, causing thoracic avity expansion and concomitant negative pressure
		in the lung spaces, leading to inspiration as indicated above in the forced
		pump mechanism. Visceral afferents from the alveoli and lung tissue sense
		expansion within the tissue, increase their impulse frequency to the medullary
		respiratory center which in turn is inhibitory to the motor impulse frequency
		to breathing muscles. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax as a
		consequence of reduced motor stimulation; the relaxation produces expiration
		as a result of elastic recoil produced by connective tissue in the lung and
		pleurae. (Some books seem to show that the vagus (IX cranial) innervates the
		diaphragm. Anatomy books do not appear to show vagus nerve innervation of the
		diaphragm.).

	</p>
	<p>Changes in blood CO<sub>2</sub>
		are monitored and sent to the medullary center; stimulation of this
		chemoreceptor will stimulate the inhalation motor impulse system to increase
		the breathing rate. Proof that CO<sub>2</sub>
		was the regulator of breathing was by experiments with animals breathing varied
		partial pressures of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>.
		Breathing in newborns only occurs when CO<sub>2</sub> begins
		to build up; if breathing does not start right away, giving
		the infant air with 10% CO<sub>2</sub> helps to start breathing.

	</p>
	<p>It is generally observed that labored breathing can result
		from below-normal atmospheric O<sub>2</sub>
		tensions unaccompanied by blood CO<sub>2</sub> changes. This can be explained
		by the stimulation of another chemoreceptor which is sensitive to the presence
		of lactic acid. Autonomic afferents connected to the carotid body
		chemoreceptors and passing to the medulla through the IX cranial (vagus) nerve
		sense increases in lactic acid buildup, and one of their effects is stimulation
		of breathing rate.

	</p>
	<p>Lung <i>tidal volume</i> is about 500 ml. Forced
		inspiration should draw 2.5 liters (<i>complemental air</i>). Forceful
		expiration beyond normally expired air produces 1 liter called <i>supplemental
			air</i>. A <i>residual volume</i> of 1.2 liters remains beyond the forced
		expiration which can never be exhaled. The sum of the tidal volume,
		complemental air, and supplemental air (4 liters) is called the <i>vital capacity</i>.
		Total lung capacity is 5.2 liters.

	</p>
	<p>Atmospheric air (dry) has a 20.96% O<sub>2</sub>,
		0.04% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 79% N<sub>2</sub>
		(by volume). Exhaled air (dry) shows 16.02% O<sub>2</sub>,
		4.38% CO<sub>2</sub>, and no change in
		the N<sub>2</sub> component. Hence the
		oxygen has been reduced by nearly 25%, while the CO<sub>2</sub>
		content has increased over 100 times.

	</p>
	<p>Mammalian lungs are adapted for sea level atmospheres. With
		a 150 mm Hg tension of O<sub>2</sub>,
		blood can be saturated. At 9000 ft, atmospheric pressure is only 550 mm Hg
		instead of 760; at 14,000 ft only 450 mm Hg; and at 18,000 ft, O<sub>2</sub>
		is half the pressure than at sea level,
		low enough to induce fainting. Adaptations to high altitudes in humans
		necessarily require an increase in the number of RBCs and an increase in
		hemoglobin in each cell.

	</p>
	<p>Hemoglobin is O<sub>2</sub>
		carrier; some myoglobin stores O<sub>2</sub>
		as well. Acidosis is blood pH change. Blood pH can affect O<sub>2</sub>
		binding to Hb.

	</p>
	<p><i>External respiration</i> may be characterized as
		the exchange of gases in tissues designed for the purpose of gas exchange so
		that the whole body benefits. <i>Internal respiration</i> may be
		defined as the exchange of gases between the gas-carrying tissues and the cells
		that require this exchange.

	</p>
	<p>At high atmospheric pressures, the dissolved (inert) gases
		have a higher tension in the blood than is normal. If a person suddenly moves
		into an environment with a considerably lower total atmospheric pressure, these
		gases will want to expand quickly. They can do this in the blood, forming
		pockets of gas instead of remaining dissolved. This apparently causes great
		pain, forcing the person into a bending position (the 'bends'), and it can kill
		the person.

	</p>
	<h1>Circulation</h1>

	<p>Snails and insects demonstrate <i>open</i> system in which
		blood (<i>hemolymph</i>) bathes cells directly, intermingles. <i>Closed</i>
		system is one in which blood cells bounded by vessels and capillaries.

	</p>
	<p>Progressive evolution among the vertebrates clearly
		demonstrated in comparing embryonic and adult stages of circ. system
		development. The avian and mammalian systems are clearly divergent from the
		reptilian system, which advances from the amphibian, and traces back to the
		very primitive chordate amphioxus.

	</p>
	<p>In amphioxus, vessels conducting blood are well formed. The
		'heart' is really a ventrally located pulsating artery. The blood proceeds
		into a <i>ventral aorta</i> which then bifurcates through multiple
		segmented loops of arteries surrounding the pharynx and into the gills, and
		this feature clearly is homologous to the pharyngeal arches in the higher
		vertebrates; these arteries converge into the <i>dorsal aorta</i> which
		delivers the oxygenated blood to the tissues. A hepatic portal system is in
		evidence.

	</p>
	<p>In the cartilaginous fishes (shark), the blood vessel
		pattern continues. Here a true heart is in evidence with two chambers arranged
		in a series to replace the posterior part of the ventral aorta in amphioxus.
		Blood passing through a two-chambered heart is unoxygenated. An expanded
		venous sac (the <i>sinus venosus</i>) empties into a single <i>atrium</i>,
		which then empties into a single <i>ventricle</i>. From the ventricle, blood
		is pumped anteriorly into the ventral aorta. The anterior length of the
		ventral aorta branches into aortic loops in the pharnynx which enter into the
		gills. The blood then collects from the gills into a dorsal aorta for
		distribution. A hepatic portal vein collects blood coming from the intestine.

	</p>
	<p>With lung development for land animals, the lung fishes,
		amphibians, and most reptiles develop a three-chambered heart; the frog heart
		is a good model (discusssed below). The fishes and primitive chordates show a
		single circuit of blood transport, but with lung development, a double circuit
		emerges: a <i>systemic</i> and a <i>pulmonary</i> circuit. The heart becomes
		a double pump, imperfectly formed in frog, more complete in reptiles, and fully
		complete in mammals and birds. With frogs, two atria and a single ventricle is
		evident. The ventricle begins to divide into two in reptiles, not fully
		separated; a complete septum is in birds and mammals. The major difference
		between bird and mammals is that the right branch of the 4th aortic arch is
		retained in birds, the left branch in mammals.

	</p>
	<p>The human heart passes through several stages during
		embryonic development in which the circulatory system resembles the systems in
		all the lower vertebrates: it is a simple tubular structure which develops two
		atria and a ventricle, which later partitions slowly then completely.

	</p>
	<h2>Human Heart</h2>

	<p>Systemic blood returns via <i>caval veins</i> (<i>superior</i>
		and <i>inferior vena cavae</i>) to enter the right atrium (cf. <i>sinus</i>
		<i>venosus</i> in lower animals). Similarly blood fills the left atrium from
		the pulmonary veins returning from the lungs. The atria are induced to
		contract and fill their respective ventricles, which soon contract after
		filling to pump blood either into the pulmonary artery leading to the lungs
		(from the right) or into the aorta leading to the body.

	</p>
	<p><b>Beating</b>. Heart beats are not generated externally by
		a remote nervous system center in animals, since hearts can be removed from
		animals, placed in a salt + glucose solution, and observed to beat for hours,
		even days. Hearts in human embryos begin to pulsate well before nervous system
		development leads to their innervation.

	</p>
	<p>The beat of the human heart is controlled by a <i>sino-atrial
			node</i> (SA node), a specialized excitable tissue which is a remnant of the
		sinus venosus of the lower forms. It is a major part of the embryonic heart.
		In the adult it becomes located on the posterio-medial aspect of the right
		atrium. Another specialized excitable muscle mass is the <i>atrio-ventricular
			node</i> (AV node), connecting the atria to the ventricles electrically.

	</p>
	<p>The SA node should be considered excitable muscle tissue:
		its membrane is such that it is slightly permeable to Na<sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt">+</span></sup> ion, which leaks slowly into the cells
		of the node. This causes electrical changes across the plasma membranes,
		eventually leading to a voltage difference which causes the Na<sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt">+</span></sup> to rush in all at once in a
		depolarization event (an <i>action potential</i>). This movement of
		ions across membranes (movement of electrical charge is the definition of an
		electrical current) is transmitted from the cells of the node to excitable
		neuron-like fibers extending and branching into the muscular walls of the
		atria. The action potential is used to cause polarization changes in the
		muscle tissue, associated with the release of Ca<sup><span style="font-size:
8.0pt">2+</span></sup> to permit myosin-actin interaction (Ca<sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2+</span></sup> binds troponin), and the ratcheting
		causes muscle contraction as in skeletal muscle. Special fibers also lead to
		the AV node: this node of muscle tissue serves to delay action potential
		transmission to the ventricles. After a brief delay, the impulse is sent down
		bundles of fibers (the bundle of His) and then branches out to terminal fibers
		(Purkinje fibers) to stimulate contraction of the ventricle walls. The delay
		is well-timed to permit ventricular filling by atrial contraction before
		ventricular contraction occurs.

	</p>
	<p>Comparison of muscle wall thickness shows atrial walls are
		thinnest, while the ventricles are thicker with the left ventricle wall the
		thickest. This is quite logical given the varying pumping forces (energies)
		necessary for each of these parts. The flaps of the valves between the atria (<i>tricuspid</i>
		between right atrium and its ventricle; <i>bicuspid</i> or <i>mitral</i>
		between left atrium and ventricle) are supported by <i>chordae tendineae</i>,
		necessary anchors to prevent flap reversal during ventricular contraction which
		would force blood back into the atria. The semilunar valves in both the
		pulmonary artery and aorta are three half-moon shaped pockets which prevent
		back flow of blood as its cups fill. Heart chamber contraction is called <i>systole</i>,
		with relaxation called <i>diastole</i>. The heart sounds, S1 and S2, are
		associated with closure of the atrioventricular and semilunar valves, resp.
		Valve damage from some diseases (syphilis, rheumatic fever) leads to altered
		sounds (murmurs).

	</p>
	<p>Human heart beats 72 per min (avg.) pumping 50 ml of blood.
		Total blood volume is between 4.5 and 6 L (heart pumps this volume twice per
		minute during exercise). Work done by a single heart in 24 hr can raise 70 kg
		human 500 m. Heart is size of clenched fist; located in a peritoneal-like
		cavity which is the <i>pericardium</i>. An external tissue layer covers the
		heart called the <i>epicardium</i>, and between this epicardium and the
		pericardial lining is a lymph secreted by the pericardial lining which reduces
		friction generated by beating action.

	</p>
	<p><i>Coronary arteries</i> provide blood to the walls
		of the heart muscle itself; emerge from the aorta in right and left branches
		just above the semilunar valves. 25% (another source says 7-10%) of blood
		emerging from heart goes to coronary circulation.

	</p>
	<h2>Frog Heart</h2>

	<p>Located in a pericardial sac in the body's anterior. A
		single, very thick-walled <i>ventricle</i> is immediately apparent with two
		thin-walled <i>atria</i> anterior to the ventricle. A <i>conus arteriosus</i>
		is a thick tube leading anteriorly from the ventricle. The <i>sinus venosus</i>
		is dorsal relative to the heart in the region where two <i>precaval</i> and one
		<i>postcaval</i> veins meet. The sinus venosus is the SA node for the heart:
		its contraction pumps blood into the right atrium. A <i>sino-atrial valve</i>
		is between the right atrium and sinus to prevent blood backflow.

	</p>
	<p>Both atria contract to force blood into the single
		ventricle, with valves between the atria and ventricle. Some mixing of the
		blood is inevitable, but the geometry and spongy construction of the ventricle
		prevent thorough mixing. The relatively less oxygenated blood from the right
		atrium is nearest to the conus arteriosus; the initial phases of ventricular
		contraction force this blood into the conus and into a wedge-like <i>spiral</i>
		<i>valve</i>, which leads to the <i>pulmo</i>-<i>cutaneous arches</i>
		directing blood to the lungs and skin. Continuation to the next phase of
		ventricular contraction, the blood in the middle of the ventricle enters
		another opening in the conus which leads to the <i>systemic arches</i>;
		this is mixed blood directed to the posterior region of the body. Last to
		enter the conus is the highly oxygenated blood obtained from the left atrium,
		which enters the <i>carotid arches</i> leading to the head. Three
		semilunar valve prevent backflow from the conus, and a similar valve is at the
		vessel leading to the pulmo-cutaneous arches.

	</p>
	<h2>Blood Vessels</h2>

	<p><i>Arteries</i> conduct blood from the heart to the
		capillaries, <i>veins</i> conduct blood from the capillaries to the heart. <i>Capillaries</i>
		are sites of exchange of gases and metabolites. William Harvey first to
		discover function of veins and arteries; Marcello Malpighi identified
		capillaries 33 years later.

	</p>
	<p>Arteries composed of three well-organized epithelial
		layers. <i>Tunica adventitia</i> is outermost; composed of connective
		tissue, elastic tissue, scattered longitudinally arranged smooth muscle. <i>Tunica</i>
		<i>media</i> composed of more dense, circularly arranged smooth muscle with
		elastic connective tissue alternating in layers with it; the tunica media
		accounts for the difference in wall thickness between veins and arteries, as
		the muscle plays a role in directing blood flow in arteries unnecessary in
		veins. <i>Tunica intima</i> is a single layer of epithelium called <i>endothelium</i>.
		An internal elastic membrane is associated with the outside of the endothelium
		in arteries to give extra strength to this vessel type. Tiny vessels and
		nerves also can be found in arterial walls which control the smooth muscle in
		these walls. Because of the forces it must withstand, the aorta is composed of
		elastic and connective tissue while arterioles are usually covered only by
		smooth muscle.

	</p>
	<p>Veins have the same three layers, but the middle layer is
		not as thick. In addition, valves are present at intervals to prevent blood
		backflow.

	</p>
	<p>Lymph vessels are similar to veins in construction but even
		thinner, with more numerous valves.

	</p>
	<p>Capillaries are formed by a single layer of flattened cells
		continuous as endothelium. Capillary diameter can be less than the RBC
		diameter, causing alterations in the static shape of the RBC. In humans total
		length of capillaries are about 100,000 km.

	</p>
	<h3>Blood Pressure and Flow; Heart and Vessel Nervous Regulation</h3>

	<p>Clear differences in pressure observed when artery severed
		as compared to a vein. Pulse is manifestation of elasticity of arterial wall
		in which wave force propagated down the arterial wall. It is felt in certain
		regions since the artery is closest to the skin. Pressure is reduced in the
		blood as a result of friction generated by branching and bifurcation into
		narrower channels. Blood velocity is greatest in the aorta (occurring in waves
		with beating of heart), decreases to a continuous unpulsed flow in capillaries,
		and gradually increases with venous return but unpulsed. Manometric reading
		from sphymomanometer involves cutting of arterial flow, listening for pulsing
		sounds as blood swishes through artery at a pressure between diastole and
		systole. Typical readings: arterial 120/80; capillary 30/10; venous 10/0.
		Blood pressure function of blood volume, blood vessel size (vasoconstrictive or
		distended), and inotropic forces from heart. Increased inotropism in the heart
		is a result of stretching the cardiac muscle because of greater coronary flow:
		the forces of contraction become greater.

	</p>
	<p>The chronal beating is generated intrinsically by the SA
		node in most animal hearts. But the SA node rate can be influenced externally
		by nerves leading from the medullary <i>cardiac center</i> via the
		spinal and cranial nerves which lead to the SA node and serve to increase or
		decrease the rate through these stimulations of the node. The cervical
		sympathetics emerging from the control of the medulla accelerate the heart;
		the vagus nerve is the cranial nerve containing the parasympathetic fibers
		which slow the heart rate. The heart rate is also controlled by baroreceptors in
		the cartoid arteries, which stimulate the cardiac receptor to slow the heart
		beat in hypertension that may result after exercise has stopped.

	</p>
	<p>Nerves from the medullary <i>vasomotor center</i>
		also direct responses in the blood vessel smooth muscle. Hormones like
		epinephrine induce smooth muscle in arteries to constrict except for those in
		skeletal muscle, which are induced to dilate; hence skeletal muscle gets the
		lion's share of blood.

	</p>
	<h2>Lymphatic System</h2>

	<p>Blood entering the capillary bed from arterial side has 40
		mm Hg pressure, and exits from the bed into the venous side with 18 mm Hg
		pressure. The pressure difference forces fluid (not cells or large complexes
		of blood protein) into the interstices of the bed (lymph) which tends to
		accumulate. Some recovery of this fluid on venous side back into the blood is
		a result of osmotic pressure of the blood proteins, but the net fluid
		accumulation is directed toward nascent lymph capillaries in the bed, which
		join to form larger vessels. In humans these vessels ultimately collect into
		the <i>thoracic duct</i> joining into the blood at the <i>left jugular</i>
		and <i>subclavian</i> veins; the head and right arm are drained by another
		separate <i>right lymphatic duct</i> entering the right side
		juncture of subclavian and jugular veins. Lymph flow is rather passive
		occurring as a result of voluntary and involuntary muscular contractions.
		Abnormal accumulation of lymph results in <i>edema</i> (edematous swelling),
		which can occur because of hypertension, changes in blood protein affecting
		osmotic pressure, or lymph circulatory occlussion.

	</p>
	<p>Lymph passes through <i>nodes</i> containing immune and
		phagocytic cells. Most every indication of problems in the body pass into the
		lymph where they can be detected in the immune cells of the node.

	</p>
	<p>The spleen is an organ in frog and human which apparently
		serves the purpose of (1) being a reservoir of white and red blood cells: it
		can contract and deliver corpuscles to the blood; (2) it is lymphoid in nature
		and filters the blood directly; (3) it is a site for lymphocyte production and
		regulation.

	</p>
	<p>The frog lymphatics are not so ordered in terms of vessels
		as in human. <i>Lymph spaces</i> exist in which forms canals or
		connections with each other and flow freely back and forth. Lymph accumulates
		into four 'hearts' which pump the lymph into the venous circulation. Two
		anterior lymph hearts are behind and lateral to the 3rd vertebrate transverse
		processes, and two posterior lymph hearts are lateral to the tip of the
		urostyle.

	</p>
	<h2>Important Blood Vessels</h2>

	<h3>Human</h3>

	<p>Among the important arteries: the <i>aorta</i> emerges from
		left ventricle and has 3 branches: (1) the <i>innominate</i>, (2) <i>left common</i>
		<i>carotid</i>, (3) <i>left subclavian</i>. The innominate divides into
		the <i>right common carotid</i> and <i>right subclavian</i>.
		The subclavian provide to the arms, the carotids to the head. The aorta
		descends (moves posteriorly) to branch into visceral arteries: <i>coeliac</i>,
		supplying stomach, spleen, and liver; <i>superior mesenteric</i>,
		supplying small intestine and ascending colon; <i>inferior mesenteric</i>,
		supplying descending colon and rectum; and <i>renal</i> supplying the kidney.
		The aorta branches in the pelvic region into <i>common iliac</i>
		arteries, which supply the pelvic area and lower limbs. <i>Pulmonary arteries</i>
		lead from the right ventricle to the lung capillaries.

	</p>
	<p>The <i>superior vena cava</i> (precava)
		collects venous blood from the head and shoulders, formed by union of two <i>innominate</i>
		<i>veins</i>. The <i>jugulars</i> from the head and <i>subclavians</i> from
		the arms empty into the innominate. The <i>inferior vena cava</i>
		(postcava) forms from the <i>common iliac</i> veins which drain the
		lower part of the body. Prominent <i>renal</i> and <i>hepatic</i> veins empty
		into this large vessel as well.

	</p>
	<h3>Frog</h3>

	<p>Blood emerges from ventricle into conus arteriosus, then
		divides into two branches which will branch at segments into right and left
		pairs of <i>aortic arches</i>. The most anterior pair is the <i>carotid</i>
		<i>arches</i>, which divide into external and internal carotid arteries
		supplying the head. A posterior branch is the <i>pulmo</i>-<i>cutaneous</i>
		arch which divides into the <i>pulmonary artery</i> to the lung and <i>cutaneous</i>
		<i>artery</i> to the skin. A middle branch is the <i>systemic arches</i>
		which bend dorsally and posteriorly, joining to form the <i>dorsal aorta</i>.
		<i>Subclavians</i> branch from the systemic arches to supply the forelimbs.
		The <i>coeliaco</i>-<i>mesenteric</i> artery also branch from the systemic arch
		just anterior to forming the dorsal aorta and supply the digestive organs. The
		aorta branches to <i>urogenital arteries</i> which supply the kidney and
		gonads. And posterior to the branch is a bifurcation to the <i>common iliac</i>
		arteries, which branch into <i>sciatic</i> and <i>femoral</i> arteries.

	</p>
	<p>Precaval veins bring blood from the anterior end of the
		animal, formed by jugular, innominate, and subclavian veins. Postcaval veins
		arise from the union of several renal veins and from hepatic veins. Blood from
		the frog's hind legs does not return to the heart directly as in humans, but
		passes either through the kidneys or liver. The <i>sciatic</i> and <i>femoral</i>
		<i>veins</i> return blood from the hind limbs. The femoral vein branches into
		a <i>pelvic vein</i> and <i>iliac vein</i>. The iliac vein then
		unites with the sciactic to form the <i>renal portal vein</i>.
		The two pelvic veins unite to form a <i>ventral abdominal vein</i>
		which passes into the liver. Veins from the intestine form a <i>hepatic portal</i>
		<i>vein</i>.

	</p>
	<p>All vertebrates have an hepatic portal venous system, and
		all but adult mammals have a renal portal vein system. The ventral abdominal
		vein has been modified and now only the postcaval vein collects blood from the
		hind limbs.

	</p>
	<h2>Aortic Arches in Vertebrates</h2>

	<p>In addition to the changes in the heart, the greatest manifestation
		of evolutionary progression has to be the changes in the uses of the <b>aortic</b>
		<b>arches</b>.

	</p>
	<p>In the development of all vertebrate embryos is seen <b><i>six
				pairs</i></b> of aortic arches, in which the ventral aorta leading from the
		heart is connected to the dorsal aorta by these branching arches. The
		ancestral vertebrate is assumed to have had this simple arrangement. In the
		shark adult, the posterior-most <i>five</i> arches persist (the most anterior
		arch becomes something else), while in adult bony fishes, the posterior-most <i>four</i>
		arches persist. These arches become the vascular beds for the gills in
		respiration of the fishes.

	</p>
	<p>With terrestrial vertebrates, the 1st, 2nd, and 5th arches
		(number 1-6 is anterior to posterior) disappear. The 3rd pair forms the
		carotid arteries, the 6th pair the pulmonary arteries. In the amphibians and
		reptiles, the 4th pair of arches form the systemic arches leading to the dorsal
		aorta. In birds, the right branch of the 4th arch forms the dorsal aorta
		alone, while the left branch of the 4th forms the dorsal aorta in mammals
		(descending aorta in humans). The other branch of the 4th arch becomes the
		subclavian in birds and mammals.

	</p>
	<p>Embryonic development of the human heart is such that a
		connection forms between the pulmonary artery and the aorta called the <i>ductus</i>
		<i>arteriosus</i>. This acts as a shunt to prevent blood from going to the
		nonfunctioning lungs. At birth, a flap closes this connection, and the
		connection constricts in normal cases (abnormal cases result in 'blue baby')

	</p>
	<h2>Blood</h2>

	<h3>Functions</h3>

	<p>(1) Food transport: sugars, amino acids, fatty acids,
		glycerol; (2) Oxygen transport; (3) Waste transport (CO<sub>2</sub>, urea); (4) Hormone conduction.

	</p>
	<p>Also involved in metabolic regulation namely via its ability
		to conduct hormones. Temperature regulation by its ability to direct blood
		flow to various parts of the body. Also provides the watery sweat to sweat
		glands via its extensive capillaries (infused when thermosensory receptors in
		skin activated by heat) to elicit evaporative cooling. Another function is the
		regulation of cellular osmolarity and homeostasis in cellular solute balance.

	</p>
	<p>Blood offers protection by a clotting mechanism. Serum is
		plasma without fibrinogen. Clot forms from fibrin being laid down. Phagocytic
		cells actively attack foreign material.

	</p>
	<p>Immunological aspects many and beyond the scope of this
		course.

	</p>
	<h3>Features</h3>

	<p>Composed of <i>plasma</i> and the <i>formed elements</i>
		(cells). 45% of blood volume is cellular, 55% plasma.

	</p>
	<p>Of the formed elements include the <i>erythrocytes</i>
		(RBCs). In mammals, biconcave discoid cells, anucleate. 2 million per second
		are made in marrow of ribs and red marrow area at ends of long bones. Liver
		and spleen cull the numbers of RBCs at same rate. Life is ~120 d. Men have
		more 5.4 million per ml, women at 4.8 million per ml; as high as 7.5 to 8
		million per ml at high altitudes. Kidney controls rate of cellular production
		by <b><i>erythropoietin</i></b>. Hemoglobin carries O<sub>2</sub> in cell.

	</p>
	<p>In many invertebrates, hemoglobin or another carrier such as
		<i>hemocyanin</i> is prepared soluble in the plasma. Fetal hemoglobin in
		placental mammals binds O<sub>2</sub>
		better than adult hemoglobin. The iron in hemoglobin freed from destroyed
		cells is either added to the biliary tract secretions or reutilized.

	</p>
	<p>Leukocytes (WBCs) occur between 5000 and 9000 per ml, very
		high if the animal is infected. Many cell types divided into two broad
		classes: <i>granular</i> and <i>agranular</i>.

	</p>
	<p>The agranular cells include <b><i>lymphocytes</i></b> and <b><i>monocytes</i></b>.
		The lymphocytes have large rounded nuclei with thin cytoplasm. Monocytes are
		larger with a greater proportion of cytoplasm.

	</p>
	<p>The granular cells, which have multiply lobed nuclei, are
		named as to how they stain using a standard staining system. The colorless
		granules belong to <b><i>neutrophils</i></b>. The <b><i>acidophil</i></b> or <b><i>eosinophil</i></b>
		binds to the eosin dye, and is normally not very abundant except in parasitic
		worm infections. The <b><i>basophil</i></b> takes up basic stains and has an
		S-shaped nucleus. The granular cells, particular the neutrophils, can leave
		the circulation to enter infected tissues. The granules in these cells have
		been show to be numerous hydrolytic enzyme aggregates.

	</p>
	<p>Platelets are anucleate cells formed from pinching off of
		the membrane of a large marrow cells called a <b><i>megakaryocyte</i></b>.
		There are 250,000 per ml in blood.

	</p>
	<p>RBCs in the nonmammalian vertebrates are generally much
		larger, retain their nuclei, and are oval in shape. This is true of frog and
		chicken. WBCs are the same, but a cell called a <i>heterophil</i> is
		boat-shaped or spindle-shaped and the equivalent of the neutrophil. Platelets
		are not found in nonmammalian vertebrates, but rather nucleated, spindle-shaped
		<b><i>thrombocytes</i></b> have that function.

	</p>
	<p>The composition of plasma: sugar (glucose); fats; amino
		acids; gases (N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>
		dissolved but most on Hb); hormones; waste products (urea). Among the proteins
		(7% of plasma weight) are <i>albumins</i>, <i>globulins</i>, and <i>fibrinogen</i>.

	</p>
	<h1>Excretion</h1>

	<p><i>Excretion</i> the process whereby <i>cell</i> eliminates
		was from within it. Multicellular animals have tissues and organs devoted to
		handling this process. Sweat gland secretion similar to dilute urine in
		composition. Liver processes much of body waste and sends it via biliary
		tract. Colon is site to remove excess Ca and Fe, removed during <i>defecation</i>.
		Feces largely undigested material and bacteria however, very little
		cell-generated body waste. Kidneys serve as the primary excretory organ for
		this reason.

	</p>
	<p>Experimental facts: (1) hepatectomized dogs showed that the
		amino acids in the blood increased and no urea was formed; (2) injection of
		amino acids into portal vein shows an increase in the urea coming from the
		venous side of the liver; (3) (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
		circulated through the liver is transformed into urea; (4) amino acids
		added to liver pulp (extract) results in liberation of ammonia.

	</p>
	<h3>Frog Urinary System</h3>

	<p>Dark red, elongated, and flattened structures lying dorsal
		to peritoneum and posterior in the body mark the <b><i>kidneys</i></b>.
		Ventral to the kidneys are long, narrow, yellowish bodies which are the adrenal
		glands.

	</p>
	<p>On the posterior lateral margin of the kidneys is a duct,
		the <i>opisthonephric duct</i>, which run back to the <i>cloaca</i>.
		Urine moves into the cloaca, where it can accumulate and back up into a sac,
		the <i>urinary bladder</i>, ventral to the cloaca. Sphincter muscles in
		the anus control the defecatory process, and when relaxed, contractions in the
		bladder force the urine out.

	</p>
	<p>The <b><i>testes</i></b> of the male frog are attached to
		the kidneys by a mesentery, the <i>mesorchium</i>. The <i>vasa efferentia</i>
		are ducts in this mesentery which connect the kidney with the testes. The
		testes contain <i>seminiferous tubules</i> in which the spermatocytes
		develop before passing into the vasa efferentia. The sperm then must travel
		the same duct as urine does to get to the outside. For this reason the two
		systems in male vertebrate are called the <b><i>urogenital system</i></b>.
		Eggs in the female frog are not carried in any part of the urinary tract but by
		special ducts. Blood to the kidneys comes by urogenital arteries and by a
		renal portal venous system.

	</p>
	<h3>Human Urinary System</h3>

	<p>As in frogs, human kidneys are dark-red, but bean-shaped and
		8-9 cm long. Located on either side of mid-dorsal line inferior to the stomach
		position. Only one surface is covered with peritoneum as the kidneys lie
		outside the coelom. Supplied by renal arteries with blood. A lengthwise cut
		of the kidney reveals two layers: an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The
		medulla show cone-shaped <i>renal pyramids</i> projecting into cup-like
		cavities of the renal <i>pelvis</i>, the <i>calyxes</i>. A <i>ureter</i> leads
		from the organs to a urinary bladder, and from the bladder is tubular
		epithelium conveying urine to the outside.

	</p>
	<h2>Kidney Histology and Urine Formation</h2>

	<p>Mammalian kidneys are composed of significant tubular
		epithelium. In the cortical region: tubules fairly coiled, but straighten as
		the move toward the medulla. <i>Renal</i> or <i>Malpighian corpuscle</i>,
		now <i>nephron</i> is the term describing the functional urine-producing unit
		of the kidney, with 1 million nephrons in each human kidney.

	</p>
	<p>Blood enters via an <i>afferent arteriole</i> into a
		ball or tuft of capillaries, the <i>glomerulus</i>, surrounded by a double wall
		of cells called the <i>renal</i> (<i>Bowman's</i>) <i>capsule</i>. Blood
		leaves the glomerulus via a much narrower bore on the <i>efferent arteriole</i>.
		Emanating from the capsule at one point is a connecting tubule, the <i>proximal</i>
		<i>convoluted tubule.</i>

	</p>
	<p>In the frog, the vasa efferentia from the testes connect
		also to this capsule, and so the sperm enter the capsule. Instead of a
		proximal convoluted tubule leading from the capsule, a <i>renal tubule</i>
		is a coiled structure which proceeds directly to the opisthonephric duct.

	</p>
	<p>In mammals however the coiled proximal convoluted tubule
		straightens to form a long <i>loop of Henle</i> which passes deep
		into the medulla and then returns back to the cortex, where it begins to coil
		again as the <i>distal convoluted tubule</i>. The efferent
		arteriole from the glomeruls extends capillaries which follow the entire length
		of the tubules through the proximal tubule, down the loop of Henle, and on up
		to the distal convoluted tubule and into venioles which pass into larger veins
		leading from the kidney.

	</p>
	<h2>Kidney Function</h2>

	<p>Three stages identified in urine formation.

	</p>
	<p><b><i>Filtration</i></b>. The difference in the bore of the
		afferent and efferent arterioles going to and from the glomerulus produces a
		large pressure drop in the glomerular capillaries. As a consequence, virtually
		everything but cellular elements and large protein and some fluid retained by
		osmotic pressure of those elements passes into the surrounding capsule and this
		lymph-like material is a <i>glomerular filtrate</i> (its composition
		analyzed by A. N. Richards, U. Penn.). High heart beat rates causing generally
		greater blood pressures lead to greater filtrate volumes. The filtration
		barrier is made of a glomerular basement membrane of a fibrous network of
		collagen which has a high degree of negatively charged functional groups; the
		pore size of this net is about 4-4.2 nm. Blood proteins which have a
		significant net negative charge themselves (e.g., albumin) but are nonetheless
		smaller than the pore diameter will nonetheless be retained within the
		glomerular capillary net since the electric field forces are sufficiently great
		to repel passage through the pore. Kidneys filter 75-150 L per 24 hr period
		from glomerulus, but only 1-1.5 L urine produced from that.

	</p>
	<p>The glomerulus is physically located near to the distal
		convoluted tubule (where it joins the loop of Henle), and there are a grouping
		of special cells called the <i>macula densa</i> which sit adjacent to
		the tubule and to the glomerulus. These cells are produce and secrete the
		hormone <b><i>renin</i></b> which is an enzyme causing the conversion of <i>angiotensinogen</i>
		(produced by liver and secreted to the blood) to an exceedingly powerful
		vasoconstrictor, <i>angiontensin II</i> (the renin is a protease cleaving
		angiotensinogen to produce the small peptide angiotensin II). Angiotensin II
		also induces production and release of the aldosterone hormones from the
		adrenal cortex. The release of renin by the cells of the macula densa is
		dependent upon (i) glomerular 'stretch' caused by increases in blood pressure;
		(ii) tubular osmolarity; and (iii) adrenergic stimulation, viz., release of
		epinephrine into the blood. Unfortunately, the damage sustained by glomerular
		capillaries because of too high blood pressures is aggravated when renin is
		released to increase the pressure even more.

	</p>
	<p>(Countering the action of the angiotensins are certain
		prostaglandins, viz. PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGI<sub>2</sub>, which are
		vasodilating in their action.)

	</p>
	<p>
		<b><i>Resorption and Tubular Secretion</i></b>. Occurs
		primarily in proximal convoluted tubules. All of the glucose and most of water
		resorbed (roughly two-thirds of the glomerular filtrate). There is an active
		secretion of H<sup>+</sup>, which has the effect of reclaiming the presence of
		HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>�</sup>. The secretion of H<sup>+</sup> in the PCT will
		depend is proportional to the P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>of the blood
		and is inversely proportional to
		[K<sup>+</sup>]. Both Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are actively
		resorbed, and the absorption of glucose, amino acids, and P<sub>i</sub> is
		coupled to the Na<sup>+</sup> absorption mechanism. Urea and uric acid and
		phosphates also resorbed to small extent, but creatinine is not resorbed at
		all. In the straightened, distal part of the PCT, organic acids (incl. uric
		acid) and drugs are secreted.

	</p>
	<p>In the loop of Henle, 15% of the original filtrate volume is
		resorbed, and about 25% of the NaCl present is also resorbed. This difference
		in NaCl/filtrate volume means that a hypotonic fluid will be delivered to the
		DCT. Also resorbed in the loop is Ca<sup>2+</sup> to some extent; this
		resorption is dependent upon the presence of parathyroid hormone
		(parathormone), in which the hormone affect the ability of the thick cells in
		the cortical region of the ascending loop to resorb Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while the
		medullary portion of the ascending loop is under no such regulation, absorbing
		Ca<sup>2+</sup> based on electrical difference between the tubule and the
		interstitial osmolarity of the medulla.

	</p>
	<p>The diagram notes that the loop has a thin portion and a
		thick portion. In the thin portion, both NaCl and H<sub>2</sub>O are resorbed
		passively based on the balance of osmolarity between the interstices and the
		tubular composition. In the thickened portion of the loop however, NaCl is
		resorbed actively and the cells (and cellular junctions) are impermeable to
		water. This makes the interstices hypertonic relative to the tubule.

	</p>
	<p>In the DCT, which is impermeable to water as well, NaCl
		resorption continues by active transport. Here K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>
		secretion are still evident. The action of parathormone here is involved with
		regulating any Ca<sup>2+</sup> resorption.

	</p>
	<p>In the frog, the renal arteries supply the glomeruli with
		their blood, but the tubules are supplied by the renal portal vein. Tying off
		the renal artery of the frog does not stop urine production, which can only
		mean that a tubular secretion process is in effect. If the dye phenol red is
		injected into several frogs' renal circulation and then some animals are killed
		at intervals, the ones killed shortly after injection show dye near the tubules
		next to the blood capillaries. Those killed later show dye at the center of
		the cells. And those killed even later show dye near the parts of cell close
		to the tubule. Hence molecules are brought from one end of tubule epithelium
		to the other in an energy-driven process.

	</p>
	<p>The kidney has the vital job of monitoring the balance of
		fluid and electrolyte in the body through its control of these balances in the
		blood. It removes harmful molecules from the body, but maintains the proper
		level of glucose and ions and pH. Naturally alteration of kidney function will
		lead to death as imbalances occur. This can occur by bacterial infections
		(nephritis) and by crystallization of relatively insoluble salts (calcium phosphate,
		uric acid).

	<p>Vasopressin (ADH) secreted by the pituitary regulates the
		water re-uptake in the kidney's tubular cells. Without it, severe amounts of
		water are lost (20-30 L per day instead of 1-1.5 L) in a condition called <i>diabetes</i>
		<i>insipidus</i>.

	</p>
	<h2>Vertebrate Kidney Development</h2>

	<p><i>Nephrogenous tissue</i> in the vertebrate embryo
		forms lateral to the somites as a strip of tissue. In the development of the
		cyclostomes, fishes, and amphibians, a <b><i>pronephros</i></b> begins to
		elaborate in the anteriormost portion of this tissue, forming segmentally
		arranged tubules (nephrons) which have ciliated funnels opening into the
		coelom. Connecting these tubules is the <i>pronephric duct</i> which
		then grows back to the cloaca. This kidney persists in the hagfish adult.

	</p>
	<p>In the fish and amphibians, however, the strip of tissue
		posterior to the pronephros develops tubules as well which make connections
		with the pronephric duct. The tubules are not segmentally arranged and only
		the more anterior tubules in this section form ciliated funnels. The tubules
		begins to form a capsule around capillaries forming a glomerus. Eventually all
		of the embryonic mesoderm is used to form the <i>opisthonephric kidney</i>
		in the fishes and amphibians. In the adult, the ciliated funnel openings have
		disappeared, along with degeneration of the pronephros. The opisthonephric
		duct is not distinguished from the pronephric duct. A urinary bladder forms
		from the cloaca in amphibians. The cloaca is lost in bony fishes, which have
		separate ducts for each system.

	</p>
	<p>In amniotes, the <i>metanephric kidney</i> develops from the
		very posterior portion of the nephrogenic mesoderm. Reptiles and birds show a
		very short stage in which a pronephric tubules and a pronephric duct forms. <i>Mesonephric</i>
		<i>tubules</i> develop from the midregion and empty into a mesonephric duct.
		At about hatching time, the mesonephros degenerates and a metanephric kidney
		develops with a new and separate duct, the <i>metanephric duct</i>. The
		mesonephric duct degenerates in females, but becomes the <i>vas deferens</i>
		in males.

	</p>
	<p>Functional pronephric tubules do not occur in mammalian
		embryonic development, or they rarely occur. Rather cells migrate from the
		nephrogenous tissue to form a rod which becomes hollow (the mesonephric duct)
		and connects with the cloaca. The mesonephric tubules then form and join the
		duct. A bud develops later from the mesonephric duct near the cloacal
		connection, then grows anteriorly extending a tube toward the posterior
		nephrogenous tissue. This nephrogenous tissue expands as the tube approaches;
		the tube induces a tubule formation in the metanephric kidney. This tube
		becomes the metanephric duct or <i>ureter</i>, expanding into the region which
		will become the renal pelvis. Male mammals retain the mesonephric duct as a
		vas deferens as in birds and reptiles.

	</p>
	<p>There are debates about whether the embryonic development of
		the kidney reflects evolutionary changes as shown by the three phases in the
		higher vertebrates. Some researchers consider the kidney as a <i>holonephros</i>
		instead of 3 different forms; an experimental fact supporting this is that
		presumptive mesonephros-forming mesoderm transplanted into the anterior of the
		pronephric tubule primordium will differentiate into pronephric tubules.
		Presumptive metaphric mesoderm transplanted into the midregion becomes
		mesonephric tubules.

	</p>
	<h2>Osmotic Regulation</h2>

	<p>The first vertebrates were likely freshwater-dwelling
		animals. Their cells were likely hypertonic to the environment, and they
		probably absorbed a net volume of water. The glomerulus and capsule is seen to
		form early in vertebrates, and its presence is considered an adaptation to
		eliminate excess water. Tubular cells likely acquired the ability to resorb
		the necessary solutes simultaneously. In the gills of freshwater fish are special
		cells which actively absorb salt from the environment to restore lost
		electrolytes.

	</p>
	<p>With movement of fish to marine environments, the external
		environment became hypertonic, as marine bony fish have an osmolarity one-half
		the osmolarity of sea water. Marine fish have very few glomeruli in order to
		maximize water retention. They also have active transport in cells in the
		gills to remove salt.

	</p>
	<p>Marine cartilaginous fish (sharks, rays) have another novel
		solution to the high salt seawater. In addition to a blood electrolyte
		concentration similar to marine teleosts, they also have a higher (2%) urea
		concentration. One segment of the renal tubule absorbs urea from the
		glomerular filtrate to maintain this concentration, and total osmolarity is
		slightly above sea water. They have numerous glomeruli as the freshwater forms
		and excrete large amounts of dilute urine.

	</p>
	<p>Sea birds which drink sea water can do so because of
		salt-secreting glands in their bills.

	</p>
	<p>As for nitrogen wastes, water-dwelling forms tend to excrete
		ammonia, which although toxic when concentrated, never gets concentrated in
		animals as it excretes in the gills; the kidney serves no role in excretion
		here but in osmotic regulation. Marine fishes excrete some urea in addition to
		large amounts of ammonia. Terrestrial forms do not have the luxury of much
		water and so ammonia buildup is unacceptable, explaining why they convert to
		the relatively nontoxic urea or uric acid. Birds, snakes, and lizards excrete
		uric acid as crystals in a pasty urine. Excreting as uric acid does not
		require a precious amount of water as does urea. 40% of a tadpole's nitrogen
		waste is excreted as ammonia, while in the frog 80% is as urea.

	</p>
	<h1>Reproduction &amp; Cell Division</h1>

	<h2>Evolution of Reproductive System</h2>

	<p>Asexual reproduction is typically limited to the more
		primitive, namely unicellular, organsims. The genome is copied in its
		entirety, the copy separated from the original and a partition (new cell
		membrane) made to form daughter cells. In many cases, the mother cell is divided
		equally (<i>fission</i>) or unequally (<i>budding</i>). These processes occur
		in multicellular forms as they reproduce asexually: fission in the flatworm,
		and budding in freshwater hydra.

	</p>
	<p>Sexual reproduction is a feature introducing variability in
		the genome of an individual and hence in the population. Organisms undergo a
		diploid-to-haploid change in some cells which become specialized (gametes) for
		the purpose of uniting quickly to form diploid organisms. Sexual reproduction
		very evident in even lower forms. In <i>Chlamydomonas</i> individual cells can
		fuse to form a zygote; its cells are equal in size, called <i>isogametes</i>,
		the process called <i>isogamy</i>. For gametes unequal in size, they are <i>anisogametes</i>.
		In the plasmodial protozoa, morphologically distinct gametes appear, a motile
		�sperm� cell, and a large immotile �egg;� these are <i>heterogametes</i>.
		These are true of the gametes of hydra to humans.

	</p>
	<h2>Care of Young</h2>

	<p>In vertebrates, 3 ways the fertilized cell is usually cared
		for until full or partial maturity. In the case of most fishes, amphibia, many
		reptiles, and all birds, it is from eggs, and these are <i>oviparous</i>
		animals. Some fish and reptiles (snakes) retain the eggs in their bodies until
		they hatch into an immature state that is relatively advanced in development;
		these are <i>ovoviviparous</i> animals. Other animals have little yolk in the
		egg and develop in a special structure of the female (typically) until in an
		advanced form of development; these are viviparous.

	</p>
	<p>With movement to land, a fluid environment (amnion) and
		plent of yolk had to be placed in the egg. Water-dwelling embryos might
		quickly develop to a stage where they could feed on organic matter diffusing
		through the water. With an increase in size, embryo also had greater oxygen
		demand (hence allantois in egg).

	</p>
	<h2>Mitosis in Animal Cells</h2>

	<p>Mitosis is considered to be equivalent to the process of a
		single cell to be divided into two daughter cells with each getting an exact
		copy of the cell's genome. But it is really nuclear division. It is estimated
		humans have 10<sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt">14</span></sup> cells as
		adults.

	</p>
	<p>Chromosomes are the DNA-composed structures coding for
		organismal development of structure and function. Multi-cellular organisms
		undergoing sexual reproduction show homologous pairs in which one set of the
		pair is obtained from one animal and the other from another (parents). The
		cells are said to be diploid. With development, most cells become somatic,
		having no role in combining their nuclei with other cells, as would gametes.
		Production of haploid cells requires cell division and reorganization called
		meiosis. Mitosis in animals cells is marked by several phases.

	</p>
	<h3>Interphase</h3>

	<p>The longest phase: marked by G<sub>1</sub>, S, G<sub>2</sub>,
		technically not part of mitosis. Proteins necessary to form the spindle are
		synthesized.

	</p>
	<h3>Prophase</h3>

	<p>Chromosomal condensation begins as DNA coiling and
		supercoiling begins. Chromosomes are connected by a centromere or kinetochore,
		making the connection to be chromatids. <i>Centrioles</i> outside the nuclear
		membrane divide and migrate to opposite poles. They extend radiating fibers
		which form the <i>aster</i>, each fibril being an <i>aster ray</i>.
		Fine filaments between the forming asters assemble to form the <i>spindle</i>,
		their filaments being spindle fibers. It should be noted that there is no
		centriole and hence no aster in the higher plants or some invertebrates; it
		appears that the spindle appears in the cytoplasm extending from pole to pole.
		The nuclear envelope is seen to break down. Chromosomes are seen to fall along
		an <i>equatorial plate</i>.

	</p>
	<h3>Metaphase</h3>

	<p>Some of the spindle fibers appear attached to centromeres (<i>chromosomal</i>
		<i>fibers</i>) while other run from pole to pole (<i>continuous fibers</i>).
		Once chromosomes are arranged on the spindle axis, their centromeres begin to
		divide (metaphase).

	</p>
	<h3>Anaphase</h3>

	<p>With centromere division, chromatids separate and the
		daughter chromosomes move to opposite poles. It is known that centromeres and
		spindle fibers are essential for this process of chromosomal movement.

	</p>
	<h3>Telophase</h3>

	<p>Furrow to divide cells begins to appear. Chromosomes
		continue to move to poles, become less dense. Nuclear envelope forms, and
		centrioles divide once more in preparation for next division. Spindle fibers
		and astral rays break down. Cytokinesis (dividing the cell) involves elements
		in the cell cortex contracting in a ring splitting the two daughter nuclei in a
		process which may likewise involve the spindle.

	</p>
	<h3>Other apsects</h3>

	<p>As plant cells have no centrioles and cannot form asters,
		the process must be different. At metaphase, only the centromeres of the
		chromosomes line up on the equatorial plate. Cytokinesis does not occur in
		synchrony with mitosis as well. With reformation of the nuclear membrane in
		telophase, material begins to condense at the spindle on the cell equator:
		this is called a <i>cell plate</i>.

	</p>
	<p>Times involved in mitosis vary. At optimal temperatures and
		growth conditions, bacteria divide every 15-20 min. In mammalian cells,
		prophase to telophase can last 1 hr, with cell cycling of 16-20 hr being
		common.

	</p>
	<p>Processes involved in mitotic control are not known
		precisely. It may relate to a cell volume relationship or changes in the
		surface area to volume ratio. Colchicine is a drug affecting spindle
		formation, used to initiate polyploidy in plants.

	</p>
	<p>Problems remaining to be answered related with mitosis
		include how it is initiated; how chromosomes move to the spindle at the
		equator, and then move to the poles; how the spindle is formed; how the
		cytoplasm constricts in animal cells; why centrioles are necessary in lower
		plants and animals, but not the higher plants.

	</p>
	<h2>Meiosis</h2>

	<p>In multicellular animals certain cells are designated as
		germ cells, cells which will mature into gametes. They will reduce their
		genome content by one-half (become <i>haploid</i>), and this process is
		meiosis. In the typical multicellular species, meiosis involves two divisions
		(meiosis I and II).

	</p>
	<h3>First Meiotic Division</h3>

	<p>A series of stages is defined as in mitosis. Prophase I is
		very long and is itself subdivided into 5 substages. The <i>leptotene</i>
		stage show long and thin chromosomes beginning to condense. The <i>zygotene</i>
		stage is a movement of homologous chromosomes to synapsis. The <i>pachytene</i>
		state shows short and thick chromosomes in synapsis. The <i>diplotene</i>
		shows a separation of the synapses pairs and tetrads of chiasmata. <i>Diakinesis</i>
		shows a contraction of the chromosomes and nucleolar breakdown. The synapsis
		marks recombination of the chromosomal DNA to give variety to the meioitc
		products.

	</p>
	<p>The centriole divides and moves to opposite poles, with
		spindle fibers beginning to appear (an aster may also be apparent). Prophase I
		ends with nuclear envelope breakdown and movement of tetrads to the equatorial
		plate of the spindle. Metaphase is reached when they align. Anaphase marks
		movement to opposite poles of each opposite pair, which appear as <i>dyads</i>.
		Telophase may lead into an interphase (chromosomal unpacking, nuclear envelope
		formation) followed by cell division, but it is likely to be very short; many
		species show no interphase or cell division and proceed quickly into the second
		meiotic division.

	</p>
	<h3>Second Meiotic Division</h3>

	<p>The dyads now orient on a second spindle. Division now
		proceeds like mitosis, with division of centromeres to separate the chromatids
		(no longer sister chromatids because of recombination). Where an interphase
		has occurred, second division proceeds with a prophase requiring nuclear
		membrane breakdown and chromosomal condensation. Cell division commences with
		telophase to form 4 cells with haploid nuclei.

	</p>
	<h2>Spermatogenesis/O�genesis</h2>

	<p>In spermatogenesis the four cells produced from meiosis in a
		single cell well go on to mature as spermatozoa, while in the female only one
		cell of the four produced becomes mature as the ovum (egg), while the other
		haploid cells degenerate as polar bodies.

	</p>
	<p>In the testis are seminiferous tubules with the presumptive
		diploid germ line cells, spermatogonia. They proliferate their numbers by
		mitosis until sexual maturity. The <i>primary spermatocyte</i> is an
		enlarged cell which undergoes first meiotic division to form two <i>secondary</i>
		<i>spermatocytes</i>. The second meiotic division now produces four <i>spermatids</i>,
		which will begin the maturation process. In human sperm, this means changes in
		the Golgi to form the acrosome (containing enzymes which degrade vitelline
		membranes and jelly coat), the nucleus becomes the sperm head, the cytoplasm
		shrinks placing mitochondria in the middle piece surrounding elaboration of the
		distal centriole to form the flagellum.

	</p>
	<p>Mammalian ovaries have a germinal epithelium which
		proliferates to form the diploid germ line <i>o�gonia</i>. The push into the
		ovary to form follicles. An oogonium enlarges a great deal to form a primary
		oocyte, a prolonged period because of the materials they will store. Once yolk
		buildup has completed, first meiotic division followed by a cell division leaving
		one cell comparatively larger (with the yolk). The cell with little cytoplasm
		is a <i>first polar body</i>. A second meiotic division occurs
		with unequal cell division as before (a <i>second polar body</i>
		and <i>ootid</i> are now present). The ootid continues maturation to form the
		ovum.

	</p>
	<h3>Meiosis in <i>Ascaris</i> Oocytes</h3>

	<p><i>Ascaris</i> is a parasitic roundworm. The diploid (2<i>n</i>)
		number = 4. At time of fertilization (sperm entry), the presumptive egg is
		actually a diploid primary oocyte. Two tetrads are in the nucleus, and now the
		nuclear envelope breaks down, the tetrads arrange on a spindle. Now one set of
		dyads is in the first polar body, pushed from the surface of the larger
		presumptive egg. Second meiotic reduction occurs immediately, with formation
		of a second polar body. The male nucleus has become part of the cytoplasm
		along with a now haploid female nucleus (both are referred to as <i>pronuclei</i>).
		After a period of interphase in which sister strand synthesis has occurred,
		their membranes breakdown, they line up alon a common spindle and undergo the
		first mitotic division of a zygote.

	</p>
	<h2>Male Frog System</h2>

	<p>Testes are oval organs ventral to the anterior region of the
		kidneys. Surrounded by peritoneum and a double layer of tissue called the
		mesorchium with attaches it to the kidney. Sperm mature in seminiferous
		tubules, pass into the vasa efferentia in th emesorchium into the kidney
		tubules, and will be conveyed to the opisthonephric duct and to the cloaca,
		where they may be stored in seminal vesicle in the duct next to the cloaca
		(such vesicles are not well-developed in all frog species).

	</p>
	<p>The males of some frog species have a vestigial oviduct
		(grass frog but not bullfrog), which is smaller than in the female of the
		species and without a lumen. Treating the frog with female hormones will open
		the lumen and develop the duct.

	</p>
	<h2>Female Frog System</h2>

	<p>Ovaries occupy positions in the frog similar to the testes,
		connected by a mesentery called the <i>mesovarium</i>. They change their size
		depending on the season, becoming distended up to the breeding period in the
		spring. The ovaries of <i>R. pipiens</i> can accumulate 3000 eggs, while the <i>R.
			catesbiana</i> ovary can produce 20,000 eggs. The eggs are eventually
		liberated into the body cavity (ovulation), and these pass into funnel-shaped <i>ostia</i>
		which are openings to the highly coiled oviduct. The ostia are located near
		the base of the lungs and lined with ciliated cells; the peritoneum is also
		ciliated. Currents generated by the cilia propel the eggs through oviduct, and
		the eggs are coated with albumen or jelly as a result of glandular epithelium
		secretions as they pass through the oviduct. Functions of the jelly: (i)
		protection against injury and infection; (ii) heat loss prevention. The
		posterior portion of the oviduct connecting to the cloaca becomes thin-walled
		and expanded, serving as a 'uterus.' Stored for a day or so there before
		extramission.

	</p>
	<h3>Mating</h3>

	<p>Frogs and toads gather in shallow ponds in the spring and
		engage in an embrace called <i>amplexus</i>. The male uses his forelimbs to
		embrace the body of the female ~24 hours prior to deposition of the eggs. As a
		female discharges the eggs, the male discharges sperm over them. This can last
		several days.

	</p>
	<p>Sperm penetrate the egg quickly before the jelly takes on
		water and swell.

	</p>
	<h2>Human Male System</h2>

	<p>Testes are size of pigeon's egg, located in sac (scrotum)
		suspended from lower anterior wall of abdomen. Scrotal sac is actually an
		evagination of coelomic cavity and continuity of the sac with the abdomen is
		via <i>inguinal canal</i>; the canals are sealed off by a growth of
		connective tissue after testicular descent. The testes are found in embryonic
		development to have a location near the mesonephric kidney much in the same
		position as the adult frog, but descend at the time of birth.

	</p>
	<p>In the seminiferous tubules are the <i>interstitial cells</i>
		(<i>cells of Leydig</i>) which produce testosterone for the
		entire body. <i>Sertoli cells</i> are present and function in
		nourishing developing spermatozoa. <i>Vasa efferentia</i> lead sperm
		from the tubules into an <i>epididymis</i>, a very coiled structure encircling
		half the testis and emptying into the <i>vas deferens</i>. These
		tubular structures, encircled by muscle, pass through the inguinal canal into
		the body then back out the urethra. Three glands emptying into the vas
		deferens prior to its connection with the urethra are <i>seminal vesicles</i>,
		the <i>prostate gland</i>, and <i>Cowper's gland</i>.

	</p>
	<p>Naturally the penis's spongy tissues fill with blood
		(erection), allowing use of it as an effective intromittent organ to deposit
		semen in the vagina. Powerful peristaltic contractions in the urethra lead to
		ejection of the semen.

	</p>
	<p>In comparing frog and human, the testes and vasa efferentia
		are similarly named and derived; the epididymis derives from the
		mesonephrogenous tissue, and the vas deferens derives from the mesonephric
		duct.

	</p>
	<p>In cases of cryptorchidism (failure of testes to descend) in
		the human, sterility is observed. Elephants are mammals with no testes removed
		from the body, indicating that sperm may not always require a lower
		temperature.

	</p>
	<h2>Human Female System</h2>

	<p>Ovaries in the lower part of coelom. The ostia, i.e.
		openings of the oviduct (<i>Fallopian tube</i>), partially surround the
		ovaries. The oviducts connect at one point to become the uterus (posterior to
		the bladder), which represents the fusion of paired ducts during embryonic
		development. This fusion is not as complete in some species, with the result
		being a fusion at the opening and two distinct uteri present for each tube.
		Continuation of the paired ducts is seen with the vagina. The vulva shows
		labia majora and minora, and a sensitive clitoris. The labia majora and
		clitoris are analogously derived as the scrotum and penis.

	</p>
	<p>The ovary is composed of germinal epithelium, a interweaving
		network of connective tissue (<i>stroma</i>) in which is found numerous <i>follicles</i>
		of various sizes. Active proliferation in the germinal epithelium causes the
		cell masses to press into the stroma; these differentiate into <i>Graafian</i>
		<i>follicles</i>. In a follicle one cell will enlarge and expand to become the
		egg while the other will form a wall. About 200,000 follicles are present at
		birth in each ovary, decreasing to 8000 to 16,000 by puberty (depending on the
		individual). For the next 30 or more years, one egg every 28 days is released
		(meaning only 400 or so are used).

	</p>
	<p>FSH controls the maturation process leading to ovulation.
		Fluid accumulates in the follicle, and the ovulatory process is controlled by
		both FSH and LH. The follicular cells themselves will produce the estrogens
		normally made in the body. Following ovulation, the follicle is transformed
		into the corpus luteum under the influence of LH; it then produces progesterone
		to maintain the uterus in a mode for potential pregnancy.

	</p>
	<p>After ovulation the egg proceeds into the ostium in a manner
		like the frog. The ostium is lined with ciliated cells producing currents to
		move the egg. Sometimes the egg does not enter the oviduct and is fertilized;
		the embryo usually dies and is resorbed. However if development continues in
		rare cases, the embryo is surgically removed. Egg transport through the
		Fallopian tube takes 3-6 days. Unfertilized eggs retain potential for
		fertilization only 2-3 days, and so eggs are necessarily fertilized in the
		upper part of the oviduct. 200 to 500 million sperm in each ejaculate
		guarantee the likelihood that fertilization can occur. Average sperm lifetime
		is 24-48 hr. Implantation of the embryo into uterine wall is typically 6-12
		postovulation, with the embryo now a hollow ball of cells. Enzymes which
		degrade endometrial lining are used in the implantation.

	</p>
	<p>Difference in egg production between females of various
		species reflects the �mothering� the embryos or individuals will receive.

	</p>
	<h2>Menstrual Cycle</h2>

	<p>In the event egg not fertilized, the uterine endometrium
		begins to break down its highly vascularized tissues about 14 days after
		ovulation over a 4 day period, manifesting itself as menstrual flow (the
		menstrual period). This process recurs every 28 days from puberty to menopause
		except during pregnancy. This occurs in the females of primates as well as
		human females.

	</p>
	<p>In the nonprimate mammals, there is an <i>estrous cycle</i>.
		In these species the female is receptive to the male only at the time of
		estrous, regulated by estrogens and progesterone as it is in primates and
		humans. Estrous behavior is at its height when ovulation is about to occur,
		ensuring fertilization. The length of the cycle varies between diverse groups
		of mammals: every 5 days in rats and mice; in dogs and cats, twice a year.
		No estrous is found in primates, possibly a result of having a more complex
		placenta than in other mammals.

	</p>
	<p>The pituitary secretes FSH which stimulates both the gamete
		development and follicular cells other than the egg over a period of 14 d. At
		that time LH has also risen and both FSH and LH are necessary for ovulation.
		Estrogens from the follicle actually promote endometrial development and begin
		to inhibit FSH production. Continued LH secretion after ovulation transforms
		the ruptured follicle into the corpus luteum, and its cells begin progesterone
		production under the stimulation of both LH and prolactin. Progesterone
		continues development and maintenance of the endometrial lining, and it begins
		inhibition of LH. The corpus luteum will persist another 5 or 6 months if
		pregnancy is obtained, after which other hormones produced by placental tissues
		support the pregnancy state. The CL will begin degeneration on the 27th day,
		causing rapid loss of endometrial lining. FSH has already increased due to a
		fall in estrogen levels, but ovulation cannot occur without LH, now no longer
		inhbited because of a fall in progesterone.

	</p>
	<p>Observation of missed menstrual flows indicate pregnancy
		often. The Friedman test for pregnancy involved use of a test urine from the
		subject injected into the blood of a mature unmated female rabbit. Hormones in
		the urine would induce ovulation of the rabbit follicles, requiring sacrifice
		of the animal to identify the presence of ruptured follicles.

	</p>
	<h1>Development</h1>

	<p>Progression from a single fertilized egg (zygote) to a
		juvenile to adult form is a complex series of stages in the life cycles of many
		species. In some species, the process is complicated by a stage called <i>metamorphosis</i>
		where the organism undergoes a very specialized transformation (the amphibians
		and insects show this). A water-dwelling vegetable-eating tadpole thus becomes
		a land-dwelling carnivore frog.

	</p>
	<h3>Gametes</h3>

	<p>Some differences between eggs and sperm are noted.

	</p>
	<p>(1) Eggs are produced in fewer numbers than sperm in all
		species. While some fish produce 10 million eggs, the contrast shows in
		mammals. The gametes (particularly the sperm) are not suited for a long
		survival time, and it is the case that sperm must do more of the work in
		finding the egg. Mortality of sperm high in a protected environment in the
		uterus; even higher if discharged into the environment.

	</p>
	<p>(2) Eggs are larger than sperm. This is true of relatively
		yolk-free human egg. The egg is designed to sustain the embryo until a late or
		early stage of development until it can acquire its own food. In placental
		mammals this is until the egg implants in the uterus at which time the tissues
		of the mother provide the necessary growth substrate. The egg is asymmetric in
		its packing of the essential nutrients, placing the food reserve at one end of
		the cytoplasm, the <i>vegetal pole</i>, from which the embryo will take
		its food as it grows on the other end, the <i>animal pole</i>.

	</p>
	<p>(3) Sperm have usually completed meiosis completely at
		fertilization time. Depending on species, the egg proceeds to a particular
		stage of meiosis and then waits for sperm entry to trigger completion of
		meiosis. In the <i>Nereis</i> sandworm, sperm nuclear entry is necessary to
		begin both meiotic divisions. The mussel <i>Mytilus</i> stops in metaphase I,
		then proceeds with fertilization. Vertebrates liberate the first polar body
		but then halt at metaphase II. And then in starfish, both divisions have been
		completed with sperm entry, making these eggs truly haploid.

	</p>
	<p>(4) Sperm are the motile cells, while eggs are the passive
		cells.

	</p>
	<p>The distribution of yolk in oval cytoplasm is reflected in
		the following terms: <b><i>isolecithal</i></b> is typical of starfish and
		humans, with a small amount of yolk distributed equally; <b><i>mesolecithal</i></b>
		is as in frog with a polar distribution of a moderate amount of yolk; <b><i>telolecithal</i></b>
		is a dense area of yolk in which cell division does not occur in the yolk
		region, this typical in birds and reptiles; <b><i>centrolecithal</i></b> is
		where the yolk is surrounded by a 'rind' of cytoplam, as in insect.

	</p>
	<h3>Fertilization and Parthenogenesis</h3>

	<p>Fertilization involves <i>egg activation</i> and <i>fusion/union
			of the egg and sperm pronuclei</i> to create the diploid cell.

	</p>
	<p>How sperm and eggs get together is being studied. In some
		cases, chemotaxis is a factor. Those eggs with a jelly coat show presence of a
		glycoprotein which can agglutinate sperm (shows it has two sites for sperm
		binding, meaning it perhaps binds to receptors on the same sperm cell to cause
		a change in its membrane). Also the sperm are activated when in jelly coat.
		Activation is seen in the unbundling of the acrosome, which has a granule which
		dissolves. A tubule from it extends and penetrates into the egg to the plasma
		membrane, with fusion of the sperm and egg membranes. Bulging of the egg
		cytoplasm partially into the canal is followed by the sperm nucleus, middle
		piece and centrioles entering the egg cytoplasm.

	</p>
	<p>Upon fertilization, a vitelline membrane elevates from the
		surface of the egg as a result of cortical vesicles in the egg fusing with the
		plasma membrane to release contents intended as a permanent block to
		polyspermy. Some sperm produce the enzyme hyaluronidase to dissolve the hyaluronidate
		cementing follicular cells to the egg in a corona radiata.

	</p>
	<p>In some species, activation development of eggs can proceed
		without fertilization by sperm. This is <i>natural parthenogenesis</i>,
		and occurs in bees and ants, producing haploid offspring. In aphids, offspring
		result from a diploid cell. <i>Artificial parthenogenesis</i> refers to
		induced activation of the egg which can lead to development of offspring, even
		in mammals such as rabbits. These offspring are usually not haploid but have
		become diploid, possibly by recruiting polar body nuclei or by a replication
		without normal mitosis.

	</p>
	<h3>Cleavage</h3>

	<p>The process involving increases in cell number while
		maintaining same volume as egg; namely the zygote partitions into many cells
		without a significant change in total mass.

	</p>
	<p>Three cleavage patterns identified: (1) radial--successive
		divisions in which cells are symmetrical around an axis running through animal
		and vegetal pole, with starfish and sea urchin as models; (2)
		bilateral--cleavage planes arranged bilaterally with reference to the median
		plane of the animal, seen in tunicates, amphioxus, and some vertebrates; (3)
		spiral--mitotic spindles are tilted in relationship to animal-vegetal axis with
		cells of one row lying on the furrows of cells in another row; the angles of
		the spindles tilt back and forth with the successive cleavages, showing a
		rotational relationship among the blastomeres, hence spiral; typical of broad
		class of including flatworms, annelids, mollusks, and some arthropods.

	</p>
	<p>Also the extent of cleavage depends upon the stored yolk.
		Isolecithal and mesolecithal have generally little yolk and cleavage occurs
		throughout the egg diameter with equally sized blastomeres (<i>holoblastic cleavage</i>).
		Frog eggs have greater yolk and show cleavage with unequally sized blastomeres,
		the larger in the vegetal pole. Cleavage in birds and reptiles is confined
		strictly to the small animal pole and does not really cut through the yolk
		portion (<i>meroblastic cleavage</i>).

	</p>
	<h3>Gastrulation</h3>

	<p>Characterized by cell movements occurring after the cleavage
		stage. Some cells move to the interior in an orderly way to form the primitive
		gut (<i>archenteron</i>). The yolk and cleavage pattern influence the
		movements of these cells. At the end of the movements, the cells have 3 germ
		layers: <i>ectoderm</i> on the surface, <i>endoderm</i> forming the gut, and <i>mesoderm</i>
		distributed in between.

	</p>
	<h2>Comparative Development</h2>

	<h3>Echinoderms</h3>

	<h4>Cleavage and Blastulation</h4>

	<p>Already described for starfish (sea urchins). Blastomeres
		are of equal size. With increased proliferation, a single layer of columnar
		cells begins to form a hollow sphere, the cavity being a <i>blastocoel</i>.
		More ancient phyla produce solid blastulae.

	</p>
	<h4>Gastrulation</h4>

	<p>Cells at the vegetal pole start movement inward. The
		invagination (indentation) they make is a developing <i>archenteron</i>. The
		process involves a select group of vegetal pole cells extending pseudopodia to
		make contact with animal pole cells; the cells then contract to pull other
		cells to form the pit. Loose cells (mesenchyme) in the blastocoel also extend
		filopodia.

	</p>
	<p>With completion of gastrulation, the archenteron forms a
		cul-de-sac tube, its anterior (innermost) end expanding into a bulb of
		bilaterally arranged pouches, the <i>mesodermal</i> or <i>coelomic pouches</i>.
		The opening is called the <i>blastopore</i>. The pouches will separate from
		the archenteron, with one or both (depends on echinoderm) forming the <i>mesoderm</i>.
		The cavity formed from the pouch is a <i>coelom</i>. After pouch tissue
		separation, the lining of the archenteron forms the <i>endoderm</i>. Starfish
		development continues with bands of cilia forming from cells on the surface.
		The embryo will become a <i>bipinnaria</i> larva.

	</p>
	<h3>Amphioxus</h3>

	<p>A cephalochordate also showing formation of a mesoderm by
		pouchin of the archenteron. Along the anterior-posterior axis is a periodicity
		or segmentation of the mesoderm into <i>somites</i>, dorsal and lateral in the
		axis. From the roof of the mesoderm will form a rod of cells called the <i>notochord</i>.

	</p>
	<h3>Trocophore Development</h3>

	<p>These animals typically show spiral cleavage. The cells in
		early cleavage which will become presumptive mesoderm can be identified early.
		In the fertilized cell, a lobe extends from one of the poles (a <i>polar lobe</i>)
		and remains present and attached to one of the cells in the two-cell stage (the
		CD blastomere in the scaphopod mollusk <i>Dentalium</i>). This lobe
		disappears, resorbing into the cell, but later another polar lobe appears in
		this cell, division to the 4-cell stage occurs, and the lobe remains on one of
		the four cells (the D blastomere), to be later resorbed by that cell as
		division proceeds without lobe formation.

	</p>
	<p>If the lobe is removed at any one of these stages, the
		embryo develops without a mesoderm, with the extent of mesodermal-derived
		deficiencies dependent upon whether the first or second lobe is removed. One
		cell in the 32-cell stage embryo of one annelid has been identified as giving
		the most mesoderm potential, and this is true of mollusks and flatworms as
		well.

	</p>
	<p>In nontrochophores, sea urchins (but not starfish) at the
		16-cell stage show 8 medium-sized cells at the animal hemisphere and 4 very
		large cells within the vegetal hemisphere, and 4 small micromeres at the
		vegetal pole. These micromeres at the vegetal pole are presumptive mesoderm.

	</p>
	<h3>Frogs</h3>

	<h4>Cleavage and Blastulation</h4>

	<p>Cleavage is holoblastic and similar to starfish pattern to
		the 64 cell stage. At 8-cell stage, an asymmetry is apparent with the 4 animal
		pole cells being smaller than the 4 vegetal pole cells, due largely to
		placement of spindles away from the yolk-rich areas.

	</p>
	<p>A hollow blastula is formed, but the blastocoel is not
		spherical but hemispherical, with the blastocoel displaced to the animal
		hemisphere. The vegetal hemisphere is a mass of large cells, while the animal
		pole wall is composed of smaller cells more than one cell thick unlike the
		echinoderms.

	</p>
	<h4>Gastrulation</h4>

	<p>Movement of cells is more complicated in the frog than
		echinoderm largely because of the yolk-rich cells in the vegetal pole. The
		position of blastopore development can be ascertained from the presence of a
		gray crescent in the egg (a slighter lighter area), and there may be a
		correlation with the point of entry of sperm. The blastopore appears first as
		a small slit and marks the median plane. It appears to form at the center of
		the lower edge of the gray crescent, the cells streaming into the interior in a
		region where the blatocoel is present, and pulling the cells to which they are
		attached. Cell proliferation at the animal pole 'supplies' more cells to
		participate in the movement lest drastic cell shape changes be necessary. Cell
		movement is most prominent at the dorsal lip of the blastopore, with the
		advancing archenteron pushing its way into the blastocoel. The blastopore
		dorsal margin expands into a curve and then into a full circle as all cells
		forming the pore show movement inward. The blastopore perimeter begins to
		contract and closes into a slit, the future <i>anus</i>.

	</p>
	<p>The middoral line of the archenteron contains presumptive
		notochordal mesoderm, which separates and forms a rod of cells from the
		anterior to posterior axis; this chordal mesoderm will also give rise to the
		somites. Mesoderm lateral to the chordal mesoderm will separate as sheets to
		form the bulk of organs and tissues in the frog; it will spread to the ventral
		surface between the archenteron lining (now endoderm) and the surface ectoderm.

	</p>
	<h4>Neuralation</h4>

	<p>The ectoderm of chordates in the mid dorsal line above the
		notochord will invaginate and fold in ways to produce what is called the <b><i>neurula</i></b>.
		Notochordal formation induces ectodermal cells on the middorsal line to become
		columnar, these thickened cells forming the <i>neural plate</i>. The
		plate edges become more prominent and begin to form a rim (the <i>neural fold</i>)
		which tapers off at the blastopore. These folds now rise further and meet at
		the middorsal line as cells in the plate fold inward; the plate cells (now <i>neural</i>
		<i>groove</i>) roll into a hollow tube (the <i>neural tube</i>) after
		the cells at the fold meet and become continuous, the cells forming the tube
		now separating. Cells from the epidermal ectoderm lying above the neural tube
		separate from the ectoderm along the dorsal line, forming a mass above the
		tube, namely at its crest, and are called <i>neural crest cells</i>.
		They will become sensory neurons, neuronal sheath cells, the adrenal medullary
		cells, pigment cells, and cells forming important cartilaginous tissues in the
		pharyngeal region.

	</p>
	<p>The presence of the notochord is required for formation and
		determination of location of the neural tube, since presumptive neural ectoderm
		transplanted to ventral location becomes epidermal ectoderm; and
		transplantation of ventral ectoderm to the region of the chordal mesoderm
		induces neuralation in that tissue. Additionally transplanting chordal
		mesoderm to underlie other ectodermal areas induces neurulation in the
		overlying ectoderm. It has not been fully decided if differentiation results
		from cell surface molecules on the inducing tissue or by movement of a
		diffusible inducer from these cells to the adjacent tissue.

	</p>
	<p>In the anterior region cells of the neural tube thicken and
		form pouches in three regions to form the primitive brain. The most anterior
		is the <b><i>prosencephalon</i></b>, to form the <i>telencephalon</i> (future
		cerebrum) and <i>diencephalon</i> which forms in part the thalamus. The
		midregion pouch is the <b><i>mesencephalon</i></b> which is not really
		differentiated. The hind pouch is the <b><i>rhombencephalon</i></b>, which
		differentiates into the <i>metencephalon</i> (cerebellum) and <i>myelencephalon</i>
		(medulla).

	</p>
	<h4>Derivatives of the Archenteron (Endoderm) and Mesoderm</h4>

	<p>
		The anterior end of the archenteron expands to form the <i>pharynx</i>. The
		lateral wall of the lining form small pouches (evaginations), the
		<i>pharyngeal</i> <i>pouches</i>, which begin to contact with overlying ectoderm
		at the same time invaginating toward the endoderm. At the point of union, holes
		begin to form and the endodermal and ectodermal fuse (the <i>pharyngeal
			clefts</i>). Between the clefts are pillars of tissue, the <i>pharyngeal
			arches</i>, lined now by ectoderm on the outside, endoderm on the inside, with a
		core of mesenchymal cells. In juvenile amphibians they will become gills.
	</p>
	<p>
		The mesoderm along the notochord and neural tube proliferates and forms into
		segemented blocks (<i>somites</i>) along the anterio-posterior axis. Mesoderm
		below the somites spreading to the ventral point is called <b><i>lateral plate
				mesoderm</i></b>. Within the core of lateral plate cells a hollow cavity (the
		<b><i>coelom</i></b>) begins to form: the layer next to the ectoderm is called
		the <b><i>somatic mesoderm</i></b> and will form the <i>parietal peritoneum</i>,
		while the layer adjacent to the endoderm is <b><i>splanchnic mesoderm</i></b>,
		and will form the <i>visceral peritoneum</i>.

	</p>
	<h3>Avian Embryology</h3>

	<h4>Cleavage and Blastulation</h4>
	<p>
		The bird egg consists largely of a yolk surrounded by a thin <i>vitelline
			membrane</i>. The white (<i>albumen</i>) and shell with its <i>shell
			membrane</i> are not part of the egg but formed to surround the egg as it passes
		through the oviduct. Cleavages occur at one pole (animal pole) of the
		fertilized egg, with divisions into the yolk being stunted and symbolic. The
		numerous cells form a plaque overlie the <i>subgerminal space</i> which forms
		between the yolk and the <i>blastodisc</i> (the animal cell plaque). Viewed
		from the top of the blastodisc, a lighter area of intensity is the <i>area
			pellucida</i>, while its peripheral margin encompasses it as a darker region
		called the <i>area opaca</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the end of cleavage, a <i>blastocoel</i> is now presence within the <i>area
			pellucida</i>, and its walls are the underlying <i>hypoblast</i> (between the
		blastocoel and subgerminal space) and a multiple layer of cells forming the
		<i>epiblast</i>. It is not known whether the hypoblast spread under the
		epiblast by cell proliferation in the hypoblast or whether epiblast cells serve
		as the source for more cells. The hypoblast is presumptive endoderm, while the
		epiblast is presumptive ectoderm and mesoderm.

	</p>
	<h4>Gastrulation</h4>
	<p>
		The posterior end of the epiblast thickens and become narrowed as a result of
		cell movements toward the middorsal line and up to the anterior. The appearance
		of these movements have given rise to the name <i>primitive</i> <i>streak</i>.
		The cells proceed to fan out to wider lateral margins in the blastocoel, between
		epiblast and hypoblast. The indentation of the primitive streak is equivalent
		to the frog blastopore, and the cells fanning inward are the true mesoderm,
		while the epiblast cells remaining outside are the ectoderm.
	</p>
	<p>
		Formation of the archenteron is delayed while neurulation accompanied by
		formation of a <i>head fold</i>, somite formation and foregut in the early
		stages.

	</p>
	<h3>Extraembryonic Membranes</h3>
	<p>
		Land-dwelling vertebrates developed alternative mechanisms in embryonic
		development, one being membranes used to store and mobilize the food, to collect
		waste, and to store a fluid which cushions the embryo against shocks. It should
		be noted that other groups besides amniotes have made adapations to protect
		their embryonic and juvenile forms. Some bony and cartilaginous fishes carry
		their young until they are ready to go it alone.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>yolk sac</b> is formed in reptiles and birds by an extension of the
		mesoderm and endoderm around the yolk portion; these mesodermal/endodermal
		layers are called the <i>splanchnopleure</i>. As development proceeds with
		expansion of the endoderm into the coelom, the mesodermal/endodermal connection
		of the embryo with the yolk sac is by the <i>yolk stalk</i>. In placental
		mammals the yolk sac is not well-developed and vestigial.
	</p>
	<p>
		Around the lateral margins of the embryonic body stalk in birds and reptiles,
		the ectoderm and underlying mesoderm invaginate and the lateral folds rise above
		the embryo to meet each other at the middoral line, starting at the anterior end
		and proceeding backward. These mesodermal/ectodermal layers are the
		<i>somatopleure</i>. Above the embryo the germ layers connect and form a new
		cavity, the <i>amnion cavity</i>. The ectodermal/mesodermal layers around the
		embryo are the <b>amnion</b>, while the germ layers continuous with the amnion
		by directed toward the shell are the <b>chorion</b>. In addition, an
		<i>extraembryonic coelom</i> forms between the amion and the chorion.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>allantois</b> is a splanchopleure which starts as diverticulum in the
		cloaca and then expands into the extraembryonic coelom. It begins to unify with
		the chorion (often called the <i>chorioallantoic membrane</i>), and is site of
		gas exchange and place for wastes.

	</p>
	<h3>Human Development</h3>

	<h4>Cleavage (Preimplantation Stages)</h4>
	<p>
		Although cleavage follows patterns similar to those described,
		mitotic and cell divisions are not synchronous and so odd numbers of
		cells may be present early. The cluster of small cells early in
		cleavage is called a <i>morula</i>. A blastula, called a
		<i>blastocyst</i>, forms in which a ball with a blastocoel
		surrounded by a single cell layer except at one pole, where
		there is a solid cell cluster expanding into the blastocoel,
		called the <i>inner cell mass</i>. At this stage the embryo
		has reached the uterus for implantation.

	</p>
	<h4>Implantation and Postimplantation</h4>
	<p>
		The embryo implants into the endometrial lining by breaking it down to become
		fully embedded within the vascular spaces. The blastocyst surface cells will
		differentiate into the chorion, forming a multinucleate syncytium. The inner
		cell mass will form cell layers that give rise to the amniotic cavity and the
		yolk sac (although there is no yolk). Three of the four extraembryonic
		membranes appear before any formation of the body stalk. In between the amniotic
		cavity and yolk sac, the embryo develops. A primitive streak, with a head fold,
		neurulation and organogenesis proceeds.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the posterior end of the blastodisc the endoderm evaginates into the chorion,
		the <i>allantois</i>. It does not expand into an extraembryonic coelom as in
		birds. Mesodermal cells form around it and both germ layers extend finger like
		projections from the chorion (<i>chorionic villi</i>) into the uterus. These
		connection arising from the allantois are the <i>body stalk,</i> which becomes
		the <i>umbilical cord</i>. The mesoderm differentiates into blood vessels. A
		portion of the allantois persists as the urinary bladder. It should be noted
		that bird development involves creation of a highly vascularized allantoic stalk
		to the chorion similar to umbilical cord blood vessel development to the
		placenta.

	</p>
	<h1>Nervous Coordination</h1>
	<p>
		With more complex morphology and tissue/organ/system development, a system for
		rapid control of body elements was necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
		Specialized cell type is <i>neuron</i>. Region of neuronal nucleus is <i>cell
			body</i>. Processes extending from cell are either <i>dendrites</i> (conduct
		impulses toward the cell body) or <i>axons</i> (conduct away from cell body).
		Several kinds of neurons, but classified into three types: (i) sensory or
		afferent, (ii) association, (iii) motor or efferent. Dendrites of sensory
		neurons connect to sense organs or receptors; their axons to the dendrites of
		association neurons. The path continues to the effects innervated by motoneuron
		axons.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sensory neuron dendrites and motor neuron axons are quite long. Sensory neuron
		dendrites extend from sense receptor to the dorsal root ganglion. Axons of
		motor neurons and the dendrites and axons of sensory neurons are surrounded by
		two sheaths: (i) <i>neurilemma</i> on the outside and (ii) <i>myelin</i> or
		<i>medullary sheath</i> on the inside formed by the winding of Schwann cell
		membranes around the axonal process. The myelin sheath affects conduction
		velocity of the nerve impulse (myelinated nerves conduct impulses about 4 times
		faster than unmyelinated nerves). The neurilemma is also cellular, and may play
		a role in nerve fiber metabolism and nerve regeneration (a thriving Schwann cell
		directs). Myelinated fibers in the brain and cord have no neurilemma, and
		little or no regeneration occurs when fibers are severed in these regions.
		Fibers leading to the viscera have neurilemma but no myelination. Nerves are
		essentially cables (processes) with impulses going in both directions.

	</p>
	<h2>Gross structure of nervous system</h2>
	<p>
		Nervous system composed of central, peripheral, and autonomic system.

	</p>
	<h3>Parts of the Frog system</h3>
	<p>
		In neural tube formation, the cavities of in the brain region persist in the
		adult as <i>ventricles</i> while in the cord they become the <i>canalis
			centralis</i>.

	</p>
	<h4>Peripheral System</h4>
	<p>
		Ten pairs of cranial nerves and ten pairs of spinal nerves form the PNS. All
		paired nerves are segmentally arranged in the primitive vertebrates. Spinal
		nerves are paired in all vertebrates; the segmental distribution of cranial
		nerves is not evident in the frog or higher animals. Most conspicuous cranial
		nerves are <i>olfactory</i> (innervation in nasal mucosa) and <i>optic</i>
		(inneration in retina). Optic chiasma is point of fiber crossover, which is
		complete in except in the higher mammals; in higher mammals, left-sides of
		retinal fibers from both eyes go to left side of brain, so there are some
		contralateral and ipsilateral connections. Posterior to optic chiasma is
		extension of diencephalic floor called <i>infundibulum</i> which is attached to
		the <i>pituitary body</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Only ten cranial nerves in amphibians and fishes, while in all other vertebrates
		twelve. Names of nerves essentially same in this wide grouping of vertebrates.
		Most conspicuous spinal nerves are the <i>brachial</i> nerves serving the
		forelimbs and <i>sciatic</i> nerves serving the hindlimbs. The first and third
		spinal nerves contribute fibers to the second, forming a mesh called the
		brachial plexus. Fibers in the 7th, 8th, 9th, and sometimes 10th unite to form
		the sciatic nerve, this net of fibers forming the <i>sciatic</i> or
		<i>lumbosacral plexus</i>.

	</p>
	<h4>Autonomic System</h4>
	<p>
		Two strands of nervous tissue run parallel to the spinal cord on both sides,
		starting at level of 7th cranial nerve, terminating posterior to last cranial
		nerve. These form the <i>sympathetic trunks</i>. The swellings along these
		strands are <i>sympathetic ganglia</i>.

	</p>
	<h4>Central System</h4>
	<p>
		Three enlargements in the anterior part of the neural tube occur early in
		development, which form the <i>forebrain</i> (prosencephalon), <i>midbrain</i>
		(mesencephalon), and <i>hindbrain</i> (rhombencephalon). From the embryonic
		forebrain, the cerebral hemispheres and diencephalon will develop, and olfactory
		lobes emanate from the front of it. From the embryonic midbrain will be the
		adult midbrain; the dorsal side will produce protuberances forming the optic
		lobes. From the hindbrain will form the cerebellum and medulla. The exterior
		surface of the CNS appears white because of the presence of myelinated fibers on
		the outside. Cell bodies usually are internally located. The cavity in the
		diencephalon will form the <i>third ventricle</i>, which is open as no neural
		tissue closes on it; the medullary cavity will form the <i>fourth</i>
		<i>ventricle</i>. There are two very vascular membranes which cover these
		ventricles, being called the <i>anterior choroid plexus</i> and <i>posterior
			choroid plexus</i>. Capillary beds here exchange materials between blood and
		fluid.
	</p>
	<p>
		Extending from the diencephalon is the <i>epiphysis</i> or <i>pineal</i>
		<i>body</i>. There is evidence that a vestigial median eye was present here,
		since such a median eye is found in a New Zealand lizard.

	</p>
	<h3>Parts of the Human System</h3>
	<p>
		Many homologies with the frog. The brain is larger in proportion to the cord in
		man than in frog. The size of the cerebral hemispheres alone exceed all other
		parts. Phylogenetic changes leading to the higher vertebrates shows
		proportional increases in both cerebrum and cerebellum. The increase in
		neuronal number has necessitated location of massive numbers of cell bodies on
		the surface of the brain rather than the interior, accounting for the exteriorly
		located gray matter. The lateral walls of the diencephalon form the
		<i>thalamus</i>, and the floor is the <i>hypothalamus</i> upon which the massive
		hemispheres sit. The <i>brainstem</i> extends posteriorly from the diencephalon
		and is composed of the <i>midbrain</i>, <i>pons</i>, and <i>medulla
			oblongata</i>. Dorsal to the pons and attached by peduncles to the pons,
		medulla, and cerebrum is the cerebellum.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the brain is linear with the axis of the neural tube in lower animals, the
		neural tube in man makes 3 bends (called <i>flexures</i>) such that the brain
		axis forms a letter starting from the cord. Membranes called <i>meninges</i>
		cover the brain and cord tissue: a tough outer layer of connective tissue
		called <i>dura mater</i>, the <i>arachnoid tissue</i>, and a thin layer close to
		the tissue called <i>pia mater</i>. Spaces between these layers are called the
		<i>subdural</i> and <i>subarachnoid spaces</i>, both filled with cerebrospinal
		fluid. Man has 31 pairs of spinal nerves composed of a mixture of sensory and
		motor fibers as in other vertebrates. The nerves going into and out of the cord
		proceed either by <i>dorsal roots</i> (sensory fiber pathway) or <i>ventral
			roots</i> (motor fibers). A <i>dorsal</i> <i>root ganglion</i> near the cord on
		the dorsal root pathway contain sensory neuron cell bodies. Axons of sensory
		nerves can pass into the <i>dorsal</i> <i>horn</i> of the inner gray matter
		region of the cord, or pass to another level of the cord via the cord white
		matter. Motor neuron cell bodies are within the <i>ventral horn</i> of the cord
		gray matter, the axons leaving by the ventral root.
	</p>
	<p>
		The spinal nerves which lead to limb motor and sensory function are the largest
		in all vertebrates, as indicated in the frog, with nerve size well correlated to
		the body region need for innervation. This has been shown in embryo studies in
		which leg primordium was grafted to the flank region of a salamander embryo to
		produce a 5-legged animal. Nerves normally extending to that flank grow to
		innervate the extra limb, producing a larger nerve diameter on the side
		containing the extra limb than on the other side.

	</p>
	<h2>Reflex Arc</h2>
	<p>
		Brain-independent protection (reflex) systems are part of the primitive level of
		protection afforded by the nervous system to the animal. A <i>reflex arc</i> is
		well established in animals, where the body (not the mind, as shown in which the
		brain is destroyed without loss of cord function) reacts to injurious stimuli.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <b>simple reflex circuit</b>: sense organ or receptor is affected, stimulates
		dendrites of sensory neuron, passes over cell body in dorsal root ganglion to
		axons and nerve terminals in dorsal horn of cord gray matter. An association
		neuron in the cord gray matter is stimulated in a
		dendrite-to-cell-body-to-axon-to-synapse manner, then to the motor neuron, which
		passes to the effector organ (maybe a muscle).
	</p>
	<p>
		A <b>complex reflex circuit</b> is shown by pinching a foot on a frog so hard
		that the leg having the foot is flexed <i>and</i> the opposite leg is extended.
		Harder pinches may initiate movement in all four limbs. In this way, the
		sensory neuron may be stimulating association neurons in the cord whose axons
		lead to motor neurons at other levels along the cord. The sensation of pain as
		well, is not found in any reflex circuit, but is noted in the brain, so
		associations with the brain are obvious. Other reflexes include the visceral
		reflexes, automatic systems to make adjustments in the body without requiring
		conscious control.

	</p>
	<h2>Nature of the Nerve Impulse</h2>
	<p>
		Proof of the electrical nature of the nerve impulse is to put electrodes from a
		galvanometer down the length of a nerve fiber and electrically stimulate a nerve
		at a remote location. Helmholtz was a physiologist who succeeded in measuring
		the nerve impulse transmission speed in frogs, consistently shown to be 30 m/s.
		In humans, the rate is 100-124 m/s. It is not a simple electric current, which
		travels at near the speed of light.
	</p>
	<p>
		The nerve impulse has a chemical nature to it, and impulse activity is
		accompanied by oxygen consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> production, and heat
		liberation. The impulse is self-propagating once it has started. A brief
		<i>refractory period </i>of 1-5 ms is required before another can pass in human
		fibers. Most studies of the impulse involve large axons (typically from squid).
		Voltmeter readings with microelectrodes show a potential difference of 70 mV
		(more negative intracellularly) in the quiescent neuron, called the <i>resting
			potential</i>. The chemical gradients with a greater Na<sup>+</sup> and
		Cl<sup>�</sup> outside and K<sup>+</sup> inside account for the electrical
		gradient (a 10-fold difference for Na outside to inside and 30-fold for K inside
		to outside). The resting membrane is more permeable to K<sup>+</sup> than to
		Na<sup>+</sup>, and so there is an excess of positively charge ions outside.
		Cellular respiraton processes maintain the concentration differences.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stimulation of the nerve occurs when a threshold is passed in the leakage of
		Na<sup>+</sup> into the neuron. A net voltage change occurs within the
		membrane, and an electrically-induced change in proteins in the neuron cause a
		wave-like alteration resulting in further leaking of Na<sup>+</sup>, propagated
		down the membrane. Repolarization occurs when a loss of permeability to
		Na<sup>+</sup> occurs and a greater permeability is seen with K<sup>+</sup>,
		which leaks out to restore the electrical potential.

	</p>
	<h2>The Synapse</h2>

	<h3>Properties</h3>
	<p>
		If nerve stimulation occurs somewhere in the middle of a fiber, it is known that
		the impulse travels bidirectionally in the nerve. However, further propagation
		of the signal to the next neuron only occurs with neurons at the axon terminals
		of the stimulated fibers, not at the dendrites or cell bodies. The synapse is
		therefore a sort of 'check valve.'
	</p>
	<p>
		Nerve impulse transmissions are slowed at the synapse, with variable resistances
		at the synapse. The nerve impulse is continued from one neuronal element to the
		next by release of a chemical from <i>synaptic vesicles</i> in the axon
		terminals of the presynaptic element into a space (the <i>synaptic</i>
		<i>cleft</i> is the ~2 µm gap between neurons) where they diffuse across
		to the membrane of the postsynatpic neuron and induce ion fluxes in the membrane
		leading to depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. These chemicals
		(<i>neurotransmitters</i>) are thus <i>excitatory</i> (they excite). Other
		neurotransmitters released from presynaptic neurons are known to enforce the
		polarized nonconducting state (i.e., induce hyperpolarization) and are
		considered <i>inhibitory</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Facilitation</i> is known to occur where the impulses passing over synapses
		enable more rapid synaptic transmission in subsequent impulses. This is
		typically seen as the first impulse failing to cross the synapse, but multiple
		impulses finally leading to a state allowing synaptic transmission. This
		phenomenon is <i>synaptic summation</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other cases repeated stimulation can lead to a condition in reflexes
		particularly in which no reflex movement is observed. This is the result of
		<i>synaptic fatigue</i>, whether interneuronal or at the myoneural junction.
		This fatigue usually precedes any muscle fatigue. It is known the certain
		drugs, such as <b>strychnine</b>, can reduce synaptic resistance to the point
		that a slight stimulation triggers convulsions in most body muscles.

	</p>
	<h3>Impulse Transference</h3>
	<p>
		Otto Loewi (1921) in experiments with frog heart showed chemical substances
		secreted from the end of a stimulated vagus nerve. Removing the hearts of two
		frogs, he left the vagus and accelerator nerve attached to one of the hearts,
		filled both hearts with Ringer's, then stimulated the vagus nerve to one heart.
		It slowed its beat. Transferring the solution to the other heart, he saw its
		beat also slowed. Transferring that solution to yet another heart had the same
		effect. The substance was later identified as <i>acetylcholine</i>. The same
		experiment was done for the accelerator nerve, its chemical secretion being
		<i>norepinephrine</i>. These chemicals are called <i>neurohumors</i> or
		<i>neurotransmitters</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The slowness of transferance across the synapse probably has to do with the fact
		that secretagogues work slower than bioelectrical currents. The dendrites have
		no secretagogues and so impulse transmission is unidirectional.

	</p>
	<h2>CNS Functions</h2>

	<h3>The Cord</h3>
	<p>
		Gray matter functions as reflex center coordination; white matter communication
		up the cord and into the brain. White matter actually composed of ascending and
		descending tracts. Crossover of these tracts is the rule: crossover sometimes
		in the cord, sometimes not until in the brains.

	</p>
	<h3>The Brain</h3>
	<p>
		Like the cord, similar in structure and function in all vertebrates. Parts
		which have evolved the most are cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. The
		olfactory lobes also appear more well developed in those animals which depend on
		that sense.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of the brain except for the cerebra, cerebellum, and diencephalon is
		referred to as the <b>brain stem</b>. Generally just extension of the ascending
		and descending tracts of cord insofar as white matter, but gray matter contains
		vital reflex centers in the medulla, including the controls for respiration,
		cardiac function, and vasomotor control. The swallowing, vomiting, coughing,
		and sneezing reflex centers are here as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>diencephalon</b> is composed the thick lateral walls of the third
		ventricle forming the thalamus, a sensory nerve relay center and for primitive,
		uncritical sensation. Sensory tracts from the cord and lower part of the brain
		connect to neurons extending into the cerebrum at this point. The hypothalamus
		at the floor of the diencephalon plays a critical temperature-regulating role,
		sleep regulation, hunger and satiety, as well as �external manifestation of
		emotion.� It is produces the releasing factors into the median eminence leading
		to the adenohypophysis of the pituitary.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>cerebrum</b> is said to set the higher animals apart from one another.
		Assuming a cord weight of 1, the brain weight would be frog=1, cat=4, monkey=15,
		man=55. Indeed the cerebra disguise the �primitive� brain parts from view in
		man. The outer <b><i>cortex</i></b> are neuronal cell bodies in highly
		convoluted layers or folds with many projection tracts leading to the body or
		other brain areas outside the cerebra, and with association fibers between the
		lobes of the one cerebrum and across to the other hemisphere, the latter by
		<i>commissural</i> tracts, the main one forming the <b><i>corpus</i></b>
		<b><i>callosum</i></b>. Cerebral functions include (1) conscious sensations;
		(2) voluntary movements; (3) learning, memory, thinking. Proof of the various
		functions of the brain come from (a) experiments with nonhuman animals with
		intentional limited tissue destruction and observation of changes in animal
		behavior, (b) study of humans with incidental (accidental) damage to their brain
		and the extent of structural damage determined clinically and at autopsy, (c)
		electrical sitmulation of brain areas in man and animals with exposed brain
		areas. Cerebral lobes assigned not just as a structural feature but defined
		functionally: the <i>fissure of Rolando</i> is an obvious structural
		(anatomical) separation between <i>parietal</i> and <i>frontal</i> lobe: the
		motor region is in front, the sensory complex posterior to the fissure, and the
		bottom of the body to the top is sensed and controlled motorwise from the
		superior to the inferior aspects of the fissure. Vision perception and
		correlation are made in the <i>occipital</i> lobe; auditory perception in the
		<i>temporal</i>. The lobes are really <i>association areas</i>, generally making
		extensive connections with other lobes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Association areas or tracts destroyed by trauma or disease result in
		<i>aphasia</i>, a condition of several types in which the common problem is a
		defect in the interpretation or communication of words. Brain activity can be
		recorded on an EEG, with waves and wave patterns being different depending upon
		the state of consciousness a person is in. Epileptics show distinct patterns,
		and epilepsy may have a genetic cause.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>cerebellum</b> is involved in coordinating motor activities in skeletal
		muscles with the voluntary control centers in the cerebrum (the cerebellum is
		the 'secretary' to the cerebral motor functions). No sensory information is
		processed or channeled through here. Cell bodies are located exteriorly to give
		it a gray appearance, with white tracts leading interiorly. Pigeons with
		destroyed cerebella can neither walk or fly, yet can flap their wings (showing
		no paralysis results). Acerebellar humans show jerky, slow movements
		characteristic of the drunken individual. Muscle tone is also dependent upon a
		working cerebellum, since skeletal muscle atrophies with loss of cerebellar
		function. Posture reflexes are said to be under cerebellar control.
	</p>
	<p>
		Brain function is correlated to development of the particular brain
		substructure. The cerebellum is proportionally large in animals moving in three
		dimensions (birds, fish).

	</p>
	<h2>ANS Functions</h2>
	<p>
		Visceral reflexes under autonomic control.

	</p>
	<h3>Sympathetic System</h3>
	<p>
		Easy to identify in frog as two nerve tracts running parallel to lateral aspect
		of vertebral column, with ganglia forming at areas where the tracts connect with
		spinal nerves via the <i>ramus communicans</i>. The chain of impulse activity is
		from a single sensory neuron to the gray matter of the cord via the same root as
		for the reflex arc. The cell body of the efferent neuron in the cord gray
		matter conducts the impulse out the ventral root, then into the <i>white
			ramus</i>, as it is myelinated. It makes the <b><i>preganglionic fiber</i></b>,
		which terminates in the sympathetic ganglion. Preganglionic fibers may also
		terminate after ascending or descending the sympathetic trunk, or they may pass
		through the sympathetic ganglia to meet the postganglionic element in various
		<i>collateral ganglia</i>. The next connection is to an unmyelinated
		<b><i>postganglionic fiber</i></b> which directly innervates the viscera, or
		which may come out the <i>gray ramus</i> to a spinal nerve and out to a blood
		vessel, hair muscle, or sweat gland. These postganglionic fibers can move up to
		the mixed-function cervical nerves, or down to the sacral region for
		distribution. The efferents from the cord controlling sympathetic function arise
		strictly in the thoracic and lumbar section of the cord (accounting for the
		<b><i>thoraco</i></b>-<b><i>lumbar</i></b> system name also given). Connections
		to the cerebral cortex from afferent fibers controlling visceral reflexes are
		very indirect, explaining why there is no continuous conscious awareness of
		visceral functions.

	</p>
	<h3>Parasympathetic System</h3>
	<p>
		Its efferents associated with 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 10th cranial nerves and the
		pelvic nerves emerging from cord's sacral section (called the
		<b><i>craniosacral</i></b> system). Preganglionic fiber cell bodies are located
		in the brainstem or cord and typically extend axons to postganglionic elements
		very near or embedded in the effector organ. Note the iris, lacrimal glands,
		and salivary glands are under the control of the 3rd, 7th, and 9th cranial
		nerve, resp. The 10th (vagus) nerve controls several organs in the torso:
		heart, lungs, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, adrenal glands. The innervation of
		the effector organs for both systems is shown as to effect it has.

	<h1>Sensory Perception</h1>
	<p>
		Environmental stimulation obtained via <i>receptors</i> or <i>sense organs</i>.
		Unicelluar animals may or may not have a simple sensory system. Multicellular
		animals have evolved complex systems. Receptor may discriminate by having a
		high threshold, or may pass all information to be processed by discriminatory
		function in nervous system. Sense systems specially adapted; as little as 2 pg
		ethyl mercaptan detected by human nose.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to five senses: <b><i>proprioception</i></b> is sensory afferents
		from muscle and tendons furnishing information about muscle tension, body
		position; sensory afferents from semicircular canals in inner ear; all visceral
		afferents under unconscious control.

	</p>
	<h2>Cutaneous Receptors</h2>
	<p>
		Various sensory tissues depending on what is to be sensed: end bulb of Krause
		(for cold); Ruffini's end organs (heat); Meissner's corpuscles and Merkel's
		discs (touch); Pacinian corpuscles (deep pressure). Have definite areas of the
		skin where they are: rule off back of hand or arm with lines 2 mm apart in
		checkerboard style, then use a stiff bristle (for touch), sharp needle (for
		pain), blunt metal stylus or thin metal rod which can be warmed or chilled to
		look for heat and cold receptors. Some areas will be found insensitive to
		either cold or heat, some sensitive to either one or the other. These mapping
		studies indicate 60 pain &amp; 100 touch spots cm<sup>-2</sup> in the fingertip
		palmar surface; the back of the finger shows 100 pain and 9 touch spots. It
		appears that touch and pressure receptors become stimulated by chemicals present
		in cells which are released only when damaged. Heat and cold receptors are
		stimulated by chemical changes occurring within them with temperature changes.

	</p>
	<h2>Taste &amp; Smell Receptors</h2>
	<p>
		The taste sense is result of <i>chemoreceptors</i> in the <i>taste buds</i>
		distributed throughout the tongue, laryngeal region, and soft palate. Taste
		buds are actually composed of sensory and support cells, with hair-like
		processes extending from sensory cell. Chemicals are conveyed via saliva (dry
		tongues can not taste) to bud, stimulate sensory cell which stimulates dendrites
		in a sensory neuron. This taste/chemical detection is generally limited to the
		mouth in higher vertebrates, but fish have chemoreceptors on their body surface.
		The interpretation of the taste sensation varies among many human individuals:
		it is known that the substance <b>phenylisothiocarbamate</b> can taste bitter,
		sour, salty, and sweet to different people. In general, acidic substances
		impart a sour taste, basic substances a bitter taste.
	</p>
	<p>
		Olfactory receptors are found in the uppermost nasal chambers; in man 5
		mm<sup>2</sup> is the area of this epithelium. Chemicals dissolve in the moist
		nasal epithelium and stimulated hairlike processes extending from the olfactory
		sense cells. Sniffing is a �reflex� response attempting to bring large amounts
		of chemical in the air in contact with the sensory epithelium. Olfaction is
		more important in some animals than others. In particular, dogs show much more
		extensive olfactory epithelium than man. The sense of smell is relatively
		unimportant for tree dwellers such as primates than it is for the ground
		dwellers. The sense of olfaction is very accomodating, requiring more of the
		chemical odor for stimulation after a while; this is readily observed when one
		does not notice the presence of a very strong odor after a time of constant
		exposure. Analysis of the olfactory receptors indicates they may respond to
		molecules of a certain �shape,� not to unique molecular structures. Five of
		seven primary odors correspond to five basic molecular shapes:
		<i>camphoraceous</i> (moth balls); <i>musky</i> (angelica root oil);
		<i>pepperminty</i> (mint); <i>floral</i> (rose); and <i>ethereal</i> (dry
		cleaning fluid). The other two odors are <i>pungent</i> (vinegar) and
		<i>putrid</i> (rotten eggs) and could not be correlated with the basic molecular
		shapes; since one kind has an excess of electrons (putrid) and the other a
		deficiency (pungent), this stimulation may be based on electrical charge/field
		and not on shape. The odor of synthetic molecules with a known shape
		(configuration) has been correctly predicted on the basis of these studies.

	</p>
	<h2>The Organ of Sight</h2>
	<p>
		Light-sensitive organs are found in many animals. <i>Euglena</i> has a red
		eye-spot or stigma to help its phototactic response. The planaria (flatworm)
		has a similar photodetection system. The compound eye in arthropods is made up
		of many light sensitive units that enable the organism to detect motion. The
		squid and octopus are the only invertebrates with eyes similar to vertebrate
		eyes which can accomodate near and far object perception; this came about by
		convergent evolution as a result of these marine invertebrates need for such
		vision capabilities. The human eye registers color better than the eyes of any
		other animal.

	</p>
	<h3>Structure &amp; Function of the Human Eye</h3>
	<p>
		Three basic tissue layers describe the human eye. An outer <b><i>sclera</i></b>
		or <b><i>sclerotic coat</i></b>, continued in the anterior part of the eye as
		the <i>cornea</i>. A middle <b><i>choroid</i></b> layer is darkly pigmented and
		serves to absorb stray light and supply blood via its many vessels, continued
		anteriorly as the iris and ciliary body. The inner <b><i>retina</i></b>
		contains the special light receptors and extends anteriorly to the point where
		it attaches to the lens. The retina is actually composed of layers of cells
		which light must pass through to reach the light-senstive <i>rod</i> and
		<i>cone</i> cells near the choroid layer. The distribution of rods (125 million
		in each human retina) and cones (4 million in each retina) shows the
		color-sensitive cones are more abundant in the fovea centralis, the rods on the
		periphery. These include the <i>ganglion cells</i> and their axons leading to
		the optic nerve, the <i>bipolar cells</i> connecting rods and cones to ganglion
		cells, and then the rods and cones. Pigmented cells are between the choroid and
		the rods and cones. Humors in the eye give it shape and perform other
		functions: nutrition of the tissue. Muscles to the lens are both radial and
		circular: in strong light the circular muscles contract, whereas in weak light,
		the radial muscles do.
	</p>
	<p>
		Visual perception is not done by the eye, but rather the brain. The inverted
		image form is �righted.� Color perception is also done in the brain.
		Refraction is largely done by the cornea, with refinements performed by flexible
		lens (accomodation). Suspensory ligaments connect the choroid to the lens. The
		<b><i>ciliary muscles</i></b> connect to the fibers of the ligaments and, when
		contracted, reduce tension to stretch the lens, causing it to bulge for focusing
		on near objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		The amount of light entering the eye is largely regulated by the <i>radial</i>
		and <i>circular muscles</i> of the <b><i>iris</i></b>, working against each
		other to control pupillary diameter. Circular muscle contraction is bright
		light effectively constricts the pupil; radial muscle contraction dilates the
		pupil.

	</p>
	<h3>Light Perception</h3>
	<p>
		The human eye can perceive a minimum of 6 quanta of photons, which is the light
		emitted from a candle 23 km away. Rod cells in the outer part have <i>visual
			purple</i>, or <i>rhodopsin</i>, which is a conjugated polyene connected to
		protein. Light striking rhodopsin decomposes the molecule to <i>retinene</i>,
		separating it from protein; these activate impulses in the rod. Retinene
		continues to decompose to <i>vitamin A</i>. This protein and vitamin A are
		resynthesized into visual purple again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Color vision in the cone is assumed to be due to variation in sensitivity to
		pigments to different broad ranges of light wavelengths in different cone cells.
		There is a pigment called <i>iodopsin</i> found in cone cells. Mac Nichol has
		studied cone cells in fish, monkeys, and man and has found three different
		pigments sensitive to particular groups of light, one pigment per cone cell
		type. Some reptiles and birds show the presence of four pigments sensitive to
		various spectral ranges: red, orange, yellow, and white light. Globules in
		cones may filter out all but certain wavelengths, cone stimulation therefore
		arising only from the wavelengths allowed to pass.

	</p>
	<h3>Eye defects</h3>
	<p>
		<i>Hyperopia</i> and <i>myopia</i> are focusing problems which are correctable
		with artificial lenses. <i>Astigmatism</i> due to irregularities in either lens
		or corneal curvature. Lens opacity often occurs which characterizes the
		<i>cataract</i> condition. Corneal opacity is only corrected by corneal
		transplant.

	</p>
	<h2>The Organ of Sound (Human Ear)</h2>

	<h3>Structure</h3>
	<p>
		In humans, an <b><i>outer</i></b>, <b><i>middle</i></b>, and <b><i>inner</i></b>
		ear. Outer ear consists of <i>pinna</i>, the cartilaginous projection from the
		side of the head which projects sound to the <i>auditory canal,</i> which leads
		to the <i>eardrum</i>, or <i>tympanic membrane</i>. The pinna in dogs and mules
		can be moved to assess sound origin; in man these muscles to move the pinnas are
		present but nonfunctional. The middle ear is an air-filled chamber formed from
		the first pharyngeal pouch and is connected to the oropharynx by the
		<i>Eustachian tube</i>. The <i>ossicles</i> of the ear are here: the
		<i>hammer</i> (<b>malleus</b>), <i>anvil</i> (<b>incus</b>), and <i>stirrup</i>
		(<b>stapes</b>), which transmit sound from the eardrum to the <i>oval window</i>
		in the <b><i>cochlea</i></b>. The inner ear is a series of fluid-filled
		chambers and canals called the <i>membranous labyrinth</i>, embedded in the
		<i>bony labyrinth</i> of the otic bone. The <i>utricle</i> and <i>saccule</i>
		are connected sacs forming the vestibule to the three (<i>anterior</i>,
		<i>posterior</i>, and <i>horizontal</i>) <i>semicircular canals</i>, all
		connected to the utricle. The canals are all arranged at right angles to one
		another in the three planes of space. The cochlea is a coiled tube of 2.5
		spiral coils connected to the saccule.

	</p>
	<h3>Mechanism of Hearing</h3>
	<p>
		Sound waves in the ear result in eardrum vibration, transmitted through the
		ossicles to the oval window. The <b><i>perilymph</i></b> fluid begins to
		transmit the vibrations into the <b><i>scala vestibuli</i></b> (<i>vestibular
			canal</i>) or first spirally wound canal leading from the oval window. These
		vibrations continue around the cochlear apex to the perilymph-filled <b><i>scala
				tympani</i></b> (tympanic canal) which terminate at the <i>round window</i>.
		The round window is membrane covering between the air-filled middle ear and the
		tympanic canal without which the perilymph cannot vibrate. Vibrations in the
		perilymph in the scala tympani cause the <b><i>basilar membrane</i></b> to
		vibrate as well. The basilar membrane has an arrangement of supporting cells
		and special cells called <b><i>hair cells</i></b>, the entire arrangement called
		the <b><i>organ of Corti</i></b>. They are called hair cells because of
		hair-like projections issuing from them, which come close to the <b><i>tectorial
				membrane</i></b>, an overhanging membrane within the <b><i>scala media</i></b>
		and supported in <b><i>endolymph</i></b>. The movement of the hairs along the
		tectorial membrane induce changes in the hair cells which in turn begin to
		induce changes (impulses) in the dendrites of nerves lead to cell bodies in the
		bony labyrinth called the <b><i>spiral ganglia</i></b>. The axons of these
		nerves continue as the cochlear branch of the auditory nerve.
	</p>
	<p>
		The basilar membrane contains some 24,000 fibers which vary
		in length, increasing from the base end of the cochlea to the cochlear apex.
		It is believed that high pitched tones are sensed by the short fibers at the
		cochlear base, while low-pitched tones are sensed better by the long fibers at
		the cochlear apex. Experiments with guinea pigs subjected to intense and
		continuous sounds for several weeks showed in microscopic analysis of killed
		animals that organs of Corti at the cochlear base were damaged in animals
		exposed to high pitches, and the converse was true for animals exposed to low
		pitches.

	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="imagesZoologyHTML/organcorti.gif" alt="illustrated Organ of Corti">
		<br>
		<img src="imagesZoologyHTML/organcortienlarged.gif" alt="enlarged organ of Corti">

	</p>
	<p>
		The human ear is sensitive to a range between 20 to 16,000 Hz, younger children
		having a better hearing range than older individuals. The ability to perceive
		the higher pitches diminishes with age.

	</p>
	<h3>Equilibration (control of balance)</h3>
	<p>
		The <i>utricle</i>, <i>saccule</i> and <i>semicircular canals</i> are important
		in the senses of <b><i>static</i></b> and <b><i>dynamic</i></b>
		<i>equilibrium</i>. The static sense controls via reflex movements changes in
		head position with respect to gravity, these sense organs in the utricle and
		saccule. Hair cells are found in these places as well, to which are attached
		<b><i>otoliths</i></b> (stones of CaCO<sub>3</sub>). Unequal stimulation of the
		hair cells causes motor neurons responsible for keeping equilibrium to be
		stimulated. Humans are accustomed to movements in the horizontal plane but not
		in the vertical, such as caused by elevator motion or ships rocking up-and-down;
		the utricle is stimulated in an unaccustomed way, which produces nausea or
		motion sickness. The solution is to lie flat so that it appears to be a
		horizontal movement.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dynamic equilibrium is controlled by the semicircular canals, attached to the
		utricles by swellings at the end of each canal called <b><i>ampulla</i></b>. A
		cluster of sensory hair cells are found in the ampulla but have no otoliths. As
		endolymph flows as a result of inertia caused by head movements moves the hairs
		on the hair cells, resulting in nerve fiber stimulation in the nonauditory
		fibers of the auditory (VIII) nerve. This produces an awareness of movement and
		reflex actions to respond to them.

	</p>
	<h3>Evolution of Vertebrate Ear</h3>
	<p>
		The first land animals, amphibians, show an outgrowth from the saccule, the
		<b><i>lagena</i></b>, present as a small diverticulum in fish, a larger one in
		amphibians, but fully developed as the cochlea in mammals. The first pharyngeal
		pouch forms the middle ear in amphibians; the <i>hyomandibular</i>
		<i>cartilage</i> (in lower animals a suspensory apparatus of the jaw), becomes
		the <b><i>columella</i></b> in the middle ear, the <i>stapes</i> in higher
		forms. An eardrum (tympanic membrane) then separates the middle ear from the
		outside, and there is no external ear structures in amphibians.
	</p>
	<p>
		The lagena in reptiles forms a true cochlea, more developed in mammals. The
		spiral turns in the mammalian cochlea vary from a half-turn in echidna (a
		primitive mammal) to 3.5 turns in deer. Sensitivity to pitches depends on the
		kind of cochlear development. The pinna is found only in mammals; birds and
		reptiles may have eardrums found with a depression, analogous to the formation
		of an auditory canal.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is clear that the middle ear and Eustachian tube development evolved from
		fishes which use it for their respiratory system. The columella and stapes were
		is part of the suspensory apparatus in the jaws of fishes, as indicated. And
		the malleus and incus are parts of the upper and lower jaws of all vertebrates
		but mammals.

	</p>
	<h2>Proprioception</h2>
	<p>
		Special nerve endings are found in every muscle and tendon which continually
		send impulses to the brain as if monitoring the state of muscle or tendon
		activity. This is all part of an elaborate system to give the brain information
		necessary for skilled and conscious movement of these muscles.

	</p>
	<h1>Chemical Coordination</h1>
	<p>
		Nervous system provides most acute, short-term changes, but nervous system
		energy expensive in monitoring processes which don't require immediate
		responses.
	</p>
	<p>
		Endocrinology study of ductless glands, hormones secreted by them into the
		blood. Most learned about hormones in the 20th century. Known for long time
		that castration in male animals causes sterility and morphological changes, but
		basis not known. Method of study typically would involve (1) removal of gland
		with observation of malfunction; (2) restoration of gland or injection of
		glandular extract or components of extract to restore lost function or alleviate
		symptoms.

	</p>
	<h2>Pancreas</h2>
	<p>
		Two kinds of glandular tissue. The exocrine <i>acinar cells</i> produce enzymes
		for digestion in the gut. Larger cluster of endocrine cells called <i>islets of
			Langerhans</i> produce hormones for blood. German physicians von Mering and
		Minkowski removed pancreas from dog to examine effects: among observations,
		ants had gathered in cages of dogs with removed pancreases, attracted by high
		glucose content of the dogs' urine. Pancreatectomized dogs always died in 10-30
		days, showing symptoms of severe <i>diabetes</i> <i>mellitus</i> in humans. (A
		control study revealed that pancreatectomy caused the problem, not the
		operation.) Other experiments involved closure of the pancreatic duct leading
		to the duodenum: this disintegrates the acinar portion, but not the islets and
		no diabetes was found.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other experiments to extract the substances involved were failures largely
		because the whole of the gland was extracted and this liberated the pancreatic
		digestive enzymes to destroy the active principle (a reasoning by F. Banting in
		1922, with assistance from McLeod, Best, and Collip and U. Toronto). Knowing
		that the islet cells differentiate in the embryonic pancreas before the
		digestive enzyme-producing cells, Banting found embryonic pancreas extracts
		relieved the symptoms in pancreatectomized dogs. The hormone found was
		<b><i>insulin</i></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without insulin, urine glucose can reach 8%. Diabetics continue to form glucose
		from amino acid breakdown and ketones and ketonic acids by improper fatty acid
		metabolism. Insatiable thirst, excessive urination, weight loss, and coma
		leading to death are among the shock phases of diabetes. Diabetics may
		sometimes over-inject insulin in which case sugar, candy, or sweet drinks are
		carried by them to compensate.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b><i>Glucagon</i></b> was first reported in 1957 and is necessary in
		controlling blood sugar in the opposite way by causing liver glycogen breakdown.

	</p>
	<h2>The Pituitary Gland</h2>
	<p>
		Found in the depression of the sphenoid in the skull, the <i>sella turcica</i>
		(L. <i>sella</i>, saddle; <i>turcica</i>, Turkish). Attached via the
		infundibulum to the hypothalamus. Composed of <b><i>anterior lobe</i></b>
		(<i>pars anterior</i>) and <b><i>intermediate lobe</i></b> (<i>pars
			intermedia</i>), which arise as a pouch from the roof of embryonic mouth and
		extends dorsally toward the brain. The <b><i>posterior lobe</i></b> (<i>pars
			nervosa</i>) extends as a ventral diverticulum from the diencephalic floor, the
		extension maintained as the infundibulum in the mature animal. In young humans
		the intermediate lobe is distinct, gradually absorbed into the posterior lobe.
		In other vertebrates, the intermediate lobe remains distinct.

	</p>
	<p>
		Hyphosectomized young rats show an inability to grow or reach sexual maturity.
		Pituitary extracts injected into these rats results in rapidly abnormal growth
		indicative of gigantism.

	</p>
	<h3>Adenohypophysis (Anterior Lobe)</h3>
	<p>
		The hormones produced by this lobe include the hormone for growth called
		<b><i>somatotropin</i></b> or nowadays <b><i>growth hormone</i></b>. In addition
		are <b><i>thyrotropin</i></b> (TSH), <b><i>adrenocorticotropin</i></b> (ACTH),
		the <i>gonadotropins</i> <b><i>follicle-stimulating hormone</i></b> (FSH) and
		<b><i>luteinizing hormone</i></b> (LH), and also <b><i>prolactin</i></b>
		(<i>lactogenic hormone</i>), the latter resulting in breast enlargement during
		pregnancy and milk production following birth.

	</p>
	<p>
		1860 was the year gigantism was attributed to overactive
		pituitary. 1944 marked isolation of the pure substance involved in growth
		promotion (identified as protein). During the growing period of animals, a
		proper secretion of pituitary growth hormone is necessary: too much is
		gigantism, too little leads to midget growth. Once maturity is reached,
		hypersecretion of growth hormone caused <i>acromegaly</i>, a result of
		excessive bone growth in the feet, hands and face, which continue to retain
		plates for growth.

	</p>
	<p>
		FSH and LH were previously described. FSH promotes Graafian
		follicle development in female and spermatogenesis in semniferous tubules in
		male testes. LH promotes ovulation and latter stages of cycle in female, and
		enhances interstitial cells in male and promotes testosterone development in
		cells producing them.

	</p>
	<p>
		ACTH promotes adrenal cortex activity. This promotes active
		secretion and synthesis of many adrenal cortex hormones (corticosteroids) which
		include cortisone. Corticosteroids have an affect on mitigating the effects of
		arthritis. Hyphophysectomized rats show adrenal cortical atrophy.

	</p>
	<p>Hyphophysectomized rats also show atrophy of thyroid gland.
		This is because TSH is missing, and this hormone enhances proliferation of
		cells in the gland as well as hormonal synthesis by these glands.

	</p>
	<p>Prolactin stimulates milk production in mammary tissue.
		Male animals artificially induced to grow large breast secrete milk when
		injected with prolactin. Prolactin also induces the corpus luteum to produce
		progesterone, and it maintains the functional life of the corpus luteum.

	</p>
	<p>Note that feedback regulation of secretion of these hormones
		means the pituitary hormones are produced and secreted only when needed.

	</p>
	<h3>Neurohypophysis (Posterior Lobe)</h3>
	<p>
		V. duVigneaud has found two hormones, both peptides which are 9 amino acids and
		differ in only two amino acids. These proteins are synthesized in the
		hypothalamus, transported down the infundibulum via axoplasmic transport, and
		stored for release in the posterior lobe.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of them is <b><i>oxytocin</i></b>, and it has been found to cause strong
		contraction in uterine muscles and elicit milk from aveolar tissues of the
		mammary gland. The other is <b><i>vasopressin</i></b> (also called
		<b>antidiuretic hormone</b>), which causes strong vasoconstriction and is a
		factor in controlling blood tension as a result; moreover this hormone enhances
		water resorption in kidney tubules.

	</p>
	<h3>Intermediate Lobe</h3>
	<p>
		The hormone <b><i>melanophore-stimulating hormone</i></b> (MSH) has no known
		effect in humans, but in frogs enhances expression of black pigment cells in the
		skin. It is these cells that result in pigmentation changes when frogs move
		into differenct surroundings. Hypophysectomized frogs can not change color (they
		remain light). Chromatophores are changed by this hormone in fishes, amphibians,
		and reptiles too. The purpose of MSH found in birds and mammals remains
		unknown.

	</p>
	<h2>Thyroid</h2>
	<p>
		A bi-lobed structure in humans just below larynx and straddling trachea. The
		<i>isthmus</i> is a narrow tissue section connecting the lobes. Present in frog
		as small glands lateral and ventral to larynx. Develops in all vertebrates as
		outgrowth of embryonic pharynx. Histological examination shows numerous hollow
		spheres (alveoli) lined by a single layer of cuboidal epithelium. These cells
		secrete their hormones into the gelatinous fluid (<i>colloid</i>) found in the
		alveolar cavities.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Simple goiter</i> has been known for centuries. Greeks recommended drinking
		sea water as a cure. Chinese found eating sea-weed helpful. Disorder was
		endemic in certain regions (Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians in Europe; Andes in
		South America; Great Lakes and along St. Lawrence in U.S. and Canada). The
		active substance in thyroid colloid is a modified amino acid,
		<b><i>thyroxine</i></b>, which has four atoms of iodine, first isolated in 1916
		then synthesized in 1927 (by Harrington and Barger). Removal of two iodine
		atoms reduces potency, removal of all four atoms makes it ineffective. It is
		now known that these areas have iodine-poor soil, a result of glaciation causing
		iodine leaching. Seawater and sea-weed have a high iodine content. Today table
		salt is fortified with KI.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thyroxine appears to regulate basal metabolic rates. Insufficient thyroxine
		secretion from the gland causes a condition called <i>hypothyroidism</i>. In
		newborn humans, can lead to <i>cretinism</i> in which growth is stunted and
		mental development lacking. Bowlegs, poor teeth, enlargement of tongue, and a
		coarse and leathery skin may develop; treatable when corrected early. In the
		adult, thyroid gland atrophy results in <i>myxedema</i>, resulting in loss of
		vigor, reduced mental activity, fat accumulation, diminished sex drive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thyroid gland is essential for development of the tadpole into the adult frog.
		Thyroxine injection alone into thyroidectomized tadpoles induces metamorphosis.
		When thyroxine is injected into normal (nonthyroidectomized) tadpoles,
		metamorphosis is rapid and produces tiny adults. A striking change was found in
		the axolotl, a Mexican salamander: it is normally a gill-bearing aquatic
		organism, but when injected with thyroxine, it loses its gills and become a land
		animal like other salamanders. It has been determined that a hereditary change
		in the pituitary prevent thyroxine synthesis.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Hyperthyroidism</i> is characterized by <i>exopthalmic goiter</i>. Thyroxine
		is actively oversecreted in a gland which may be normal in size or enlarged.
		Protrusion of the eyeballs, hypertension, general behaviorial irritability,
		diaphoresis, weight loss, and fatigue are common. Death can occur in severe
		conditions. Thyroidectomy and/or radioactive iodine (<sup>131</sup>I) are
		indicated in therapy.

	</p>
	<h2>Parathyroid Tissue</h2>
	<p>
		Humans have four (4) very tiny glands embedded in the tissue of the thyroid.
		These tiny glands secrete <b><i>parathormone</i></b> (PTH). Some confusion
		resulted when death occurred in some thyroidectomized animals while in others no
		effect was seen. It is now known that the glands have different locations in
		the mammals: in rabbits they are exterior to the thyroid; in dogs and humans
		they are embedded.
	</p>
	<p>
		Parathyroidectomy results in <i>parathyroid tetany</i> and can lead to death.
		Injection of either parathormone or calcium restores the normal condition, but
		for a short while. Hypoparathyroidism causes impairment of the regulation of
		both calcium and phosphorus in the blood, essential for maintaining calcium
		balance in the tissues. Hyperparathyroidism results in bone decalcification and
		hypercalcinuria.

	</p>
	<h2>Adrenal Glands</h2>
	<p>
		Located superior to kidney in humands, as thin strips of tissue ventral to frog
		kidney. In mammals a <i>cortex</i> and <i>medulla</i> have separate embryonic
		origins, former from the coelomic mesoderm, the latter from the neural crest
		cells from the ectoderm.

	</p>
	<h3>Medulla</h3>
	<p>
		Can be removed with traumatic results in animals. Epinephrine and norepinephrine
		first purified in 1901 from these glands. It is now considered that the medulla
		is a specialization to augment the effects of the sympathetic nervous system.

	</p>
	<h3>Cortex</h3>
	<p>
		Vital to the life of animals, it produces several hormones. <i>Addison's
			disease</i> is a result of the destruction or atrophy of cortical tissues (often
		by infection): symptoms include loss of appetite, muscular weakness, NaCl and
		water loss from the body, and characteristic bronzing of the skin. Extracts
		were prepared for patients to relieve these symptoms and first termed
		<i>cortin</i>. More than 20 hormones have now been isolated since 1927.
		<b><i>Cortisone</i></b> (antiarthritic, antileukemic, anti-inflammatory) is most
		well known. Other hormones are vital to water and electrolyte, as well as
		glucose metabolism: stimulation of gluconeogenesis by conversion of amino acids
		to glucose.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b><i>Androsterone</i></b> is also produced by the cortex in male and female
		humans, and it exhibits male sex hormone activity. Adrenal coritical tumors
		resulting in <i>hyperandrosteroidism</i> resulting in enhanced characteristics
		in males, precocious genitalia development in young boys. Women or girls begin
		to lose the qualities promoting their femininity, with facial hair development,
		voice deepening, male musculature, atrophy of ovaries, uterus, and vagina, and
		clitoral enlargement.

	</p>
	<h2>Gonads</h2>
	<p>
		The hormones are clearly necessary for eliciting physical effects as well as
		maintaining reproductivity. Capons (castrated roosters) develop no large combs,
		which grown with testosterone injections.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another curiosity was found by F. R. Lillie (U. Chicago) in work with twin
		calves of opposite sex. The female of the twin pair is typically sterile
		(called a <i>freemartin</i>), with masculine features. This apparently resulted
		from the extraembryonic membranes becoming united and resulting in
		cross-circulation of the hormones. Male development precedes the female
		development, and its hormones can influence the female by arresting development
		of the female gonads.

	</p>
	<h2>Thymus</h2>
	<p>
		A bi-lobed gland in humans above the heart. Prominent at birth, it atrophies by
		adulthood. Thymectomy in adults produces no ill effects. R. Auerbach (U.
		Wisconsin) has shown that spleen rudiments from 2-week-old mouse embryo fail to
		become lymphoid if cultivated alone, but that embryonic thymic rudiments make
		them lymphoid. J. F. A. P. Miller (in England) found thymectomized neonatal
		mice grew normally for a few weeks or months, then died from a wasting disease;
		autopsy showed very few lymphocytes. These mice also produced no circulating
		antibodies. Thymus implanted in thymectomized animals produced normal lymphoid
		tissue and circulating antibodies, <i>but</i> these lymphocytes were of the type
		of the host and not the grafted thymus.
	</p>
	<p>
		R. H. Levey and colleagues used a plastic capsule holding a thymus (pores in the
		capsule were not permeable to cells) and placed them in the abdominal cavities
		of thymectomized neonatal mice. They survived and grew like the normal animals,
		producing lymphocytes and circulating antibodies, indicating a hormone is
		certainly important in the development of these cells.

	</p>
	<h1>The Evolution of Invertebrates</h1>
	<p>
		A problem in looking at the evolution of animals leading to the vertebrates is
		that it invertebrate evolution of the major phyla occurred very early in
		geological time. Cambrian rocks of the Paleozoic show many major invertebrate
		phyla well developed: mollusks, annelids, arthropods such as crustaceans and
		trilobites. Most of the evolution was over the 2 billion years in the
		Precambrian, and paleontogical evidence is obscured by earth changes in that
		time. Comparative morphology at all developmental stages is the only reliable
		clue to evolutionary changes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The attending evolutionary changes may not have come from adaptations around a
		central body plan, a plan in all phyla, but rather by radical changes in body
		plan or organization. It is possible that one body plan arouse from another, or
		that multiple body plans arose from a single ancestral form no longer extant.
	</p>
	<p>
		Comparison of structure in the adult stage makes it difficult to analyze the
		evolutionary relationships, as variations are so considerable as to make common
		features unidentifiable. It is the characters in the adult structures which are
		the basis for separating the phyla however.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is the comparison of embryological (larval) forms which dramatically provides
		the basis of drawing evolutionary relationships. In the very early larval
		stages, the members of the different phyla may be indistinguishable. These
		similarities can have either of two meanings: (1) parallel evolution of the
		animal phyla or (2) evolution from a common ancestor. The sheer number of
		common characters seen in development make the acceptance of a parallel
		evolution hypothesis difficult, so this supports the ideas of evolutionary
		biology.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was Haeckel who made the observation that �ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,�
		stating that larval forms of the present phyla were the adult ancestral forms,
		and that development tells the story of the evolution of the group. Studies
		which have been done since Haeckel indicate that when two forms have larva which
		are similar that it does not mean that they evolved from an adult of that form,
		but rather they had an ancestor whose larval form was also grew through such
		developmental changes. With fossil evidence weak, the adult structure of the
		ancestor is a matter of speculation.

	</p>
	<h2>The Phylogenetic Tree</h2>
	<p>
		The diagram below speculates on only one of several possibilities that have been
		put forth to show the evolutionary relationships between phyla. The evidence
		for this particular one is discussed below.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="imagesZoologyHTML/phylogenetictree.gif" alt="The Phylogenetic Tree">
	</p>
	<p>
		The diagram show that plant-animal ancestor gave rise to the two great groups of
		living organisms, the plant and animal kingdoms. Wide agreement is there that
		protozoa are the simplest, the flagellates being the primitive forms and there
		are flagellates with both plant and animal characteristics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Choanoflagellates then formed, having strange protoplasmic collars which later
		gave rise to the multicellular forms, the sponges (Porifera). The absence of
		these cells in other groups distinguishes the porifera on that basis.
	</p>
	<p>
		The mesozoans present special problems. The internal cell or cells having only
		reproductive functions and surrounded by a single layer of cells may be the
		result of degeneration due to a parasitic existence, a feature seen in the
		primitive nature of parasitic metazoans. Their exact phylogenetic placement is
		difficult to ascertain.
	</p>
	<p>
		The evolution to metazoan life has been treated in the discussion of the
		protozoa. L. Hyman has proposed that a ciliated planula-like larva, a
		characteristic of coelenterates, is mostly likely the hypothetical ancestor.
		This is traceable to the existence of colonial flagellates such as the hollow
		ball colonies of Volvox or a colony without a hollow cavity.
	</p>
	<p>
		The radiate phyla of coelenterates and ctenophores, while successful today, gave
		no rise to higher phyla. Another of the planuloid forms likely adapted a
		bilateral symmetry and formed an acoelomate worm form, much like the flatworms
		of today. Mesoderm was present in coelenterates (showing in scyphozoa, more
		prominent in anthozoa), but there was no organogenesis. In the flatworms
		organogenesis is evident. The rhynchoceols are very much related to the
		flatworm but a noticeable advance was the development of an anus in this phyla.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is likely the pseudocoelomate phyla emerged from the acoel flatworm rather
		than advancing from the modern flatworms or rhychocoels. Acanthocephala shows
		highly specialized parasitic modifications but other characters show an affinity
		to the roundworms. And while related to rotifers, the pseudocoelous entoprocts
		have their own phylum nonetheless.
	</p>
	<p>
		A third form of the acoel flatworm likely developed a lined body cavity to
		become coelomate. From here, coelom formation was either a splitting from
		ectodermally derived mesoderm or from outpocketing of the endodermal gut.
	</p>
	<p>
		Among the features relating the schizocoelomates, acoelomates, and
		pseudocoelomates, which are all grouped under the division Protostomia, are:
		(i) spiral, determinate cleavage; (ii) mesoderm derived from teloblasts which
		separate early in development; (iii) coeloms arise from a split in solid mass of
		mesodermal cells; (iv) embryonic blastopore or surrounding region becomes adult
		mouth; (v) trochophore larva appears in schizocoels but is nascent in acoels
		and pseuodcoels. Other features link the separate phyla to each other:
		segmentation appears in annelids but is perceived in a segmented mollusk,
		<i>Neopolina</i>. Combinations of annelid and arthropod characters are found in
		the onychophora.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="imagesZoologyHTML/coelomatecompare.gif" alt="Comparison of coelomates">
	</p>
	<p>
		Among the features with deuterostomes have in common include: (i) radial,
		indeterminate cleavage; (ii) the mesoderm and coelom arise from outpocketings of
		the primitive gut; (iii) the embryonic blastopore or surrounding region becomes
		the anus in the adult; (iv) trochophore larva are not present but larval
		similarities are observed in some phyla.
	</p>
	<p>
		Distinct yet together with the deuterostomes and protostomes are the
		lophophorates, indicating they may have originated from a form giving rise to
		both protostomes and deuterostomes. They may even be the link. The blastopore
		in lophophorates becomes the mouth as in protostomes, and trochophore larva are
		in all three phyla. However, coelomic formation is enterocoelous in some
		brachiopods, and while the phoronids show spiral cleavage, the other groups are
		radial in cleavage. The lack of cephalization in lophorphorates also
		distinguishes them from protostomes, and a suggestion is made that no
		cephalization appeared in ancestral deuterostomes. The cephalization seen in
		vertebrates in merely an example of convergent evolution with protostomes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Among deuterostomes, clearly the chaetognaths show the most interesting
		development. They are very much like the acoelic roundworms, with loss of
		coelom and peritoneal linings in the adult, similar nervous systems and
		musculature to nematodes. The presence of ciliated funnels in the coelom for
		sperm ducts is the only feature remaining typical of coelomic forms. Their
		holoblastic, radial, indeterminate cleavage places them among deuterostomes,
		with coelom and mesoderm formation by a modified enterocoelous method. Since
		there are no larval forms, other comparisons are difficult. It is likely
		chaetognaths closely represent the primitive deuterostome ancestor. The rest of
		the deuterostomes likely evolved from a dipleurula, similar to the echinoderm
		larva. Echinoderms show bilaterally symmetrical larva in different stages. The
		bipinnaria larva is similar to the tornaria larva of hemichordates.
	</p>
	<p>
		The placement of pogonophores and hemichordates between echinoderms and
		chordates is based on relationships concerning the presence or absence of gill
		slits and dorsal hollow nerve cords. The hemichordates is the phylum closest to
		chordates. It is not a given that echinoderms or hemichordates are ancestral to
		chordates; it is only that a common ancestral type gave rise to all three
		phyla.

	<!--   PART 2:
									SYSTEMATICS
-->

	<h1>Animal Naming and Classification</h1>
	<p>
		Naming is common of man's attempt to sort and put order in
		his world. To categorize for the sake of memory. Many common names exist.
		Systematization of the naming process has been attempted. Aristotle divided
		into air dwellers, water dwellers, land dwellers. During the Roman age,
		nothing improved upon this scheme. St. Augustine began a classification
		scheme as well: useful, harmful, superfluous.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 17th C. John Ray and later in 18th C with Karl von Linne (taking the Latin as
		his name, Linnaeus). Ray defined the <i>species</i> as an assemblage of
		individuals derived from similar parents and able to pass these to the next
		generation. Linnaeus contributed by using the binomial names for groupings,
		insisting on the use of Latin as the learned naming scheme. The first name
		should be the <i>genus</i> or broad grouping, the second is the species name.
		<i>Felis</i> was used for house cats and smaller members: <i>Felis
			domestica</i>, house cat; <i>Felis pardalis</i>, ocelot; <i>Felis rufa</i>,
		bobcat. The large cats were <i>Panthera</i>: <i>Panthera leo</i>, lion;
		<i>Panthera tigris</i>, tiger. These Latin or Latinized names are followed by a
		designating letter or letters to indicate the nomenclator or system being used,
		often the first person to give the name. 'L.' is used for Linnaeus.
	</p>
	<p>
		Linnaeus found two great kingdoms: <b>animals</b> (<q>are bodies organized, and
			have life, sensation, and the power of locomotion</q> from <i>System
			Naturae</i>, 1750) and <b>plants</b> (<q>are bodies organized, and have life and
			not sensation</q>). There are no absolutely satisfactory criteria for deciding
		whether an organism is plant or animal; philosophical debates continue.
		Linnaeus also used higher groupings than genus: <i>order</i> and <i>class</i>,
		with an order being a grouping of genera and class being a grouping of orders.
		Linnaeus formed 6 classes: mammals, birds, amphibians, fishes, insects, and
		worms. Within mammals were 7 orders, only one of which, the Primates, survives
		in the present system.
	</p>
	<p>
		Modifications to the present hierarchical classification include the use of
		<i>family</i> formed from grouping genera (instead of the <i>order</i>); orders
		are now groupings of families. The highest grouping is now the <i>phylum</i>,
		which becomes a grouping of classes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Examples include the phylum Chordata, which are animals which are one time or
		throughout development show three characters:</p>
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
		<li>a rod-like skeletal structure in the mid-dorsal line called a
			<i>notochord</i>;
		</li>
		<li>a dorsal hollow <i>neural tube</i>;
		</li>
		<li>openings between the endodermal pharynx and the ectoderm, the <i>pharyngeal
				clefts</i>.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Three subphyla can be formed from groupings of classes in this phylum,
		Vertebrata being one. The principal subphylum characteristic is possession of a
		vertebral column. The 7 (living) classes in Vertebrata are Agnatha (lampreys
		and hagfishes), Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes; all have gills and fins as
		appendages), Osteichthyes (bony fishes), Amphibia (salamanders, frogs: smooth
		skin, gills in larval stage, lungs in adult); Reptilia (turtles, lizards,
		snakes, crocodiles (scaly skin, all lung breathers), Aves (birds; feathers as
		skin, winged forelimbs), Mammalia (mammary glands, hair-covered skin).

	<h2>Criteria for Animal Classification</h2>
	<p>
		With at least 1 million different animals seems difficult. Actually to the level
		of phylum and class it is easy. Orders, families, genera, and species are more
		difficult. The criteria for putting an animal into a proper phylum is indicated
		below.

	</p>
	<h3 class="part2">Number of Cells</h3>
	<p>
		The phylum protozoa (also considered a subkingdom) are animals which are single
		celled or existing as colonies of undifferentiated cells. Multicellular animals
		(the Metazoa) show cell differentiation and division of labor. 25 metazoan
		phyla are recognized.

	</p>
	<h3 class="part2">Germ Layer Number</h3>
	<p>
		Among the metazoan phyla, <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> embryonic layers may form.
		In one class (Hydrozoa) of the phylum Coelenterata, the organisms are
		<i>diploblastic</i>, meaning they give rise only to an endo- and ectoderm in the
		adult. The Porifera give rise to two cell layers but they are not
		embryologically homologous to and endoderm and ectoderm (so they are not
		diploblastic). Parasites in the Mesozoa do not qualify as well since bodies
		develop an external layer with a single multinucleate mass within which are not
		characteristic of endoderm and ectoderm. In the other two Coelenterata classes
		and the higher phyla, a <i>triploblastic</i> organism with an <i>endoderm</i>,
		<i>mesoderm</i>, and <i>ectoderm</i> is the rule.

	</p>
	<h3 class="part2">Alimentary Canal Development and Number of Openings</h3>
	<p>
		All metazoans grouped higher than sponges possess a digestive cavity
		save certain parasitic organisms) wherein substances are
		secreted into the cavity to break down foreign substances for nutrient
		absorption by the organism. In sponges, all digestion is intracellular.
		Of the animals with digestive cavities, some have only one opening
		(<i>mouth</i> or <i>os</i>), typical of Coelenterata and Platyhelminthes.
		The other phyla show another opening (<i>anus</i>).

	</p>
	<h3 class="part2">Coelom Presence</h3>
	<p>
		Triploblastic organisms above the flatworms develop a cavity
		between the body wall (surface) and the gut. In the Acanthocephala,
		Aschelminthes, and Entoprocta, this cavity does not form from mesoderm
		and is called a <i>pseudocoelom</i>. In all others, it forms from
		the mesoderm and is called a coelom. In Mollusca, Arthropoda, and
		three small phyla related to arthropods, the coelom is greatly reduced.

	</p>
	<h3 class="part2">Segmentation</h3>
	<p>
		The three highest animal phyla show a feature called <i>segmentation</i>
		or <i>metamerism</i>, which is a linear repetition of parts. This is obvious
		in Annelida or Arthropoda (grasshopper). In Chordata, the segmentation is
		retained internally (cranial and spinal nerve extension, muscle development,
		vertebrae) and is apparently embryologically as <i>mesodermal somites</i>.

	</p>
	<h3 class="part2">Skeleton</h3>
	<p>
		Serves in protection, support of locomotion in most
		multicellular animals. Chordates have <i>endoskeletons</i>, while mollusks and
		arthropods show <i>exoskeletons</i>. Note well that while Vertebrata is a true
		name in systematic classification, the invertebrates referred collectively has
		no official significance and is intended to exclude animals which are not
		invertebrates.

	</p>
	<h3 class="part2">Appendages</h3>
	<p>
		Structures protruding from the body (torso) and used in
		locomotion and feeding. These can be <i>tentacles</i> (encircling mouths of
		coelenterates), <i>parapodia</i> (of annelids), <i>muscular foot</i> (of
		mollusks), <i>legs</i> (in arthropod), <i>fins</i>, <i>legs</i> and <i>wings</i>
		(of vertebrates). The limbs of all arthropods and vertebrates are <i>jointed</i>.

	</p>
	<h3 class="part2">Symmetry</h3>
	<p>
		Most animals are either <i>radially</i> or <i>bilaterally</i>
		symmetrical, although some are asymmetrical. Among other things, the
		development of a bilateral symmetry was the result of or the cause of more
		efficient locomotion in animals. Radially symmetrical organisms include the
		Porifera, Coelenterata, and ctenophores, which have no bilateral points of reference
		(anterior, posterior, ventral, dorsal) and are sessile if not slowly moving,
		have what are called <i>basal</i> and <i>oral</i> ends. The Echinodermata
		represent a peculiar transition: as embryos they show bilateral symmetry, but
		as adults the symmetry becomes radial.

	</p>
	<h2>Problems in Classification</h2>
	<p>
		Taxonomic studies have changed from being examination of
		purely adult forms to studying embryological forms and examining evolution of
		the homologous characteristics. Philosophical arguments have emerged about
		placing other life forms other than animals. Haeckel proposed a third kingdom
		called <i>Protista</i> (<q>first ones</q>) to include protozoa and the thallophytes
		(algae, fungi, bacteria, and slime molds). The kingdom <i>Monera</i> has also
		been proposed to separate the bacteria and blue green algae from the eukaryotes
		in Protista.
	</p>
	<p>
		Under Linnaeus, each species was a fixed entity and
		considered in terms of a <b><i>type</i></b> or <i><b>archetype</b></i>, in
		which variations of individuals were ignored. With adoption of an evolutionary
		point of view, the type is retained, but not as an abstraction, but rather a
		specimen found in a museum or herbarium. Specimens in question are then
		compared with the museum archetype for resemblance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Still what is a species? The following is a definition
		advanced by E. Mayr: s<i>pecies are groups of actually or potentially
			interbreeding populations, which are reproductively isolated
			from other groups</i>. The emphasis here is on a species being
		a population of organisms, and knowing the range of variation
		in the different characteristics of a group is essential.
	</p>
	<p>
		Typically though a specialist must classify a dead specimen
		far removed from its natural habitat, depending entirely on comparing
		structural features to the known descriptions, including
		in his determination the range of variation known for the species.
	</p>
	<p>
		In many cases, individuals grouped in the same species have been found not to
		interbreed. Frog members of <i>Rana pipiens</i> (common grass frog) taken from
		Texas and mated to members from Minnesota do not produce viable offspring,
		showing that wide geographic separation leads to significant infraspecific
		variation.

	</p>
	<p>
		Defining what members belong to a species by reproductive isolation is
		comparatively easy to grouping animals which cannot be checked for interbreeding
		ability. Arguments over the classification of barnacles, sea squirts, and the
		crab parasite, <i>Sacculina</i>, have arisen. Observing these animals at various
		stages of their development (life cycle) would put them into the same group,
		then an entirely different group (phylum). Barnacles would appear to be
		mollusks, but at one point they resemble crustaceans; sea squirts are sessile
		and look like cellophane bags, but at another stage of the life cycle, they show
		a notochord and are chordates; <i>Sacculina</i> as an adult has no hard parts,
		appendages, or gut, but shows characteristic crustacean development.

	</p>
	<p>
		Other factors differentiating species are cytological and
		metabolic. Chromosome karyotyping reveals differences in
		appearance and number of chromosomes between species even
		in the same genus (<i>Drosophila</i> is an example).
		Differences in biochemical pathways can be a clue to differentiation.
		A technique developed by E. T. Bolton is DNA hybridization
		quantitation, which seeks to measure the genetic relatedness between species
		using radioactive probes. A graph of percent similarity vs time
		since predicted divergence correlates very well with our belief
		in this theory.

	</p>
	<h2>Kinds of Vertebrates</h2>
	<p>
		Additional characteristics for vertebrates in addition to
		the three basic chordate characters are (d) a brain case; (e) segmentally
		arranged vertebrae. The fourth character is why the subphylum Vertebrata is
		also called Craniata. The notochord is replaced by a cartilaginous or bony
		segmented protection for the neural tube.
	</p>
	<p>
		The seven living classes of vertebrates are (1) Agnatha,
		(2) Chondrichthyes, (3) Osteichthyes; these being fishes
		are also grouped into a superclass Pisces; (4) Amphibia,
		(5) Reptilia, (6) Aves, (7) Mammalia; these last four
		forming a superclass Tetrapoda (four-legged).

	</p>
	<p class="class-level">
		Class Agnatha (‘without jaws')
	</p>
	<p>
		Oldest and most primitive vertebrates are the <i>lampreys</i>
		and <i>hagfishes</i>, also called <b><i>cyclostomes</i></b>
		as they have rounded mouths. (Although lampreys are called
		‘lamprey eels,' they are not true eels.)
		They are only vertebrates truly without jaws, and they are the
		only parasitic vertebrates.
	</p>
	<p>
		The mouth of lampreys is surrounded by a sucking disc on the ventral
		side of the anterior end. Lampreys use the toothlike projections to
		clasp to the body of fish, rasp through the host skin and suck
		blood and body fluids, damaging fish in large numbers.
		Both freshwater and marine forms are known, although all forms
		migrate to freshwater for spawning. Hagfish have a similar
		sucking disc as well, but they eat their way into and through the
		bodies of fish, doing so usually on injured fish.
	</p>
	<p>
		The notochord persists in the adult cyclostome, with rudimentary vertebrae
		consisting of cartilaginous arches surrounding the nerve cord. They have a
		cartilaginous skeleton, are scaleless, with paired fins or skeletal girdles.
		Like the extinct ostracoderms (first known vertebrates) they lack jaws and
		paired fins but are distinct in the ostracoderms had a bony skeleton, had
		scales, and were not parasites (not possible since they were the first
		vertebrate; they likely fed on mud &amp; detritus).
	</p>
	<p>
		Ammocoete larva of the lamprey are studied in vertebrate anatomy because it
		shows a primitive chordate structure similar to the cephalochordate
		<i>Amphioxus</i>, and Cephalochordata and Agnatha likely have a common origin.

	</p>
	<p class="class-level">
		Class Chondrichthyes (‘cartilaginous fishes')
	</p>
	<p>
		Also known as <b><i>elasmobranchs</i></b>. The
		cartilaginous skeleton in these fishes is actually thought to be a
		specialization diverging from ancestral bony fishes. Most are marine, and
		include the sharks and rays. Their ancestors were freshwater dwellers, showing
		the successful adaptation to sea life. Elasmobranchs retain large amounts of
		urea to maintain blood osmolarity. They have no swim bladder present in bony
		fishes, and they have biting jaws and paired fins. The mouth is ventral and
		removed from the very anterior end. Five external gill openings are visible on
		either side of the pharynx. <i>Placoid scales</i> on the skin are
		similar to the teeth in structure.

	</p>
	<p class="class-level">
		Class Osteichthyes (‘bony fishes')

	</p>
	<p>
		In the Devonian they arose from the ancestral <i>placoderms</i>
		(scaly skin). Adults have a bony skeleton, the brain encased in many plates
		forming a skull. Paired fins; well-developed jaws with a mouth fully
		anterior. Gills are covered by a hinged bony plate (<i>operculum</i>) on each
		side of the pharynx. Cycloid or ctenoid scales overlap like roof shingles. A <b><i>swim</i></b>
		<b><i>bladder</i></b> arising as a diverticulum of the pharynx, which the fish
		uses to maintain buoyancy and position in the water. In some groups this
		connection with the pharynx is retained and the bladder serves as a respiratory
		organ.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b><i>teleosts</i></b> form one large grouping (16,000 spp.)
		which include bass, perch, herring, and trout. They developed
		independently from the early osteichthyans, and are found in every aquatic
		environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <i>Dipnoi</i> or <b><i>lungfishes</i></b> form a smaller
		group, with functional lungs <i>and </i>gills. There is evidence that the
		ancestral primitive osteichthyans had both lungs and gills. In teleosts, the
		lung became the swim bladder, but in this group has persisted as functional
		respiratory organs. Only five species of lungfish persist today (one in Australia, one in South America, three in Africa). These regions have both wet and dry seasons. In
		the dry season, the lungfish burrows in the mud, secretes a mucus to mix with
		the mud and form a cocoon. The cocoon has small holes around it to permit gas
		exchange. The dormancy period of the animal is called <b><i>estivation</i></b>.
		If the burrow fills with rain water, the cocoon dissolves and the fish swims
		away.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <i>Crossopterygii</i> or <b><i>lobe-finned fishes</i></b>
		form the third major group in this class. It was believed that this group had
		been extinct for millions of years until 1939 when a specimen from <i>Latimeria</i>
		was caught. This group is thought to represent an important transition to land
		dwelling: they have functional lungs, nostrils opening into a mouth cavity,
		and the bones in elongated fins are homologous to legs in primitive
		amphibians. They may have used their fins to crawl from one body of water over
		land to another.

	</p>
	<p class="class-level">
		Class Amphibia
	</p>
	<p>
		The age of amphibians was considered to be in the late Paleozoic
		since the number of kinds existing today is considered small to the
		number that lived then. Only three orders in this class are present
		today: (1) Urodela or Caudata, which are the tailed amphibians being
		newts and salamanders; (2) Salienta or Anura, the tail-less amphibians
		being frogs and toads; (3) Gymnophonia or Apoda, a few legless,
		nearly blind kinds living in the tropics burrowing in moist soil.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first land-dwelling vertebrates which did not completely
		free itself from the water; some salamanders are aquatic and never live on
		land. Nearly all amphibians return to water to reproduce. Frogs, toads, and
		some salamanders are terrestrial as adults while larvae are fish-like with
		gills. Metamorphosis is not extensive in salamanders as it is in frogs and
		toads. Despite having lungs for breathing air, respiration is also afforded by
		a smooth moist skin, being a feature of amphibians which means they are never
		far from water. Toads have thicker skins than frogs or salamanders and can
		venture farther from water but do not survive in hot dry places.

	</p>
	<p>Formation of limbs are observed rather than fins, yet the
		limbs are not designed to carry the body's full weight. The tail-less toads
		and frogs have highly developed jumping limbs and are the most specialized.
		The amphibians today are more specialized than their more ancestral
		primitives. It is likely primitive amphibians possessed dermal plates or
		scales which have disappeared today.

	</p>
	<p class="class-level">
		Class Reptilia

	</p>
	<p>
		The first completely terrestrial vertebrates, they evolved from primitive
		amphibian ancestors. They have dry, scaly skin which usually has an underlying
		armor of <i>dermal plates</i>, which prevents dessication in hot climates. The
		lungs are more highly developed than in amphibians, with heart and pulmonary
		circulation more specialized. Essentially a complete four-chambered heart (the
		ventricles are only completely separated in crocodiles), there is very little
		mixing of venous or arterial blood nonetheless. The limbs are larger and more
		powerful than in amphibians, and the internal organs are protected by ribs.

	</p>
	<p>
		The greatest evolutionary changes may be related to reproduction. Fertilization
		is completely internal as reptiles were first to develop a penis. The egg is
		quite similar to the bird's, with a tough moisture-proof shell and a large yolk,
		with development in dry places afforded. The four extraembryonic membranes
		appear as in birds and mammals, and because reptilian, avian, and mammalian
		embryos all develop in amniotes, they are called amniotes.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the Mesozoic Era was the zenith of the age of reptiles, occupying all
		habitats on land and in water. 14 different orders emerged over this period,
		four of which survive today. In the order Chelonia are turtles and tortoises;
		in the order Crocodilia are the crocodiles and alligators; in the order Squamata
		are the lizards and snakes; and in the order Rhynchocephalia is the tuatara of
		New Zealand. The latter in the genus <i>Sphenodon</i> is the lone survivor of a
		very ancient reptile group. It is of interest because of a well-developed
		median eye and represents a primitive reptile. Some reptiles returned to the
		water although they are air breathers. Snakes are limbless, evolving from the
		limbless lizards; in some snakes such as pythons, vestigial structures of limbs
		and girdles remain.
	</p>
	<p>
		Reptiles, as well as fish and amphibians are <i>poikilotherms</i>, meaning their
		body temperature varies with the surrounding environment. One line of reptiles
		diverged to produce the mammals, another diverged to form the birds. Both these
		classes are <i>homeotherms</i>.

	</p>
	<p class="class-level">
		Class Aves

	</p>
	<p>
		Birds share many features with reptiles. Internal fertilization and avian egg
		structure and development are very similar. The hind limbs of birds are scaled
		similarly to the limbs of reptiles while forelimbs are modified for flight.
		Feathers are scale modifications, reducing water and heat loss on the body, and
		necessary for flight in the wings and tail. Birds can remain active in cold
		environments unlike reptiles. The avian heart is completely four-chambered.
		All flying birds show well-developed pectoral muscles and a high ridge on the
		sternum. Bones are very hollow.

	</p>
	<p>
		27 living orders are found, and birds are extensively spread around largely
		because of their ability to fly. More than half of the known species of living
		birds belong to the order Passeriformes, the perching birds. Four orders have
		vestigial wings and are flightless: ostriches, rheas, emus, and kiwis.

	</p>
	<p class="class-level">
		Class Mammalia

	</p>
	<p>
		The distinctive features are: <i>mammary glands</i>, <i>hair</i>, <i>sweat
			glands</i>, and differentiation of teeth into <i>incisors</i>, <i>canines</i>,
		and <i>molars</i>. A <i>diaphragm</i> exists only in these vertebrates to
		separate the thoracic and pericardial cavities from the abdominal. They share
		with birds the four-chambered heart, and they share with birds and reptiles
		amniotic development. The cerebrum of the brain is much more highly developed.
		Mammals are subdivided into two subclasses, the Prototheria or egg-laying
		mammals, and the Theria (viviparous). The subclass Theria is further divided
		into the infraclass Metatheria (pouched mammals) and the Eutheria (placental
		mammals).

	</p>
	<p>
		The monotremes (Prototheria) consist of the duckbilled platypus and the spiny
		anteater, both found in Australia and Tasmania. Embryos hatch from eggs, then
		feed upon any of numerous mammary glands on the female's belly. In the
		marsupials (Metatheria) a <i>marsupium</i> (pouch) carries all of the young on
		the abdomen of the female. Marsupials were very widespread in ancient times
		according to the fossil evidence, but today are found only in the U.S.
		(opossum), South America, and Australia (kangaroo, wombat, koala bears,
		phalangers). Once the young are born they must claw their way to the pouch to
		continue development.

	</p>
	<p>
		95% of mammals today are placental. Development remains in
		the body of the female.

	</p>
	<h2>Vertebrate Evolution</h2>
	<p>
		In the Ordovician Period is evidence of the peculiar scales
		in the ostracoderms. Evidence demonstrates that they also lived in the
		Silurian Period too, and more complete remains dates them to the Devonian.
		They had jawless mouths and no paired fins as in lampreys. The Devonian was
		essentially the age of fishes. Ostracoderms flourished during the Devonian but
		disappeared at the end of the period except for the cyclostomes today.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the late Silurian the primitive ostracoderms give rise to
		the placoderms (class Placodermi), jawed vertebrates with paired appendages,
		scale-covered body, and a bony skeleton. They were abundant in the Devonian
		but most became extinct at the end of the period.
	</p>
	<p>
		Jaw development is generally viewed as a modification of
		gill arches, which are skeletal structures supporting the body wall anterior
		and posterior to each gill slit. How the paired appendages developed is more
		difficult: some evidence indicates they derived from elongate finfolds present
		in fossils. Each continuous finfold is supposed to break up into separate
		fins, in which ultimately two persist, the pectoral and pelvic fins.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cartilaginous and bony fishes evolve from placoderms in
		the Devonian, which replace the placoderms. The crossopterygians is a group
		from the bony fishes which then diverges to produce the amphibians. Fossil
		evidence shows that <i>Icthyostega</i> from the late Devonian had a blend of
		crossopterygian and amphibian characters.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the Mississippian Period are a large number of primitive
		amphibians, the <i>labyrinthodonts</i>. Heads covered with an armor of bony
		plates resembling the head cover of the crossopterygians, they did not much
		resemble the present-day amphibians. From the labyrinthodonts come the
		reptiles. Fossils from the late Pennsylvanian show characters of both reptiles
		and amphibians, <i>Seymouria</i> being a good example. A fossil reptilian egg
		had been found and dated to the end of the Pennsylvanian. True reptiles
		emerged in the Permian Period and were the cotylosaurs (stem reptiles), from
		which all higher vertebrates evolved. The therapsids

	</p>
	<h2>The Evolution of Humans</h2>
	<p>
		(The following information abstracted from M. D. Lemonick, <q>How Man Began,</q>
		<i>TIME</i>, vol. 143., no. 11, p. 40, Mar. 1994.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Neanderthal man was first discovered in 1856 in the Germany valley so named.
		Yet this is sparse evidence of how humans evolved, how he migrated to become
		modern humans. New evidence seems forthcoming which indicates <i>Homo
			sapiens</i> is older than at first thought. Chinese scientists claim to have
		discovered that a skull found about 10 years ago is at least 200,000 years old,
		more than twice as old as the finds on record. This human-looking skull sets
		aside the belief that evolved from Africa alone; humans may have emerged in
		several places. Other anthropologists have also re-dated skull fragments
		believed to be from <i>Homo erectus</i> found at Java, and these fossils may be
		about 2 million years old rather than 1 million. <i>Homo erectus</i> was likely
		to be the first to use fire and create sophisticated stone tools.

	</p>
	<p>
		A hypothesis is set forth that <i>Homo erectus</i>
		evolved into an African and Asian environment. A competitive theory emerges in
		which Asian man or African man evolved into Homo sapiens.
	</p>
	<p>
		The current understanding is that a primate forerunner was
		<i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> who emerged about 4 million years ago.
		The famous skeletal find called <q>Lucy</q> by
		its discoverer, Donald Johanson, who found it in Ethiopia in 1974,
		is <i>A. afarensis</i>. From <i>A. afarensis</i>, a divergent
		population then gave rise to <i>Australopithecus africanus</i>
		about 3 million years ago. At this time, <i>A. afarensis</i>
		probably died out Another divergent population
		of <i>A. afarensis</i> gave rise to two species variants,
		<i>Paranthropus boisei</i>, which emerged 2.5 million years
		ago and probably continued for 1.5 million years before it
		died out, and the related <i>Paranthropus robustus</i>,
		which emerged1.9 million years ago and died out 1.5 million years ago,
		surviving only a brief period. The <i>Paranthropus</i> group
		represented an evolutionary dead-end.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand <i>A. africanus</i> likely continued for
		about a million years, yielding to a population split from it
		which became <i>Homo habilis</i>. <i>Homo habilis</i> emerges
		about the time <i>A. africanus</i> dies out (2.5 million years ago).
		Also emerging, likely from a population derived from <i>H. habilis</i>
		is <i>Homo erectus</i>, about 1.8-2 million years ago.
		As <i>H. habilis</i> fades out after only a half million years,
		it is <i>H. erectus</i> which continues for more than 1.5
		million years. Populations of <i>H. erectus</i> split off to form the
		derivatives which are exemplified in Neanderthal man
		(<i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>). <i>Homo sapiens</i> likely
		emerges from another population of <i>H. erectus</i>,

			Solid, two-layer cellular construction with inner cells having

		</p>
		<p>
			First discovered in 1839, this group of animals is puzzling
			insofar as understanding of phylogeny. The name implies that there is more
			complexity than to protozoa, but less than in Metazoa; this was the reasoning
			of van Beneden who named them in 1877. It appears that some of the complexity
			these animals may have had has been lost as they adapt to parasitism (a common
			feature of all parasites). Some class them in Coelenterata because of
			planula-like larva, others in Platyhelminthes since they appear to be
			degenerate flatworms. If they truly represent a transition between protozoa
			and metazoa, this disputes the theory by Haeckel of blastuaea and gastraea.

		</p>
		<p>Parasites in nephridia of octopus and squid, but an
			intermediate host is likely. A small and constant number of cells (~25)
			forming round a single reproductive cell is common to the life cycle and is
			called a <i>nematogen</i>. In the interior a single reproductive cell divides
			mitotically to produce <i>agametes</i> (called so because divisions are not
			meiotic reductions). An asexual phase may occur in a host intermediate.
			Agametes leave the nematogen to become new nematogens, maturing to produce
			more. Sexually mature hosts induce a change in nematogens or agametes to
			become <i>rhombogens</i>, which are ciliated free-living larvae-like forms
			which leave the host via the kidney ducts. It is believed these larvae enter
			another kind of host and little is known about the subsequent process.

			These are rare parasites in various vertebrates (flatworms,

			multinucleate, amoeboid form. Fragmentation produces new plasmodia, but
			development of agametes can result in formation of one (or in some cases two)
			kind of form which is either <i>male</i> or <i>female</i>. These multicellular
			males and females leave the host body and fertilization is marked by
			insemination by the male into a genital opening in the female. A ciliated
			larval form develops with the female form, becomes liberated, finds a new host,
			then will give rise to a new plasmodium.

		</p>
		<p>
			Characters of the phylum include:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>No true tissues or organs; body shape flat, vase-like,
				rounded, or branched.
			</li>
			<li>No digestive tract or mouth.
			</li>

			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Although there are three classes of sponges, they are marked
			more by their similarity rather than by their differences. Most are gray
			(‘drab') in color, but some have brilliant colors: red, orange, yellow, blue,
			violet, or black. Sponges are found in arctic and tropical seas, in low tide
			lines to depths of 5000 m. Originally classified as plants, but thought to be
			animals in 1765; placed in animal kingdom in 1857. Resemble the
			choanoflagellate protozoans (<i>Proterospongia</i>). Because they represent a
			wide divergence from metazoans, they are often classed as Parazoa.
		</p>
		<p>
			Morphologically there are many body types. Some sponges
			have a developmental stage called a <b><i>olynthus</i></b>, which is a
			vase-shaped structure in which an outer layer is composed of <i>pinacocytes</i>,
			which the large inner cavity (<i>spongocoel</i>) is lined with choanocytes.
			Porocytes occur at intervals and have intracellular pores to connect spongocoel
			and outside. Water entering via porocytic holes enters the spongocoel and
			leaves by an <i>osculum</i> at the top of the sponge body. Water currents are
			produced to move through the sponge body by choanocyte flagella. Water flow
			through the body is controlled by porocytes, which can close the pore in the
			event of a hostile environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Between the cell layers is a jelly-like <b><i>mesoglea</i></b>
			holding other cell types. <i>Amoebocytes</i> are wandering cells carrying
			nutrients (like storage cells) from one part of the sponge to the other, also
			collecting wastes. <i>Scleroblasts</i> form the skeletal elements and
			spicules. They begin to form monaxon spicule, divide into two cells, a <i>founder</i>
			which forms the basic shape of the spicule and a <i>thickener</i> moving back
			and forth over it to lay down more material. The number of axons on a spicule
			is related to the number of scleroblasts needed to form it: hence a triaxon
			spicule is formed by three scleroblasts. <i>Spongioblasts</i> are the cells
			making spongin fibers, which are protein similar to keratin (the protein in
			hair), silk, and collagen. Spongioblasts line up side-by-side, and when fibers
			are fused, the cells degenerate. Spongin secreted as an amorphous mass instead
			of fibers is used to cement the sponge body to a substratum. <i>Archeocytes</i>
			in the mesoglea serve a reproductive function.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other body types from the olynthus include the <b><i>ascon</i></b>,
			typified by the Leucoselenia, a common calcareous sponge. Similar to olynthus
			with respect to its porocytes, epidermal cells, and choanocytes within the
			spongocoel, but with a thicker body wall, and the body is more elongate.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <b><i>sycon</i></b> body type (in <i>Scypha</i>) in
			which folding of the cell layers occurs; the folding is really a corrugation
			of the cell layers. This form <i>incurrent canals</i> where the fold
			contacts water on the outside, and <i>excurrent</i> or <i>radial canals</i>
			where the water in the fold opens to spongocoel. Water enters the incurrent
			canal through an opening in the fold (<i>ostium</i>), then passes through an
			opening in the sponge wall (<i>prosopyle</i>) and into the radial canal. It
			leaves the radial canal at its opening (<i>apopyle</i>) and into the
			spongocoel; later it leaves the sponge body by the osculum. Intracellular
			pores formed by porocytes are absent; however, pore formation starts via
			intracellular pores in porocytes, which later degenerate to form holes in the
			epidermis.
		</p>
		<p>
			An even more complex body type is the <b><i>leucon</i></b>.
			Choanocytes are embedded in the body wall and into numerous cavities called <i>flagellated</i>
			<i>chambers</i>. Water passes into ostia into incurrent canals which connect
			to numerous prosopyles which connect to flagellated chambers, and exits the
			chamber by a single apopyle to an excurrent canal, many of which connect to a
			main excurrent canal. The main excurrent canal (note there is no well-defined
			spongocoel) then is in contact with an <i>osculum</i>, many which penetrate the
			body wall for water exit.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Nutrition and Metabolism</b>. Choanocytes start the
			currents of water that move through the body and they capture the food
			(ingested at the base of their collars). If the food is not digested and used
			by the choanocyte, it is passed to amoebocytes, these cells completing
			digestion and moving the processed food to other cells. Some minerals and
			other substances are taken by all cells themselves from the water. Respiratory
			gases occurs with the water present. While excretion involves simple
			diffusion, amoebocytes can pick up some. The ascon to leucon type of body is
			supposedly an adaptation to increase the efficiency of food gathering and excretion.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Defense</b>. Sponges defend themselves from predators by
			their spicule skeleton and by chemical substances producing odors or which are
			toxic. There is no nervous system in the animal and individual cells respond
			as independent agents. <i>Myocytes</i> are epidermal cells with contractile
			properties which can close the ostia (in body plans with ostia) as they form a
			ring around the opening. Still it is a local response and is not transmitted
			to the entire sponge.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Reproduction</b>. Reproduction of one type is asexual,
			by budding. If the body become fragmented, sponges show a regenerative
			capacity. Studies show that small groups of cells will organize and grow into
			a normal individual. In freshwater and some marine forms, as the autumn season
			approaches archeocytes form a mass in the mesoglea, storing food reserves;
			other amoeboid cells secrete a thick membrane around the archeocytic mass, and
			scleroblasts form special spicules (<i>amphidiscs</i>), all of which are later
			surrounded by an outer membrane. The final structure is a <i>gemmule</i>, and
			it has a single opening called a <i>micropyle</i>. When the parent dies, the
			gemmules withstand harsh winter environments. Archeocytes then move out
			through the micropyle and regenerate (asexually) a sponge as occurs with
			fragmentation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sexual reproduction occurs as well. Classically sperm and
			egg gametes develop from archeocytes. Although monoecious (hermaphroditic),
			self-fertilization is rare since the gametogenesis for both gametes is not at
			the same time. The sperm float free and enter the sponge to find an egg in the
			body wall. Cleavage occurs and results in a flagellated blastula which enters
			the canals and out of the osculum. The free-swimming stage is brief, and the
			larva differentiate. Two types of larva: (1) <i>amphiblastula</i>--marked by
			a reduced blastocoel and flagellated cells at the anterior end; after settling
			to the bottom, proliferation of nonflagellated posteriorly located cells is
			enhanced, and flagellated cells are pushed inward to develop into choanocytes;
			this type typical in most calcareous sponges. (2) <i>parenchymula</i>--a larva
			in the early stages showing a blastocoel bounded by many flagellated cells with
			a few aflagellate cells at the posterior; before larva escapes, posterior
			cells have moved into coel and proliferated to make it solid; these will move
			out and encircle flagellated cells; typical of freshwater Demospongiae.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Ecology</b>. Sponges show mutualistic relationships with
			many species. Intracellular algal forms (<i>zoochlorellae</i>) can be found
			within amoebocytes. The decorator crab (Dromia) fastens bits of sponge to its
			carapace for camouflage. The canals of some large horny sponges are homes for
			shrimps and other small crustaceans, worms of several phyla, brittle stars, and
			even small fish.
		</p>
		<p>
			The poriferans represent probably the simplest metazoans.
			They are not in the direct line of evolution, representing instead a widely
			divergent branch (evolutionary ‘dead end'). Choanoflagellates are their
			ancestors, in all probability, and the choanocytes distinguish porifera from
			other phyla. In addition, lack of a digestive system and unique embryological
			development put them in another subkingdom, for no other metazoan shows this
			form.

			It is the first phylum in the branch Eumetazoa, a branch
			including the rest of the animal kingdom. Coelenterates (sometimes called
			Cnidaria because of the law of priority) and ctenophores belong to the grade
			Radiata as they are the only forms possessing radial symmetry. Linnaeus
			originally classed them with echinoderms in his group Radiata. Leuckart (1847)
			placed the sponges, coelenterates, and ctenophores into a single group
			Coelenterata, and Hatschek (1888) later distinguished them as phyla: Porifera,
			Cnidaria, and Ctenophora, resp.

		</p>
		<p>The Hydrozoa and Anthozoa show up in the fossil record at
			about the time of the Cambrian, while some impressions of Scyphozoa also appear
			in the Cambrian, Permian, and Jurassic rock beds. The Tabulata, an extinct
			group likely to be a subclass of Anthozoa, were colonial forms with tubular
			body tubes and many cross partitions pierced with pores; they appear to have
			thrived between the Lower Ordovician and the Permian. The Stromatoporidea
			(includes the genus <i>Stromatopora</i>) were likely related to Hydrozoa; they
			lived between the Cambrian and Cretaceous periods, leaving masses of wavy
			calcareous plates that persist as ocean reefs.

		</p>
		<p>Another extinct class, the Graptolithina, includes the genus
			Dictyonema and thrived from the Upper Cambrian to the Carboniferous. They had
			hollow stem-type bodies connected by stolons at the base. Their similarity to
			the hemichordate <i>Rhabdopleura</i> suggests that they may have been
			hemichordates, but evidence of a circle of tentacles and no anal opening may
			suggest they were a coelenterate form.

		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Hydrozoa</span>

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Hydra
		</p>
		<p>
			A few freshwater spp. with the most common being <i>Hydra</i>
			and diverse spp. being found in streams all over the world.
			Usually not more than 1.5 cm in length. Typically anchored
			to substratum because of cementing substances secreted by
			glandular cells of the <i>basal disc</i> (on aboral end).
			Body is simple tubular polyp. Free end (oral) of polyp body has
			a conical <i>hypostome</i>, having <i>mouth</i> in center.
			6-10 slender tentacles around mouth serve food-gathering function;
			these increase in number with animal age or size or both.
			Inner body cavity called <i>gastrovascular cavity</i> (<i>enteron</i>)
			since it is involved in digestion and circulation. Body is
			composed of outer layer <i>ectoderm</i> (old term <i>epidermis</i>)
			and inner layer <i>endoderm</i> (old term <i>gastrodermis</i>)
			and thin layer of jelly-like mesoglea in between. Ectodermal cells
			are <i>epitheliomuscular cells</i>, and have elongated base and
			contractile fibers which run lengthwise. Endodermal cells are
			<i>nutritive-muscular</i> cells, with fibers running at right angles
			to fibers in the ectoderm (i.e., circular). Fiber contraction
			in the ectoderm causes shortening or bending in the very
			flexible and bendable body, while in the endoderm, body constriction or
			lengthening occurs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scattered in ectoderm are <i>cnidoblasts</i>, which hold
			structures called <i>nematocysts</i>, fluid-filled capsules holding
			a long, spirally coiled, hollow thread. A <i>cnidocil</i>
			is present on the cnidoblast as a fine projection, which is
			a trigger that when stimulated, ejects the nematocyst which
			in some species can penetrate the food animal stimulating it,
			and in others wrap the thread to entangle the organism.
			It has been thought that mechanical stimulation of the cnidocil
			induces discharge, but experiments show such stimulation is ineffective.
			It is now believed that the cnidocil is sensitive to diffusible
			chemical substances from prey animals induce reaction,
			high concentrations indicating the prey is near to the animal.
			There are four kinds of nematocysts: (1) <i>penetrants</i>,
			which contain long, transversely coiled threads which penetrate
			the enemy's skin and inject a toxin; (2) <i>volvents</i>,
			which are pear-shaped containing thick threads coiling tightly
			around the bristles or hair on prey; (3) <i>streptoline glutinants</i>,
			having long threads with minute thorns; and
			(4) <i>stereoline glutinants</i>, have a straight unarmed thread.
			The theories involving nematocyst discharge include (i) an increase
			in hydrostatic pressure and (ii) contractile fibers
			surrounding the capsule providing the force. Once discharged,
			a nematocyst can never be ‘re-charged,' but the cnidoblast
			is replaced by new cnidoblasts developing from the interstitium.
			Many cnidoblasts are concentrated in groups near tentacles called
			<i>batteries</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Receptor cells</i> are elongated sensory cells in
			both layers which have bases composed of neurofibers in contact
			with underlying nerve cells located near the ectoderm. Nerve cells
			form a <i>nerve net</i> in the animal. Rounded cells at the base
			of differentiated cells in both layers are called
			<i>interstitial cells</i> and are pluripotential cells
			able to differentiate into any cell type the organism may need; they also
			participate in reproduction, playing a role in <i>gonad</i> and bud formation.
			Interstitial cells are necessary in the regenerative powers of damaged or
			fragmented animals. Nutritive-muscular cells specialize in their functions:
			some secrete digestive enzymes, some extend pseudopodia to ingest particles,
			some have flagella used to circulate water in the gastrovascular cavity.
			<i>Gland cells</i> in the ectoderm, concentrated in basal disc
			of the hydra body, secrete substances to give the body a horny covering.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hydra capture small aquatic animals (minute crustaceans,
			insect larvae) by paralyzing them with nematocyst discharge, then distending
			its body wall to get the animal into the mouth. The prey (worm, small
			crustacean) can be much larger than the hydra. It is interesting to note that
			the chemical glutathione, release from the chambers of the nematocysts when
			they are discharged, induces mouth opening activity in the hydra. Digestion is
			both extracellular and intracellular: enzymes secreted into gastrovascular
			cavity breakdown the animal, and then particles and other substances are
			ingested into food vacuoles of cells. Processed food is passed to
			non-nutritive cells in the mesoglea and ectoderm if not used by the endodermal
			cells. Undigested material is expelled from the cavity. Gas exchange and
			excretion of waste is a matter of simple diffusion.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Reproduction</b>. Asexual reproduction is seen as a bud
			forming on well-fed hydra (it may have two or three in different stages) in
			which both body layers fold and form in the shape of a miniature hydra. The
			cavity of the small one is continuous with the large one, but a constriction at
			the base separates it from the parent eventually.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hydra can also form <i>testes</i> and <i>ovaries</i>, their
			formation being induced by a high aqueous CO<sub>2</sub>
			among other possible inductions. Some species show hermaphroditism,
			while others are dioecious. Interstitial cells proliferate to push
			the ectoderm out in bulges, with testes forming on the body's
			upper half, ovaries near the basal disc. Cells in the testes divide
			many times to form sperm; cells in ovaries fuse with all of the
			nuclei but one degenerating to form an egg. The egg
			breaks through the epidermis, but remains attached for a time as a
			single sperm (there is a polyspermy block) penetrates and fertilizes.
			<i>Cleavage</i>, followed by formation of a hollow ball <i>blastula</i>,
			followed by proliferation and migration of some cells into the cavity
			occurs to form a <i>gastrula</i>. The outer cell layer secretes
			a protective coat, then drops from the parent to
			a substratum, where it winters or may begin immediate development.
			The cell mass in the inner cavity spreads and proliferates to form
			an endoderm, and the animal matures.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Regeneration</b>. As is true for most animals that are
			the lowest in the phylogenetic scale�the least specialized�hydra
			can regenerate its form even when cut into numerous pieces,
			although the pieces re-form miniature hydras. (For this regenerative
			capacity it was given the name Hydra because it was like the mythical
			monster who regenerated two heads in place of the one cut off.)
			Presence of the pluripotential interstitial cells confers
			this regenerative ability.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Locomotion</b>. Hydra can glide along the substratum due
			to amoeboid movements in the basal cells. Another kind of motion,
			more rapid, is by somersaulting: the animal can bend and attach
			its tentacles, loosen its basal attachment, swing over, then re-attach.
			The tentacles attach in the somersaulting action by use of the
			glutinant nematocysts. In some cases, hydra can accumulate
			a gas bubble into the mucus of its disc, then rise and float on
			the surface. For most of its life the hydra remains attached to a surface.
			The white and brown hydra often remain fixed for long periods, but the green
			hydra moves often, especially for searching for food.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Behavior</b>. When stimulated with a needle, hydra are
			seen to contract into a very compact mass. When prey brush along its
			tentacles, the tentacles are seen to work the prey into the mouth. These
			sudden reactions are produced by a simple nerve net composed of sensory cells,
			nerve cells, and the contractile fibers in the ectodermal and endodermal
			cells. The excitable cells are not true neurons in the sense that they do not
			show changes in polarity, and the nerve network is not connected by synapses.
			Although the net is more extensive near the tentacles, it represents no central
			nervous system. The type of nervous system of hydra has been called a <i>receptor</i>-<i>effector</i>
			system.

		</p>
		<p>Hydra generally prefer colder waters. The avoid too
			strongly and weakly illuminated regions, but this may be related with its food
			source; the green hydra prefer a stronger light source, but only because the
			symbiotic photosynthetic organisms requiring light prefer it. When richly fed,
			in high temperature waters, in foul water, or other conditions, hydra lower
			their metabolic state (a <q>depression</q>), with shortening and gradual loss of
			tentacles.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Obelia
		</p>
		<p>
			Very related to <i>Hydra</i>, these are marine spp. with colonial
			existence. These grow typically in intertidal zone to depth of 9-10 m.
			While the colony appears as a number of hydra bodies attached to a common
			stalk base, some of the polyps (or zoids) have tentacles and are
			<i>nutritive polyps</i>, while others without tentacles are
			<i>reproductive polyps</i>. A root-like structure (<i>hydrorhiza</i>)
			anchors the colony to the substrate, as the polyps are attached to it.
			Upright branches (<i>hydrocauli</i>) extend from the hydrorhiza at
			intervals; the polyps are attached to these hydrocauli.
			The <i>perisarc</i> is a covering of chitin secreted by
			ectodermal cells, and around the nutritive polyps, it forms
			a distinctive cup shape called the <i>hydrotheca</i>;
			around the reproductive polyps, the shape is more like a vase
			with narrow neck called a <i>gonotheca</i>. At intervals,
			the perisarc is has rings which give flexibility for movement.
			The soft parts (the actual animals cells) within the perisarc
			are called the <i>coenosarc</i>, consisting of ectoderm, endoderm, and
			mesoglea. The gastrovascular cavity is continuous throughout the colony.
			A <i>manubrium</i> is a specialized elevation in the nutritive
			polyp which projects the mouth out from the hydrotheca. Normally
			tentacles and mouth extend from hydrotheca to capture food,
			but when disturbed, contract fully within the hard shell of the
			hydrotheca. Ingested food is distributed throughout the colony
			because of the common digestive cavity, assisted by flagellated
			endodermal cells. The nervous system is like that in <i>Hydra</i>.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Reproduction</b>. <i>Obelia</i> starts as a single
			nutritive polyp. It forms buds which also develop into nutritive
			polyps, but remaining attached to the parent. After a number have formed,
			reproductive polyps begin to appear as buds in the angle between
			the nutritive polyp bud and the hydrocaulus. In the core of
			the reproductive polyp is the <i>blastostyle</i>, and each
			blastostyle produces a series of button-shaped buds which mature,
			break off, and swim from the opening as <i>medusae</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Medusae appear as inverted polyps, umbrella-shaped, with
			manubrium and mouth extending downward. Tentacles encircle the outer edge of
			the body. There are anatomical differences, however. The gastrovascular
			cavity extends from the mouth into four <i>radiating canals</i> which
			extend toward the body edge. At the end distal from the mouth, the radiating
			canals join with a <i>circular canal</i> which extends around the body
			circumference. <i>Gonads</i> are present along the length of radiating canal
			on the concave side (inner) of the medusa. <i>Statocysts</i> are present at
			intervals in the body margin; they are spherical cavities with sensory hairs
			which support a calcareous body, and the system is used to help medusae right
			themselves if their position changes. A <i>velum</i> is a subumbrellar
			membrane which partly closes the subumbrellar cavity; locomotion in the medusa
			is accomplished by contraction of the body wall to force water from the
			subumbrellar cavity; if a velum narrows the hole by which water escapes, the
			force of contraction will enable greater movement. (Presence of a velum
			distinguishes hydrozoan medusae from the scyphozoan medusae, or true jellyfishes.)
			There are <i>suctorial pads</i> on the tentacles of some spp. of
			hydrozoan medusae which permit medusae to anchor to seaweed. Along with
			statocysts on the margin are light-sensitive structures called <i>ocelli</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides spreading the animal to new location, medusae are
			sexually distinct. The gonads will either form testes or ovaries, producing
			either sperm or eggs. Gametes are released into the water, where they may
			unite. The zygote undergoes cleavage, blastulation, and gastrulation
			as in <i>Hydra</i>. The end of gastrulation produces an elongated,
			ciliated swimming larva called a <i>planula</i>. It will form
			a central cavity, attach to substratum and start a new colony
			by asexual budding. The life cycle from polyp to medusa and back
			is sometimes called <i>metagenesis</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			As seen in the social insects, <i>polymorphism</i> (the different forms
			of appearance occurring in individuals in the species or in the
			life cycle of an animals) is quite characteristic of coelenterates.
			<i>Obelia</i> has three (nutritive and reproductive polyps and sexual
			medusae), but <i>Physalia</i> (Portuguese man-of-war) has polyps
			involved in protection, sensory perception, and a gas-filled float
			called a <i>pneumatophore</i> (a modified medusa). The poison
			in the nematocysts of most hydrozoans is benign to humans, although the
			toxin produced by larger <i>Physalia</i> and related spp. can be dangerous,
			even fatal. A small fish (<i>Nomeus</i>) does live within the tentacles
			of <i>Physalia</i> however. Despite the polymorphism, comparison of medusa and polyp anatomy
			shows more similarities than differences. The gastrovascular cavity
			is reduced and the mesoglea more pronounced in medusa. Not all
			coelenterates show polymorphism (e.g., hydra, anthozoans), and
			in the debate over which came first, the medusa or the polyp,
			one expert says the medusa was the primitive coelenterate
			because the polyp-like larva produced by medusa may have adapted
			to a sessile existence common in the adult stages of higher forms.

			(<i>skyphos</i>, cup)

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Aurelia
		</p>
		<p>
			A common form found on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
			US. Medusae of all scyphozoa (true jellyfish) are larger and without velum
			when compared to hydrozoan. <i>Aurelia</i> can range between 6-30 cm
			diameter. In this genus, medusa is the important stage of the life cycle, with
			polyp stage reduced or absent. Life cycle involves a sexual medusae in which
			sperm are released from the mouth of one, enter a female medusae by the mouth
			and into the stomach where fertilization occurs. The zygote leaves to be held
			by the <i>oral arms</i> of the medusa until the form ciliated larva (planula),
			which swim to anchor themselves in the formation of a young polyp, which
			matures to become a trumpet-shaped polyp called a <i>scyphistoma</i>. Peculiar
			to scyphozoan are a series of transverse divisions which segment the polyp body
			into saucer-like structures, each developing tentacles (the process is called <i>strobilation</i>).
			The structures break off from the superior end to form 8-lobed <i>ephyra</i>
			larva, which invert, swim about, and develop into adult aurelia medusae.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <i>Aurelia</i> medusa has a manubrium and mouth, but the
			manubrium is short and the mouth corners flatten and extend
			into four trailing <i>oral arms</i>. These arms function is
			capturing food, having numerous nematocysts. From the mouth
			into the body cavity is a centrally located stomach having
			four diverticulae known as <i>gastric pouches</i>.
			Gonads derive from the endoderm and are adjacent to the pouches.
			<i>Gastric filaments</i> are tentacle-like structures protruding
			from the gastric pouch lining, and they have nematocysts and
			secrete digestive enzymes. On the floor of each gastric pouch
			is an invagination from the subumbrellar surface called
			the <i>subgenital pit</i>, and the function appears to be respiratory.
			Numerous, highly branched canals (<i>perradial</i>, <i>aradial</i>,
			<i>interradial</i>) extend from the pouch to the umbrella edge.
			Numerous, short tentacles ring the umbrellar margin. Eight equally
			spaced structures around the umbrella are <i>rhopalia</i>,
			which contain a statocyst, an ocellus, and two sensory pits
			(between two small <i>lappets</i>) perhaps serving as chemoreceptors.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, the scyphozoa have a true mesoderm since the
			region occupied by mesoglea in hydra is cellular in scyphozoa.
			There is no velum in medusae as there are in the other groups.
		</p>
		<p>
			The jellyfish may live singly or in schools, being directed
			by the currents of the water more than moving themselves with feeble
			contractions of the bell. Many can be found beached during storms.
			Their food is largely small invertebrates, being paralyzed by nematocysts
			in the oral arms, carried to the mouth, perhaps the prey being
			further subdued by nematocysts in the gastric cavities.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Metridium

		</p>
		<p>
			This class includes the sea anenomes, sea pens, and corals.
			Generally well observed at low tides along the coastline. Members of this
			class exist as polyps, are large and brightly colored (no medusal stage).
			The body of the adult sea anenome (<i>Metridium</i>) is stout, the upper end
			expanded into a disc with a central mouth surrounded by several circles of
			hollow tentacles. Lower end is a <i>pedal disc</i> attaching body to
			substratum. Anthozoan polyps have many vertical partitions or septa dividing
			the gastrovascular cavity, a feature distinguishing them from hydrozoan
			polyps. Some septa are complete and extend from body wall to pharynx, while
			others are not complete. In the septa are longitudinal retractor muscles,
			and at the lower free edges of septa are filamentous structures called
			<i>acontia</i>. These acontia bear nematocysts which probably function
			to deal with ingested prey not yet killed. They may protrude
			through the mouth and also through small pores in the column
			and pedal disc called <i>cinclides</i>; this is likely for defense.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also unlike hydrozoans, anthozoan polyps form the mouth and
			pharynx from an invagination of ectoderm (rather than being lined by
			endoderm): this is called a <i>stomodaeum</i> (an older name is
			<i>gullet</i>). Two longitudinal grooves in the pharynx
			(<i>siphonoglyphs</i>) are lined with downward-beating, long cilia,
			the function apparently to generate currents for
			effective respiration. The triploblastic animal has a well-developed
			mesenchyme in which muscle is present in some areas.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gonads form in the endoderm and are found on the septa of
			the gastrovascular cavity. Mature gametes are released
			through the pharynx and mouth (anenomes can be male, female, or both).
			Zygotes cleave to form the usual planula. Reproduction by budding and
			fission are also known.
		</p>
		<p>
			The anenome can creep slowly on its pedal disc.
			Disturbances to the anenome or exposure to air by a receding tide can cause the
			widely extended body and tentacles to turn inward and the body wall contracts.
			The diet of the anenome includes mollusks, crustaceans, other invertebrates,
			and fish. The enemies of anenomes are fish, crabs and other crustaceans,
			starfish, and nudibranch mollusks.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Corals
		</p>
		<p>
			Similar to anenomes, but the polyps are protected by
			limestone cups which they secrete. These animals are very colonial as well.
			Each cup has a series of vertical plates extending from the wall inward, and
			fitting into corrugations in the polyp between septa. Ectodermal cells secrete
			the material to form these cups (coral). Differences in form among the coral
			arise from the nature of budding of the animal. Solitary corals grow in
			temperate and even cold ocean waters, but the more extensive masses of colonial
			corals grow in the subtropics and tropics. Reefs in the south Pacific, the
			Great Barrier Reef of Australia, and the Keys in Florida are examples.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some corals have been found at 300 m deep although it is
			known that they can live not below 40-45 m (due to temperature). The
			explanation involves coral formation from long ago. Coral grows in fringing
			reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls. Fringing reefs are very close to the
			coastline; barrier reefs follow coast lines also, but are separated by a deep
			water channel; atolls are ring-shaped formation about a central lagoon. C.
			Darwin first said that all coral reefs start as the fringing type. Formation
			of barrier reefs results with sinking (erosion?) of the coastline concomitant
			with buildup of the coral reef. Atolls occur as fringing reefs around islands
			which become barrier reefs as the island submerges, becoming atolls as the reef
			grows and the island is fully submerged. Oceans were very shallow millions of
			years ago, increasing in depth as a result of glacier melting.

			This is the sea gooseberry, considered a model ctenophore.
			Its body spherical and transparent (2 cm dia.). Body wall made of ciliated
			ectoderm, and gastrovascular cavity lined with endoderm. The mesodermal cells
			differentiate into connective and muscular fibers. Eight rows of ciliated
			meridional comb plates from the aboral sense organ to the mouth (the ctenes).
			Ctenes composed of fused cilia, forming paddle-like structures and beating from
			aboral pole to mouth so that the mouth moves anteriorly. Beat coordination and
			direction are controlled by nervous impulses originating in a statocyst in the
			aboral sense organ. Retractable tentacles are found emanating from sacs in the
			aboral end, and the tentacles can trail from the organism for some distance.
			Feathery lateral branches on the tentacles contain colloblasts, cells which
			produce an very adhesive substance to catch food organisms. Organisms so
			entangled cause a <i>straight filament</i> to rupture and a <i>spiral</i>
			<i>filament </i>holds the prey while the tentacles contract to move the prey to
			the mouth.

		</p>
		<p>The mouth-pharynx combination is really a stomodaeum leading
			to the stomach at the aboral pole. From the stomach extend five canals: two
			toward the mouth and pharynx, two <i>transverse canals</i>, and an <i>aboral</i>
			<i>canal</i> lead to the aboral pole from the stomach. Each transverse canal
			branches to form a tentacular canal and four meridional canals which lie
			beneath the rows of comb plates.

		</p>
		<p>The nervous system is limited to that of the nerve net in
			coelenterates; although some fibers are bundled together to coordinate ctene
			movement, they are still protoneurons. No special systems are present for
			respiration. And while excretion may also be by simple diffusion of wastes,
			special structures called <i>cell rosettes</i> are ciliated cells
			surrounding an opening between the mesoglea and gastrovascular cavity and may
			have excretory function. This would constitute first phylogenetic appearance
			of special excretory structures.

		</p>
		<p>Gonads develop from endoderm and appear as bands of tissue
			following along each meridional canal. One is a testes, the other an ovary
			(ctenophores are hermaphroditic). Eggs and sperm are released via the
			meridional canals and mouth. In some species fertilization is internal and the
			zygote is released through the ectoderm. Development is unique in this phylum
			with respect to cleavage: it is biradial meaning, that at the 8-cell stage,
			the biradial symmetry is established. The blastula is solid with numerous
			micromeres at the presumptive aboral end and macromeres at the presumptive oral
			end. Gastrulation is marked by invagination and epiboly resulting in
			micromeres surrounding the macromeres to become presumptive ectoderm and the
			macromeres forming endoderm. Delamination of the ectoderm gives rise to the
			mesoderm. Since blastomeric fate is determined early, cleavage is therefore
			determinant: this is shown by experimentally destroying certain blastomeres
			and finding deficiencies in the developing larva. Indeed separation of the
			two-cell zygote results in a half-larva; one-quarter larvae result from
			separation of blastomeres at the four-cell stage. Ctenophores show an ability
			to conduct bioluminescence, and they also possess a regenerative capacity shared
			with coelenterates.

		</p>
		<p>Haeckel's concept of gastraea and its modification include
			the concept of an ancestral coelenterate as a solid mass of ciliated cells very
			much like the planula larva of modern coelenterates. The planuloid ancestor
			later developed a gastrovascular cavity and tentacles. A major difference
			between ctenophores and coelenterates is that the former lack nematocysts and

			Grade Bilateria
			and its subgrades;
			the divisions Protostomia and Deuterostomia

		</p>
		<p>
			In the Eumetazoa a major portion of the branch is in the
			grade Bilateria, i.e., organisms with bilateral symmetry. Subgrades derive
			from the Bilateria depending upon whether a body cavity other than the gut is
			present. Organisms with only a gut are considered acoelomates, of which two
			phyla are found, Platyhelminthes and Rhynchocoela. The Acanthocephala,
			Aschelminthes, and Entoprocta have a definite space between gut and body wall,
			but the space is a remnant of the blastocoel and not completely enclosed by
			mesoderm, and so it is a pseudocoel; hence these phyla belong to the subgrade
			Pseudocoelomata. The balance belong to the Coelomata, those with a true
			mesodermally lined body cavity.

		</p>
		<p>
			Another character of the Bilateria used in classification
			relates to the fate of the blastopore in embryological development. In the
			acoelomates and pseudocoelomates, the blastopore becomes the mouth. In
			addition some coelomates show mouths developing from the blastopore. These
			phyla, taken together across the grades and subgrades belong to the division
			Protostomia. The coelomates (as well as all the acoelomates and
			pseudocoelomates) belonging to Protostomia are in the phyla Ectoprocta, Brachiopoda,
			Phoronida, Mollusca, Sipunculida, Echiduria, Annelida, Onychophora, Tardigrada,
			Pentastomida, and Arthropoda. A smaller group of coelomate phyla belong to the
			Deuterostomia since the embryonic blastopore becomes the anus: Echinodermata,
			Chaetognatha, Pogonophora, Hemichordata, and Chordata.

		</p>
		<p class="subgrade-part2">
			Subgrade Acoelomata

		</p>
		<p>
			The acoelomate flatworms are considered the most primitive
			bilateria. It may be possible to derive the evolution of free-living
			turbellarians from an acoel ancestor. Trematodes and cestodes have undergone
			considerable changes in morphology because of parasitism.
			One expert (L. H. Hyman) believes they descend from an ancestral
			rhabdocoel turbellarian, since certain of modern-day rhabdocoels
			are commensals with mollusks and echinoderms. It is logically
			believed that commensalism is a step toward parasitism.

		</p>
		<p>As for the origin of flatworms, a hypothesis by Hyman is
			that something like the planula larva of present-day coelenterates is the

			very much like the modern flatworm.

			The Platyhelminthes exist as parasitic (tapeworms, flukes)
			and free-living (planaria) forms in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine
			habitats. This phylum has a considerable number of species. The most
			primitive of bilateria, nervous tissue is seen to concentrate in the anterior
			region and the third germ layer (mesoderm) is now cellular instead of a
			jelly-like mesoglea. The mesoderm is mostly derived from de-laminations of the
			endoderm instead of the ectoderm as in the earlier groups. The digestive
			cavity still has only one opening and is therefore a gastrovascular cavity.

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Turbellaria</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			Generally nonparasitic and without hooks and suckers. An intestine
			is evident in all but the most primitive order of the class (Acoela),
			which has a mouth and pharynx. The epidermis (outermost surface)
			is a cellular or syncytial ectoderm ciliated in a few places.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Planaria

		</p>
		<p>
			The classic flatworm is the planarians, about 1-1.5 cm long and
			gray or black in color. They are ubiquitous, found in uncontaminated
			spring-fed streams and feeding on small living or dead organisms;
			if a piece of fresh liver is placed in the stream, these worms will
			be found on it in a few hours.

		</p>
		<p>
			The classic character of planaria is bilateral symmetry,
			which includes the concept of anterior/posterior, ventral/dorsal frames of
			reference. Another character emergent in flatworms is the organ level of
			development, an advancement beyond the tissue grade organization in
			coelenterates. Structures developing from a parenchymal mesoderm includes
			those forming a muscular system, complicated reproductive system,
			and excretory system. Planaria also have a nervous and digestive system.
			There is no skeletal, circulatory, or respiratory systems, and no coelom.

		</p>
		<p>
			The freshwater flatworm belong to <i>Dugesia</i> (or <i>Euplanaria</i>)
			but are just called planaria. The head is triangular and shows conspicuous
			eyespots. The lateral head projections are called <i>auricles</i> and
			function in locomotive sensation. The mouth is located
			on the ventral surface, and the pharynx of the animal protrudes
			during feeding. A <i>genital pore</i> is a small opening posterior
			to the mouth. The <i>epidermis</i> is cuboidal epithelium which
			expresses cilia on the ventral and lateral surfaces. Gland
			cells in large numbers on the body surface secrete a mucous upon
			which the worm moves; the cilia beat in this bed of mucous
			to produce the slow, gliding movements of the animal.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Digestion</b>. The current anatomical features suggest
			that the planaria evolved from a planarian ancestor which developed a
			gastrovascular cavity and an inferiorly placed mouth to feed from the bottom.
			Planarian diet includes worms, crustacea, insect larvae, dead animal matter.
			Planaria move over the food organism in an attempt to trap it. The pharynx
			extends and sucking movements produced by the powerful muscles in the pharynx
			rend the food to bits, after which it is swallowed. From the pharynx ingested
			food can enter a three-branched (<i>triclad</i>) gastrovascular cavity, which
			is multiply branched in marine flatworms (<i>polyclad</i>). One anterior
			branch leads to the anterior, and two branches to the posterior. From each of
			these main branches are numerous side branches. The branching is evidently a
			means of distributing food to all tissues.

		</p>
		<p>
			Digestion in planaria is largely intracellular, in which the
			cells lining the cavity take the material into food vacuoles. The nutritive
			substances are then passed from these cells to other tissues in the body.
			Indigestible material is eliminated from the mouth. Certain endodermal cells
			can store food reserves and enable long periods without feeding; indeed,
			planaria starved for several months shrink to 10% of normal size and resorb
			nonvital tissues, such as reproductive organs.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Respiration</b> and <b>Excretion</b>. The animal is
			small enough such that all tissues can obtain adequate gas exchange by
			diffusion, and no special respiratory system is required.

		</p>
		<p>
			Another system of tubules (<i>excretory canals</i>)
			formed within the mesenchyme or parenchyma and running
			along the length of the body serve as an excretory system.
			At certain points along the body, the tubules make contact
			with the surface and these are <i>excretory pores</i>.
			Side branches on the tubules consist of <i>flame cells</i>.
			These hollow cavity of each flame cell connects to an excretory tubule
			and the beat of its long cilia cause fluid in the tubes to move
			to the excretory pores. This entire system is called
			<i>protonephridial</i> because the ducts originate in closed hollow cells
			or bulbs and open only at the body surface. The <i>metanephridial</i>
			system in higher forms is open both internally and externally.
			The chief function of the excretory canals and flame cells appears
			to be elimination of water since most nitrogenous wastes diffuse
			from the endoderm and mouth. It is the forerunner of the systems
			in higher phyla.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Nervous system</b>. Paired ganglia in the head
			region constitute a <i>brain</i> for the animal. Ventral nerve cords proceed
			laterally to the posterior of the animal, forming many cross-connections with
			each other (giving it the appearance of a ladder with many steps, hence ‘ladder
			type') and also extending peripheral nerves to lateral surfaces. Extensive
			innervation of the auricles indicates why they are used in locomotive
			sensation, sensitive to touch and water currents. The ‘eyes' are indeed
			light-sensitive; they are bowl-like structures lined with black pigment and
			extending cells to the brain. The covering epithelium over the eye is not
			pigmented (transparent for light transmission). Other sensory cells are
			scattered in the epidermis. Removing the head of the planarian does not stop
			coordinated movements, indicating its brain may receive sensory information and
			then transmit it to other parts of the body. Planarians prefer dark places,
			reacting negatively to light. When contacting an object, they are drawn toward
			it, keeping their ventral surface (mouth) close to the substrate. Planaria
			also show chemotaxis and respond rapidly to food sources. They also look for
			water currents.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Muscular system</b>. Mesoderm differentiates into
			three muscle types: an outer, <i>circular layer</i> underneath the
			ectoderm; inner <i>longitudinal layer</i>; and <i>dorsoventral</i>
			muscles found in strands. The circular muscle produces body axis elongation;
			longitudinal muscle contraction causes constriction. Other body shape changes
			produced by dorsoventral muscles.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Reproductive system</b>. The most elaborate system.
			This system is dispensable in times of starvation, as indicated, but
			regenerated if the worm is well-fed. Planarians can reproduce asexually by
			fission, seen as a constriction forming behind the pharynx and some kind of ‘tug
			of war' between posterior and anterior, eventually leading to the fragmentation
			of both halves. The tail regenerates a new head, and the head a new tail.

		</p>
		<p>
			Planarians are monoecious but self-fertilization is rare.
			Two <i>ovaries</i> form in the head region, connecting with the posteriorly
			located <i>genital chamber</i> by <i>oviducts</i> running the length of
			the body. <i>Yolk glands</i> branch off the oviduct throughout their
			length. <i>Testes</i> are found on both sides of the body, and each connects
			by a short duct to a long <i>sperm duct</i> just like the oviduct. Each
			sperm duct leads into a <i>seminal vesicle</i>, and the two seminal
			vesicles terminate in a pear-shaped <i>penis</i>. The penis then projects into
			the <i>genital chamber</i>, which is connected to the outside by the
			genital pore. Connecting as well to the genital chamber is a <i>seminal receptacle</i>.

		</p>
		<p>
			Copulation occurs when the penis of one animal inserts into
			the genital chamber of another and sperm are transferred to the seminal
			receptacle of the other worm. After the worms separate, sperm become
			‘activated' and move down the oviduct to fertilize the eggs released from the
			ovaries. Fertilized eggs passing down the oviducts are covered with yolk from
			yolk glands, unusual since the yolk is generally stored <i>within</i> the eggs
			in most animals. Upon reaching the genital chamber, the yolk-covered egg is
			encapsulated along with other eggs and then passed out of the body. Minute
			worms emerge in two to three weeks.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Regeneration</b>. Dividing planaria in half will
			regenerate two new whole worms as indicated above. More selective cutting
			produces different results. Separating the posterior third of the body
			elaborates a new head (no re-extension of the body) the cut, formerly anterior
			end. Cutting the middle third just posterior the auricles regenerates a head
			at the cut end which had been anterior and a stunted tail at the end which had
			been posterior. Cutting off the head (including auricles) generates a short
			tail at the cut end. But most interesting is that a very thin slice just
			posterior to the auricles generates two heads on the cut surface facing away
			from each other!

		</p>
		<p>
			The capacity for regeneration comes from mesenchymal cells
			which remain pluripotential in the animal. Why the head forms
			on the formerly anterior end of large slices, the tail on the posterior,
			is presumably by the presence of an <i>antero-posterior gradient</i>
			as proposed by C. M. Child. The gradient is apparently due
			to the different metabolic activities of the cells:
			cells in the anterior have a greater activity while in the posterior
			they have a lower activity. One experiment to prove this hypothesis
			is where O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates were measured on the head,
			middle, and tail regions: it was as expected, with O<sub>2</sub>
			consumption highest in the head and lowest in the tail. This is
			also observed in the metabolic poisoning
			of worms: cells in the head region die first and those in the tail last.
			This also explains the finding that a piece cut so narrow generates
			the same parts (two heads) on both cut surfaces: it is difficult
			to assess a gradient in this case. Other interesting findings
			include cutting the head region down the middle, and keeping
			the cut surfaces separated, two heads with form.

		</p>
		<p>
			An interesting feature of planaria is a form of learning or
			memory. Planaria can be trained to anticipate an electric shock with
			combinations of the shock and with bright light. With light, it will react
			after the first few bursts of light. With electric shock it continually reacts.
			Combining the two, the planaria will react as if electrically stimulated
			subsequent to being stimulated with light. This clearly does not involve the
			brain since if the worm is cut in half and then both halves allowed to form two
			worms, both worms show this reactivity. If an untrained worm is allowed to eat
			a trained worm, it also begins to show this reactivity.

		</p>
		<h3 class="part2">Reproduction in Marine Polyclads</h3>

		It was indicated that the yolk in planarian development is
		enclosed in cells separate from the egg and bundled into the capsule or
		cocoon. No larval stage is evident.
		<p>
			The marine polyclad turbellarians shows different
			development. The first two cleavages produce four cells (labeled A-D) of equal
			size. The third cleavage produces a difference in cell size, smaller
			micromeres at the animal pole, larger macromeres at the vegetal. The cleavage
			plane is at 45° angles such that the micromeres lie in the furrow of macromeres
			rather than directly over the macromeres. The next division is unequal too,
			with the cleavage furrow forming 45° to the opposite direction, the micromeres
			of the next quartet lying on the cleavage plane. Two more quartets are
			produced, with cleavage planes alternating first left then rightward. This
			pattern of cleavage is called <i>spiral cleavage</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each of the cells in the dividing zygote can be tracked and
			has been named. With formation of the fourth quartet, a blastula is evident.
			One cell in the last quartet, called <b>4d</b> and also the mesentoblast cell,
			is the source of all the endoderm and endomesoderm (which is most of the
			mesoderm) of the adult. Other fates are determined as well: the first quartet
			provides for the future nervous system, eyes, and dorsal ectoderm; the 2nd and
			3rd form the rest of the ectoderm and ectomesoderm, which forms the pharyngeal
			muscles. The macromeres and other 3 cells of the 4th quartet are used as food
			reserves.
		</p>
		<p>
			Spiral-type determinate cleavage is observed in many
			Protostomia, including Mollusca and Annelida. The fate of the blastomeres is
			generally the same although the macromeres and other fourth quartet cells
			usually become the endoderm.

			Encompasses the flukes, which are all parasitic forms.
			Typically equipped with suckers and hooks. Usually require more than one host
			to complete their life cycle. For flukes requiring more than one host, the
			host harboring the sexually mature or adult form is the <i>final</i> or <i>definitive</i>
			host, whereas the <i>intermediate</i> host harbors the larval forms. The final
			host is typically a vertebrate, infesting some particular tissue often giving
			the fluke its common name (blood fluke, liver fluke, lung fluke, intestinal
			fluke). The intermediate host is typically a mollusk.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Clonorchis
		</p>
		<p>
			Best known is the Chinese liver fluke (<i>Clonorchis sinensis</i>,
			referred in by others as <i>Opisthorchis sinensis</i>). The adult is
			1-1.5 cm long with a flat body. It lives in bile passages, attaches by
			suckers, and subsists on bile. Its epidermis secretes a cuticle for protection
			against enzymatic breakdown from the host's hydrolases; this is associated with
			its loss of cilia and sense organs present in free-living forms. The <i>mouth</i>
			is at the anterior-most end surrounded by and <i>oral sucker</i>. A
			<i>ventral sucker</i> is present some distance posterior to the mouth. A muscular <i>pharynx</i>
			extends from the mouth into a short <i>esophagus</i>, and then into body-long
			branches which are <i>intestinal caecae</i>. A pouch-like <i>bladder</i>
			is present which connect to the outside at the posterior end via an
			<i>excretory pore</i>. Two protonephridial ducts empty into the bladder,
			and these connect with flame cells in the anterior part of the worm and
			lateral to the intestinal caeca. A nervous system is as in planaria.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hermaphroditic reproductive system is even more
			elaborate than in planaria. In the posterior third of the body are two highly
			branched <i>testes</i>, one anterior to the other. <i>Vasa efferentia</i>
			from each testis proceed anteriorly to join to form a <i>vas deferens</i>
			(the joining is anterior to the ovary). The vas deferens proceeds anteriorly,
			enlarges to form a <i>seminal vesicle</i>, this terminating at the
			<i>genital pore</i> just anterior to the ventral sucker. There is
			no penis as there is in the planaria. The <i>ovary</i> is
			a trilobed organ in the midline, anterior to the anterior
			testis and between the <i>seminal receptacle</i> and
			a very coiled structure called the <i>uterus</i>.
			A short oviduct connect the seminal receptacle to the ovary,
			but continues forward to meet to become the
			uterus. Numerous <i>yolk glands</i> are found at the sides of the body,
			and their tubes all converge to form two <i>yolk ducts</i> proceeding
			medially to connect with the oviduct at the level of the ovary. Moreover,
			a small delicate duct called <i>Laurer's canal</i> connects
			with the oviduct anterior to the seminal receptacles.

		</p>
		<p>
			Self-fertilization is common, probably as there is no
			copulatory structure. Sperm can reach the genital pore and pass back through
			the uterus. Laurer's canal is considered by some to be a vestigial vagina,
			since it opens by a pore on the dorsal surface in this genus. It remains
			possible that sperm might follow through this canal. Egg formation begins in
			mature worms, and developing eggs (conspicuous in their light brown shells)
			pass slowly through uterus and eventually out the genital pore. Fecundity is
			enormous, at 1000 per day. And the egg producing process appears to be
			continuous. Development in the uterus forms a ciliated embryo called
			a <i>miracidium</i> which passes out the bile duct and in the feces.

		</p>
		<p>
			The eggs hatch when ingested by a particular species of
			freshwater snail. Hatching occurs in the snail's digestive tract, and the
			miracidium penetrates the snail's tissues to become a <i>sporocyst</i>. <i>Rediae</i>
			are larval forms produced 3-8 in number within the sporocyst, reproduction
			being asexual; they have a mouth and short gut. Rupture of the sporocyst wall
			releases the rediae, and they find the sinuses of the snail (in <i>Fasciola</i>,
			the liver) to produce another generation or two of rediae. Within each of the
			second generation redia, 6-8 <i>cercariae</i> are formed (asexually), breaking
			free from the mother redia into the lymph sinuses. Here the cercariae mature
			with a tail and disc-shaped body, with oral and ventral suckers and a forked
			gut, and then leave the snail for the water.

		</p>
		<p>
			For 24-48 h the cercariae are free-living; it must find a
			fish belonging to one of several species or it dies. If it finds a fish, it
			penetrates its scales and into its muscles, losing its tail, and then encysting
			to form a <i>metacercaria</i>. If a mammal (man, dog, cat) eats the infested
			fish, the cyst wall is digested in the stomach and duodenum, and the freed
			larva moves toward the bile duct and into the liver to become an adult.

		</p>
		<h3 class="part2">General Features of Parasites</h3>

		Often parasitic forms of closely related free-living forms
		show adaptations usually in the form of morphological changes to become
		parasites. The presence of a cuticle, absence of cilia and sense organs, and
		reduced digestive tract in <i>Clonorchis</i> is evidence of that. In addition,
		many parasites show a need for more than one host for completion of a life
		cycle, often with a high degree of host specificity. Clonorchis uses three
		hosts and is not as adamant about the hosts as some, but only certain species
		of snails and fish as well as a mammal eating raw fish are absolute
		requirements.
		<p>
			The seeming impossibility of completing each stage of the
			life cycle is compensated for by the tremendous reproductive potential and
			fecundity of the animal. A day's worth of eggs from a single adult might
			produce 20,000 to 100,000 adults in the next generation assuming all eggs reach
			maturity. The occurrence of the liver fluke is high in southern China, Japan,
			and Korea, and it causes liver problems and death in some cases. Control may
			be achieved by stopping consumption of raw freshwater fish and use of human feces
			as fertilizer. Thorough cooking of fish as well as mixing
			(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with human feces
			if used as fertilizer are solutions.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Other Trematodes
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Fasciola hepatica</i> is the sheep liver fluke,
			infecting many vertebrates including man. Infection occurs when plants are
			eaten which grow near water where encysted cercaria are. More serious flukes
			belong to <i>Schistosoma</i>, the blood flukes. Their reproduction is unusual
			in that animals are of only one sex; also there is no cyst. Cercariae enter
			through the skin directly (while the person is bathing) or when the water is
			drunk. They live in the blood vessels. Females lay eggs in capillaries next
			to intestinal walls or the wall of the urinary bladder. Eggs are provided with
			sharp spines and pass through the capillary wall and intervening tissue to
			enter the bladder or intestine, and then are passed out with the waste. The
			intermediate host is a snail, which produces the cercariae.
			<i>Schistosomiasis</i> results when eggs fail to make their
			way out of the body, and the body reacts to them.

			(<i>cestus</i>, girdle + -<i>oid</i>, like)Tapeworms
			represent an epitome in parasitic adaptation, having a protective cuticle like
			flukes and no gastrovascular cavity (unlike them). The host provides both food
			and digestion. Adult tapeworms live in the intestine and all have hooks or
			suckers for holding.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are nine orders, six of which are parasitic in fishes
			or lower vertebrates. One order is only in swans. Two orders contain species
			infecting man.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Taenia
		</p>
		<p>
			The beef tapeworm, <i>Taenia saginata</i>, infects
			humans and is the classic model. At the anterior is a head or <i>scolex</i>, a
			short <i>neck</i>, and numerous <i>proglottids</i>. The worm attaches to the
			intestine by suckers on the scolex (the human-infecting pork tapeworm, <i>Taenia</i>
			<i>solium</i>, has both suckers and hookers on the scolex). Proglottids bud
			from the neck. As many as 2000 proglottids can form, making the worm 4-9 m
			long.
		</p>
		<p>
			A mature proglottid is virtually a reproductive structure.
			Two <i>nerve cords</i> extend the length of the body, and two <i>excretory</i>
			<i>canals</i> parallel the nerve cords, connected to each other by a transverse
			duct at the posterior of each segment. Each proglottid has male and female
			gonads. Numerous <i>testes</i> join to a <i>sperm duct</i> which leads
			to the <i>genital pore</i>. The female system is composed of a pair of <i>ovaries</i>,
			a short <i>oviduct</i>, a <i>yolk gland</i>, a <i>shell gland</i>,
			a <i>vagina</i>, and a <i>uterus</i>. Self-fertilization in a proglottid can
			occur, but cross-fertilization between proglottids of the same worm or between
			proglottids of different worms is likely. Sperm are stored in the vagina until
			they meet with released eggs. Fertilized eggs are covered in yolk by the yolk
			gland, covered with a shell by secretions from the shell gland, then are stored
			in the uterus. Embryos develop and the uterus distends, causing degeneration
			of testes and the female system. The ‘ripe' proglottid breaks from the worm
			and passes out of the body in the feces. A ripe proglottid may contain 124,000
			eggs, with annual output of one worm estimated at 600 million eggs. A worm may
			persist 20 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			A cow must consume food contaminated with human feces
			containing the eggs. In the cow's gut, the shell disintegrates and a <i>hexacanth</i>
			(six-hooked) <i>embryo</i> emerges. It bores its way through the gut and into
			the blood, where it works its way into muscle tissue. In the muscle it
			transforms into the <i>cysticercus</i> or <i>bladderworm</i> phase of its
			cycle. Uncooked beef consumed by humans will result in hatching of
			bladderworms. Their heads evert to bring the scolices outside, and they attach
			to the intestinal wall.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Other Tapeworms
		</p>
		<p>
			The pig tapeworm mentioned has a similar life cycle except
			the intermediate host is pig. The fish tapeworm (<i>Diphyllobothrium latum</i>)
			has three hosts: eggs are eaten by a copepod and develop into a <i>procercoid</i>
			stage; fish must eat the copepod and the infective <i>plerocercoid</i> stage
			is reached; humans consumed the uncooked fish and are infected.
		</p>
		<p>
			In rare cases man is the intermediate (as well as
			definitive) host of <i>T. solium</i>. Eggs not passing from the gut may
			hatch, penetrate the gut wall, and circulate to tissues to produce cysticerci.
			These might cause blindness and death if brain tissue becomes involved, or
			severe pain if muscle tissue is involved.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Echinococcus granulosus</i> is a small tapeworm
			with dog as the final host. It is a very small tapeworm with only 2 or 3
			proglottids, but may number in the thousands in the dog. A secondary host is
			an herbivore (cow, sheep, pig) but man can sometimes be infected. This species
			forms hydatid cysts instead of bladderworms, and the cysts have multiple
			scolices and reach large sizes. If it locates in the brain, the cyst grows
			like a tumor and kills the patient. It is usually transmitted by contaminated
			food or water, or even by lick from a pet. It is only a problem in areas where
			sheep and cattle are raised in large numbers.

			much as 25 m. Many species colored, often having striped pattern. A proboscis
			is a character of the phylum, used multifunctionally in tactile sensation, for
			defense and offense, and for grasping food (its has a prehensile structure).
			It is often retracted in a cavity at the anterior region next to the mouth,
			called the <i>rhynchocoel</i>. Circular muscle in the proboscis sheath
			contract and force the proboscis out (due to hydrostatic pressure from muscular
			contraction). A retractor muscle running the length of the proboscis pulls it
			back into the sheath when it contracts. At the tip are stylets in many spp.,
			and poison glands at the stylet base as well as a mucous covering the proboscis
			which may have poison make the organ an effective weapon. The body wall
			enclosing the intestine is composed of an epidermis, dermis, circular muscle,
			longitudinal muscle and parenchyma surrounding the gut (similar to
			turbellaria). The gut has a mouth, simple esophagus, long intestine which may
			or may not have diverticulae, and then an anus.

		</p>
		<p>The nervous system are two pairs of ganglia in the anterior
			on the ventral and dorsal side of the rhynchocoel, and connected by a
			commissure. From the ventral ganglia, lateral nerve cords extend posteriorly,
			and a pair of nerves also parallel the proboscis sheath. Sense organs include
			eye spots, statocysts, and <i>cerebral organs</i> (invaginations of the
			anterior end which are ciliated and probably chemoreceptors).

		</p>
		<p>The circulatory system is a well-developed closed system
			with three contractile vessels and numerous interconnections. The blood is a
			colorless fluid containing corpuscles which may or may not be pigmented.
			Hemoglobin is the pigment in some spp. A protonephridial excretory system
			exists with flame bulbs typically multicellular or multinucleate.

		</p>
		<p>Most nemerteans are dioecious, with numerous gonads along
			the lateral walls of the trunk and each with its own duct. They are generally
			located between intestinal diverticulae in spp. with such diverticulae. Spiral
			determinate cleavage is as in the polyclad turbellaria. While development is
			often to the adult, in some species, a larval form called a <i>pilidium</i>
			shows an unusual body form with a stomodaeum, midgut, and apical sensory tuft
			as identifiable structures.

		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Parasitic, unsegmented worms.

				at the anterior end.
			</li>
			<li>No digestive system at any stage in life history.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			This phylum has three orders. Composed of spiny-headed
			worms which have a vertebrate as definitive host and
			arthropod as intermediate.

		</p>
		<p>
			The worms of this phylum attach to the intestinal wall of
			the host with the spiny retractable proboscis. It has no digestive system,
			obtaining nutrients simply by absorbing them through the body wall. A delicate
			cuticle covers the worm, secreted by a syncytial (multinucleate) <i>hypodermis</i>
			with large nuclei constant in their number. In species where the number or
			nuclei or cells is always constant in individuals is a condition called <i>eutely</i>.
			Also in the hypodermis is a lacunar system of fluid-filled interconnecting
			canals which have no walls and are believed to distribute nutrients to
			tissues. Infoldings of the hypodermis at the anterior end are called <i>lemnisci</i>;
			these also have lacunar channels and may supply the fluid for these channels.
			An outer <i>circular muscle</i> and inner <i>longitudinal muscle</i>
			layers lie below the hypodermis; and there is no lining internal to the
			longitudinal muscle, i.e., between pseudocoel and muscle. The nervous system
			is a brain in the anterior ventral region with two or more longitudinal cords
			and sense organs are stunted.

		</p>
		<p>In the pseudocoel, the <i>ligament</i> is a tubular
			membranous sheath extending from the proboscis in the anterior to the gonopore
			at the posterior. Either a testis or ovary (the animals are dioecious) attach
			to this ligament. Males also have a penis for internal fertilization of
			another animal. Fertilized eggs develop within the pseudocoel of the female,
			and young larvae (<i>acanthors</i>) are encased in a shell and pass out the gut
			of the host in the feces. The intermediate host (insect or crustacean) becomes
			infected after ingesting, and the worm begins to look like an adult but without
			the gonads. The definitive host (fish, bird, mammal) becomes infected with
			than animal in its juvenile stage by eating the intermediate host, although if
			the intermediate host is eaten by something other than a definitive host, the
			encysted worm passes from host to host until so done.

		</p>
		<p>Although many of the structural features make it resemble
			the flatworms, these worms are nonetheless placed as pseudocoelomates because
			the central cells in the solid blastula separate from the body wall in the
			early larval stage.

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Rotifera</span>

		</p>
		<p>
			Among metazoans the smallest (microscopic). Typically freshwater pond
			dwellers. At their anterior ends is a ciliated disc called a <i>corona</i>,
			which gives rotifers (‘wheel-bearers') their names as they
			function in locomotion and bring food to the mouth. The appearance of
			the ciliary beating looks like rotating wheels.

		</p>
		<p>
			Although not always apparent, bilateral symmetry is certain: a head
			bearing a ciliated mouth, a central trunk, and tapering
			terminal region or <i>foot</i> is the body plan. The foot is observed as
			having spines or toes, and <i>cement glands</i> open through the spines
			to secrete an substance for holding the rotifer during feeding. Swimming is
			done by ciliary action, although movement on a substrate in an inchworm-like
			manner is seen as well. Rotifer shape depends on type of existence:
			spherical or sac-like for floaters; worm-like for swimmers; <i>lorica</i>
			(a thickened cuticle)-secreting vase shapes for sessile forms.
			The syncytial hypodermis in all rotifers does secrete a cuticle.

		</p>
		<p>
			A curiosity is the fact that rotifers are <i>eutelic</i>: they have
			a constant number of cells (or nuclei, since adults are syncytial)
			which range between 1000 and 2000 usually. The constancy of number
			is seen in every organ and tissue of a particular species.
			Under the hypodermis are circular and longitudinal muscle groups
			but not arranged in any regular array as in flatworms. A noncorpuscular
			fluid circulates in the pseudocoel, but only when the body moves.

		</p>
		<p>
			The organism possesses a specialized pharynx (<i>mastax</i>)
			which has jaws to crush food; food then moves into a stomach which oft. has
			gastric glands, then short intestine and cloaca, and then out the anus. The
			excretory system is a pair of protonephridial branching tubules with 2-8 flame
			bulbs in ea. tubule. A urinary bladder is a reservoir uniting the tubules in
			the posterior and emptying into the cloaca. Water excretion is tremendous: in
			10 min a volume equal to body weight is excreted. A nervous system is composed
			of dorsal ganglion (brain), with fibers to sense organs in the head and ventral
			cords running posteriorly to internal organs. Sense organs include eyespot,
			dorsal antenna thought to be tactile receptor, and chemoreceptors in head
			region.

		</p>
		<p>
			Sexes are separate in rotifers, and dimorphism is observed,
			with males small, and often absent in some groups. In others males are
			well-developed and of comparable size to the female. Males show single testes
			with duct, penis, and gonopore; they have no digestive system usually, and
			therefore no cloaca. Fertilization is internal in the cloaca of female; in
			some cases, the penis punctures female body wall and sperm are introduced into
			pseudocoel and move to ovary (<i>hypodermic impregnation</i>). Females
			have one or two ovaries usu. closely associated with yolk glands.
			Parthenogenesis can occur in which eggs released singly and the offspring are
			all female. Species with males show egg development accompanied by first
			meiotic division (still diploid), and these will become females
			parthenogenetically; later in the season, a smaller egg type undergoes both
			meiotic divisions (haploid), develops into a male, then impregnates females
			with haploid eggs. The fertilized eggs form a heavy shell and remain dormant,
			typically waiting for a cycling of harsh conditions before developing into
			females. There is no larval form in the development of rotifers. Zygote
			cleavage is spiral and determinate. At one point a single cell moves
			internally in gastrulation of the stereoblastula, and this cell will become the
			source of gonads. All cells in the outer layer become the germ layers.

		</p>
		<p>
			Also microscopic and aquatic like rotifers, and often
			classed with them. Both freshwater and marine form. The largest is only a
			fraction of a millimeter. The model is <i>Chaetonotus</i>, which has ciliated
			tufts on its head, two ventral bands of cilia, and a bifurcated posterior.
			Ciliary beating produces locomotion. <i>Adhesive glands</i> at the
			posterior is a phylum character. The cuticle covering can appear scaled (not
			smooth) which may overlap, or it may extend well-developed spines, or there may
			be both. It is secreted by a syncytial hypodermis (as in the rotifers). A
			very small pseudocoel is between the body wall and gut. Digestive system
			consists of mouth, pharynx similar to the kind in nematodes, intestine, and
			posteriorly located anus; and also in common with nematodes, the tract is not
			ciliated.

		</p>
		<p>A (water) excretory system is found only in freshwater spp.,
			which have a single pair of protonephridia, each with multinucleate flame
			bulb. Gastrotrichs are dioecious, and some groups, including <i>Chaetonotus</i>,
			show absence of males, and reproduction is by parthenogenesis. Spiral,
			determinate cleavage without larval forms is how development occurs.

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Kinorhyncha</span>

		</p>
		<p>This class also goes by the name Echinodera. The
			specialization of the cuticle is observed in the entirely marine animals of
			this class. The cuticle is segmented: one encloses the head, the second the
			neck, and the next 11 or 12, depending on species, the remainder. Most
			cuticular segments have spines, and the mouth at the terminal anterior end is
			ringed by spines. The segments are telescoping: the head may retract into the
			neck or trunk such that the entire plates can close over the anterior end.

		</p>
		<p>Longitudinal cords run, two lateral and one dorsal, along
			the hypodermis and are distinctive features of nematodes too. The pharynx is
			also like nematodes, and digestive system a nonciliated tract. A pair of
			nephridia each with single flame bulb and long flagellum make up the excretory
			system. The sexes are separate but little else is known. They live in shallow
			marine waters in mud or sand, feeding on algae, diatoms, detritus.

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Priapulida</span>

		</p>
		<p>Cylindrical marine worms less than 10 cm long. They have no
			tentacles but the anterior end is bulbous and referred to as a <i>presoma</i>.
			It is also eversible. Appendages looking like warts are found in the posterior
			end. At the terminal anterior end is the mouth arrayed with spines curving inward.
			Eversion of the mouth allows the spines to grasp prey and pull it in.
			Posterior to the spine-covered region is the proboscis covered with
			longitudinal rows of <i>papillae</i>. A trunk is demarcated by a constriction
			between trunk and anterior, and segments appear on the trunk due to apparent
			annulation of the trunk. The trunk is also spine or wart covered. At the
			posterior are an anus and two urogenital pores.

		</p>
		<p>The nervous system shows no brain enlargement (a
			circumesophageal ring with a midventral cord). The hypodermis is cellular and
			produces a cuticle. Below it are a circular and longitudinal muscle layers in
			that order.

		</p>
		<p>Internal to the longitudinal muscle is a membrane which some
			contend is cellular. If so, this would indicate a true coelom and remove the
			priapulids from Aschelminthes. The alimentary canal is a straight tube with
			muscular pharynx. Excretion is by protonephridia equipped with <i>solenocytes</i>
			instead of flame cells, the difference being that solenocytes have long
			flagella instead of cilia (as in flame cells). Sperm and eggs in these
			dioecious species are carried to the urogenital pore along with excreted
			products. Development is not well known. These worms live in the mud,
			extending their proboscis above it to seize food animals (usually annelids).

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Nematoda </span>(the Roundworms)

		</p>
		<p class="genus">Ascaris

		</p>
		<p>One of the most numerous of classes in the kingdom in terms
			of species and the largest class in Aschelminthes. Generally small, with
			parasitic and free-living forms. They have habitats everywhere: soil, fresh
			and marine water, aquatic vegetation, usu. moist places.

		</p>
		<p>Of the free-living forms, most do not attain a 1 cm length.
			But among parasites (of human, porcine, and equine intestine, including other
			animals), representative of the nematodes is <i>Ascaris</i>. The female is
			usu. larger than the male; males have characteristic incurved tails and a pair
			of projecting <i>reproductive spicules</i>. The body is very elongated
			and tapers finely at both ends. The mouth is triangular, surrounded by three
			lips, the anus not but a short distance from the posterior end. From the mouth
			is a short and muscular pharynx, and most of the gut is intestine. A rectum
			appears present before the anus, but it is a cloaca in the male since the
			genital ducts merge here. Food is taken from the host's intestine and moved by
			contractions of the pharynx.
		</p>
		<p>
			A nerve ring around the pharynx and a ventral and dorsal
			nerve cord make up the nervous system. Body wall is a cuticle, syncytial
			hypodermis, and muscle cells which are primitive versions of the higher forms.
			Muscle fibers are longitudinally arranged which limits movement to bending
			activity. Elasticity in the cuticle whips the body into a straight position.
			In the hypodermis are two <i>lateral lines</i>, one <i>dorsal line</i>
			and one <i>ventral line</i> running the length of the body and
			interrupting the continuity of the muscle cell layer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Excretory canals parallel the lateral lines and empty
			through a ventral pore in the anterior. There are no cilia associated with
			excretion. The reproductive systems fit the female with a genital pore
			(one-third body length from anterior), single vagina, two long convoluted tubes
			consisting of uterus, oviduct, and coiled and threadlike ovary. Males have
			coiled, threadlike testis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, and short muscular
			ejaculatory duct opening into a cloaca. They have organs for inseminating
			females, and fertilization occurs in the uterus. A female produces as many as
			200,000 eggs ea. day.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zygotes are sturdy, and leave out the feces until taken in
			by another host. Spiral, determinate cleavage, and first molt in the egg shell
			occurs. Hatching in the intestine is followed by burrowing into intestine,
			going into blood vessels and going to pulmonary artery. From there, they bore
			into bronchial tubes, molt a second time, move to the throat and a swallowed.
			They molt twice more by the time they get to the intestine, then become adults.

		</p>
		<h3 class="part2">Other Parasitic Forms</h3>

		The hookworm (<i>Necator americanus</i>) is endemic
		in the southeastern US and cause of severe and often fatal disease. Adults
		(~1-1.5 cm long) live in intestine sucking blood and lymph from the mucosa.
		Eggs produced at 10,000 per day pass out of the feces, hatch in the soil and
		live on bacteria, growing, molting twice to form an infective third stage larva
		in 1-2 weeks. These worms bore into human skin and enter the blood, taking the
		same path to the intestine as Ascaris. The disease symptoms are mostly due to
		loss of blood and the tendency of the worms to inflict wounds at several sites.
		<p>
			The trichina worm (<i>Trichinella spiralis</i>)
			causes trichinosis in humans, hogs, mice, and rats. Infection is by eating
			infected flesh, with humans getting it by eating uncooked pork. Pigs get it by
			eating scraps with uncooked pork or by eating diseased mice or rats. The life
			cycle ends with humans since it passes no eggs from humans. Encysted worms
			emerge in the intestine and grow to adults about 1 mm long. Subsequent to
			mating, viviparous females burrow in the intestinal wall and deposit larvae
			(several thousand each) into blood and lymph vessels. These larvae leave
			through capillaries to encyst in striated muscle, particularly diaphragm,
			chest, and tongue. These induce rheumatic muscular pains, swelling, and other
			symptoms. Heavy infections can cause death. Eating 10 larvae per g host body
			weight is typically fatal. 16% of Americans are said to be lightly infected.
			There is currently no treatment for the larvae encysted in muscle tissue.
		</p>
		<p>
			The filaria worm (<i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i>) is
			found in tropical and subtropical areas, and is a parasite in the lymph ducts
			and glands of humans. Females are threadlike and attain 8-10 cm in length
			while males are half that size. Females give birth to <i>microfilariae</i>,
			which enter the bloodstream. Completion of the life cycle requires mosquitoes
			ingest the microfilariae, develop within their bodies, then be transmitted back
			to humans. With multiple infections, the worm can block the lymph ducts in
			regions, causing <i>elephantiasis</i>.

		<p class="grade-part2">
			Subgrade Coelomata

		</p>
		<p>
			Animals up to this point are small in size and so the
			distribution of food substances, excretion of accumulated toxic wastes, and the
			exchange of gases presents little problem. The presence of a pseudocoelom
			enabled a greater size increase as its fluid space represented a diffusible
			medium suitable for the distribution of substances on a larger scale. The
			greater complexity of animals is shown by the development of a coelom.
			Mesodermal tissue formed the organs and systems necessary for efficient
			movement of substances throughout the body of the animal. Here the evolution
			of animals went in two directions as indicated by mesodermal differentiation
			into development of two coelomic types: in the annelid-arthropod line, a solid
			mass of mesoderm splits to form a <b><i>schizocoel</i></b> (‘split cavity'),
			while in the echinoderm-chordate line, the coelom develops from outpocketings
			of the gut and forms the <b><i>enterocoel</i></b> (intestine cavity).

		</p>
		<p>
			The phyla Phoronida, Ectoprocta, and Brachiopoda represent a
			transitional stage in coelom formation, in which the coelom is neither a
			schizocoel or enterocoel in phoronids or ectoprocts, and in brachiopods, both
			enterocoels and schizocoels are observed, depending upon the species.
			Brachiopods resemble the annelid-arthropod line more however since the mouth
			arises from the blastopore and the larva are trochophore-like.

		</p>
		<p>
			The phoronids, ectoprocts, and brachiopods are referred to
			collectively as <b><i>lophophorates</i></b> (animals having a circle of
			ciliated tentacles), and they may be derived from a line which eventually
			gave rise to the protostome and deuterostome coelomates.

			ciliated tentacles protruding from the open end of the tube (also features of

			A basement membrane supports the cellular epidermis, and

			ring in the epidermis which has an enlarged portion making up the main neural

			system is U-shaped, and food is brought to the mouth by the currents produced
			in the ciliated tentacles; a ciliated lining continues to move the food to
			through the esophagus, stomach, and intestine. The anus is in the anterior of
			the animal, and just outside the lophophore ring. The gut wall is composed of
			a mucosal lining, muscles, connective tissue, and an outer peritoneum.

			to the coelom is called a <i>nephrostome</i> and to the outside are two
			openings called <i>nephridiopores</i>. Nephridial ducts present also carry the
			gametes; phoronids are mostly hermaphroditic, with gonads being found lining
			the coelom. Fertilization is either external or internal. Cleavage patterns
			show radial, spiral, and irregular patterns depending on species. The mesoderm
			arises from an ingrowth of cells from the endoderm and the coelom develops from
			mesenchyme cells migrating to form a hollow sac-like structure. A
			trochophore-like larva is called an <i>actinotroph</i>.

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Gymnolaemata</span>

		</p>
		<p>Nearly all are marine forms with circular lophophore. Many
			thousands of fossilized species are present as well. Colonies are of
			considerable size, appearing as branching upright types or as flattened mats on
			the rocks, algae or other animals. Many are polymorphic and several <i>zoids</i>
			make up a colony. One zoid is the feeding zoid. This animals produce an
			exoskeleton which is box-like with an opening through which the animal can
			retract or emerge; this exoskeleton is produced by epidermal cells as either a
			chitin or a calcium-carbonate containing layer under a thin chitinous cuticle.
			Under the epidermis is a peritoneal lining of cells. There is no musculature
			in the body wall.

		</p>
		<p>The lophophore tentacles are arranged in a single circular
			row around the mouth, and they can retract when retractor muscles present
			contract. Protraction is caused by increases in coelomic hydrostatic
			pressure. Currents produced by ciliated tentacles move food to the mouth; the
			pharynx and intestine are ciliated, and the esophagus and stomach are not.
			Food movement through the gut is by both cilia and muscles in the gut wall.
			Digestive enzymes are secreted into the gut lumen to assist the intracellular
			digestive processes (unlike in phoronids). A thin peritoneum is under the
			intestinal lining of cells. The stomach is held in position by a cord-like <i>funiculus</i>
			in the peritoneum. The nervous system is simple: nerve ring around base of
			lophophore, cerebral ganglion dorsal to pharynx, and plexus in the epidermis.

		</p>
		<p>A <i>brown body</i> is a brownish shapeless mass forming
			during the generation of a new zoid (with new organs formed by tissues in the
			body wall) when the organs of the old individual degenerate to form this brown
			body. The brown body is then passed out through the anus. This is considered
			a form of excretion of toxic wastes for organisms having no excretory or
			circulatory system.

		</p>
		<p>Polymorphism in the colony is likely an adaptation dividing
			labor among the animals of the colony. An <i>avicularium</i> has the structure
			of a bird's beak and appears to have muscular structures which act in defense
			of the colony. The <i>vibricularium</i> has long, vibratile extensions which
			extend of the colony surface, also probably acting to defend the colony.

		</p>
		<p>Reproduction in the hermaphroditic animals is marked by
			gonadal development in the peritoneal lining with gametic release by body wall
			rupture (there are no ducts). Fertilization is internal; while some release
			eggs to the sea, some can develop within a brood in the coelom or in an
			invaginated pocket near the tentacles. Development occurs with radial cleavage
			and formation of <i>cyphonautes</i> larvae which come in different forms
			according to species. These larva may swim freely for 2 months, then settle on
			a suitable surface and undergo metamorphosis to an adult zoid. Indeed
			metamorphosis is from the ectoderm, all other larval tissues disintegrating.
			New individuals from the adult can arise directly by asexual budding.

		</p>
		<p>Asexual reproduction also occurs during unfavorable growing

			peritoneal cells, secreting a chitinous covering, sometimes covered with hooks
			or air spaces for floating. This entire assembly is called a <i>statoblast</i>,
			and the different appearance of this structure is used as a character in
			species classification. After the unfavorable period passes, the statoblast
			opens and the cells produce a new zoid. Asexual budding causes the colony to

		</p>
		<p>
			Valves held together by tooth and socket arrangement;

		</p>
		<p>
			The bodies of articulate brachiopods extend their walls both
			ventrally and dorsally into a <i>mantle</i>. This mantle secretes a thin
			external layer of chitin which is surrounded by a thicker layer of
			CaCO<sub>3</sub>. (Compare the pelecypod mollusks in
			which the valves are lateral instead of dorsal and ventral.) In the posterior
			third of the valve space is the animal's main part of the body. The anterior <i>mantle</i>
			<i>cavity</i> contains two coiled arms of the lophophore. Supports for the
			lophophore arm come from extensions of the dorsal valve. Between the bases of
			the lophophore arms is a slit-like mouth, leading to a ciliated tract to the
			stomach (sac-like) having a large digestive gland, and then to the intestine
			ends blindly.

		</p>
		<p>
			A heart is a contractile organ with a posterior and anterior
			channel which pumps the fluid through the open circulatory system of the
			coelom. There is no pigment to the relative acorpuscular blood. An esophageal
			nerve ring with dorsal and ventral ganglionic thickenings and nerves to the
			mantle and lophophore in the anterior and to the valve muscles in the posterior
			comprise the nervous system. A pair of metanephridia with nephrostome funnels
			and ducts leading to pores near the mouth are the excretory system. The sexes
			are separate usually, gonads forming in the coelom attached to the peritoneum,
			and gametes leaving by the nephridial tubules. Fertilization may be within
			mantle cavity or in the sea. Cleavage is radial, mesoderm and coelom formed by
			enterocoelic pouches (evaginations from primitive gut). The larva are
			distinguished from trochophores. A mantle fold in the free-swimming larva
			reverses the way it folds, extending toward the peduncle but then switching
			position to fold toward the anterior end.

		</p>
		<p>
			Differences between articulata and inarticulata are in the

		<p>
			Before 1957, it was believed all members of this class
			extinct since early Devonian. A ship in 1952 obtained some material off Costa
			Rican coast at depth of 3570 m, and sorting of this material later (1957)
			identified an organism <i>Neopilina galathea</i> which clearly belonged
			to the class. This organism is &lt;4 cm long, with a small head and large
			circular foot having ciliated surface and encircled by a pallial groove. In
			the pallial groove are segmentally arranged gills. The foot has 8 pairs of segmentally
			arranged retractor muscles. The organism subsists on detritus, namely diatoms,
			radiolarans, and foraminiferans. A flattened velum is on either side of the
			mouth and there is a series of tentacles to the rear. The radula in the mouth
			is a rasping organ, a strip of chitin provided with recurved teeth it pulls
			back and forth via a muscular activity over a protrusible cartilaginous rod
			located beneath it. Leading from the mouth is the pharynx, with two
			diverticulae and a salivary gland, then the esophagus, then stomach with two
			more glands. The intestine coils, straightening to the posterior to form a
			rectum and anus. Six pairs of metanephridia arranged in segments, two of the
			pairs serving as ducts for gonads, make up the excretory system.

		</p>
		<p>
			A nerve ring around the mouth extends cords forming the
			pedal nerve in the foot, and the lateral nerve in the roof of pallial groove.
			These cords interconnect with each other at intervals along their length. A
			dorsally located heart is composed of two tubular auricles and a ventricle on
			each side of the rectum, pumping through the open system. Ventricles empty
			into the dorsal aorta, which moves to the anterior sinuses. From the sinuses
			to the gills (where it is oxygenated) and then back to the auricles.

		</p>
		<p>
			Sexes are separate. Two pairs of gonads located beneath the
			intestine. Gametes move to nephridium by a short gonoduct as indicated above.
			The phylogenetic significance of the class is segmental arrangement of systems,
			pointing to common ancestry of annelids and mollusks; other evidence includes
			spiral, determinate cleavage and trochophore larvae.

		<p class="class-level">

			(the chitons)

		</p>
		<p>
			Chitons are well known for ability to cling to rocks:
			muscles in the foot pull the central adhering region of the foot away from the
			rock surface, effectively producing a suction cup. Gentle prying of the foot
			at the edge allows easy removal. When removed the many species can roll into a
			ball.

		</p>
		<p>
			The ovoid animals elaborate 8 overlapping calcareous <i>valves</i>
			on their convex dorsal surface. Covered with spines or bristles on the lateral
			side of the valves is a thickened part of the mantle called the <i>girdle</i>.
			Some species have the mantle completely covering the dorsal surface without
			much of or any of a shell. On the ventral surface only a foot is really
			apparent. A pallial groove between mantle and foot has number finger-like
			grooves representing external gills, and a head/mouth in the anterior can be
			found. The digestive system is similar to Neopilina, with a radula. The head
			is poorly developed.

		</p>
		<p>
			A heart in the dorsal pericardial cavity in the posterior of
			the animal has two auricles, a ventricle and a dorsal aorta leading to the
			anterior sinuses as in monoplacophorans. A pair of metanephridia connect this
			pericardial cavity with the outside: these metanephridia are highly
			vascularized structures showing filtration and resorption.

		</p>

			A circumoral nerve ring with pedal nerves and pallial nerves
			make up the nervous system, with serially arranged connections between the
			cords. The dioecious animals have a single gonad dorsal in the animal, with
			paired gonoducts leading to an opening in pallial groove in the posterior.
			Spiral, determinate cleavage produces trochophore larvae.

			A good example of this class is the common garden snail, <i>Helix</i>.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Helix

		</p>
		<p>
			The foot of gastropods is flattened and ciliated, secreting
			a bed of mucous through a pedal gland as a characteristic feature. The head is
			well developed, having two pairs of retractable tentacles. Eyes are located on
			the tips of the posterior pair, both pairs having tactile sensitivity. The
			dorsal surface is elongated and coiled and has most of the internal organs
			(visceral hump). A coiled shell covers this hump: the animal can retract
			fully into the shell thanks to the columellar muscle connecting the animal with
			the apex of the coiled shell.

		</p>
		<p>
			The mouth opens into the pharynx, and the dorsal surface has
			a chitinous jaw. The radula is on the pharyngeal floor, protruding from the
			mouth to rasp the plant material upon which snails feed. Salivary glands open
			into the pharyngeal cavity. An esophagus leads to a thin-walled crop and
			muscular stomach. The intestine is long and coiled, and returns to the anus in
			the anterior of the mantle cavity. A large digestive gland (liver) is in the
			dorsum of the visceral hump, a duct from it going to the stomach. Digestion
			can occur extracellularly in the stomach or intracellularly in this liver.

		</p>
		<p>
			A gill system exist in water-living gastropods, but land
			snails and freshwater spp. have a modified mantle cavity called a <i>lung</i>,
			the lining which is highly vascular and with a duct leading to a opening on the
			outside. The heart has a single auricle and ventricle, receiving blood from
			the mantle, pumping it through arteries to the head and foot sinuses and to
			visceral hump, then to the lungs. A kidney from the pericardial cavity extends
			a duct to the mantle cavity. A cerebral ganglion dorsal to the pharynx, and
			ganglia in the pedal, pleural, and combined visceral and parietal ganglia make
			up the nervous system.

		</p>
		<p>
			Helix is hermaphroditic, with the <i>ovotestis</i> in the
			apex of the visceral hump. From the ovotestis, sperm pass through the
			hermaphroditic duct to the <i>vas deferens</i>, and then to the <i>penis</i>
			in the <i>genital atrium</i> of the anterior. A long tubular <i>flagellum</i>
			extends posteriorly from the base of the penis, in which sperm are enclosed in
			small packets called <i>spermatophores</i>. <br>
When eggs pass through the hermaphroditic duct, they stop at the albumen gland,
proceeding into the oviduct to the vagina and genital atrium, then out through
the genital pore.  Two snails then mate by exchanging sperm:  each animal
shoots calcareous darts produced by a <i>dart sac</i>, part of the
			genital atrium (it is believed involved in stimulating sexual activity). The
			penis of each snail is placed into the genital atrium and spermatophores
			deposited. Once eggs are fertilized, they are covered with albumen and placed
			in holes in the soil. (Some species retain eggs until hatching:
			ovoviviparity.)

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Other Gastropods

		</p>
		<p>
			In marine forms, outgrowths of the mantle surface are gills
			or ctenidia. Pelagic heteropods have a reduced shell, and terrestrial slugs
			have none. Sea slugs (nudibranchs) have no shell as well. Certain nudibranchs
			in Eolidae have finger-like evaginations on the dorsal surface called <i>cerata</i>.
			These have ducts which are diverticulae from the gut. <i>Hermissenda crassicornis</i>
			is one such gastropod feeding on hydrozoan coelenterates (<i>Obelia</i>) and
			able to inhibit nematocyst discharge. Indeed, the nematocysts are taken into
			the ducts of the cerata during digestion, then stored in muscular sacs at its
			tip; these sacs can contract to squeeze out the nematocysts in the service of
			their <q>new master.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			Coiling of the visceral hump varies among the various groups
			of gastropods. The three subclasses of gastropods were believed to have
			evolved from an ancestor with an uncoiled visceral hump. Coiling is a later
			feature, with loss of one gill and one auricle during development in some
			opisthobranchs. Another kind of twisting distinct from coiling is called <i>torsion</i>,
			in which the posterior of the body is twisted to bend around to the anterior.
			The Prosobranchia show 180° twisting which brings the gills and anus to the
			anterior; what was the left visceral ganglion is on the right side and vice
			versa. The Opisthobranchia show torsion (180°) in development but mature forms
			reverse this partially or completely. Nudibranchs show complete detorsion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Marine gastropods show different developmental stages. They
			have a characteristic trochophore larval stage, a free-swimming ciliated form
			with several tufts of ciliated cells and a structure called a <i>teloblast</i>.
			This differentiates into a <i>veliger</i> larva, in which the larva has two
			semicircular ciliated folds called a <i>velum</i> which are used in swimming.
			In the veliger, the shell rudiment begins to form, the teloblast extends a band
			of cells, the rudiment of the foot appears, and an anus has formed. With later
			development the anus twists around in the torsion seen in gastropods.

		<p>A small class with &lt; 300 spp (not divided into orders).
			These are the tooth shells of all marine animals. They can live partially
			buried in the substrate of shallow coastal waters or as low as 5000 m. <i>Dentalium</i>
			is a representative with elongated body, its tubular mantle secreting a shell
			open at both ends. A pointed foot protrudes from larger opening at bottom,
			used for digging and pulling the animal into the mud or sand. At the same end
			as the foot, a mouth with a poorly developed head is surrounded by many
			delicate and filamentous tentacles (<i>captacula</i>). These have knob-like
			structures at their ends and are ciliated; they are prehensile, helping to
			capture food and in sensory perception. Gills are lacking, the very tubular
			mantle serving a gas exchange function nonetheless.

		</p>
		<p>The alimentary canal has a mouth with radula. A retractor
			muscle can pull the animal and foot back into the shell. The circulatory
			system has a few sinuses and no heart. Two nephridia, connected to
			nephridiopores near the anus in the mantle cavity, do not open internally
			because there is no pericardial cavity. The standard molluscan ganglia are
			present in its nervous system, but there are no special sense organs. Sexes
			are distinct, and a single gonad is in the apex of the body, making up most of
			that region. The right nephridiopore is where the gametes are released. A
			trochophore and veliger-type larva are the developmental forms.

		<p class="class-level">

		<p class="genus">
			The Freshwater Clams
		</p>
		<p>
			The clams are typically used as mollusk models because of
			their large size and easy availability. They are in fact atypical mollusks,
			having no head or radula. The class name means ‘hatchet foot' to describe the
			shape of the foot in many species.

		</p>
		<p>
			The shells are formed from two right and left-side valves,
			and are hinged on the dorsal edge by an elastic ligament. At the anterior edge
			of the ligament each valve has an elevated hump called an <i>umbo</i>, the
			oldest part of the shell and the center of its growth. During growth, the
			mantle secretes successively layers of the shell, concentric lines represents
			increments in growth. The shell's outer layer is thin and called
			the <i>periostracum</i>, composed of a horny organic material called
			<i>chonchiolin</i>. The middle layer is the <i>prismatic layer</i>,
			made of CaCO<sub>3</sub> crystal oriented perpendicular to the
			mantle. The innermost layer just beneath the mantle is the
			<i>nacreous layer</i> in which the CaCO<sub>3</sub> crystals are
			now oriented parallel to the mantle surface. The cells at the edge of the
			mantle produce the periostracum and prismatic layer, but cells over the
			entire mantle surface (nacre-secreting cells) produce the nacreous layer.
			When foreign materials (sand, parasites) get between the shell and mantle,
			an epithelium of nacre-producing cells surround it and produce successively
			layers of nacre, thus forming a pearl.

		</p>
		<p>
			Inside the valves, <i>mantle lobes</i> envelope the
			animal to form a <i>mantle cavity</i>. At the posterior of the mantle
			end are modifications called the <i>incurrent</i> and <i>excurrent siphons</i>.
			Projecting into the mantle cavity on each side are two large plate-like gills.
			The foot occupies the central part of the cavity, the <i>visceral mass</i>
			continuous with the foot dorsally. On the inner surface of the valves are the large
			<i>anterior</i> and <i>posterior adductors</i>, contraction of which
			brings the valve edges together. Relaxation brings them apart (due to elastic
			recoil in the ligament), and the muscular foot can protrude. Locomotion is
			quite slow: extension of the foot into the sand or mud is followed by the foot
			swelling with blood in its tip to form an anchor. Contraction in the foot
			draws the body forward. The mantle inner surface and gills are ciliated, the
			beating of which brings water through the incurrent siphon and pass out the
			excurrent. Tubes within the sieve-like gills fill with water where gas
			exchange occurs, water passes into a chamber, the out of the body via the
			excurrent siphon. Food particles are also trapped in the gills by a mucous
			secreted from them, passed to the mouth by ciliary beating. Two ciliated flaps
			(<i>labial palps</i>) are on either side of the mouth. A short
			esophagus leads to a stomach, from there to a large coiled intestine and then
			to the anus near the excurrent siphon. A large digestive gland is associated
			with the stomach, and it is thought digestion occurs here and is largely
			intracellular. A <i>crystalline style</i> is associated with the digestive
			gland: it is a transparent gelatinous structure formed in a ciliated
			diverticulum of the stomach, and ciliary beating brings out its tip into the
			stomach where it provides an amylase for starch digestion.

		</p>
		<p>
			The coelom becomes reduced to the pericardial chamber
			surrounding the heart. The intestine also passes through this area. The
			circulatory system is open, with a heart of one ventricle and two auricles,
			pumping blood through arteries leading to sinuses. Returning blood passes into
			two kidneys on either side of the valves; these are bent tubular structures,
			with a ventral glandular region in which wastes are filtered, and a dorsal
			bladder to store wastes. From the bladder, it narrows at one point to a ureter
			going to the gill chamber, from which leaves the animal by the excurrent
			siphon.

			For the nervous system there are three pairs of ganglia, one
			in each main region of the body. The <i>cerebral ganglia</i> are on
			either side of the mouth, joined by a connector passing over the esophagus. <i>Pedal
				ganglia</i> are located in the foot, connected to cerebral ganglia by two
			connectives. <i>Visceral ganglia</i> are located below the posterior adductor
			muscle, also connected to the cerebral ganglia by a connective pair.
			Statocysts are found in the foot near the pedal ganglia (used in equilibrium).
			Certain sensory cells near the visceral ganglia are apparently chemoreceptive
			in nature, sampling the waters entering the incurrent siphon. Also the mantle
			edge and siphons have light- and touch-sensitive sensory cells.

		</p>
		<p>
			Sexes are separate in most species. Gonads are near the
			intestine where it is close to the foot, and genital ducts empty into the
			dorsal gill chamber near to the ureter connection. Freshwater female clams
			release eggs through a short oviduct into the mantle cavity, and eggs lodge
			into the interior of gills. Sperm from the male are carried by water into the
			incurrent siphon into the female's mantle cavity, where fertilization occurs.
			Bivalved larvae called <i>glochidia</i> develop within the female, attached to
			the gills. Released into the water, they must attach to the gills or fins of
			fish within a few days or development arrests. After attaching, the skin of
			the fish grows over the clam (appearing as <q>blackheads</q>), and for some weeks
			they live as parasites. Eventually they develop into young clams and drop from
			the animal to grow independently. Marine bivalves are different in that eggs
			and sperm are both released, and egg to larval (first trochophore, then
			veliger) to adult development occurs outside the body and without a parasitic
			stage.

			Class <span class="class-name">Cephalopoda</span>

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			The Squid

		</p>
		<p>The largest of invertebrates belong to this class, viz. <i>Architeuthis</i>,
			or the giant squid, perhaps approaching 50 ft in length. Cephalopods represent
			the most highly specialized mollusks. A typical cephalopod is <i>Loligo</i>, a
			squid with a large head encircled by 10 sucker-bearing <i>arms</i>. These arms
			represent the molluscan foot, situated ventrally. The body is conical, covered
			with a muscular mantle, having a triangular fin at the dorsal end. The edge of
			the mantle at the ventral open end is called the <i>collar</i>; it articulates
			with cartilaginous ridges on the neck so that it can effectively close the
			mantle cavity except for the opening in the muscular <i>siphon</i>. With
			expansion and contraction of the mantle, water is forced in and out of the
			mantle cavity between collar and neck. With this, respiratory exchange occurs
			between the gills in the inner mantle and the water. The collar around the
			neck can close suddenly, in which case mantle contraction forces water through
			the siphon and propels the animal by jet propulsion through the water. The
			siphon can adjust in many directions to alter the course of the animal,
			including tentacle-first movement.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the animal's outer surface of the mantle are <i>chromatophores</i>,
			elastic pigment cells surrounded by muscle cells which can expand and contract
			to make the animal seem more or less pigmented. This enables the squid to
			change color rapidly, which it does if excited or in response to a background
			change. The animal also has a <i>pen</i>, a reduced shell acting as a
			stiffening rod.
		</p>
		<p>
			Squids have beak-like jaws within their mouth and can
			capture fish, crustaceans, and other mollusks. A radula is present in the
			pharynx, but probably not used. Through the narrow esophagus, food passes to a
			muscular stomach with a long thin-walled <i>caecum</i>. This has a valve
			permitting only liquids to pass into it. From there, an intestine and rectum
			lead to the anus in the mantle cavity near the siphon's inner opening. Two
			pairs of salivary glands connect to the pharynx and a large liver and a small
			pancreas open to the stomach. An <i>ink sack</i> opens into the rectum
			near the anus; its fluid contain melanin granules to produce the dark pigment
			protecting the animal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Circulatory system nearly closed, very well developed with
			heart of two auricles receiving oxygenated blood from gills, then going to
			ventricles then arteries. Blood goes to the gills by the veins, from the gills
			back to the heart by a branchial heart pumping blood back. Connected to the pericardial
			cavity is a pair of kidneys which open as well into the mantle cavity.
		</p>
		<p>
			The nervous system has most of the ganglia fused around the
			pharynx. An eye present in the squid represents a model example of convergent
			evolution, having evolved independently from the vertebrate eye. The
			anatomical features have been named analogously with the vertebrate eye (pupil,
			iris, lens, ciliary process, retina, optic nerve) but have no homologous
			function. Focusing in the eye is not by lens distortion but by moving the lens
			forward or backward (as in the camera).
		</p>
		<p>
			Squids are dioecious, the gonad at the apex of the mantle,
			and a duct opening near the anus in the mantle cavity. Sperm are placed into
			specialized spermatophore in the spermatophoric gland, being taken up by one of
			the arms termed the <i>hectocotylus</i> at its tip. These then placed in
			mantle cavity of female; eggs are heavily yolked, fertilized, then surrounded
			by capsule prepared by <i>nidamental glands</i>. Coelom is schizocoelic
			and young hatched as miniature adults (no larval forms).

			Besides squid and its cousin the cuttlefish having

		<p>
			These are burrowing marine worms of less than 250 spp. in
			the phylum; this phylum not broken down into orders or classes. They can be in
			the intertidal zone and as deep as 5000 m. The defining character is an <i>introvert</i>,
			a long slender anterior end being capable of rolling in and out. The genus <i>Sipunculus</i>
			is a representative example. About one-third of the anterior end can be
			withdrawn into the body largely because of retractor muscles extending from the
			body wall to the esophagus. The opposite action of protrusion occurs with
			contraction of circular muscles in the body wall forcing coelomic fluid into
			the introvert, creating the hydrostatic pressure to induce the rolling out.
			The body wall is covered by a thin cuticle, modified on the introvert with
			scales or spines. In this genus and some others are <i>coelomic canals</i>
			in the dermis leading to pores in the coelom; lined with peritoneum and
			containing coelomic fluid, corpuscles containing <i>hemerythrin</i> are found
			in the fluid, apparently serving a circulatory function in an animal with no
			circulatory system. There is an outer circular and inner longitudinal muscle
			layer beneath the dermis; diagonal muscle layers are found in between these in
			some groups of the phylum.

		</p>
		<p>
			The mouth is encircled by tentacles at the tip of the
			introvert, and the entire gut length shows no real specialization with any
			connecting digestive glands as in previous phyla. The anus is located
			anteriorly, on the dorsal side at the base of the introvert, a location
			consistent with the existence of this animal as a mud burrower. The digestive
			tract is highly coiled, and the lining cells are ciliated, and a distinctive <i>ciliated</i>
			<i>groove</i> extends the length of the tract. In the coelomic fluid are found
			a variety of cells: red corpuscles, amoebocytes, and a floating vase-like
			(unicellular) structure with ciliated opening unique to sipunculids called an <i>urn</i>.
			In the early developmental stage, the urn is fixed to the peritoneum. It
			appears to function in excretion, since it collects bacteria and other cellular
			debris, and deposits it to the pair of nephridia, these being elongated
			recurved tubular structures in the anterior ventral portion of the animal
			equipped with a nephrostome.
		</p>
		<p>
			The nervous system is a bilobed brain in the dorsal anterior
			end, circumesophageal connectives meet to form a ventral nerve cord. The
			latter extends the length of the body in the midventral line, extending lateral
			nerves. This nervous system resembles the annelid worm system and is the
			character close relating them to annelids. The <i>nuchal organ</i> is a
			chemoreceptive sense organ near the mouth and composed of ciliated cells.
			Pigmented spots embedded in the brain may have light-sensitive functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gonads develop on the body wall of these dioecious animals.
			Gametes move to the outside through the nephridia, where fertilization occurs
			outside, followed by spiral determinate cleavage, schizocoelous coelom
			formation, and trochophore larva. Larva swim freely for a month, settle, and
			metamorphose to the adult.

			The phylum has no classes or orders. Ca. 60 species of

			and spoon-shaped, and can be long and bifurcated at tip in some species.

		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Urechis caupo</i> is a representative of the
			phylum. Its spoon-like anterior proboscis is contractile and mobile but does
			not retract as does the introvert of a sipunculid. It has a cuticle-covered
			epidermis and muscular layers similar to the sipunculids. Recurved movable
			setae at the anterior arise from a muscular seta sac. A circle of setae are
			found in the posterior end. The mouth is at the base of the proboscis, has a
			short pharynx, long esophagus, small stomach, and very long and coiled
			intestine. As in sipunculids, the tract has a ciliated groove throughout the
			intestinal length. A <i>siphon</i> is a structure also found in the animal; it
			extends the length of the intestine, being enclosed in the intestinal
			peritoneum, opening into the intestine only at the anterior and posterior ends
			in the ciliated groove. Its function remains unknown.
		</p>
		<p>
			Diverticulae at the anal end comprise the anal sacs, mucus-secreting
			tissues which may also have an excretory function in that they
			have ciliated funnels opening into the coelom. There is no respiratory
			system; contraction of the gut muscles forces water in and
			out of the anus and may serve an exchange function. A nephridial
			pair similar to those in sipunculids open to the outside near
			the anterior setae. It has a closed circulatory system with
			dorsal and ventral vessels connecting anteriorly. Its
			blood is filled with amoeboid colorless corpuscles, but the coelom is not
			segmented and has hemoglobin-containing cells (role in circulation?).

		<p>
			Nervous system shows same pattern with sipunculids and annelids
			without ganglia. Circumesophageal loop, midventral cord with lateral

			in the immature state, then leave through nephridia when mature.
			As their trochophore larvae mature, there is transitory segmentation
			(15 mesodermal somites) and equal number of ganglionic swellings
			in the lateral branches of the ventral nerve cord, but this is
			lost with metamorphosis into the adult.

		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Oligochaeta</span>

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			The Earthworm
		</p>
		<p>
			This class is not the most primitive annelid (those being
			the polychaetes), but it is discussed first since the classic
			annelid is <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>. It is found worldwide in
			all moist soil, living in burrows several centimeters to as much as
			2 meters deep if the moisture is sufficient and there is humus.
			Warm weather brings them to the surface, but dry soil at
			the top forces them to deeper places; in the winter, they are
			below the frost line. With loose soil they push the soil away
			to the side, but very compact soil requires them to eat their way through.
			The soil passes through the gut of the worm and is deposited as
			castings seen at the mouth of its burrow. While leaves provide
			the main source of food, elements in the soil (organic matter,
			seeds, eggs, small animals, decaying plants and animals) are also
			consumed. The worm's body requires moisture at all times;
			placed in a dry atmosphere, it dessicates and dies. It is nocturnal,
			leaving the mouth of its burrow to explore the surrounding area,
			but leaving its tail anchored in the event rapid retreat is necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			The body shows obvious segmentation; bilaterally symmetry is
			evident when it is seen the ventral side is flattened compared
			to the round dorsal side. The anterior tapers to a point,
			the posterior end more blunt. A lobe-like projection in the anterior
			is the <i>prostomium</i>, the first complete segment in the body is
			the <i>peristomium</i>. The anus is a vertical slit in the
			last segment, and no jaws, teeth or special structures are in the mouth.
		</p>
		<p>
			Segments in full-grown worms vary in number from 110 to
			180. The epidermis is cuticle-covered. All but the first and last few
			segments have four pairs of slender bristles (<i>setae</i>), two
			nephridiopores, and dorsal pore leading from the coelom to the outside.
			Two pairs of setae are lateral, two ventral; and the nephridiopore
			openings vary in position. For 6-7 segments (usu. from 32nd to 37th),
			mature worms have a distinguishing swollen lateral and dorsal region
			called the <i>clitellum</i>. The worm is hermaphroditic: oviducts
			open to the outside on the ventral surface of segment 14,
			and sperm duct openings are on segment 15. Sperm ducts
			have swollen lips and a ridge which extends posteriorly
			to the clitellum. Between segments 9 and 10 and segments
			10 and 11 are furrows having openings to two pair of seminal
			receptacles, where sperm are received during copulation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tube-within-a-tube body plan is the phrase used to describe annelids,
			the outer tube being the body wall, the inner tube being the gut.
			A coelom is obvious on dissection, and it is divided by septae,
			positions known by the external groove position. The alimentary
			canal is supported by the septal membranes. From anterior
			to posterior excepting the mouth and anus, the gut is the
			<i>buccal cavity</i>, <i>pharynx</i>, <i>esophagus</i>, <i>crop</i>,
			<i>gizzard</i>, and <i>intestine</i>. The intestine begins about
			segment 19. Food enters by suction produced by changes in
			muscular contraction in the pharynx, passes through the pharynx
			to the crop, a thin-walled storage organ. <i>Calciferous
				glands</i> are three swellings on either side of the esophagus secreting
			CaCO<sub>3</sub> into the gut lumen and are used to neutralize
			organic acids. Food passes into the thick-walled muscular
			gizzard where it is mechanically digested; sand consumed in the meal
			is used to assist. Most of the digestion (and all absorption) occurs
			in the intestine, which is not a simple cylindrical tube but
			possesses an infolding called a <i>typhlosole</i>, intended
			to increase absorption. The intestinal mucosa has cells which
			secrete digestive enzymes into the lumen, and cells which function
			in absorption of the material. Undigested material and other
			products (moistly soil) pass out the anus.
		</p>
		<p>
			A dorsal vessel along the median is readily seen in living
			worms, red because of the hemoglobin dissolved in the plasma (acorpuscular).
			This vessel is contractile, peristaltic waves moving the blood along from
			posterior to anterior. Nutrients from the gut are received largely by this
			vessel, and a median ventral vessel below the gut suspended by a mesentery
			distributes the blood. In the esophageal region are five pairs of large
			transverse vessels connecting the dorsal and ventral vessels, and these are
			pulsating <q>hearts</q> forcing blood into the ventral vessel.
			Flow in the ventral vessel is in fact backward posterior to the hearts,
			forward anterior to the hearts. There is also a subneural vessel
			running the worm's length, with flow being backward; within each
			segment a pair of parietal vessels connects the subneural vessel
			with the dorsal vessel. The ventral vessel branches in each segment
			to distribute blood to body wall, alimentary tract, and nephridia.
			Small vessels from the body wall drain into the parietals as does blood
			from the nephridia. Blood from the alimentary canal drains
			into the dorsal vessel as mentioned above. Valves are present
			in the dorsal vessels and heart to control direction of blood flow.
			The moist surface of the skin is highly vascularized and serves
			chiefly as the gas exchange site. In general the earthworm
			requires less oxygen than more active organisms.
		</p>
		<p>
			In every segment but the first three and the last are pairs
			of coiled tubules called <i>nephridia</i>. A single ciliated funnel
			(<i>nephrostome</i>) is found in each segment, and it is connected
			by a thin tube with a major part of the structure in the segment
			posterior to the nephrostome. The nephridium is coiled into three loops,
			expanding into a bladder-like region before emptying to a pore
			on the surface. Materials in the coelom enter the tubule of
			the nephrostome, and in the glandular region of the nephridium,
			wastes in the blood are transported across the epithelium
			to the tubule lumen. <i>Chloragen cells</i> are found attached
			to the visceral peritoneum in the coelom, forming a chloragen layer
			in that lining. Wastes from the blood accumulate within the cells,
			and after a time, they detach and float throughout the coelomic fluid.
			They then break up and the detritus passes out the nephridia
			or is engulfed by amoeboid cells which will migrate to the outer tissues,
			disintegrate, leave their material as a deposit of protective pigment.
		</p>
		<p>
			The muscles in the body wall and the setae serve in locomotion of the worm. An outer circular muscle layer and very thick, inner
			longitudinal layer are below the epidermis. The coelomic fluid is not
			compressible, so contraction results in shape changes and not size changes.
			The contraction of longitudinal muscles makes the worm body short but thick;
			it is these muscles which allow the worm to retreat when disturbed.
			Movement is largely dependent on whether the setae are arranged
			forward or backward and the alternate contraction of smooth and
			circular muscle. The epidermis of the worm is composed of many
			cell types: columnar epithelium producing the cuticle
			in addition to other glandular and sensory cells. The parietal
			peritoneum underneath the muscle is squamous.
		</p>
		<p>
			The nervous system is a ventral ladder-type with ganglia in
			each segment. The double cords and ganglia fuse in the adult,
			being preserved only in the brain. The brain is a bilobed mass
			in the dorsal part of segment 3, being a partial fusion of cerebral
			ganglia. Connections to the first ventral (<i>subpharyngeal</i>)
			ganglion are in segment 4, circumpharyngeal connectives extending
			around the pharynx. A ventral nerve cord then extends from here
			along the floor of the animal length. Each segment has an
			enlargement (ganglion) with three pairs of lateral nerves having
			both sensory (from sense organs) and motor (to muscles and glands)
			pathways. A reflex arc similar to vertebrates is found,
			with sensory-association-motor neurons. Other nerve fibers
			(giant nerve fibers) extend throughout the length and may function
			in the retreat behavior of the worm. Special sense organs
			are not well developed in the anterior of this burrowing animal:
			light receptors appear at the two ends, while receptors for touch,
			chemicals, and temperature changes are in the epidermis.
		</p>
		<p>
			Worms react negatively to light and are sensitive to temperature changes.
			It responds positively to moisture but cannot immerse itself
			in water because of the low oxygen availability (this is why worms
			emerge in heavy rains from their burrows). Worms react negatively
			to acetic acid. C. Darwin was one of the first to analyze dietary
			preference in worms: onion, celery, carrot are preferred to cabbage.
			Red cabbage is preferred to green cabbage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although it may seem unusual for a relatively advanced animal
			as an earthworm to be hermaphroditic, it may be an adaptation for
			animals occupying a limited territory. However, two individuals
			meeting does produce cross-fertilization. Gonads are not
			segmentally arranged as other organs. In the female system are
			a pair of ovaries, oviducts and associated egg sacs, and two pair
			of seminal receptacles. Ovaries are in segment 13, and funnel-shaped
			oviducts penetrate the septum between segments 13 and 14. Mature
			eggs are stored in egg sacs prior to laying. The male system has
			two pairs of testes, two large seminal vesicles with lateral pouches,
			two vasa deferentia opening to the outside in segment 15.
			These seminal vesicles are the most noticeable of the male system,
			filling the body from segments 9-12. The anterior vesicles have
			two pairs of lateral pouches, the posterior only one
			pair. The tiny testes are housed in these vesicles; they discharge
			sperm into the vesicles where they are stored. With copulation,
			sperm enter the vasa efferentia then to the outside by the vas deferens.
			Copulation shows a ventral-to-ventral joining with anterior ends
			opposite to one another, held together by clasping actions
			in the clitellar region and by formation of a <i>slime tube</i>.
			The clitellum secretes a thick mucus covering forming a tube around
			the animals. Discharged sperm emerging from segment 15 move along
			temporary longitudinal furrows in the skin to the seminal receptacles,
			with worms separating after this is done. A mucus ring is secreted
			by the clitellum next, passing forward over the worms body as it
			contracts, picking up eggs and it moves past segment 14,
			then picking up sperm from the seminal receptacles as
			the ring continues forward. As it moves over the anterior end
			of the worm, the ends of the ring close to form a sealed capsule
			(<i>cocoon</i>). In the damp soil, fertilized eggs begin to cleave
			(cleavage is unequal) and form a hollow blastula. Invagination
			of endodermal cells marks gastrulation, and presumptive mesoderm
			is determined in two special cells in the blastula. The blastopore is
			the future mouth. There is no larval stage and development proceeds
			directly to form young worms hatching several weeks later (2-3 weeks
			under laboratory conditions).
		</p>
		<p>
			There is limited regenerative ability in worms, but nothing
			like planaria. Lost tail segments can lead to new ones. Regeneration of the
			anterior end is limited. Usually no more than 4-5 segments are regenerated.
			If &gt;15 segments are lost in the anterior, the head does not reform.
		</p>

			There is an Australian earthworm (<i>Megascolides</i>) which is
			found to be 2-3 cm in diameter and as long as 3-4 meters.

			The prostomium and peristomium form a definite head with sense organs.
			Four pairs of dorsally located <i>peristomial tentacles</i> surround
			the mouth (ventrally located), and on the prostomium are two short
			<i>prostomial tentacles</i> medially, a pair of stubby conical
			<i>palps</i> laterally, and two pairs of dorsal <i>eyes</i>.
			The eyes are more advanced than in planaria, with a layer of
			light-sensitive cells and gelatinous lens concentrating light
			on each eye. A pair of strong chitinous <i>jaws</i> are everted
			from the pharynx are used by <i>Neanthes</i> in capturing its prey
			(it feeds on crustaceans and small animals).
		</p>
		<p>
			With exception of the first and last, each segment has <i>parapodia</i>,
			lateral extensions involved in locomotion (swimming, creeping) and
			respiration. Capillaries in the parapodia serve in the gas exchange.
			Stiff bristles (<i>aciculi</i>) emerge from the parapodia and are
			internal skeletal elements.
		</p>
		<p>
			The rest of the anatomy is not much different from the earthworm
			except for reproduction. Sexes are separate, and gonads develop
			only during breeding. They develop in the coelomic peritoneum
			in the posterior; this is associated with structural changes
			in various body regions, with color changes, and with parapodial
			enlargements. At various times (associated with external stimuli
			such as moon phase changes) the worms come to the surface,
			release their gametes through nephridial ducts or by ruptures
			in the body wall. These events are dramatic in the case of
			<i>Eunice viridis</i>, a South Pacific worm which emerges
			in the millions during the last quarter of the moon
			at lowest tides during October and November. Fertilization
			in the sea is followed by development seen as spiral determinate
			cleavage producing a trochophore larva not distinguishable
			from the mollusk in early stages. The apical portion of
			the larva undergoes metamorphosis to form a prostomium and
			body segments form from the rest, extending segments to the rear.

			The Leeches

		</p>
		<p>
			Most of these organisms are parasitic, but some are
			carnivorous, living on worms, crustaceans, and other vertebrates. The body is
			quite flattened in the dorsoventral plane. Most species have two suckers, at
			the anterior surrounding the mouth, and a posterior one. A constant 34
			segments are found in the leech body, although it may seem like more because of
			superficial annulations in the body wall. With the exception of <i>Acanthobdella</i>,
			there are no setae.

		</p>
		<p>
			Sharp jaws in the animal cut the skin of the host in the
			parasitic forms (the cut is Y-shaped). <i>Hirudin</i> is an anticoagulant
			secreted from the salivary gland of the animal, and it is also an anesthetic to
			make the host unaware of the leech's presence. <i>Hirudo medicinalis</i>
			is the classic example. Blood meal enters the gut through the contractions of
			the pharynx, passing through it and a short esophagus into a capacious <i>crop</i>
			or <i>stomach</i>, it having up to 11 pairs of lateral <i>caeca</i> to store
			the blood. These organs permit the leech to store food for several months
			between meals. Posterior to these caeca is the intestine, a straight tube
			perhaps with lateral storage sacs. A short rectum leads to the anus in front
			of the posterior sucker.
		</p>
		<p>
			Paired metanephridia are found in the midsegments. The
			coelom is filled with spongy connective tissue and nephridial tubules are
			enveloped within it. The circulatory system is made up of sinuses in the
			connective tissue. There are two lateral sinuses, and one ventral and one
			dorsal sinus. These sinuses pulsate to circulate the blood. The brain is
			bilobed and dorsal, with circumpharyngeal connectives to a ventral cord.
			Eyespots are on the head, chemoreceptors on the mouth, tactile organs on the
			body. The leeches are hermaphroditic, with a series of paired testes attached
			to a vas deferens; a median muscular penis joins with the mate anteriorly in
			cross-fertilization. Posterior to the male pore is an opening to a median
			vagina connected to two ovaries. A clitellar-derived cocoon is produced as in
			oligochaetes and development has no larval stages.

		<p>
			The phyla Onychophora, Tardigrada, and Pentastomida
			represent transitional stages in the emergence of arthropods from annelids.
			Zoologists do not always agree about their placement. Onychophores are
			considered subphyla of Annelida by some. Some unite the three phyla into one
			called Oncopoda.

		</p>
		<p>
			The onychophores are made up of &lt;75 spp. and show the
			greatest transition between arthropods and annelids. They live under logs and
			leaf mold in tropical and subtropical forests of both hemispheres.

		</p>
		<p>
			Their body is covered with a velvet-like chitinous cuticle.
			Tubercles and papillae cover the entire body, and the larger ones have a
			sensory bristle. In the head segments: eyes and sensory antennae are on the
			first, <i>oral papillae</i> on the second, and mouth and jaws on the
			third. The oral papillae can shoot an adhesive up to a half meter away; it
			effectively entangles prey or enemy. Segmentation is evidenced only by the
			paired appendages, unjointed but each bearing claws. Nephridial openings are
			found at the base of the legs on the ventral side.

		</p>
		<p>
			The body wall is very like an annelid body, with epidermis
			and circular/longitudinal muscle. Muscles are also not striated (a feature of
			annelids while arthropods have striated muscle). The mouth is equipped with
			lateral movable jaws (modified appendages) and a single dorsal median tooth.
			The gut is a straight tube which ends in a posterior anus. Paired metanephridia
			are in each segment, opening internally into a coelomic sac. Circulation is a
			simple dorsally located tubular heart open at both ends, with a pair of ostia
			in each segment. Blood is colorless with amoeboid cells moving anteriorly and
			into open blood sinuses. <i>Trachea</i> are thin, unbranched tubules, many of
			which open into each <i>spiracle</i>. Spiracles are not arranged segmentally
			(as in arthropods) but are all over the body surface. The nervous system is
			annelid-like (bilobed brain, ventral nerve cord with lateral connections) but
			ganglia in the segments are not obvious.

		</p>
		<p>
			The animals are dioecious, with paired gonads in the dorsal
			posterior region. A gonopore just anterior to the anus leads its ciliated
			ducts (modified nephridia) to the gonads. Ducts in females are enlarged to
			form a uterus where fertilized eggs are retained until development is finished
			in most species. Eggs have their cytoplasmic arrangements similar to the
			arthropods, with yolk centrally located and cleavage generally superficial.
			Subsequent development is arthropod-like.

		</p>
		<p>
			Microscopic animals usually &lt;1 mm long. They have 4
			pairs unjointed legs with claws; they were first placed as arachnids, but the
			unjointed legs and the lack of chitin distinguishes these forms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Body is a head and 5 trunk segments. Four of them have
			fleshy appendages with claws at the tip. The cuticle secreted by epidermal
			cells is nonchitinous and covers body and anterior and posterior of the gut.
			Spines or other modifications of the cuticle are present. The muscle below the
			epidermis is more arthropod-like, arranged in thin bands extending from one
			part of the exoskeleton to the other. The space between body wall and gut is
			not a coelom but a hemocoel. <i>Coelomic sacs</i> form during
			development, but degenerate in all but the cavity containing the gonad and its
			ducts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The animals are largely vegetable feeders, sucking sap with
			the help of a stylet and using the muscular pharynx to produce the vacuum. A
			short esophagus leads to a stomach and short hindgut; the anus is located just
			anterior to the fourth pair of legs on the ventral surface. At the beginning
			of the hindgut are <i>Malpighian tubules</i>, which are glandular
			diverticulae. The brain is dorsal above the pharynx, with circumpharyngeal
			connectives, a ventral nerve cord with four ganglia.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tardigrades have separate sexes, with either a single
			ovary or testis dorsally located in the hind region. Gonoducts open into the
			hindgut or to a pore on the outside. Development is outside the body,
			surrounded perhaps by the female cuticle shed at that time. Five pairs of
			coelomic sacs evaginate from the gut during development, typical of
			enterocoelic development and not usual for protostomes. All but one disappears
			as previously indicated.

		<p>
			This phylum sometimes referred to as Linguatulida, has
			&lt;70 spp. Adults are entirely parasitic in respiratory passages of
			carnivorous animals, mostly reptiles. Tropical in distribution (not found in
			the U.S.). Their larvae have two stubby, unjointed, claw-bearing legs (similar
			to mite larvae) which show their relation to arthropods. The adults are
			degenerate in accordance with a parasitic existence.
		</p>
		<p>
			Their body has thin chitinous cuticle. Mouth anterior, two
			pair retractable claws on either side. The name pentastomida results when the
			four claws were mistaken for mouths, in addition to the true mouth. These
			worms attach to the lining of the respiratory passage and use the claws to
			cause bleeding. Glands in the claws secrete anticoagulant; blood is sucked
			into the mouth with the muscular pharynx. A midgut extends the body length.
			The nervous system is a ladder-type, three segmentally arranged ganglia
			present. A circumpharyngeal nerve ring is found but no brain. The
			circulatory, respiratory, and excretory systems with ciliated cells are absent.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sexes are separate, and dimorphism shows a larger
			female. Fertilization is internal. Zygotes must leave the host to be ingested
			by an intermediate host, a fish in the case of a species infecting crocodiles
			or by an herbivorous mammal in terrestrial definitive hosts. Eggs hatch in the
			gut, enter the blood or lymph, being transported to various parts of the body.
			The larvae hatch are resemble mite larvae with their unjointed, claw-bearing
			legs. These encyst in the host tissue and molt several times. The
			intermediate host is then eaten by the carnivorous vertebrate; larvae excyst,
			move up the esophagus to the respiratory passages, attach and mature.

			(5) Coelom greatly reduced.

		</p>
		<p>
			The largest phylum in the kingdom in terms of numbers and species.
			Indeed combining the numbers of both plant and animals excepting the
			arthropods, the arthropods still outnumber this total. Arthropods
			are found in all climes and habitats. Most are free-living,
			some are parasitic. Some species have organized societies where
			labor is divided and there is caste differentiation. They have
			been on this earth for at least half billion years;
			trilobite fossils from the Cambrian and Silurian date back 550-350
			million years ago.
		</p>
		<p>
			Phylogenetic development shows a clear ancestral
			relationship to annelids. The progenitor had a segmented body with simple head
			which maybe had sensory bristles. A ventrally located mouth was between the
			head and first body segment. Walking legs appear in each segment but the last;
			these legs are unsegmented in the more primitive forms. Eyes and antennae
			develop in the head (characters like in <i>Peripatus</i>).
		</p>
		<p>
			Segmentation of the legs then follows, with the anterior
			appendages evolving for feeding rather than locomotion. The prostomium fuses
			with the first body segment. The trilobites show such features although no
			living species does.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arthropods then follow two separate paths: some develop enhanced
			jaws and antennae (the Mandibulata), while the others lack jaws and
			antennae but have pincer-like <i>chelicerae</i> and a pair of leg-like
			pedipalps around the mouth (the Chelicerata).
		</p>
		<p>
			The <i>jointed appendages</i> are a defining character in arthropods
			(hence the name). The success of the phylum is due to adaptation
			developed within these structures, in which these appendages are
			used for swimming, breathing, and reproduction, in addition to having
			specialized functions in defense, food procurement, chewing, and sensory
			perception.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <i>chitinous exoskeleton</i> is another defining
			character. This is only a thin cuticle in annelids without skeletal
			significance to them. It is thicker and harder in arthropods,
			composed of a waxy outer layer, chitin in the intermediate layer
			made rigid by infusion with mineral salts (lime), and a chitinous
			horny inner layer more flexible. This hard middle layer is not
			present at the joints, necessary for the hinged movement about
			the jointed regions. Muscles are attached to the hard layer on
			either side of the jointed region, spanning the joint. This muscle is striated
			as in vertebrates, and provides the same strong and rapid contraction as in
			vertebrate skeletal muscle. The exoskeleton makes a terrestrial existence
			possible, since it is suitable to prevent dessication of the tissues.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are some disadvantages to such an exoskeleton
			however. It is basically a suit of armor which allows for little growth of the
			organism. For this reason, arthropods undergo a number of <i>molts</i> during
			growth. In this process, the organism splits its exoskeleton and emerges from
			it. At this stage the animal has no protective chitin, expanding its body size
			first before secreting the hard inflexible layers of chitin; because of its
			vulnerability during this period, it is most subject to attack by its enemies.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Cephalization</i> is more advanced in arthropods than in annelids.
			In the previous phyla there is no real distinct <i>head</i> as in
			arthropods. Other segments of the body may form a <i>thorax</i>
			and <i>abdomen</i>. In some arthropods fusion of the head and thorax
			is obvious (<i>cephalothorax</i>). An improved nervous system and
			more specialized sense organs are evident in the head. A
			<i>compound eye</i> is one sense organ distinctive in arthropods.

		</p>
		<p>
			The arthropod digestive system is divided into a fore-,
			mid-, and hindgut. The fore- and hindgut are lined with chitin and
			embryologically derive as a stomodaeum and proctodaeum, resp. An esophagus and
			stomach are present (usually) in the foregut, the intestine making up the
			midgut. The anus is terminal at the end of the posteriorly located hindgut.
			Digestive glands and salivary glands connect to the gut appropriately.

		</p>
		<p>Excretion depends upon whether there is aquatic or
			terrestrial existence. For water-dwellers, a gland similar to a modified
			nephridium collects wastes and opens to a pore at the base of an appendage (the
			<i>coxal glands</i> of horseshoe crab; the <i>green glands</i> in
			crustacea at the base of certain head appendages, usually second antennae).
			For land-dwellers, <i>Malpighian tubules</i> open into the gut (where
			mid- and hindgut meet). The open circulatory system is of a dorsal heart with
			openings called ostia. Arteries deliver blood to large sinuses, and the blood
			returns from the sinuses to the heart. In aquatic forms, these respire by
			means of gills or <i>gill books</i>, while terrestrial forms have either
			<i>lung books</i> or tracheal systems, or both.

		</p>
		<p>Most are dioecious, with internal fertilization in
			terrestrial forms, and either internal or external in the water-dwellers. Eggs
			have a centrally located yolk. Cleavage is mitotic to form a syncytial mass.
			Nuclei then migrate to the surface and then plasma membranes form around them.
			At that time, a blastula forms. Gastrulation is either by invagination or
			delamination.

		</p>
		<p>
			There are 10 orders of arachnids and three are detailed below.

		</p>
		<h3 class="part2">The Scorpions</h3>

		Thought to be the most primitive of arachnids, they may have
		had a common ancestor with the extinct eurypterids. Typically living in the
		arid tropical and semitropical zones. Both the obvious body segmentation and
		appendages show less specialization than in other arachnids. The body is a
		cephalothorax with highly segmented abdomen. A pair of three-jointed
		chelicerae are anterior to the mouth. Posterior to it are large and
		pincer-like pedipalps, a distinctive feature of the scorpions. It has four
		pairs of walking legs extending from the cephalothorax. On the ventral side of
		the first segment in the abdomen, a genital opening is covered by an
		operculum. On the second segment are <i>pectines</i>, comb-like structures
		which appear to be tactile receptors. The next four segments have slits which
		are <i>spiracles</i> opening into its book lungs. The abdomen extends its
		segments to form a very characteristic tail, the last segment (telson) bearing
		the sharply pointed <i>sting</i>. Most scorpions are not deadly to humans, but
		young children are small enough to be fatally vulnerable to the sting of many
		genera.

		<p>
			Scorpions feed on small arthropods which they grasp with
			their pedipalps, stinging them by arching their tails. Fluids from the victim
			are consumed, the chitinous shell discarded. Excretion is by Malpighian
			tubules. Respiration is by lung books. During reproduction, mating is
			preceded by a courting dance; fertilization internal. The young develop within
			the mother, clinging to her for some days after birth.

		</p>
		<h3 class="part2">The Spiders</h3>

		The most familiar arachnids, living in all types of
		environments. Body is an unsegmented cephalothorax joined by a narrow peduncle
		to the abdomen (also unsegmented). On the dorsal aspect of the anterior of the
		cephalothorax are four pairs of simple eyes. Six pairs of appendages include
		(i) the chelicerae, seen as sharp <i>fangs</i> connected to poison ducts; (ii)
		pedipalpi which have enlarged bases to crush food; (iii) four pair of walking
		legs. Only a very few spiders have poison is seriously toxic to humans: the
		black widow spider (<i>Latrodectus mactans</i>) and other members of its
		genus can cause severe pain, even death; the brown recluse (<i>Loxosceles reclusa</i>)
		can cause severe pain and ulcerating sores.

		<p>
			In the abdomen just behind the peduncle is the ventral
			opening to the book lungs, found only in arachnids. These are a series of
			flat, leaf-like plates highly vascularized. Gas exchange occurs as air passes
			over these plates, as many as 20 to a book lung. A genital opening is
			posterior to the book lung opening, covered by a heavy plate called a <i>epigynum</i>
			in female spiders. In the posterior of the abdomen of many species is a second
			spiracle opening which leads to a tracheal system seen in insects, giving the
			spider two types of respiratory systems. And at the abdominal tip just anterior
			to the anal opening are two to three pairs of <i>spinnerets</i>, opening to the
			tubules which connect to the silk glands. Spider silk is protein in nature,
			hardening when it makes contact with air. Particular threads are sticky (for
			catching prey) and others are not.

		</p>
		<p>
			The sexes are distinct and dimorphism is typical, with the
			female usually larger or differently colored, or both. Pedipalps on the male
			are modified for transferring sperm to the female genital pore. In many
			species, there is a complicated courting in which the male attempts to mate
			with the female or be killed and eaten by the female. Eggs are laid to a
			cocoon which may or may not be carried by the female until the young hatch.

		<h3 class="part2">The Mites and Ticks</h3>

		This order is of importance as it is a vector for disease or
		does agricultural damage. Mites are the more numerous, with soil dwelling
		forms numbering in the multimillions per acre. The acarinids are generally
		small and even microscopic. The entire body is fused, with evidence of
		segmentation lost in most. The body can be membranous or covered on the dorsal
		side with thick plates. All ticks and most mites have no eyes. The chelicerae
		are chelate in free-living forms, pointed, sucking types in parasitic forms.
		Pedipalps can be simple leg-like structures to stout one with pincers. Claws
		are found on the terminal segments of the four pairs of walking appendages. In
		most the circulatory system is reduced and there are trachea, although some
		completely lack trachea, carrying out respiration on their body surface.
		Either coxal glands or Malpighian tubules, or both, are present in one to four
		pairs for excretion.

		<p>
			Sexes are separate with a 6-legged larval form feeding and
			molting into a sexually immature 8-legged form called a <i>nymph</i>. The
			nymph feeds and molts (usually after a blood meal in parasitic types) a number
			of times before becoming an adult.

		</p>
		<p>
			Serious diseases transmitted by tick bites include Rocky
			Mountain spotted fever (the wood tick, <i>Dermacentor andersoni</i>),
			tularemia, relapsing fever, and Q fever. The chigger is a larval stage of
			mite; in the Far East it causes severe itching and is a vector for scrub
			typhus.

		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Crustacea</span>

		</p>
		<p>
			Body is a head with five segments which may or may not fuse
			with thorax, and then an abdomen with terminal telson. Appendages on the head
			include two pairs of antennae, one pair of jaws, and two pairs of maxillae.
			Compound eyes are present usually. The appendages are biramous mostly.
			Respiration is through gills or through the body surface. Crustacea are mostly
			aquatic, both freshwater and marine.

		</p>
		<h3 class="part2">The Crayfish</h3>

		<p>A typical crustacean is the crayfish. One only genus is
			found west of the U.S. Continental Divide (<i>Astacus</i>), while six are found
			east of it (<i>Cambarus</i> being most common). The marine lobster <i>Homarus</i>
			<i>americanus</i> which is such a seafood delight is a cousin.

		</p>
		<p>The body has a hard exoskeleton, with a cephalothorax and an
			abdomen divided into six segments with terminal telson. The anal opening is
			ventral. The carapace is the solid exoskeletal shield covering the dorsal and
			lateral surfaces of the cephalothorax; it hides the segmented nature of the
			head and thorax, evident on the ventral surface in the appendages. A <i>cervical</i>
			<i>groove</i> on the carapace marks the separation between head and thorax.
			The <i>rostrum</i> is a point forming in the anterior of the carapace.

		</p>
		<p>The evolution of appendages in crustaceans is very marked.
			The ancestral trilobite had appendages very much like paired abdominal
			appendages on crayfish, the <i>swimmerets</i>, biramous in that they have two
			branches or rami. Each of the biramous appendages has a basal portion (<i>protopodite</i>),
			outside branch (<i>exopodite</i>), and inside branch (<i>endopodite</i>). It
			is assumed that these appendages were used in swimming for the trilobite, and
			there is <i>serial homology</i> for such appendages in crustaceans (seen
			in development), although many are not biramous in the adult.

		</p>
		<p>The most anterior appendages are the stalked compound eyes
			and the branched antennules (first antennae) on the head. These are probably
			not homologous with other appendages on the crayfish, but instead developing
			form the nonsegmented prostomial region in the embryo. Branching of the
			antennules is not indicative of an endo- and exopodite elaboration, since it
			occurs later in development and seems secondary. The other appendages in the
			head are in fact homologous structures: the antennae (2nd antennae), the <i>mandibles</i>,
			and the <i>first</i> and <i>second maxillae</i>. The antenna is
			composed of a long endopodite sensory in function; the exopodite is a small
			scale-like projection. Each mandible has a small segmented palp which is a
			modified endopodite and missing exopodite; the heavy jaw-like part of the
			mandible is derived from the protopodite. The mouth is located above the
			mandibles. The first and second maxillae pass food to the mouth: the
			exopodite of the second maxilla is modified to form a thin indented plate
			called the <i>bailer</i>, and this circulates water through the gill chamber.

		</p>
		<p>The thoracic region is made of 8 segments, each with pairs
			of appendages. The first three pairs are the <i>1st</i>, <i>2nd</i>, and <i>3rd</i>
			<i>maxillapeds</i>, which rend food and pass it to the mouth. The next pair is
			the large pinching legs or <i>chelipeds</i> (also called 1st walking legs) used
			in defense and food procurement. The last four pairs are walking legs. In
			these last five pairs of thoracic appendages (the walking legs namely), the
			exopodite does not appear in the adult.

		</p>
		<p>Crayfish show the capacity for <i>autotomy</i>, a process of
			self-amputation. At the base of the leg is an <i>autotomy line</i>
			where special muscles contract and let loose the distal leg portion. A valve
			and diaphragm then close to minimize blood loss, and appendage can later
			regenerate. Gills are found at the bases of thoracic appendages. Openings to
			the reproductive system are at the base of the 3rd pair of walking legs in the
			female, the 5th pair in the male.

		</p>
		<p>The abdominal appendages are swimmerets, in which the first
			two pairs are modified in the male for transferring sperm. The next three
			biraminous appendages move water and also attach to eggs (in the female). The
			sixth pair are <i>uropods</i>, very enlarged and used (with the action of the
			telson) in forming a powerful backward swimming tail.

		</p>
		<p>The food for crayfish is caught and crushed in the
			chelipeds, passed to the mouth with the maxillipeds and maxillae. Food is
			broken down further by maxillipeds and the mandibles and then consumed. From
			the mouth and into a short tubular esophagus, it enters a large stomach with a
			thin-walled anterior <i>cardiac</i> region and a smaller posterior <i>pyloric</i>
			region. This continues to a short midgut, then to the intestine. Two large
			multilobed digestive glands connect to the midgut. The cardiac stomach is for
			storage and it has a <i>gastric mill</i>, three teeth-like (one median,
			two lateral) structures which pulverize the food and are moved by muscles
			surrounding this region. Folds with many hair-like setae guard the entrance to
			the pyloric chamber and these filter out all but the finest particles. The
			digestive glands secrete all of the enzymes necessary for digesting of protein,
			carbohydrate, and fat; this perhaps accounts for why the crayfish has such a
			short, uncoiled intestine. It is interesting that only the midgut and
			digestive glands are endodermally derived, while the other parts of the
			alimentary canal are ectodermally derived and secrete a cuticle that is shed
			with each molt. <i>Gastroliths</i> are two calcareous deposits in the wall of
			the cardiac region of the stomach, and the calcium salts in these are absorbed
			during molting, believed to be used in hardening certain parts of the new
			exoskeleton.

		</p>
		<p>Crayfish respire through feather-like gills under the
			lateral wall of the carapace, attached to the bases of the thoracic
			appendages. They are located in a gill chamber. Water enters the chamber
			under the carapace, helped by the up-and-down action of the bailer (second
			maxilla) causing water to flow in the direction toward the gills. The gills
			are highly vascularized.

		</p>
		<p>The circulatory system in all arthropods is open, with the
			heart in a blood-filled chamber called the <i>pericardial sinus</i>. It
			has three pairs of openings (ostia) which lets blood enter from the pericardial
			cavity. Heart contraction carries the blood to seven arteries going into the
			body; backflow out the ostia is prevented by valves. The arteries bifurcate,
			eventually opening into sinuses in the tissues. Blood collects into a large
			ventral sinus (<i>sternal sinus</i>), where it follows afferent vessels
			into the gills. From the gills, efferent vessels lead to the pericardial sinus
			where the blood is dumped. Its blood is nearly colorless, but <i>hemocyanin</i>
			is a pigment dissolved in the blood (very deep blue when fully and artificially
			oxygenated). Crayfish show a clotting ability seen when autotomy occurs.

		</p>
		<p>Two large <i>green glands</i> are in the head ventral
			region, anterior to the esophagus. They remove waste from the blood. Each
			gland has a glandular portion and bladder. The nervous system is similar to
			the annelid earthworm. The brain receives sensory input from eyes, antennules,
			and antennae. Circumesophageal connectives pass ventrally to a double ganglion
			(subesophageal), which is the fusion of six embryonic ganglia present in the
			embryo. The ventral nerve cord appears as two cords running posteriorly.
			There are many other nerves to appendages, muscles, and organs. Most of the
			body is sensitive to touch, there being <i>tactile hairs</i> found on
			the chelipeds, mouth parts, under side of abdomen, and edge of telson.
			Chemosensation (like the vertebrate smell and taste) is found in the hairs of
			antennules, antennae, and mouth parts.

		</p>
		<p>At the base of the antennules are statocysts (undoubtedly
			for equilibrium). These statocysts are chitin-lined sacs with small openings
			to the outside. Within each statocyst are numerous sensory hairs to which sand
			grains are attached by mucus to serve as statoliths. Sensory fibers lead from
			the hairs to the brain. Changes in position (gravity) cause the statoliths to
			tug and initiate impulses leading to a righting reflex. Kreidl showed this
			function in shrimp related to the crayfish: using newly molted shrimp (the
			statocyst lining and sand grains are shed in the molt), he placed the animal in
			water with a bed of iron filings instead of sand. When the animal formed its
			new exoskeleton, it scraped its antennules to pick up the filings instead of
			sand. Thus substituted, the experimenter placed a magnet over the animal and
			it responded by turning on its back.

		</p>
		<p>The compound eye is a distinct sense organ in arthropods and
			unlike the vertebrate eye. In the crayfish they are on movable stalks on
			either side of the rostrum. The outer rounded surface is the <i>cornea</i>,
			divided into 2000 tiny <i>facets</i>. The facet represents the outer part of
			the compound eye unit, the <i>ommatidium</i>. Besides the facet, serving as a
			lens, the ommatidium has a crystalline cone, sensory cells serving as the
			retina, and pigment cells at the outer and inner ends. Nerve fibers extend
			from the retina to brain. In bright light, the pigment is dispersed so that
			each ommatidium is isolated from the neighboring ones, and light must enter at
			an angle parallel to the long axis of the ommatidium. Light coming in at an
			angle is absorbed by pigment. The image detected is a <i>mosaic image</i>.
			In bright light the eye detects moving objects very well. In dim light, the
			pigment become concentrated at the two ends of the ommatidia such that light
			rays spread to adjacent ommatidia. This image is likely to be a continuous or <i>superposition</i>
			<i>image</i> less distinct than the mosaic.

		</p>
		<p>Muscles are segmentally arranged in the abdomen, with large
			flexors functioning in the backward locomotion of the animal. These muscles
			are striated, being rapid and forceful in contraction. Other muscles move the
			various appendages in the cephalothorax, such as adductors for the chelipeds.
			Smooth muscle is found in crayfish around blood vessels and digestive tract as
			it is in vertebrates.

		</p>
		<p>Sexes are distinct in crayfish, with three-lobed gonads
			located in the dorsal area between pericardial sinus and gut. The gonads are
			hollow, the cavities here and in the excretory organs being the only remnants
			of the coelom in the adult crayfish. Oviducts in females connect to an opening
			in the base of the 3rd walking leg pair. A seminal receptacle is fashioned as
			a cuticular fold between the bases of the 4th and 5th walking leg pair. Coiled
			sperm ducts in the male open to the base of the 5th walking leg pair, the walls
			of the duct secreting a sticky gelatinous mass over the sperm as they pass
			out. Received by the female during a copulatory act, the sperm are held alive
			in the gelatinous mix in the seminal receptacle until the female flips on to
			her back after cleaning the ventral side of the abdomen, then releases the eggs
			over the sperm. The eggs pass to the swimmerets where they adhere to the
			appendages as a result of sticky secretions in the limbs. Development proceeds
			for 5-8 weeks in which the hatched young resemble the adult. Marine
			crustaceans do however go through larval stages with young looking nothing like
			the adult.

		</p>
		<p>Little work has been done to understand the endocrine
			functions in crayfish, insects, and invertebrates. Crayfish have a
			neurosecretory gland called the <i>X-organ</i>, located at the base of the
			eyestalk. This X-organ produces a number of hormones passing via axons to a
			storage-release center, also located in the eyestalk and called the sinus
			gland. These hormones control the distribution of retinal pigment in the light/dark
			adaptation; they regulate calcium deposition in gastroliths during molting;
			they regulate molting; they regulate pigment granule distribution in
			chromatophores in the epidermis.

			Class <span class="class-name">Diplopoda</span>

		</p>
		<p>These animals have a long, usually cylindrical body with
			distinct head and trunk. The head has many small simple eyes; one pair
			antennae (7-segmented); jaws and maxillae. The latter fuse to form a
			plate-like <i>gnathochilarium</i>. The thorax has four segments, the first of
			which is legless, the other three having a single pair of legs. Abdomen is
			huge, with many segments (up to 100 or more), each with two pairs of legs.
			Reproductive ducts open in middle of third segment.

		</p>
		<p>This class contains the millipedes and centipedes. It is
			clear that the segments in the abdomen represent the fusion of two segments,
			since in each segment there are two pairs of legs, two spiracles, two ganglia
			along the ventral nerve. The long dorsal tubular heart runs the length of the
			animal and has two ostia.

		</p>
		<p>The millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living and
			decaying vegetation. Some will eat dead animal matter; others prey on
			earthworms. The digestive tract is mostly uncoiled, little or no
			modifications. Salivary glands are present to assist digestion; excretion is
			through Malpighian tubules. On the midventral line is a single gonad, opening
			to ventral side on 3rd segment. On the 7th segment of males, <i>gonopods</i>
			help transfer sperm to the female, where fertilization is internal. Eggs in
			some species can sit in nest often lined with fecal matter. A small version of
			the adult hatches 2-3 wk later, 3 pairs of legs and 7 segments. Growth and
			molting involves the addition of a new segment (<i>anamorphosis</i>), added to
			the posterior just in front of the terminal segment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some species have <q>stink glands</q> (<i>repugnatorial glands</i>)
			which can produce hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The glands are on the lateral body
			margins, one per segment in some forms, one every other segment in others.
			Nontoxic precursors are prepared and mixed to liberate the HCN when it is
			necessary.

		</p>
		<h3 class="part2">The Grasshopper</h3>

		A good model of insects is the lubber grasshopper, largely
		because it is sufficiently large to dissect and to give meaning. The
		exoskeleton is chitinous, as for all insects; at the joints the exoskeleton
		become thin for flexibility in motion.

		<p>All three body regions are segmented. In the head the six
			fused segments are not generally apparent except during embryonic development;
			only the paired head appendages suggest the segmented nature. Insects have two
			large compound eyes (see crayfish for anatomy of this eye). Grasshoppers also
			possess <i>ocelli</i>, three simple eyes, much like a single ommatidium in a
			compound eye. Two long segmented sensory antennae issue from the medial point
			between the eyes. The mouth parts have an upper lip or <i>labrum</i>, a pair
			of toothed mandibles, a pair of maxillae, and the lower lip or <i>labium</i>.
			Also in the mouth is a hypopharynx, a tongue-like organ beneath the labrum.
			Their mouth parts are considered to be <i>chewing</i> mouth parts. Their diet
			is leafy vegetable material

		</p>
		<p>The thorax has three segments which are each called <i>prothorax</i>,
			<i>mesothorax</i>, and <i>metathorax</i> from anterior to posterior. The
			thorax is partially covered by a dorsal projection from the first segment.
			From each segment is three leg pairs (the old name for Insecta was Hexapoda).
			Each leg is segmented, grouped into 5 regions: the first two are short and
			called the <i>coxa</i> and the <i>trochanter</i>. Next are two long segments,
			the <i>femur</i> and <i>tibia</i>. The last region is the <i>tarsus</i>, and
			has three segments and ends in two <i>claws</i> having a pad between them (the <i>pulvillus</i>).
			The first two pairs are for walking, but the third pair is modified for
			jumping. Forewings attach to the dorsal mesothorax and hindwings to the dorsal
			metathorax. The grasshopper shows some specialization distinct from other
			insects in that its wings are different, whereas in the primitive species they
			are alike. The first pair of wings are actually hardened and serve as a cover
			for the fan-like second pair.

		</p>
		<p>Two <i>cerci</i> are paired appendanges found in the tip of
			the abdomen of the grasshopper, which otherwise has no abdominal appendages.

		</p>
		<p><b>Digestive system</b>. The digestive tract has
			three regions as in crustacea: a foregut, midgut, and hindgut, and as in
			crustacea, the foregut and hindgut are lined with chitin and are ectodermally
			derived. The foregut is composed of a pharynx, tubular esophagus, large thin-walled
			<i>crop</i>, muscular <i>gizzard</i>. Salivary glands contribute to digestion
			of items taken into the mouth. The crop is a storage organ, and the gizzard
			has chitinous teeth used in grinding the food before it proceeds to the
			stomach, having paired cone-shaped <i>gastric pouches</i> or <i>caeca</i>
			and making up the midgut. The pouches secrete a digestive mix, and absorption
			is through the stomach wall. The hindgut is composed of a small and large
			intestine, rectum, and anus. Several long excretory tubules are found at the
			junction of the stomach with the intestine.

		</p>
		<p><b>Excretory system</b>. Named after their
			discoverer, the Malpighian tubules lie in the blood sinuses and take up
			nitrogenous wastes from the blood, passing them to the hindgut as uric acid
			crystals; hence the nitrogenous wastes pass out the gut with fecal material as
			dry excretions. This explains why insects are adapted to arid areas as well.

		</p>
		<p><b>Respiratory system</b>. The tracheal tubules are
			a network of finely branching tubules distributed throughout the tissues of the
			body. These connect with tubes leading to the outside of the body, the
			openings (spiracles) being evident on the lateral thorax and abdomen. Each
			spiracle is guarded by a valve which opens or closes to regulate the air flow.
			Larger tracheal tube walls are reinforced with fine spirally wound chitinous
			threads to prevent collapse. Also associated with tubes in the grasshopper are
			several large <i>air sacs</i> serving as air reservoirs. The finer
			tracheal tubes are fluid-filled, into which oxygen dissolves. Air movement
			through the tubes results from alternate expansion and contraction of the
			abdomen. The first four pairs of spiracles open during inspiration, the last
			six are closed; in expiration, these are reversed.

		</p>
		<p><b>Circulatory system</b>. The blood in the
			grasshopper is not as in other complex animals, with blood in others serving a
			vital respiratory role. The circulatory system is open, a single dorsal tube
			in the middorsal line below the body wall in which the posterior is contractile
			(a heart), and the flow of blood is to the anterior by an aorta. The heart is
			partially constricted into a series of chambers and a pair of ostia open into
			each of these. The heart is found in a pericardial sinus. Contraction causes
			closing of the ostia and blood is pumped into communcating sinuses. The blood
			is a colorless plasma but does have phagocytic white cells.

		</p>
		<p><b>Nervous system </b>and<b> sense organs</b>. Its
			nervous system is like the crayfish. A ganglion for each segment is present,
			but in the adult some of the ganglia are fused. The first three embryonic head
			ganglia fuse to form an adult brain, the last three fuse to form an
			subesophageal ganglion, and the brain and the subesophageal join by a pair of
			circumesophageal connectives. Wentral nerve cords connect at large ganglia in
			each thoracic segment, and the abdomen has 5 ganglia, the reduced number a
			result of fusions during development. In more complex insects, fusion of the
			embryonic ganglia is more extensive, in some cases all of the thoracic and
			abdominal ganglia fusing into one mass.

		</p>
		<p>The grasshopper appears to have excellent receptors for all
			5 senses. The compound eye works as for crayfish, and the ocelli for simple
			light detection. All of the fine hairs on the body are tactile receptors.
			Chemoreceptors are found in small pits in the antennae (smell) and around the
			mouth (taste). On the sides of the first abdominal segment are a pair of <i>tympana</i>,
			each vested with nerve fibers leading to the central nervous system; these
			clearly sense vibrations in the air generated by sound.

		</p>
		<p>As for sounds produced by grasshoppers: one is made by
			drawing of the femurs of the hindlegs aross the hindwings; a sharper noise
			produced by flying is a result of rubbing of the forewing against the hindwing.

		</p>
		<p><b>Muscles</b>. The muscles associated with the exoskeleton
			are very well striated, accounting for the power and rapid response. A
			honeybee is known to beat its wings 400 times each second. An ant can carry an
			object heavier than itself: this is equivalent to a man climbing a vertical
			cliff at a speed of 30 km per hour with a 90 kg load on his back.

		</p>
		<p><b>Reproductive system</b>. The female grasshopper
			is larger than the male; has four prongs at the tip of its abdomen (<i>ovipositors</i>);
			has a pair of ovaries and oviducts which unite to form a vagina. The seminal
			receptacle (receives sperm during copulation) connects with the vagina. The
			testes are found in the male at a position similar to the ovaries. Vasa
			deferentia lead from them to unite to form an ejaculatory duct, the end of
			which is the penis. Subsequent to copulation, the female digs a hole with her
			ovipositor and deposits the egg mass.

		</p>
		<p>Development involves a cleavage in which the mitosis with
			cell division; nuclei then migrate to the periphery and cell membranes form
			around them to make an outer layer of cells. The three primary germ layers
			form. Coelomic sacs form in the mesoderm, but have fully disappeared by the
			time the adult is formed.

		</p>
		<p>Hatching shows a young grasshopper with a very large head
			relative to the rest of the body and no wings (the <i>nymph</i>). These nymphs
			are voracious feeders, and take five molts to become adults. The wings develop
			first as wing buds, expanding with each molt in a process called <i>gradual</i>
			<i>metamorphosis</i>.

		</p>
		<h3 class="part2">Insect Metamorphosis</h3>

		<p>Although seen in the other classes and indeed in other
			phyla, development from an egg to the adult can proceed in four ways in
			insects:

		</p>
		<p>1. No metamorphosis. The primitive species (silverfish,
			springtails) show no metamorphosis, looking like adults upon hatching, only
			increasing in size.

		</p>
		<p>2. Gradual metamorphosis. Many, including crickets,
			roaches, and the grasshoppers just mentioned show gradual morphological
			changes.

		</p>
		<p>
			3. Incomplete metamorphosis. This is typical of the May
			flies, stone flies, and dragonflies. The immature form resembles the adult,
			but these are adapted for an environment very different than the adult. The
			young dragonfly, or <i>naiad</i>, lives in the water and feeds on aquatic
			animals, possessing tracheal gills for respiration. As a terrestrial adult,
			the gills are lost for the proper tubes.

		</p>
		<p>
			4. Complete metamorphosis. The stages of development are
			obvious and this kind of metamorphosis describes the life cycle of the moths,
			butterflies, flies, beetles, and bees. The four stages are: <i>egg</i>, <i>larva</i>,
			<i>pupa</i>, and <i>adult</i>. Emerging from the hatched egg is a segmented,
			worm-like larva often referred to as a caterpillar (butterfly and moth), maggot
			(fly), and grub (beetle). The larva feed and grow. Several molts attend the
			larva, which eventually becomes a pupa. In moths, the caterpillars spin a
			cocoon around the pupal case (larval integument); in flies, the fully grown
			larva stop feeding and motion, with the larval covering becoming the pupal
			case. The pupal stage is generally called the quiescent stage. Within the
			pupa is a total reorganization of tissue to produce the adult; the nervous
			system reorganizes, compound eyes form, the muscles change, reproductive organs
			mature. When complete, the case splits and the adult emerges. Once the wings
			dry, the adult flies away.
		</p>
		<p>
			Study on molting and metamorphosis indicates the insects are
			under the control of hormones. The cecropia moth has been of use. It has a
			long dormancy (diapause) in the pupal stage. C. Williams (Harvard U.) has shown
			that chilling pupae for 6 weeks and then returning them to normal temperature
			is followed by a month of metamorphosis. Two hormones are involved: one is a
			brain hormone which stimulates the prothoracic glands to produce a second
			hormone, <i>ecdysone</i>. This hormone induces epidermal cells to produce a
			molting fluid so both molting and metamorphosis occur. These hormones are not
			made during diapause but during the larval period. A third hormone, the <i>juvenile</i>
			<i>hormone</i>, is produced by the <i>corpora allata</i>, two tiny
			glands posterior to the brain; this hormone stimulates larval development and
			inhibits metamorphosis. What happens is that ecdysone promotes larval
			development in the presence of juvenile hormone, but in its absence promotes
			metamorphosis. Reduced juvenile hormone produces a pupa, no juvenile hormone
			the adult. If the corpora allata are removed, pupation occurs at the next
			molt. If extra corpora allata are implanted in the mature larva, the larva
			molts to form a larger larva rather than pupates.
		</p>
		<p>
			The molecular biology of ecdysone (a sterol) has shown that
			hormone injected into a midge causes chromosomes to puff within 15 min in cells
			of the salivary gland, indicating it acts to produce certain genes.

		</p>
		<h3 class="part2">Importance of Insects</h3>

		Some insects are clearly beneficial. Honey and silk are
		insect products. Insects are vital to plant pollination. Others are used to
		kill injurious insects. Maggots of blowflies have been found useful in that,
		when placed in wounds, they consume dead tissue and produce a substance
		stimulating healing; they have been effectively used in cases of bone and bone
		marrow inflammation.

		<p>Other insects damage agriculturally important plants, cause
			damage to homes, annoy people, and spread disease. Plant-damaging insects
			include: grasshopper, army worm, potato beetle, European corn borer, Japanese
			beetle, Mediterranean fruit fly, Hessian fly, cotton boll weevil, wood-boring
			beetles, alfalfa weevel, corn-ear worm, flour moth, gypsy moth, brown-tail
			mouth, plant lice, leaf hopper, stink bug, scale insect, and chinch bug.
			Domestic animals are bothered by biting lice, sucking lice, horn flies, botfly
			larva, and ox warble fly larvae. Household pests include termites,
			cockroaches, clothes moths, ants, flies, bedbugs, mosquitoes.

		</p>
		<p>Malaria is perhaps the most significant disease affecting
			humans throughout the world, still killing millions. Control usually be
			stopping the propagation of the mosquito vector. Also carried by another
			mosquito is the yellow fever virus. Other diseases with insect vectors
			(vectors and etiologic agents in parentheses in that order): typhoid (can be
			housefly; bacterium), elephantiasis (mosquito; parasitic roundworm), bubonic
			plague (lice; bacterium), typhus fever (lice; rickettsia), African sleeping
			sickness (tse tse fly; trypanosome).

			The second major group of coelomates are the deuterostomes,

			indeterminate meaning that fate of blastomeres is not determined at an early
			stage; the mesoderm derives from the cells of archenteron, these cells
			evaginating to form the coelom (enterocoelic origin); the anus is formed from
			the blastopore; larval forms are not trochophores. These are all different

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Asteroidea</span>

		</p>
		<p>
			The most familiar of the echinoderms, the starfish. The Asterias forbesi
			is representative of the class. Composed of a central region
			(<i>disc</i>) with usually five <i>arms</i> (<i>rays</i>). These rays
			are not clearly delimited from the disc. The oral surface (the one
			with the mouth) is on the underside; the aboral surface on top.
			The plates of the calcareous endoskeleton are arranged such that
			the arms are capable of movement in lateral and up and down fashion.
			Numerous spines project from the thin epidermis. Moreover, numerous
			small pincers (<i>pedicellariae</i>) and small fingerlike process
			(<i>dermal branchiae</i>) project from the surface. The pedicellariae
			are used in handling food and caring for the body; the dermal
			branchiae have a respiratory function. An <i>ambulacral groove</i> is a
			deep groove on the oral surface extending from the mouth to the tip of the
			ray. Each groove contains two double or single rows of tube feet, these feet
			being part of the water-vascular system and functioning in locomotion. This
			system is really part of the coelom: water enters the sieve-like <i>madreporite</i>
			on the aboral surface, passes orally through the <i>stone canal</i> to a
			<i>ring canal</i> surrounding the mouth. On the inner margin of the
			ring canal are five pairs of sacs called <i>Tiedemann's bodies</i>, the source
			of amoeboid cells in the water-vascular system. Running just above the
			ambulacral groove in each of the arms is a <i>radial canal</i>,
			connected to the ring canal. Along this radial canal in the arms at regular
			intervals are lateral canals leading to muscular bulbs at the base of the tube
			feet, these bulbs being called <i>ampullae</i>. At the oral surface of the
			tube feet is a sucker, and when the ampullae contract, water is forced into the
			tube foot, expanding it and causing it to form a suction cup attaching to the
			substratum. Contraction of the muscles of the feet forces water back into the
			ampulla, shortening the feet, and the action of all feet working in unison
			pulls the animal forward slowly. These tube feet also can force open the
			bivalves of mollusks which are its food.

		</p>
		<p>
			The mouth leads to a two-part stomach with a cardiac and
			pyloric region. The cardiac region can actually evert from the body to
			surround the soft parts of bivalves. Even the bivalve shell is only opened
			partially, yet this is sufficient for the stomach to gain entry. In each arm
			are five pairs of <i>hepatic caeca</i> which release digestive enzymes.
			Partially digested material passes to the pyloric stomach and into the hepatic
			caeca where absorption occurs. A short intestine equipped with two <i>rectal</i>
			<i>caeca</i> then lead to the anus in the middle of the aboral surface.

		</p>
		<p>
			The blood vascular (<i>hemal system</i>) is very
			reduced in the animal. There is an oral hemal ring with a radial hemal sinus
			extending into each of the arms under the radial canal. An extensive coelomic
			cavity with ciliated epithelium provides circulatory function. Amoeboid cells
			are replete in the coelom, and these may gather wastes and move to the outside
			via the dermal branchiae having evaginations into the coelom. The dermal
			branchiae also serve a role in respiration.

		</p>
		<p>
			The nervous system is a nerve ring around the mouth, with
			five radial nerves into each arm. These nerves are in the ambulacral groove
			epidermis. A light-sensitive eyespot is at the end of each arm. Other nerve
			fibers are in the arms as well: a nerve pair below the oral epidermis and a
			single cord in the peritoneum on the aboral side.

		</p>
		<p>
			The sexes are separate, a pair of gonads at the base of each
			arm. Each gonad opens to the outside by a pore on the aboral surface of the
			central disc. Fertilization is extracorporeal. The details related to zygotic
			cleavage can be found in the chapter on development. Once the gastrula has
			formed, the body develops characteristic ciliated bands used in locomotion and
			feeding. The larva is bilaterally symmetrical and is considered to be the
			hypothetical <i>dipleurula</i> ancestor of echinoderms and hemichordates. On
			each side of the larva there develops three lobes, and now the larva is a <i>bipinnaria</i>
			<i>larva</i>. Additional lobes form, and all lobes start to elongated and
			become ciliated. The ~3 mm long larva is now a <i>brachiolara larva</i>.
			After several weeks, the free-swimming larva drops to the bottom and attaches
			on its anterior end by an attachment disc. The posterior enlarges, bends to
			the left, and the larval arms are resorbed. The posterior then rounds up, with
			five lobes forming on the right side (the future aboral surface). The left
			side becomes the oral surface. Internally the water vascular system is forming
			from the larval coelom.

		</p>
		<p>
			Starfish show amazing regenerative capacity: a single arm
			with part of the central disc can regenerate a whole organism. Before this was
			known, oyster fishermen would <q>kill</q> the starfish by breaking them into pieces,
			not knowing they were actually increasing its numbers.

		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Ophiuroidea</span>

		</p>
		<p>These are the brittle stars, also called serpent stars.
			They have a circular disc and five, very slender arms. They are called brittle
			stars since their arms are easily broken off, serpent stars because there is
			some flexibility. Calcareous vertebral ossicles are found in series in the
			arms, articulating with one another and provided with muscles that give the
			star its characteristic movement; the arms not hollow as in asteroids and
			there is no ambulacral groove either. A radial canal of the water vascular
			system is internal, leading to small tube feet and not having suckers or
			ampullae. These play a function in respiration and sensory perception and not
			in locomotion. The arms have a reduced extension of the coelom, a radial nerve,
			and a hemal sinus. Connecting all radial canals is a ring canal, which also
			connects to a stone canal connected to a madreporite on the oral surface. A
			saclike stomach comes after the mouth, filling up most of the disc cavity, with
			no intestine or anus. Undigested material leaves via the mouth. Food is small
			invertebrates and organic debris.

		</p>
		<p>Gonads are located in the central disc, opening into small
			sac-like <i>genital bursae</i> on the oral surface seen in five pairs.
			Each bursa opens to the outside by a narrow slit near the mouth. These bursae
			also have a respiratory function as well. Sexes are usually separate, though
			some species are hermaphroditic. Fertilization is in the sea in most cases,
			while in some fertilization and development can occur within the bursae. In
			cases where development is within bursae, there is no free-swimming larval
			stage. Development for other ophiuroids is similar to starfish: the larva
			becomes conical, flattens on its left side, outgrowths extend from the
			flattened left side (to become the oral surface), and the long arms will mark
			the appearance of the <i>pluteus larva</i>. Metamorphosis occurs within
			the larva, which may have as many as four pairs of larval arms with calcareous
			endoskeletal support; there is no attachment phase as in asteroids. The
			regenerative capacity is high, arms breaking off if the animal is handled
			roughly.

		</p>
		<p>The sea urchins and disc-like sand dollars. These still
			retain the echinoderm pattern. <i>Arabacia</i> is the common sea urchin and is
			representative. The animal is enclosed in a rigid shell (<i>test</i>), in
			which ten distinct rows of plates fuse to form the test. Five of them have
			homology to starfish arms, as they have rows of long, slender tube feet. The
			rows with tube feet alternate with five wider rows lacking them. The former
			are <i>ambulacral areas</i>, the latter <i>interambulacral areas</i>.
			Both types of plates have rounded tubercles from which the long spines (a
			defining character) emanate. Muscles at the base move the spines. Some spines
			have a toxic secretion which can cause pain in humans. The tube feet have
			suckers and the animal use these in locomotion as in the asteroidea.
			Pedicellaria are found on long stalks and serve to keep the body clean of
			debris, other organisms. Sphaeridia are modified spines on the oral surface,
			and they have a sensory function in maintaining equilibrium.

		</p>
		<p>
			The mouth has five large, pointed teeth with a complex
			internal structure, the whole assembly referred to as <i>Aristotle's lantern</i>.
			From the mouth the gut proceeds through a long coiled esophagus to a sac-like
			stomach which then connects to a coiled intestine. From there to a short
			rectum and to the anus at the aboral surface in the center. A <i>siphon</i> is
			tube following along the edge of the stomach, connecting the esophagus and
			intestine, lined with ciliated epithelium; it may serve to remove excess water
			from the food, bypassing the stomach. A madreporite on the aboral surface
			leads to the stone canal, which then descends to the ring canal lying above the
			lantern complex. Five radial canals pass under the ambulacral plates and
			connect to tube feet, each of which have a large ampulla.

		</p>
		<p>
			Both the nervous and hemal systems have a central ring
			branching into the five ambulacral regions. The echinoids are dioecious
			(normally), with five gonads located in the aboral region of the coelom. A
			small duct with aboral pore connect each to the outside. Gametes meet outside,
			develop into a pluteal larva similar to ophiuroids. Metamorphosis follows
			after several weeks. In other species, the developing zygotes are held by
			spines and pedicellariae on the animal, developing directly rather than as larvae.

		</p>
		<p>
			In other echinoids, e.g., sand dollars and the partially
			flattened heart urchins, the structural differences relate to Aristotle's
			lantern, which can be modified, reduced, or absent.

			The sea cucumbers have an elongated body in the oral-aboral
			axis. The calcareous endoskeleton and spines are absent in this class,
			appearing instead as <i>ossicles</i> in the leathery body wall. These animals
			lie on or burrow into a substratum with one side downward, making an upper
			<q>dorsal</q> and lower <q>ventral</q> side, and the oral end is anterior, the aboral
			posterior. Retractile and branching tentacles numbering 10-30 encircle the
			mouth; the tentacles are really modified tube feet. From the mouth to the
			anus are five rows of tube feet with well developed suckers (distribution of
			tube feet irregular in some species).

		</p>
		<p>
			Leathery body wall covered by thin cuticle, with thick
			dermal layer below. A layer of circular muscle is followed by five thick bands
			of longitudinal muscles. The body wall epithelium is ciliated. A large coelom
			has septa (but they are not formed completely and do not divide) and is filled
			with fluid containing amoebocytes, some having hemoglobin. Digestive tract is
			short esophagus with relatively small stomach. Long coiled intestine suspended
			by connections to the body wall via mesenteries. This leads to a cloaca at the
			posterior, the outside opening the anus. From the cloaca are two highly
			branched tubular structures called <i>respiratory trees</i>, which
			extend to the anterior into the coelom. Water is drawn in by muscles around
			the cloaca and forced into the respiratory trees. Respiratory and excretory
			exchanges occur between the trees and coelom, then the water is forced back out
			the anus as the cycle continues.

		</p>
		<p>In some species of sea cucumbers are tubules at the base of
			the respiratory trees called the <i>organs of Cuvier</i>. When adversely
			stimulated, the tubules evert from the anus and produce a sticky viscous mass
			which takes cares of the animal's enemies. Another more common occurrence is
			the passing out through the anus nearly all of the internal organs: cloaca,
			respiratory tree, intestines, gonads. These are later regenerated.

		</p>
		<p>
			The hemal system is most developed in this class of animals,
			with the same distribution pattern but use of larger vessels. Prominent
			vessels are the dorsal and ventral vessels associated with the intestine. The
			nervous system is a circumesophageal nerve ring and five radial nerves
			(typical).

		</p>
		<p>
			The single gonad of the dioecious animals is made of fine
			tubules attached to the mid-dorsal body wall. A single duct leads to a genital
			pore near the base of the tentacles. Fertilization is generally external and a
			larval form called an <i>auricularia</i> develops (similar to asteroid
			bipinnaria), next forming a barrel-shaped <i>doliolaria larva</i> with
			3-5 bands of cilia around the body, then metamorphosing to a young sea
			cucumber. In the few species that brood in special body wall pockets,
			development is direct.

			Class <span class="class-name">Crinoidea</span>

		</p>
		<p>The sea lilies and the stalked echinoderms were significant
			groups during the times of the Paleozoic. Only one of the six classes within
			the Pelmatozoa have survived beyond the Paleozoic. Forms today have a
			cup-shaped body (<i>calyx</i>) with five flexible arms which bifurcate several
			times. Very fine appendages (<i>pinnules</i>) fringe the branches. The
			sessile forms have a long, jointed stalk joining the substratum to the middle
			of the aboral surface. At the distal end of the stalk are <i>cirri</i>,
			root-like branches attaching the animal to mud or sand. Some crinoids (e.g.,
			feather stars of <i>Antedon</i>) have no stalks in adult phase; they might
			have a ring of jointed cirri on the aboral surface and use them to walk or
			attach to the substratum, or they might use their feathery arms in swimming.

		</p>
		<p>The oral surface is superior, and both mouth and anus are on
			this surface, the anus usually near the base of one of the arms on a
			cone-shaped protuberance. On the oral surface of each arm is an open
			ambulacral groove, its lining ciliated to create currents bringing food
			(microorganisms, detritus) to the mouth. Small tube feet are in the ambulacral
			groove; they have no suckers and are used for pushing food particles into the
			ambulacral groove and for respiratory exchange. With no madreporite in
			crinoids, water enters the water vascular system by canals connected to the
			coelom; the coelom takes in water by minute ciliated funnels open to the
			outside.

		</p>
		<p>
			Gametes develop in the pinnules of these dioecious animals,
			and pinnules rupture to release the gametes. Fertilization products can adhere
			to the pinnules, be released to the sea, or be brooded in special chambers
			depending upon species. A barrel-shaped doliolaria larva hatches from eggs
			after 5-6 d, swim freely for a brief time, settles to the substratum attaching
			by means of an adhesive pit on the anterior of the larva, and then becomes an
			adult in several stages.

			Phylum <span class="phylum-name">Chaetognatha</span>

		</p>
		<p>
			(1) Transparent, unsegmented planktonic marine organisms.
			(2) Head provided with groups of large sickle-shaped setae. (3) Cylindrical
			body divided into three regions: head, trunk, tail. (4) Trunk with one or two
			pairs lateral fins; tail with a fin around the tip; all fins in the
			horizontal plane. (5) Circulatory, respiratory, excretory systems absent. (6)
			Hermaphroditic with direct development.

		</p>
		<p>The torpedo-like arrow worms are very common among marine
			plankton. Transparent animals, they are range from 2-3 cm to as long as 10-12
			cm. The animals take their name from the sickle-shaped chitinous bristles on
			either side of their head. Besides the <i>head</i>, the body has <i>trunk</i>
			and a <i>tail</i>. The bristles have muscles which the animal uses as jaws to
			catch crustacea and planktonic forms upon which it feeds. There are also small
			chitinous teeth about the subterminal, ventral mouth for grasping prey. They
			are voracious feeders and can drastically alter the plankton population if
			present in significant numbers. The head has a pair of eyes on the dorsal
			surface. A <i>hood</i> at the base of the head apparently encloses it for the
			purpose of rapid swimming, providing a streamlining function to reduce
			friction. Horizontal fins on each side of the trunk come in one or two pairs;
			these fins have no muscles and may assist the animal only in flotation; they
			have ray-like internal supporting elements. There is also a midventral anus to
			mark the end of the trunk. Posterior to that is a tail which tapers to a point
			and has a horizontal caudal fin.

		</p>
		<p>During development, a coelom derived from the endodermal gut
			(enterocoelic) forms but in the adult, the body cavity is not lined with a
			peritoneum. The body cavity is divided into a head, trunk, and tail by
			transverse partitions, and the trunk and tail subdivided into lateral portions
			by median mesenteries.

		</p>
		<p>The body wall resembles what is found in aschelminthes. A
			thin cuticle is found with an epidermis often only one cell thick. A thin
			basement membrane separates the epidermis from underlying muscle, which are all
			longitudinal (as in nematodes) and are arranged in four thick bands, a pair on
			the dorsal and a pair on the ventral sides. The mechanism of body movement is
			difficult to analyze, probably done by alternating contractions of dorsal and
			ventral muscles; the animal moves rapidly. Other muscles are associated with
			the spines, teeth, and hood in the head.

		</p>
		<p>The digestive system is very simple, with muscular pharynx
			leading into long straight intestine. A pair of lateral diverticulae are at
			the trunk anterior end. The anus is at the midventral region. For a nervous
			system, there is a single cerebral ganglion in the dorsal region of the head;
			nerves connect to eyes and muscles in the head from this ganglion, a pair encircles
			the pharynx to meet on the ventral side, and connect with a large ganglion in
			the trunk anterior. From this ganglion are nerve connections to the rest of
			the body. Besides eyes, tactile receptors in the head and a U-shaped tract of
			cilia (<i>ciliary loop</i>) extend from the head to trunk anterior and
			function in chemoreception.

		</p>
		<p>These forms are hermaphroditic. Ovaries are elongated
			structures in the posterior trunk coelom; paired testes fill the tail coelom.
			Sperm cells are released immature into the coelom and mature there. They enter
			a ciliated funnel, pass into a duct and into one of the laterallly located
			seminal vesicles. Rupture of the seminal vesicle releases sperm joined in a
			spermatophore. Female gonopores are in the lateral region of the end of the
			trunk. The sperm enter here, swimming up the oviduct and fertilizing in the
			body. In some species self-fertilization occurs, in others it does not.
			Temporary ducts developing during reproduction convey eggs out, and these are
			cemented singly or in masses to seaweed or other objects, or to the body.
			Cleavage is radial and indeterminate, a hollow blastula invaginating during
			gastrulation as for echinoderms. The blastopore closes despite the anus
			developing in the same area. Enterocoelic pouches evaginate from the
			archenteron to produce the coelom and mesoderm. The coelom obliterates, but
			new body cavities appear in the adult. Young develop directly to adult without
			passing through larval stages.

		</p>
		<p>
			The placement of the chaetognaths as deuterostomes comes
			from the facts of early development. It is later in development that they take
			on the appearance of more primitive forms. It is likely they had a dipleurula
			ancestor soon after it evolved from the ancestral protostome.

		</p>
		<p>
			This phylum has no classes or orders as it is small in terms
			of species numbers (despite the infinite numbers in the population of each
			species). <i>Sagitta</i> is a representative genus.

		<p>
			The beard worms have been studied very much by one scientist, Ivanov,
			and it was he who was able to prove to the zoological community
			that they belonged to a separate phylum (very difficult to do in the
			mid-20th century). These are delicate worms ranging from 10-30 cm long,
			with a diameter of about &lt;1 mm. They live in secreted tubes of
			a cellulose-like polysaccharide similar to the tunic of urochordates;
			these tubes embed in mud or suitable substance. Most are deep sea dwellers,
			but some are in shallow waters. The body has a protosome, mesosome,
			and metasome from anterior to posterior in that series.
			Transverse internal septa mark these divisions, with the coelom
			appropriately divided: protocoel, mesocoel, metacoel. The
			protosome has one to many fringed tentacles. No digestive tract
			is found at any time in the life cycle. No feeding is observable
			in these multicellular animals; Ivanov says the tentacles form
			a food-catching web, in which digestive enzymes may be secreted
			by the tentacles, whose cells absorb the nutrients in the very vascular
			tentacles. The nervous system is a network of
			nerves in the epidermis, brain in the head at the base of the tentacles, and
			middorsal nerve cord. Closed circulatory system is evident, with middorsal and
			midventral vessels and muscular heart in ventral protosome. Ducts leading from
			the protocoel to exterior thought to have excretory function (they have no
			ciliated nephrostome).

		</p>
		<p>
			Sexes are separate, paired gonads in metacoel. Testes are
			elongated bodies in posterior half of trunk, sperm ducts open anteriorly near
			mesosome-metasome junction. Ovaries are in anterior trunk portion, opening to
			the outside near middle of trunk. The radial cleavage and development is
			typically deuterostomial. A solid blastula forms a gastrula by delamination,
			and gastrulation is not marked by a blastopore. The endoderm after
			gastrulation evaginates to form a mesoderm and eventual coelom. Elongation of
			the coelomic sacs is marked by constrictions which divide the coelom into the
			three parts specified. The remaining endoderm appears to be resorbed during
			development (no digestive tract).

		</p>
		<p>
			This phylum had once been a subphylum of Chordata, but while
			the animals have gill slits, the structure once thought to be a notochord or
			homologous notochord is not one at all.

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Enteropneusta</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			The acorn worms are the most familiar of hemichordates.
			They range in size from 10 to more than 40 cm, live in shallow waters in
			U-shaped burrows lined with mucus. Deep sea species are known. The body
			consists of three parts: cone-shaped <i>proboscis</i>, narrow <i>collar</i>,
			and long <i>trunk</i>. The proboscis is efficient in digging burrows and has
			tactile and chemoreceptors. The mouth is ventral on the anterior edge of the
			collar. The diet is small organisms, detritus, caught in the mucus and moved
			to the mouth by beating of cilia all over the animal's body. The mouth opens
			into a buccal cavity, then into a pharynx, along the sides of which are a
			series of U-shaped gill slits opening into the surrounding branchial chamber.
			The branchial chamber communicates with the outside by means of a series of
			gill pores.
		</p>
		<p>
			From the buccal cavity there is an anterior diverticulum
			extending anteriorly into the proboscis, at one time thought to be a notochord,
			now just considered an extension of the endodermal gut. It is because of the
			lack of a notochord that hemichordates are distinguished from chordates. A
			long straight intestine follows the pharynx leading to a terminal anus.
		</p>
		<p>
			The circulatory system is open: two main vessels, one in
			the middorsal line and one in the midventral line conduct blood anteriorly and
			posteriorly, resp. These two join in the anterior in a large central sinus
			sometimes referred to as a heart. A pericardial sac enclosing this sinus is
			contractile, and this serves to move the colorless blood through the
			noncontractile sinus. Branches of the vessels lead to all tissues, and
			capillary beds are particularly rich in the tissues around the gill slits.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <i>glomeruli</i> are a pair of structures located on
			either side of the central sinus, made of blind tubular evaginations of the
			coelom. Its internal cavities directly connect to the central sinus, and all
			blood appears to flow through these glomeruli. Wastes pass into the
			evaginations, and to the outside by openings in the coelom. The nervous system
			appears very primitive, with middorsal and midventral nerve cords leading to
			nerves in the epidermis, and nothing like a centralized brain present.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sexes are separate, gonads in the pharyngeal region lateral
			to the branchial chamber and with openings to the chamber. Fertilization
			occurs externally. Development is deuterostome-like, and direct to the adult
			form, although a ciliated larval form called a <i>tornaria</i> occurs in some
			species. This larva is similar to echinoderm larva, has a planktonic existence
			for some days; this closely links hemichordates to echinoderms.

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Ascidiacea</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			The sea squirts are vase-shaped animals attached by secretions of a cellulose
			<i>test</i> or <i>tunic</i> to the substratum connected by a flattened base or
			stalk. Below the tunic is a membranous <i>mantle</i> with an outer epidermis
			secreting the tunic. Beneath the mantle is vascularized connective tissue,
			circular and longitudinal muscle, and inner epithelial lining. An <i>incurrent
				siphon</i> brings water in by ciliary beating (cilia line the internal
			chambers). Water enters an enlarged pharynx equipped with gill slits in the
			walls, passing into an <i>atrium</i>, then out an <i>excurrent siphon</i>.
			Mucus lines the pharyngeal cavity and capture planktonic animals, its diet. The
			food is carried by ciliary beating into the esophagus, then into the stomach
			(digestion here). A narrow curved intestine leads to the anus at the bottom of
			the atrial chamber. Respiratory exchange occurs with water passing over the gill
			slits.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nitrogenous wastes are removed in tunicates by no special excretory system and
			it appears to be by simple diffusion. <i>Nephrocytes</i> are wandering cells
			which appear to deposit wastes in specialized areas where they accumulate. The
			circulatory system is open and poorly developed: a heart with blood vessels
			leads to main tissue regions and deposits blood there. A peculiar feature is
			that the heart appears to pump in both directions rather than through
			unidirectional circuit. Corpuscles in the blood have no pigment or either red,
			blue, and green pigment (in case of one species). A single ganglion in the
			mantle between the two siphons serves as a nervous system, which nerves to
			various tissues leading from here.

		</p>
		<p>
			Most tunicates are hermaphroditic: a single ovary and testis have ducts leading
			to the atrial chamber. Fertilization and development are outside the body.
			Cleavage is holoblastic, radial, and determinate (the latter not typical of
			deuterostomes). The hollow blastula has a gastrulation marked by invagination
			and epiboly. A tadpole-like larva forms which has a dorsal hollow nerve cord
			and notochord in tail. Segmentally arranged muscles occur in some pairs. This
			larva is free-swimming for only a few hours, then attaches to a substratum from
			secretions from the <i>adhesive papillae</i> at the anterior. Resorption of
			notochord, neural tube, and tail mark a metamorphosis. As development proceeds,
			the mouth becomes situated opposite the attachment site. Colonial tunicates
			appear to be able to reproduce by asexual budding as well.

		</p>
		<p>
			Most of the 1600 species in the subphylum are sessile ascidians. Some 100 spp.
			have adapted to the pelagic mode of life and represent the two classes below.
			<i>Molgula</i>.

		</p>
		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Larvaceae</span>

		</p>
		<p>
			The ascidians have a brief pelagic larval existence which is retained somewhat
			in this class, as the name implies. Adults are small and transparent, living in
			a secreted gelatinous housing. The digestive system show a mouth leading to an
			enlarged pharynx which has a single pouch leading to the body wall and
			functioning as a pair of <i>gill slits</i>. A short esophagus bends around to an
			enlarged stomach, then to a short intestine with the anus on the lateral wall of
			the oddly shaped representative of this class.

		</p>
		<p>
			The animal also has a very long tail which emerges from the lateral body wall,
			and this tail has a notochord present which remains in the adult. This tail is
			vital in the feeding of the animal, its movements drawing water into the
			housing, which has a filtration system for bring food organisms into the
			animal's body. This filtration system is quite distinctive in these animals.
		</p>
		<p>
			The animal has a circulatory system with heart near the intestinal region. A
			ganglion is next to the gut wall near the mouth opening and serves as a brain.
			It has a nerve cord coursing throughout the body and especially into the
			animal's long tail. A large part of the body is filled with a testis and ovary
			in these hermaphroditic animals, and ducts lead an opening in the body wall.

		<p>
			These forms are pelagic, existing solitarily or in colonies. The <i>salps</i>
			are important members of the planktonic community. Adults lose tail, notochord,

		<p>
			(1) Small, slender, laterally compressed, fish-like marine animals. (2) The
			segmented body lacks scales. (3) No head or brain is present. (4) Notochord
			and dorsal, hollow, nervous system present throughout life. (5) Pharyngeal gill
			slits present.

		</p>
		<p>
			Only ~20 spp. of marine animals in this subphylum, of which the lancelet
			Amphioxus is an example (<i>Branchiostoma</i>). This is a small fish-like
			chordate (~4-5 cm long) and has classic chordate characters: adults with
			notochord, neural tube, and pharyngeal gill slits. There is no head in its long
			slender body, which is laterally compressed and has a continuous dorsal fin
			expanding into a tail fin, this continuing ventrally to the <i>atriopore</i> as
			a ventral fin.
		</p>
		<p>
			The mouth forms from an opening in a thin membrane called the <i>velum</i>,
			located at the rear of a preoral chamber called the <i>vestibule</i>. Fleshy,
			finger-like <i>cirri</i> are ventrally located at the anterior. From the mouth
			is an enlarged pharynx with many gill slits on each side. A straight, narrow
			intestine follows to a subterminal anus, and the intestine is connected to a
			small diverticulum (<i>liver</i>) believed to secrete digestive enzymes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Between the pharyngeal wall and ventral body wall is a space called an atrium,
			and it has an opening to the outside called the <i>atriopore</i> and the
			midventrum anterior to the anus. Ciliary action in the mouth and pharynx bring
			water through them and past the gill slits into the atria, and out the
			atriopore. Respiratory exchange occurs and food is trapped by mucus secreted
			within a groove of this gut region called the <i>endostyle</i>. Ciliary action
			carries the food back to the intestine. The circulatory system is open and
			heartless. Numerous vessels with contractile properties are arranged as for
			primitive vertebrates, forcing blood anteriorly in a series of ventral veins and
			posteriorly through a dorsal aorta. Capillaries are absent; the blood is fluid
			only.

		</p>
		<p>Support for the body is primarily from the notochord lying
			above the dorsal nerve cord, which is hollow with a central canal. At the
			anterior is an enlargement (cerebral vesicles). Myomeres along the sides have
			a pair of nerve extending from the cord. There is a dorsal nerve cord which is
			sensory, a ventral cord which is motor, a situation identical with the spinal
			nerves of vertebrates. Ciliated protonephridia connect the coelom with the
			atrium; the existence of protonephridia in a group high on the phylogenetic scale
			is hard to explain.

		</p>
		<p>These species are dioecious, paired ovaries or testes in the
			lower portion of muscle segments bulging into the atrium. Mature gametes
			rupture from the gonads and pass out the atriopore. Fertilization is
			external. Cleavage is radial and indeterminate. A hollow blastula invaginates
			during gastrulation much like in echinoderms. Continued organogenesis is as in
			the echinoderms. An asymmetrical larva, with a left-side mouth and right-side
			gill slits obtains, but the asymmetry is lost later.

		</p>
		<p>
			Mostly unicellular forms, free-living or forming colonies.
			No organized tissues or organs. (&gt;30,000 spp.) Two subphyla and four
			classes. Habitat moist or aquatic, freshwater and marine. Both sexual and
			asexual reproduction. Protozoa (‘first animals') first detected by
			Leeuwenhoek, who likely found both bacteria and protozoa. Most protozoa feed
			on bacteria, primitive unicellular plants, and other protozoa.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of the subgroups, the Mastigophora are probably the most primitive,
			the Ciliata the more specialized, and the Sporozoa simplified as a
			result of the totally parasitic existence.
		</p>
		<p>
			Size is between 3 to 16,000 µm, the avg. being less than 100
			µm. Among the giants are the ciliate <i>Spirostomum</i> (3 mm) and the
			sporozoan <i>Porospora gigantea</i> (16 mm). Protozoal species have a
			wide habitat range, being found on every continent. Fresh water, marine,
			soil-living, hot springs, mountain snow, and as parasites in the bodies of
			animals is the range of habitats. Under favorable growth conditions (moisture
			a must), the animals show life cycle stage which is very metabolically active.
			Under adverse conditions, the organism encloses itself in a protective membrane
			and forms <i>cyst</i>, which opens under favorable conditions.

		</p>
		<p>
			While a multicellular organism assigns functions to large
			cell masses which participate in the body function, a single cell must arrange
			itself for all of those things. With <i>Amoeba</i>, there appears to be few
			cellular structures to give the organism a competitive advantage, whereas with <i>Paramecium</i>,
			there are many such structures. Many refer to Protozoa as noncellular or
			acellular, preferring to refer to the individual units of multicellular
			organisms as cells.

		</p>
		<p>
			Protozoans which generally consume other organisms have a
			nutritional requirement termed <i>holozoic</i>. Others consume organic matter
			from decaying organisms, and are called <i>saprozoic</i>. Some contain
			chlorophyll and are photosynthetic: <i>holophytic</i>.

		</p>
		<p>
			Membranous intracellular inclusions are as in any animal or
			plant cell. Mitochondria are double membraned, with the inner membrane forming
			lamellar, tubular, or even vesicular cristae. Protozoans living in
			environments of low oxygen tension will have mitochondria as simple sacs
			lacking cristae. Golgi bodies (dictyosomes) with the cisternal arrangements
			typical of cells. Single-membrane peroxisomes and their variations as
			glyoxysomes are present.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Contractile vacuoles (c.v.)</b>. Function is to
			assist in maintenance of cellular osmolarity. Does this by filling with water
			(<i>diastole</i>) and then usually contracting fluid to extracellular space
			(<i>systole</i>). Structural and functional arrangements vary with
			organism.

		</p>
		<p>
			EM pictures of <i>Amoeba</i> show unit membrane-bound
			vacuole is surrounded by mitochondria and numerous small vesicles. Vesicles
			form in cytoplasm and fuse with larger vacuole during diastole. Vacuole feebly
			expels fluid at systole, but there is no evidence of fibrous network which acts
			as a contractile apparatus.

		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Paramecium</i> shows more complex c.v., which the main
			vacuole fed by six radiating canals. Systole in the canals contributes to
			diastole in the c.v.; it is at this time when the ampullae of canals (at
			proximal end to c.v.) is open to the c.v. A closing between canals and c.v.
			apparently occurs during c.v. systole. Smaller tubules (20 nm dia.) form a
			thick layer around the canals, with one end connected to the ER and the other
			end to the canals, open during diastole of the canal. Fibers surrounding the
			ampullae of the canals and the main vacuole probably are part of the necessary
			apparatus involved in systolic contractions of canals and c.v., and their
			action correlates perhaps with a certain degree of distention of the canals and
			c.v.
		</p>
		<p>
			It has been shown that rates of c.v. systole (pulsations)
			vary between species, with the volume output per unit time being
			as little as 2 and as much as 200 µm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>.
			Systolic rate is function of both environmental temperature and osmolarity.
			In one suctorian (Discophrya) a direct linear relationship was shown
			in which <i>output rate</i> = 0.1467 × [<i>sucrose</i>] + 8.5,
			in which the sucrose concentration is given in millimolar and
			the output rate is expressed in µm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The molecular physiology of c.v. function has not been fully
			defined, although an active transport mechanism of ions is thought to be
			involved. The c.v. contents in <i>Amoeba</i> are one-third the osmolarity
			of cytoplasm, hypertonic with the outside medium by 4 times.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Food vacuoles (f.v.).</b> In protozoans with a
			complex and organized cell structure including a cytostome, phago- or
			pinocytosis is through this structure. In amoeba-like cells, phagocytic
			vesicles arise from any surface it appears. What stimulates formation of
			pinocytic vesicles in amoebae also depends upon the chemical: numerous
			vesicles will form if the substance is protein but not carbohydrate.
			Food cup formation in amoeba leading to phagocytic vacuole is similar
			also to phagocytic vacuole formation in cytostomal-bearing protozoa.
			Phagocytic vacuoles may also be found around cell organelles,
			this autodigestion being a manifestation of
			the morphogenetic re-organization of the organism's structure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Digestion of the solid contents in f.v. has been clearly shown to involve fusion
			of tiny vesicles (lysosomes) which come from the Golgi body and fuse with the
			f.v. membrane. These have been shown to contain hydrolases and proteins capable
			of producing an acid pH within the f.v. Ingested algae or protozoans seen to be
			moving within the f.v. soon cease movements shortly after f.v. formation,
			indicating rapid lysosomal fusion. After a time, the vacuolar contents assume
			an alkaline pH as the f.v. swells. Absorption of simple molecules in the f.v. is
			accompanied by formation of micropinocytic vesicles seen to elaborate from the
			f.v. The f.v. shrinks to surround the undigested residue, which is removed at
			an arbitrary location by fusion with plasmalemma or at an anal pore in animals
			with specialized pellicles.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Cilia and Flagella</b>. There are minor structural differences
			between cilia and flagella, but both use the same 9+2 arrangement
			of microtubules which is a feature of these organelles. The longitudinal
			bundle of microtubules is called the <b><i>axoneme</i></b>, and this is
			surrounded by an extension of the plasmalemma. The basal body giving
			rise to the axoneme is sometimes called a <i>blepharoplast</i> when
			it gives rise to flagella, a <i>kinetosome</i> when it gives rise to cilia.
		</p>
		<p>
			The arrangement of microtubules in the axoneme at different points along the
			length of the flagellum are shown in the figure, along with some of the
			dimensions of the flagellum. Note that in the peripheral doublet of
			microtubules that they share a common wall, i.e., the tubules mesh with each
			other. The microtubules run the length of the flagellum straight: there is no
			twisting or spiraling.

		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="imagesZoologyHTML/flagellum.gif" alt="flagellum">

		</p>
		<p>
			In each doublet, there are two rows of lateral projections (arms)
			which are 8 nm wide and 14 nm or more long extend from one
			of the tubules (sub fibril A), being directed toward the
			adjacent doublet on its sub fibril B tubule. Each set of
			arms occurs at 17 nm intervals along the length of doublet fibril.
		</p>
		<p>
			The central microtubules are made from 13 rows of molecular
			subunits, while 23 rows compose the doublet fibrils. Protein subunits of two
			types compose the tubules (ea. MW ~55,000). There are differences in the
			solubility of the central tubules and the peripheral doublet tubules. Genetic
			studies show that nonmotile flagellar mutants have no central tubules, although
			they have peripheral tubules. The arms of the peripheral doublets are composed
			of a protein <i>dynein</i> (MW ~500,000), and similar in size to myosin, but is
			different in shape and is a Mg- and Ca-dependent ATPase. Another lateral
			projection from the tubule in the peripheral doublet holding the dynein arms
			extends radially toward the center of the flagellum, appearing to have a knob
			at its end. Certain thread-like strands also weave around the center fibrils,
			connecting with radial threads at certain points along the axoneme. In the
			peripheral doublet near the tip, one of the tubules (subfibril B) terminates
			prior to the other tubule.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the root of the cilium/flagellum, the basal body shows
			fibrous connective network with adjacent basal bodies. At the point where the
			flagellum emerges and the basal body begins, the arms and radial projections
			disappear, with links appearing between the doublets themselves and with the
			plasma membrane. The central tubules end at the level of the cell surface,
			possibly embedded in a granule or transverse plate. Within the basal body, a
			third tubule (subfibril C) forms along the peripheral doublets, and the
			peripheral triplets are twisted so that tubule A is more centrally located and
			tubule C more peripherally. Connecting strands make contact on fibril C on one
			set with fibril A on the adjacent (as shown). At another point a strand from
			fibril A connects to a ring-like central granule within the basal body.
		</p>
		<p>
			Studies of ciliary and flagellar movement are facilitated by
			use of a stroboscope in which the flash interval is synchronous with the
			beating movements, or slightly longer in time than the beating to observe the
			form of the beat. Beating frequencies can be slowed (if helpful) by altering
			the viscosity of the medium (methyl cellulose addition), but interpretation
			should be done with caution.

		</p>
		<p>Flagella move in an undulating manner. In some cases, the
			flagellar twisting movement is nearly in a single plane. In the rest, the
			flagellar twisting motion is perfectly helical (corkscrew-like) and the
			flagella twist appears cylindrical when viewed end-on. Given a smooth
			flagellar surface, the force on the water is along the long axis of the
			flagellum in the direction of the flagellar waves. The forces involved in
			resistance from a viscous medium (like water) and the internal elastic
			resistance in changing flagellar shape become significant at the slightly
			supramolecular level. The energy expended by a flagellum 40 µm long with a
			beat frequency of 30 s<sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt">-1</span></sup> and a
			beat wavelength of 30 µm is ~3 10<sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt">-7</span></sup>
			erg s<sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt">-1</span></sup> at 16°. The locomotive
			force is a function of both flagellar amplitude, wavelength, and beat
			frequency, while structural dimensions are less significant. Medium viscosity
			is only important in that it influences wave shape and frequency.

		</p>
		<p>EM photographs have also shown that <i>lateral hairs</i>
			project from the plasma membrane surface of the flagellum. There are two types
			of hairs: one is a thinner (5 nm thick) and long hair called a <i>flimmer filament</i>;
			the other is a thicker (20 nm) hair about 1 µm long and is given the name <i>mastigoneme</i>.
			The thicker mastigonemes are thought to project rigidly from the flagellum in
			two rows arranged in the plane of flagellar undulation: they apparently cause
			a reversal in water flow during flagellar undulation as the wave propagates
			from base to tip, forcing water back to the base.

		</p>
		<p>Ciliary beating has been shown to have two types of
			strokes: the <i>effective</i> or <i>power stroke</i>, where the cilium
			stiffens in the stroke movement, and the <i>recovery stroke</i>, where it bends
			more easily while returning to its position. The effective stroke forces the
			movement of more water, which is why it is the effective stroke. In the
			typical cycle, the recovery stroke take up more than half the cycle time.
			There are some cases where the effective stroke takes up more than half the
			cycle time and moves less water, in which case, ciliary beating is probably for
			some purpose other than propulsion through water. Typically, the effective
			stroke moves in a single plane, while the recovery stroke is accompanied by a
			bending of the cilia and a rolling to one side (when viewed end-on); in
			protozoans this rolling is to the left of the direction of the effective
			stroke, so that the cilium appears to move in a counterclockwise from the
			end-on view (in some metazoan ciliary movements, the movement is clockwise).
			Physical calculations indicate that the viscous work done during the effective
			stroke with the propulsive effect on the water varies with the cube of cilium
			length and square of angular velocity of the beat.

		</p>
		<p>The most effective propulsive effect of an undulating
			extension like a cilium or flagellum is when these organelles are placed in
			rows next to each other. Coordinated movement of closely spaced cilia or
			flagella enhance propulsion since the velocity of water is sustained in a
			laminar flow without the individual cilia having to overcome viscous resistance
			involved inertial changes in the fluid medium. These coordinated movements of
			the cilia or flagella make them ‘hydrodynamically linked.' Spermatozoa often
			hydrodynamically link by synchronous flagella movements between cells, the
			combined effort creating great flow for the community than would take place for
			an individual member. Cilia aligned in rows are typically linked by a fibrous
			network between basal bodies, a network which presumably coordinates the <i>metachronal</i>
			beating patterns observed. However, it has also been show that widely spaced
			cilia with no basal connections show metachronal beating, presumably because
			the beating in one member creates a hydrodynamic linkage with the nearby
			cilium.

		</p>
		<p>There are many forms of coordinated ciliary beating. One is
			<i>symplectic</i>, in which the effective stroke and the metachronal wave
			pattern move in the same direction in the same plane, and the cilia in a row
			move as one undulating set. In <i>antiplectic</i> beating, the effective
			stroke is opposite in direction to the metachronal wave, and this has single
			cilium at wide intervals involved in the same phases of the two-stroke cycle,
			with the cilia in between at various phases. In <i>laeoplectic</i> and <i>dexioplectic</i>
			beating, the effective stroke is at right angles to the observed metachronal
			wave, with this beating type seen as the effective stroke coming toward the
			viewer while the wave propagates to the left or to the right, resp. Beating in
			<i>Paramecium</i> is approximately dexioplectic under normal conditions (these
			can be altered by abnormal changes in medium viscosity).

		</p>
		<p>It is known that ciliary beating and animal direction can be
			influenced by physical stimuli. Beat direction appears to be influenced by
			changes in calcium ion distribution in the cytoplasm. Simultaneous change in
			beating over the entire body suggests an electrical potential change across the
			membrane, since only changes in electrical polarizations could be that fast to
			alter such beats; indeed evidence has been shown that membrane depolarization
			results in reversed beating while hyperpolarization causes forward beating.
			Galvanotaxic movements in protozoa have been observed in which cilia on the
			cathodal side of an electric field reverse their direction; this has been
			explained as a reduction in the concentration of divalent calcium ions relative
			to monovalent cations at the cathodal side of the organism. Phototaxis in some
			flagellates is seen where a swelling is at the base of the flagellum (a
			light-sensitive eyespot): continuous illumination cause photonegative behavior
			while mildly shaded regions show photopositivity.

			Protozoa with one or more flagella (used in locomotion) at

		</p>
		<p>
			This group has presented some difficulty since it includes
			organisms with chlorophyll which are plant-like, and others are colorless and
			animal-like. That there are forms which combine plant and animal
			characteristics is not surprising if one believes in the evolutionary
			progression to more complex forms.

		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Euglena</i> is the archetypal model in this class. It
			has chloroplasts, namely chlorophyll (like algae and higher plants), but no
			cellulose-containing cell wall (unlike those groups). The <i>astaxanthin</i>
			in its eye spot is a carotenoid found only in animals. Most experts maintain
			that the first organism was a ‘green flagellate,' evolving divergently into a
			alga which later gave rise to the multicellular plant life, and also into an
			animal flagellate (a protozoa) which later gave rise to multicellular animal
			life and more complex unicellular animals. This class is considered to contain
			the most primitive organisms (the first organisms).

		</p>
		<p>
			It is maintained that the plant-like organisms arose before
			the animal forms. The Sarcodina probably derive from flagellated protozoa
			based on the number of species having flagella in their life cycle. Some
			members of Sporozoa show flagellated microgametes. As for the ciliates, their
			cilia have the same microtubular arrangement (‘9+2') as flagella, so it is
			likely these organisms also derive from the primitive flagellates.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Euglena

		</p>
		<p>
			This group commands special consideration. A freshwater green flagellate
			very small in size (35-60 µm), with colonial populations so high
			they form a green scum on the water surface. Organism is spindle-shaped,
			its shape maintained by a proteinaceous <i>pellicle</i> (not mainly
			polysaccharide as cellulose). Parallel thickening in the pellicle twist
			helically around the body. At one pole (anterior pole) is a cavity
			(<i>reservoir</i>) from which emerges a single long flagellum.
			At the bottom of the reservoir the flagellum emerges from the
			cytoplasm from two <i>blepharoplasts</i>. An <i>eyespot</i>
			or <i>stigma</i> contains a light-sensitive red pigment and is near
			to the reservoir. A single <i>contractile vacuole</i> is near to
			and empties into the reservoir. A large <i>nucleus</i> is organized
			posterior to the center of the cell. A number of <i>chloroplasts</i>
			are evident in the cell interior, and a single <i>pyrenoid</i>
			(starch-forming center) is generally associated with each chloroplast.
			<i>Paramylum bodies</i> are nonmembranous inclusions of stored carbohydrate.

		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Euglena</i> are circumspectively phototactic, i.e., they
			swim toward daylight but avoid direct sunlight. The red eyespot has been shown
			to be necessary for these phototactic responses. The flagellum is used for
			locomotion for this purpose; the manner in which it works causes Euglena to
			move in a spiral path. Under the light microscope, the flagellum is difficult
			to see unless a drop of iodine is added to the specimen. <i>Euglena</i> also
			demonstrate worm-like (euglenoid) movements when trapped, which are wormlike
			contractions and expansions; the pellicle elasticity permits or makes this
			movement possible.

		</p>
		<p>
			Normally <i>Euglena</i> is photosynthetic (holophytic).
			Experiments of culturing <i>Euglena</i> in total darkness but supplemented with
			growth materials shows that the group can be chemoheterotrophic too. The
			chloroplasts and pyrenoids disappear or are reduced in size, but reappear when
			Euglena is once again exposed to light. Older studies indicate Euglena ingests
			solid food which have not been confirmed in recent studies; another closely
			related colorless flagellate, <i>Peranema</i>, do ingest bacteria, yeast and
			small protozoa (being holozoic). As some <i>Euglena</i> seem to have an
			external requirement for vitamin B<sub><span style="font-size:8.0pt">12</span></sub>,
			these are used in bioassays to determine presence of this vitamin. The
			contractile vacuole is a feature to maintain osmotic balance as in other
			protozoa.

		</p>
		<p>The <i>Euglena</i> life cycle has an <i>active</i> (<i>trophic</i>)
			phase and an <i>encysted</i> phase. In the encysted phase a special external
			membrane surrounds the organism, which rounds up. Asexual reproduction is
			found in both phases of the life cycle, in which cell division can be observed
			in the active stage as a longitudinal binary fission (lengthwise cell division
			after mitosis). No forms of sexual reproduction are known in Euglena.
			Encystment is thought to result from unfavorable living or growth conditions.

		</p>
		<p>
			Treatment of Euglena with streptomycin and selected other
			antibiotics causes a degeneration of the chloroplasts.

			Other Mastigophora

		</p>
		<p>
			As there are many species in this class, two subclasses have
			been created to group them better. The Phytomastigina include the
			chlorophyll-containing organisms (Euglena) which the other, Zoomastigina,
			are colorless and animal-like in their nutritive behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dinoflagellates are members of Phytomastigina. This
			order has two flagella, one a <i>longitudinal flagellum</i>
			originating in the center of the cell and extending posteriorly
			through a groove (<i>sulcus</i>), the other a <i>transverse
				flagellum</i> lying in a groove (<i>annulus</i>)
			which encircles the midregion of the cell. The freshwater and marine
			dinoflagellate <i>Ceratium</i> is a model of this description.
		</p>
		<p>
			Certain dinoflagellates, e.g., <i>Gymnodinium</i> and <i>Gonyaulax</i>,
			produce a red pigment as well as a toxic metabolite. Their growth
			in water can attain numbers which makes the water appear red
			(‘red tide'). The toxic substance in them kill
			millions of fish and other marine animals, and the poison can
			kill human that eat fish or shellfish which have ingested these organisms.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Volvox</i> is a plant-like flagellate which assumes a
			colonial form. The colony is an aggregate of minute cells (4-8 µm)
			forming a hollow sphere (of ~0.5 mm dia.) with thousands (8000-17,000)
			of cells, each connected by protoplasmic bridges in a gelatinous matrix.
			The colony shows a polarity or radial symmetry: experiments show that
			certain cells in the mass are always leading the path in locomotion.
			Asexual reproduction can occur when small colonies move to the interior,
			forming a daughter colony, which is
			released from the interior when the parent colony bursts to release the new
			colony. Sexual reproduction also occurs when certain cells bud into the
			interior and differentiate into sperm (<i>microgamete</i>) or enlarged eggs
			(<i>macrogamete</i>). Zygotes encyst and wait as in asexual reproduction for the parent colony to
			burst. Volvox shows clear signs of division of labor among an aggregate
			cell mass: some cells in the colony serve a reproductive function,
			others are seemingly involved in leading locomotion.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hypothesis that <i>Volvox</i> represents a transitional
			stage between protozoa and metazoa is compelling. The hollow sphere colony
			resembles a metazoal blastula. Haeckel considered that such stages of an
			organism are <i>blastaea</i>, which later invaginated to produce a two-layered
			organism or <i>gastraea</i>. Certain simple metazoans (coelenterates) show
			such invaginations. Once criticism of this hypothesis comes from Metschnikoff,
			who maintained that gastrulation is not a simple invagination, but a movement
			toward the interior by cell proliferation, and hence gastraea were solid and not
			hollow. Some other difficulties of assuming <i>Volvox</i> is a progenitor is
			that it contains chloroplasts and has a cellulose-containing membrane
			surrounding it.

		</p>
		<p>The Zoomastigophora are a group of colonial flagellates with
			thin, transparent, funnel-shaped collars extending from the surface of the cell
			and surrounding the flagellum. A good representative is <i>Proterospongia</i>,
			so named because it may have been the progenitor to the sponges. The reason is
			that it is found to have <i>collar cells</i>, or <b><i>choanocytes</i></b>,
			present only in this group and in the poriferans. It is now believed that
			present-day sponges and these protozoa had a common ancestor. It is considered
			that sponges represent an evolutionary ‘dead-end,' and that the higher animals
			evolved from a different ancestor.

		</p>
		<p>The zoomastiginians are typically parasites, with the best
			known being trypanosomes (<i>Trypanosoma gambiense</i> causes African
			sleeping sickness). The flagellum is attached by a thin membrane which emerges
			from the edge of the cell, becoming free at the pole of the animal. This
			membrane-flagellum combination is called an <i>undulating membrane</i>;
			its function is in locomotion. The tsetse fly is the vector for <i>T.
				gambiense</i> and some related spp.: the blood obtained by the fly (from human
			or animal) is mixed into the fly's intestine where the parasite is, causing
			changes in which it invades the fly's salivary glands, where it proliferates
			and further changes. From there it can go into a vertebrate host, where it
			proliferates and produces toxic substances; it can later invade the
			cerebrospinal fluid and cause death unless treated.

		</p>
		<p>The Hypermastigophora are the most complex flagellates,
			having many of varying lengths. They are parasitic in the gut of termites and
			cockroaches. The <i>Trichonympha</i> is found in termite intestines is
			necessary for termite survival: in eating wood, the termite depends upon the
			protozoa to produce enzymes which degrade the wood so it can be used. These
			protozoans are sensitive to temperature and oxygen tension and can be killed
			without killing the termite. When the protozoans are killed, the termite soon
			dies of starvation since the wood it consumes goes undigested. Such an
			arrangement between the termite and protozoan is called <b><i>mutualism</i></b>.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Amoeba
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Amoeba proteus</i> is the common freshwater pond
			and stream dweller, about 250 µm in diameter (reaching a length of 1 mm during
			locomotion). It moves very sluggishly, about 2-3 µm per second. It feeds on
			small algae, bacteria, and other protozoans. No definite shape, and the
			organelles inside it are few. The nucleus is a biconcave disk with no fixed
			position in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm has a clear distinction: a
			translucent, thin, outer agranular <i>ectoplasm</i> and a inner granular <i>endoplasm</i>.
			Within the endoplasm is an outer viscous region called the <b><i>plasmagel</i></b>,
			the inner region is a more fluid <b><i>plasmasol</i></b>. The endoplasm also
			contains a contractile vacuole, food vacuoles, numerous granules and crystals.
			Numerous pseudopodia extend from the plasma membrane surface.

		</p>
		<p>Locomotion in the amoeba is called ‘amoeboid movement.' The
			pseudopodia are extended in the direction of movement, and endoplasm is
			observed to flow toward that direction. While several pseudopodia may actually
			extend, all but one will likely withdraw into the body as a single direction is
			pursued. Currently there are no explanations as to the physical and chemical
			changes involved in amoeboid movement. One hypothesis is that the outer region
			where pseudopodia form is liquefied, with the plasmasol entering into the
			weakened area. As the plasmasol flows into the pseudopodia, it supposedly
			becomes more viscous (part of the plasmagel), and plasmasol continues flowing
			into advancing tip. In the retreating side, the plasmagel also turns into
			plasmasol. Advancement of the plasmasol may occur as a result of contraction in
			the plasmagel, forcing plasmasol forward. If the membrane is touched, the
			plasmasol in that area may gel, and the direction of movement is changed.
			Amoeba stimulated all over round up into a sphere and remain motionless; it
			apparently forms a heavy layer of plasmagel on all sides.

		</p>
		<p>Pseudopodia are also used in capturing food. They extend on
			all sides of the food object, forming a food cup. The membranes eventually
			envelope the object, trapping it in a <i>food vacuole</i> within the
			body of the cell. With algal cells, the food vacuole does not change its
			size; with the capture of fast-moving protozoa, a larger food cup forms to
			take in more water when forming the food vacuole. All digestion takes place in
			the vacuole. Fast-moving protozoa are observed to move for a short period of
			time within the food vacuole; eventually they stop movement as the amoeba
			secretes acid into the vacuole in the initial phase of digestion; in the latter
			phase, it becomes alkaline. Digestive enzymes are delivered to the food
			vacuole by fusion of lysosomes with the vacuole. The simple molecules in the
			vacuole are absorbed into the cytoplasm later. Certain contents in the vacuole
			may remain undigested; the vacuole then moves to an arbitrary site and <i>egests</i>
			the material.

		</p>
		<p>Gases in respiration move about simply by diffusion.
			Nitrogen wastes are eliminated by diffusion as well. Reproduction in <i>Amoeba</i>
			is asexual and done by binary fission. Amoeba round up, undergo mitosis in
			which the spindle forms within a nuclear membrane (unlike in metazoans).
			Amoeba do have some special senses which allow them to distinguish what is food
			and what is not; to avoid strong chemicals and light, and to move from
			mechanical prodding. Some species form protective cysts, reducing their
			metabolism to a low level in the encysted state.

		<p class="genus">
			Other Sarcodina
		</p>
		<p>
			Five other orders very different from <i>Amoeba</i>. These
			include other kinds of pseudopodia. <i>Amoeba</i> uses what are called <i>lobopodium</i>.
			A more complex type is the <i>axopodium</i> in Heliozoa and Radiolara, a
			permanent structure (more or less) with a central axial filament and sometimes
			a basal granule. A <i>filopodium</i> is a pseudopod with a filamentous shape
			but no axial filament; it may branch without anastomosing with other branches.
			The filopodium in which its branches do anastomose with other such branches is
			a <i>reticulopodium</i>. Some sarcodinans form a shell-like enclosure (test).
			For example, <i>Arcella</i> is a freshwater dweller which secretes a
			chitin-like test composed of <i>tectin</i>. <i>Difflugia</i> secretes a
			similar test, but before hardening, it becomes embedded with sand grains and is
			a <i>arenaceous</i> test. The foraminifera secrete a shell of
			CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and the Radiolara have an outer shell of SiO<sub>2</sub>,
			or in some cases, SrSO<sub>4</sub>, with an inner perforated <i>central
				capsule</i> made of tectin.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are parasitic spp. of amoeba, one causing amoebic
			dysentery in humans, <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>. It can cause
			formation of abscesses and bleeding ulcers. It is common in
			areas where water sanitation is poor, since it is transmitted
			in food and drink contaminated by excreta of infected persons.
			It forms cysts in a stage of its life cycle where
			it will be out of the body in order to infect another body.

		<p>
			Vector is female <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito. Infection occurs
			when organism is in the spindle-shaped <i>sporozoite</i> stage of life
			cycle. From the blood, sporozoite associates itself with tissues
			important in circulatory system, the liver being an important site.
			From inside a hepatocyte, the sporozoite feeds, becomes enlarged,
			then undergoes <b><i>schizogony</i></b>, wherein the nucleus
			undergoes many divisions, eventually the cytoplasm dividing.
			The product cells (<i>merozoites</i>) are quite small, and
			they spread to other hepatocytes and continue schizogony.
			Since it occurs outside erythrocytes, this stage is called
			the <b><i>exoerythrocytic</i></b> phase of the life cycle.
			10 to 18 days after the time of infection, merozoites appear in the
			blood and infect the red blood cells. Here they increase in size,
			becoming <i>trophozoites</i>, and under schizogony to produce
			more merozoites, infecting more RBCs, until billions of cells
			are infected. It takes 48 h for <i>P. vivax</i> merozoites
			to undergo schizogony after entering an erythrocyte.
			Merozoites are released by lysis of the RBC, releasing
			also certain toxic metabolites. This release of toxic metabolites
			is what causes the chills and fever every 48 h.
			(For <i>P. falciparum </i>and <i>P. ovale</i>,
			the cycle is also 48 h; for<i> P. malariae</i>, it is 72 hours.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Schizogony is an asexual process. After a time, some trophozoites
			differentiate in to sexual forms incapable of further division.
			Some become female gametocytes, others male gametocytes
			(in later texts, these are called <i>microgametes</i> and
			<i>macrogametes</i>). These cells should be taken into the blood meal
			of a mosquito for them to develop further. When taken into the mosquito,
			the female gametocyte will enlarge to form an egg or female gamete.
			The male gametocyte will divide to produce 4-8 slender flagellated
			sperm. With fertilization accomplished in the stomach of the female mosquito,
			the <b><i>zygote</i></b> becomes an elongate, wormlike
			<i>ookinete</i> which moves through the stomach wall and
			then forms an <i>oocyst</i> on the outer side of the stomach wall.
			The oocyst shows a second type of multiple division
			to produce large numbers of sporozoites in a process called <i>sporogony</i>.
			Bursting from the oocyst, the sporozoites move through the mosquito hemolymph
			to the salivary glands. This developmental period in the mosquito both varies
			with the species of Plasmodium and the temperature. The alternation between
			generations of a sexual stage and asexual stage is called <i>metagenesis</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is noted that more than one host is necessary to complete
			the <i>Plasmodium</i> life cycle. Control of the disease comes from both
			vector control and from pharmaceuticals (quinine, atabrine, and chloroquine).

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Other Sporozoa
		</p>
		<p>
			All sporozoans are parasites as is <i>Plasmodium</i>.
			Except in the stage where male gametes form, there are no organelles designed
			for locomotion. The common feature is the formation of a spore which is
			generally infective. Hosts become infected generally by ingesting the organism
			or through an intermediate host (vector).
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Monocystis lumbrici</i> is a parasite in
			earthworms, entering as a sporozoite via its seminal vesicles, and growing at
			the expense of its sperm cells by infecting sperm balls. They become
			trophozoites, which then mature further to become <i>sporonts</i>, and two of
			these unite but do not fuse or otherwise lose identity: this process is called
			<b><i>szygy</i></b>. In this process the secrete substances which let them
			form a cyst wall (they are gametocytes inside a <i>gametocyst</i>). Each cell
			undergoes multiple fission which forms gametes (both micro- and macrogametes).
			Gametes pair and fuse to form a <i>sporoblast</i> (in one text, the zygote is
			said to encase in a hard shell called the <i>oocyst</i>), and from one
			sporoblast 8 sporozoites will form within the sporoblast. It can pass from the
			worm's sperm duct to infect another worm; the infected worm may be eaten by a
			bird, and it will pass through the bird's digestive tract. In any case, infection
			in a worm will digest the case away and the sporozoite will move to the seminal
			vesicles.

		<p class="class-level">
			Class <span class="class-name">Ciliata</span>

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Paramecium
		</p>
		<p>
			Ciliata is the only class of the subphylum Ciliophora. <i>Paramecium</i>
			is the most well-known, and very common in water with decaying organic matter
			or bacteria. Several spp. in this genus range from 120-300 µm. Unlike amoeba,
			it has a definite structure to the cell, with an anterior and posterior axis.
			Its locomotion is rapid compared to the very slow amoeba.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cell structure is infinitely more complex than for
			amoeba as well. The anterior end of the cell is rounded while the posterior is
			pointed. The outer surface is a stiff but flexible <i>pellicle</i>, which is
			the skeleton giving shape to the cell. The pellicle is composed of hexagonal
			plates with are slightly concave; from each concavity a <i>cilium</i>
			emerges. These cilia provide locomotion for the animal. The cilia are
			arranged in rows over the entire body. A groove called the <i>oral groove</i>
			is a diagonally running depression in the anterior portion. At the posterior
			end of the groove is a <i>mouth pore</i> or <i>cytostome</i>. From the
			mouth pore, a funnel-like tube (<i>gullet</i> or <i>cytopharynx</i>) extends
			into the cytoplasm. <i>Food vacuoles</i> form at the base of the gullet.
			The cytoplasm itself has an <i>ecto</i>- and granular <i>endoplasm</i> as in
			amoeba. Found in the ectoplasm just beneath the pellicle are rod-like
			structures called <i>trichocysts</i>. These can be induced to discharge long
			threads by adding some small amount of acetic acid near the paramecium. If
			attacked by other protozoans, it may discharge these trichocysts. Besides an
			apparently defensive function, these trichocysts are also known to anchor the
			animal during feeding.
		</p>
		<p>
			A <i>macronucleus</i> and one or more <i>micronuclei</i> are
			also present. These are characters of ciliates and not found in other
			protozoa. <i>Paramecium caudatum</i> has one of each. It appears that
			the macronucleus is used in controlling metabolic activities, while the
			micronucleus is involved in reproductive functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			A discussion of the function of contractile vacuoles in <i>Paramecium</i>
			has been given in the introduction on Protozoa above.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Movement</b>. See the introductory section on Protozoa
			for a discussion of the nature of cilia and locomation in <i>Paramecium</i>.
			Swimming movements in <i>Paramecium</i> show a trial-and-error type behavior,
			in which it strikes and object, pivots, then swims forward and away from the
			object in what is called an <i>avoiding reaction</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is estimated that there are &gt;2000 cilia in one
			individual, and all movements are coordinated. Each cilium ends in a basal
			granule (<i>kinetosome</i>). The kinetosomes of each cilium
			in a given row are interconnected by fibers called <i>kinetodesmata</i>
			beneath the pellicle. Different coordinating fibers are connected
			with adjacent one at intervals, forming the <i>kinety system</i>.
			In <i>Paramecium</i>, these fibers converge in the region
			of the gullet and form a coordinating center; when the
			center is destroyed, cilial beating is no longer coordinated.
		</p>
		<p>
			The role of the coordinating center is best studied in <i>Euplotes</i>
			than in <i>Paramecium</i>, since the latter has too many cilia.
			In addition to its few number of cilia, it possesses <b><i>cirri</i></b>,
			which are several fused cilia serving in locomotion. The coordinating
			center is anterior in the animal, and it extends coordinating fibers
			posteriorly to five cirri there. C. V. Taylor showed that when
			the coordinating fibers are cut, the cirri do not beat in a coordinated way.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Nutrition</b>. Ciliates such as <i>Paramecium</i>
			subsist on bacteria and yeast. Where bacteria exist in a mass, the animal
			anchors itself to the mass and feeds. Ciliary beating in the oral groove
			sweeps the bacteria into the mouth opening, down the gullet and to the base
			where food vacuoles form. Once the vacuole is of a certain size, it breaks off
			and passes through the endoplasm via cyclosis (a streaming). Digestion within
			the food vacuole occurs as in Amoeba. And although holozoic in free-living
			environments, one species (<i>Tetrahymena geleii</i>) has been cultured
			in a sterile, completely chemically defined medium (salts, sugars, vitamins,
			amino acids, nucleic acid derivatives). <i>Paramecium</i> has also been
			cultured in nearly-defined chemical media (inorganic salts, carbon source, five
			B vitamins, 14 amino acids, a purine and pyrimidine, the sterol sigmasterol,
			either stearic or oleic acid, and an unknown yeast fraction).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Respiration</b> and <b>excretion.</b> Gas exchange is by
			simple diffusion (through plasma membrane and pellicle). Hydrostatic changes
			are handled by the sophisticated contractile vacuole. Ammonia produced is
			excreted by diffusion.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Reproduction</b>. Both <i>sexual</i> and <i>asexual</i>
			in <i>Paramecium</i>. The organism typically divides asexually (once or twice
			in 24 h under favorable conditions). (1) Asexual reproduction is by transverse
			binary fission. The nuclei divide in different ways: macronuclear division is
			not by mitosis, wherein a spindle forms and chromosomes separate, but by an
			increase in the size of the macronucleus followed by formation of a
			constriction in the middle and coordinated to the the midline where cell
			division is occurring. The micronucleus does divide by mitosis with controlled
			chromosomal duplication. There is no nuclear envelope breakdown.
		</p>
		<p>
			(2) In sexual reproduction, two organisms will become
			involved in a transfer of genetic material in a process called <i>conjugation</i>.
			The organisms attach in the region of the oral groove. The following processes
			happen in both animals: (i) the micronucleus undergoes meiotic divisions (to
			four haploid nuclei); (ii) three of the four haploid nuclei degenerate; (iii)
			the remaining fourth nucleus undergoes another division, but the nuclear
			products have an unequal size appearance; (iv) the smaller of the two nuclei
			migrates across a cytoplasmic interzoic bridge; (v) the transferred smaller
			nucleus fuses with the larger nucleus of the other animal. Nuclear fusion is
			quite similar in process and mechanism to the pronuclear fusion of nuclei in
			the zygotes of higher animals. The macronucleus meanwhile has been breaking
			down and disappears into the cytoplasm.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once genetic material is transferred, conjugation ceases
			with animal separation. The fused nuclei, then divide mitotically into 8
			micronuclei (3 divisions). Four will increase in size to become macronuclei,
			one will remain the micronucleus and three will disintegrate. Two successive
			binary divisions will produce four animals; during this process, the
			micronuclei undergo mitosis with each cell division, while the four macronuclei
			simply redistribute such that there is one per animal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another process called <b><i>autogamy</i></b>
			(self-fertilization) occurs after several fission-type divisions when there has
			been no conjugation. This is marked by several micronuclear divisions to a
			haploid state without cell fission and by macronuclear disappearance. Two of
			the haploid micronuclei fuse, and then development of additional micronuclei
			and the macronuclei from these fusion products produces several animals with
			one micronucleus and one macronucleus as in normal conjugation. Although there
			is no exchange of genetic material, the process seems to be for the purpose of
			generating new macronuclei.
		</p>
		<p>
			Several protozoologists (Sonneborn, Jennings) have shown
			that conjugation does not occur randomly between two animals but that animals
			of specific <b><i>varieties</i></b> and <b><i>mating types</i></b>.
			In <i>Paramecium aurelia</i> there are seven varieties: within each
			variety of six varieties, there are two mating types, in the seventh variety
			there is only one. The mating types within a variety only conjugate with the
			other mating type where varieties have two mating types. In the seventh
			variety, there is no conjugation.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Behavior</b>. The ciliates have the power to
			discriminate between extremes of temperature and light. They show avoiding
			reactions to chemical fluxes or predatory forms. Paramecia are negatively
			geotropic, typically forming near the top of a glass container (dissolved
			O<sub>2</sub> is likely to richer there). They
			aggregate near dilute acetic acid; a good adaptation since bacteria aggregate
			near decaying organic matter which tends to release organic acids. Paramecia
			do not discriminate food and nonfood particles easily, but some studies show a
			preference for certain bacteria.

		</p>
		<p>Certain strains of P. aurelia have been called <q>killer</q>
			strains since they produce a virus-like, self-replicating cytoplasmic inclusion
			called a <i>kappa</i> particle. These particles release a toxin into the
			medium which kills other sensitive strains. But when cytoplasm containing
			particles from a killer strain is injected into the sensitive strain, it
			becomes immune and also a killer strain.

		</p>
		<p class="genus">
			Other Ciliates
		</p>
		<p>
			15 orders are placed into four subclasses, with basis of
			classification being nature and distribution of cilia. Among the different
			forms of cilia are (1) <i>cirri</i>--already indicated as being a fusion of
			cilia at the end; (2) <i>membranelles</i>--a fusion of cilia side-by-side,
			i.e., along a line form a paddle-like structure; (3) <i>undulating membrane</i>--a
			membranelle which a flexible and <q>wavy.</q>

		</p>
		<p>
			Ciliates are generally not parasitic; only one infects man (<i>Balantidium
				coli</i>). Ciliates can be found in the millions in the stomachs of ruminants
			and colon of herbivores, feeding on the plant material. When the ciliates die,
			they apparently supply nutrition to the host (although if ciliate numbers are
			controlled using copper sulfate, there is no decline in the health of the
			animal).

		</p>

			Other ciliates have special structures for feeding. <i>Didinium</i> feeds on
			paramecia and possesses rod-like trichites lining the cytopharynx (gullet) from
			its cytostome. Other ciliates show variation in the feeding apparatus from
			Paramecium. Some have a simple buccal cavity; some a large involuted buccal
			cavity in addition to a vestibule; others a very long funnel-like buccal cavity
			with the cytostomal apparatus within the interior of the animal.

			Some animals undergo complex morphological changes in the life cycle.
			Suctoridians are stalk-like, sessile, and aciliate as adults. The adult bodies
			show sticky, knobbed tentacles which serve to entangle and paralyze prey. These
			tentacles virtually suck the food from the body of the prey through the core of
			the tentacle (hence the name).
