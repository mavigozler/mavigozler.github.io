Clinical Interpretations of Ion-Specific Electrode Measurements

<h1>Measurement of Electrolytes</h1>
Serum/plasma electrolytes are now typically determined by a potentiometric
method using an ion-specific electrode (ISE).  The principle is exactly
like the measurement of hydrogen ion concentrations using a pH electrode,
which is typically a combination electrode with one polar element being a
glass electrode sensitive to hydrogen ion and a reference electrode which
is usually a silver wire/silver chloride junction or a
mercury/mercurous chloride (calomel) junction.
<p>An older established
method---in fact, the <em>reference</em> method---for measuring
sodium and potassium is flame photometry,
in which the metal ions are vaporized in a flame and the intensity of
emission lines (wavelengths) characteristic of the ions are measured
with selection of the wavelength by something like a diffraction grating
and the intensity of the filtered band then measured by a photomultiplier
tube.
<h2>Indirect and Direct Measurement</h2>
A <strong>direct</strong> measurement of the concentration
(or ion activity) of an electrolyte is one performed on the
<strong>undiluted</strong> specimen.  This can be whole blood or with
the cellular elements removed, viz., plasma.  For measuring the cations
sodium and potassium, if direct measurements are to be
made with plasma rather than whole blood (absolutely recommended for
various reasons), the anticoagulant should be heparin.
<p>
It follows then that an <strong>indirect</strong> measurement of
the concentration (or ion activity) of an electrolyte is one
performed on a <strong>diluted</strong> specimen.  Dilution with water
is likely to affect the ion <em>activity</em>, which is equivalent to the
ion <em>concentration</em> in infinitely (or very) dilute solutions,
which are considered ideal solutions in the thermodynamic sense.  However,
because true solutions, particularly body fluids, have many other components,
both ionic and non-ionic, they are far from ideal and the behavior of
ions will vary from classical expectations.
<h1>Indirect versus Direct Measurement</h1>
Electrolytes are generally measured (and reported) as mass (a certain number
of gram-atoms) per unit volume, namely, mmol/L.  The total volume
of the sample can be
considered to be sum of the (mole) fraction of water and the fraction of
non-water components.  Since ions prefer to be solvated and therefore
partition into the water phase, the true specific ion concentration
will be the measured concentration if the fraction of water making up
the solvent approaches 100%.  Diluted samples, such as those prepared
for indirect ISE or flame photometry, approximate this condition.
<p>
However, since non-water components (protein, lipids) make up a significant
fraction of plasma, with plasma water being 93% (930 g/L) and non-water
components being 7% weight per volume, the same mass of ions are
now more concentrated in a smaller water volume, and therefore the
concentration will be observed to be higher in undiluted versus
diluted samples.  The difference will be about 7% in this case, a
difference often observed between direct ISE versus indirect methods
(indirect ISE or flame photometry).

<h2>The Effect of Pathological States</h2>
Experimental evidence shows that the effect of the difference in
sodium and potassium readings is even more pronounced when conditions
cause significant changes in the fraction of non-water components present,
such as protein or triglycerides.  Elevations in protein and/or
triglycerides can even cause a greater degree of difference in
direct versus indirect method use.

<h1>Measuring Directly Preferred</h1>
Advances in instrument technology, particularly potentiometric methods
like ISE, now make it possible to get more reliable determinations of
of sodium and potassium ion activity by direct measurement of (undiluted)
plasma.  Since these values report the &quot;true&quot; or rather
<em>physiologically relevant</em> concentrations, and therefore are
important as factors in medical decision-making, direct measurements
should be attempted when the quality of the result is in no doubt, or
where quality is as comparable as measurement by an indirect method.

<h1>Laboratory Reporting</h1>
While direct methods might be preferred, a laboratory may still nonetheless
use indirect methods because:
<ul>
<li>no direct method is available
<li>a direct method is available, but the quality of the result makes
using the method unacceptable
<li>an indirect method is used and is preferred because quality and
consistently are vastly superior
</ul>
<p>
What is important though is <em>consistency</em> of method.  Laboratory
staff need to be aware that switching from one method to another can
lead to inaccurate reporting.  Indeed, it might be established protocol
to measure and report normal specimens using direct (undiluted) ISE while
specimens showing abnormally high levels of protein and/or lipids are
measured by indirect (diluted) ISE, which actually creates a larger
difference from the true reading.
<p>
A laboratory might actually wish to report the method used to measure
sodium and potassium (by whatever method) and provide instruction to
clinicians about the dependency of the true value on the method.
<p>
An alternative to be debated is the use of a <em>correction factor</em>
applied to an instrument (raw) result to get a final (adjusted/corrected)
result.  Clearly laboratorians are instinctively averse to &quot;messing
with the machine's output.&quot;  Nonetheless, there is a responsibility
to provide the clinician as much data context as is necessary so that
an informed decision can be made, however that is achieved.

The (U.S.) National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS) has prepared
a draft (C29-A2) which is a second edition for the document titled
<cite>Standardization of Sodium and Potassium Ion-Selective Electrode
Systems to the Flame Photometric Reference Method</cite>, from which much
of the material presented here was taken.
<p>Note this is a <em>draft</em> document (!), and NCCLS states that
