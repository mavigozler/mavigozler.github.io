<h1>Limits, Continuity, Differentiation</h1>
<p>
These problems help with evaluating limits where `x->oo`.
<p class="prob">
Evaluate `lim_{x->oo} (5x^2 + 8x - 3)/(3x^2 + 2)`
<div class="soln">
This is a rational function. When the highest degree of the polynomial in the
numerator is less than or equal to the highest degree of the polynomial in the
denominator, divide by the highest degree in both numerator and denominator:
<p class="math">
`lim_{x->oo} ((5x^2 + 8x - 3)(1/x^2))/((3x^2 + 2)(1/x^2))` <br>
`\ \ \ = lim_{x->oo} (5 + 8/x - 3/x^2)/(3 + 2/x^2)` <br>
`\ \ \ = lim_{x->oo} (5 + 0 - 0)/(3 + 0)` <br> 
`\ \ \ = 5/3`
</div>
<p class="prob">
Find `lim_{x->oo} sin (1/x)`
<div class="soln">
Create a substitution of `t = 1/x`. This means that as `x -> oo` then 
`t -> 0^+` which means that `t` approaches zero from the positive side.
This problem is now re-cast as and the limit is now much easier to evaluate:
<p class="math">
`lim_{t->0^+} sin t = 0`
</div>


<p class="prob">
Find `lim_{x->+-oo} x sin (1/x)`
<div class="soln">
This is actually two problems, which will be evaluated separately.
<p class="math">
`lim_{x->oo} x sin (1/x), lim_{x->-oo} x sin (1/x)`
<p>
Perform the `t = 1/x` substitution and it is re-cast as
<p class="math">
`lim_{t->0^+} (sin t)/t, lim_{t->0^-} (sin t)/t`
<p>
The numerator moves towards 0, but the denominator makes it move towards infinity.
With these competing tendencies, you can graph the function in its original form.
Another way is to draw a horizontal line with a semicircle. Draw a radius from
the center to some point in the semicircle. `sin t` will be the ratio of the
chord perpendicular from the radius point intersection to the horizontal line
and the radius, while `t` will be the arc length (a representation of the
angle). If one assumes the radius = 1, then `sin t` represents the chord lenght.
As `t -> 0`, the chord length and arc length start to become equal, so 
`(sin t)/t` starts to approach 1.  Thus:
<p class="math">
`lim_{t->0^+} (sin t)/t = 1, lim_{t->0^-} (sin t)/t = 1`
<p>
and so:
<p class="math">
`lim_{x->oo} x sin (1/x) = 1, lim_{x->-oo} x sin (1/x) = 1`
</div>

<p class="prob">
Find `lim_{x->oo}(x - sqrt(x^2 + 16))`
<div class="soln">
Both terms approach infinity as `x -> oo`, and it seems that infinity is
subtracted from infinity. The approach is to multiply the conjugate radical
expression:
<p class="math">
`lim_{x->oo}(x - sqrt(x^2 + 16))((x + sqrt(x^2 + 16))/(x + sqrt(x^2 + 16)))` <br>
`\ \ \ = lim_{x->oo}(x^2 - x^2 + 16)/(x + sqrt(x^2 + 16)) ` <br>
`\ \ \ = lim_{x->oo} 16/(x + sqrt(x^2 + 16))`
<p>
This shows that the denominator alone will get quite large, so it will evaluate
to zero. But one more step can be taken to divide by the highest degree of
the polynomial:
<p class="math">
`lim_{x->oo} 16/(x + sqrt(x^2 + 16))((1//x)/(1//x))` <br>
`\ \ \ = lim_{x->oo} (16//x)/(1 + sqrt(1 + 16//x^2))`
`\ \ \ = 0 / (1 + sqrt(1 + 0)) = 0`
</div>

<h2>Continuity</h2>
<p>
A function has a derivative at point `x_0` if the slopes of the secant lines
through `P(x_0, f(x_0))` and a nearby point `Q` approach a finite limit as `Q`
approaches `P`. If the secants fail to take a limiting position or become vertical
as `Q` approaches `P`, the derivative does not exist. In other words the curve
must generally be <q>smooth</q> for continuity.
<p>
Graphing of the function will show discontinuities and where derivatives cannot
be found. These include any point:
<ul>
<li>on the function that is a <var>corner</var>
<li>where the function becomes a <var>vertical tangent</var>
<li>where there is a <var>cusp</var>: this is like a corner but the function
reflects back
<li>where there is a <var>discontinuity</var> representing offset of the function
plot
<li>where there is a <var>discontinuity</var> in which a point is not defined
for the function (an open interval) or the point is alone offset
</ul>


<h1>Differentiation: The Derivative</h1>

<h2>Composite Functions and The Chain Rule</h2>
<p>
The function `F(x) = sin(x^2 - 4)` is a <dfn>composite function</dfn> in that there is
a function within a function. There is a function `y = f(u) = sin u` and a 
function `u = g(x) = x^2 - 4`. The derivative with respect to `x` will be 
expressed as
<p class="math">
`dy/dx = dy/(du) (du)/dx` <br>
`dy/(du) = cos u` <br>
`du/dx = 2x` <br>
So `dy/dx = (cos u)(2x) = 2x cos (x^2 - 4)`
<p>
when all backsubstitutions are made to variable `x`.
<p>
Using a more functional notation, consider that `y = f(g(x))`, which represents
a composite function. The derivative is then:
<p class="math">
`dy/dx = f'(g(x)) g'(x)`
<p>
This states that the <q>outside</q> function `f` is evaluated with respect to `x` and this
is then multiplied by the derivative of the <q>inside</q> function `g`.
<p>
Note that the Chain Rule will apply to all levels of a composite function.
Thus for y = f(g(h(x))), then
<p class="math">
`dy/dx = f'(g(h(x)))g'(h(x))h'(x)`
<p>
Evaluate `g(t) = tan(5 - sin 2t)`
<p class="soln">
`g'(t) = d/dt (tan(5 - sin 2t))` <br>
`\ \ \ = sec^2(5 - sin 2t)*d/dt(5 - sin 2t)` <br>
`\ \ \ = sec^2(5 - sin 2t)*(0 - cos 2t * d/dt (2t))` <br>
`\ \ \ = sec^2(5 - sin 2t)*(- cos 2t) * 2` <br>
`\ \ \ = -2 (cos 2t)\ sec^2(5 - sin 2t)`


<h1>Integration Also Called Antidifferentiation</h1>
<p>
To integrate is to evaluate the mathematical expression that is the 
<var>integral</var>. The mathematical expression can be a function `f(x)` or a
combination of functions connected by the typical operators: `+, -, xx, div`:
<p class="math">
`f(x) + g(x),\ f(x) - g(x),\ f(x)g(x),\ f(x)/g(x)`
<p>
Integration requires <b>MUCH</b> of the two p's: patience and practice.
<p>
This is absolutely unlike determining the derivative, where you just execute
the rules and then make sure you don't forget the minus sign and any possible
back-substitutions you need to make to get the result.
<p>
With integration, you may start one of the techniques that takes you down a
dead end. You will quickly realize that if the substitutions you make actually
make the resulting integral more complex and more difficult to analyze. 
These substitution techniques are intended to make the integral in a form that
simplifies it, that makes it quickly evaluated so that the integral is eliminated,
which means you have the result and you're done. And once you have evaluted 
the integral with your substitutions, you have to take great care in doing the
back-substitution to get the original variable (turning all `u` variables back
to the `x` variables).

<h2>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h2>
<p>
There are many theorems involved in understanding calculus and in the setup 
of important theorems.

<h3>Riemann Sums</h3>
<p>
Let `f` be a continuous function in the interval `[a,b]`. The interval is subdivided
such that the points are located in the `[a,b]` interval. There are `n` 
subintervals and the set of points are such that `x_0 = a` and `x_n = b` with
`x_(n-1)` points in between: 
`a = x_0 &lt; x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; ... &lt; x_(n-1) &lt; x_n = b`. 
It need not be true that the intervals are equally spaced. Each subinterval in the
set `{ x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_(n-1), x_n }` is a closed subinterval:
<p class="math">
`[x_0,x_1], [x_1,x_2], ..., [x_(k-1),x_k],...,[x_(n-1),x_n]`
<p>
The difference between each subinterval is denoted
<p class="math">
`Deltax_1, Deltax_2, ..., Deltax_k, ..., Deltax_n`
<p>
for the corresponding subinterval series above. A point `c_k` is within the
<i>k</i>th subinterval `[x_(k-1), x_k]` such that `(c_k, f(c_k))` represents a
point above or below the `x`-axis that is the height of a rectangular area and
`Deltax_k` represents the width of that area. The area itself can be computed
as `f(c_k) * Deltax_k` and it should be noted that the value can be negative.
<p>
What this does is approximate the area under the curve with respect to the 
x-axis. By summing all the subinterval areas, the approximate area of 
the [a,b] interval is determined:
<p class="math">
`S_P = sum_(k=1)^n\ f(c_k) Deltax_k`
<p>
which is called the <b>Riemann Sum</b>.

<h3>Intermediate Value Theorem</h3>
<p>
This theorem states:
<p class="theorem">
If function `f` is continuous in `[a,b]`, and if `y_0` is a value between `f(a)`
and `f(b)`, then `y_0 = f(c)` for some `c` in `[a, b]`.
<p>
This basically says that there will be a horizontal line of `y = y_0` that will
cross `f(x)` at least once at some point `x = c`.

<h3>Mean Value Theorem</h3>
<p>
The theorem states:
<p class="theorem">
Let `y = f(x)` be continuous on interval `[a,b]` and differentiable in the open
interval `(a,b)`. For at least one point at `x = c` in `(a,b)`:
<p class="theorem-math">
`(f(b) - f(a))/(b - a) = f'(c)`
<p>
If a secant line is drawn between (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)), its slope will be
equal to some point on f(x) at x = c whose tangent line will have the same
slope. Since the tangent line on a function is found by the derivative of the
function `f(x)` at `x = c`.
<p>
As a rigorous proof, define the function g(x) to be the secant line connecting
the two points on f(x). The point-slope equation is:
<p class="math">
`g(x) = f(a) + (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)(x - a)`
<p>
There is a function `h(x)` that represents the difference between `f` and `g`:
<p class="math">
`h(x) = f(x) - g(x)` <br>
`\ \ \ = f(x) - f(a) - (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)(x - a)`
<p>
The graph of `h(x)` will satisfy Rolle's theorem: it is continuous on `[a,b]`, 
differentiable in `(a,b)`, and because both `f` and `g` are as well. Also
`h(a) = h(b) = 0`. The important point is that there is a point `c in (a,b)` 
where `h'(c) = 0`.
<p>
Differentiating both sides of the equation to get `h'(x)` and then evaluate 
`x = c` with `h'(c) = 0`:
<p class="math">
`h'(x) = f'(x) - 0 - (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)(1)` <br>
`\ \ \ = f'(x) - (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)` <br>
`h'(c) = f'(c) - (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)` <br>
`0 = f'(c) - (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)` <br>
`f'(c) = (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)`
<p>
which proves the theorem.

<h3>The Theorem: FTC</h3>
<p>
This theorem makes the connection between differentiation and integration, 
between the derivatve and the antiderivative. The integral of the Mean Value
Theorem will be demonstrated as a preliminary to the FTC, as it is used in proof.
<p>
An important preliminary step is showing the Mean Value Theorem for Definite
Integrals.
<p class="theorem">
If `f` is continuous in `[a,b]` at some point `c` in `[a,b]`:
<p class="theorem-math">
`f(c) = 1/(b -a) int_a^b\ f(x)\ dx`

<h2>`u`-Substitution</h2>
<p>
This is a popular name for this technique because most every calculus and
algebra book discusses functions and expressions in the variable `x`, and 
for this substitution technique in calculus, professors used the variable 
`u`.
<p>
But it is the most powerful and primary means of solving integrals, with
the second technique by <b>integration by parts</b> discussed below.

<h2>Integration By Parts</h2>
<p>
When <i>u</i>-substitution does not seem to be working, you will try a technique 
that attempts to give you a simpler integral to work with. You are going to 
commit the following formula to memory which is what integration by parts is:
<p class="math">
`int\ u\ dv = uv - int\ v\ du`
<p>
Both u and v are functions of x, actually.  And this will be shown in the 
proof of the Integration By Parts formula. Consider two functions f(x) and
g(x) that are continuous and differentiable in x in any interval. If we
differentiate the product of these two functions, we get the sum rule:
<p class="math">
`(d(f(x)g(x)))/dx = g(x) (d(f(x)))/dx + f(x) (d(g(x)))/dx`
<p>
It is typical to symbolize the result of `(d(f(x)))/dx` as `f'(x)`, which is the
derivative, so we can re-write the expression as:
<p class="math">
`(d(f(x)g(x)))/dx = g(x) f'(x) + f(x) g'(x)`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Eq A]
<p>
Now suppose `h(x) = f(x)g(x)`. You can evaluate  `(d(h(x)))/dx` to get its
derivative, but if you integrate the derivative, you get back the original 
function (the antiderivative):
<p class="math">
`int\ (d(h(x)))/dx\ dx = h(x)`
<p>
So [Eq A] is evaluated by integrating it through:
<p class="math">
`int\ (d(f(x)g(x)))/dx\ dx = f(x)g(x) = int\ g(x)f'(x)\ dx + int\ f(x)g'(x)\ dx`
<p>
Rearranging:
<p class="math">
`int\ f(x)g'(x)\ dx = f(x)g(x) - int\ g(x)f'(x)\ dx`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Eq B]
<p>
What does this equation say?
<p>
On the left hand side you have an integral. This integral is your problem,
your starting expression. What you will do is convert that integral to the 
right-hand side of the equation. The first term, the product `f(x)g(x)` is
easy since there is no integral. The second term `int\ g(x)f'(x)\ dx` is 
an integral that you should try to make as an integral that is less complex, 
and thus easier to solve.
<p>
How does it work?  You will need to have an expression in the form of `f(x)`
and an expression that is a derivative of some function `g(x)`. With that,
you can get the right-hand side of the equation. You will do with with 
substitutions using the variables `u` and `v`.
<p>
This is how the formula you should remember evolved. Let `u = f(x)` and `v = g(x)`.
Then `du = f'(x)\ dx` and `dv = g'(x)\ dx`.  Making the substitutions in [Eq B]:
<p class="math">
`int\ u\ dv = uv - int\ v\ du`
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>
So how does this work? Evaluate `int\ x^3 ln x\ dx`
<p>
It is necessary to find an expression `g'(x) dx` that is a derivative whose
antiderivative is determined easily. The other expression does not require an
antiderivatve. Look at the expression, it appears easier to evaluate `x^3\ dx`
than `ln x\ dx` for an antiderivative, so we set `dv = x^3 dx` and `u = ln x`
to complete the left-hand side of the equation. We now need to compute
`v` and `du` for the right-hand side of the equation.  Thus `du = 1/x\ dx`
and `v = x^4/4`. Now complete the equation:
<p class="math">
`int\ ln x\ x^3\ dx = x^4/4 ln x - int\ x^4/4 1/x\ dx`
<p>
The terms have all been substituted in to reflect the formula. Now simplify:
<p class="math">
`int\ x^3 ln x\ dx = 1/4 x^4 ln x - 1/4 int\ x^3\ dx`
<p>
It can be seen that the resulting integral is of the form `int\ x^n\ dx` and
is the easiest of integrals to solve, so the technique worked well. Finishing
the evaluation:
<p class="math">
`int\ x^3 ln x\ dx = 1/4 x^4 ln x - 1/4 (x^4/4) = x^4/4 (ln(x) - 1/4) + C`


<h3>Guidelines for Choosing `u` and `dv`</h3>
<p>
When you have decided to use Integration By Parts, there is a way of deciding
which functions you should set to `u` and which you should set to `dv`. You
can find this information detailed <a 
href="http://www.dummies.com/education/math/calculus/knowing-when-to-integrate-by-parts/">here</a>.
<p>
It's already been shown above that setting any logarithmic function to 
`dv` is difficult since you have to evaluate the antiderivative `v`. Also 
difficult are the inverse trig functions `arcsin x` or `sin^(-1) x`, 
`arccos x` or `cos^(-1) x`, and so on. Antiderivatives easier to evaluate
are simple algebraic expessions of `x` and the trigonometric functions 
(`sin x, cos x` and so on). Most every trigonometric function can be converted
by identities to an expression of `sin x` or `cos x` or both, and these are
more easily evaluted in integral form. The continuing differentiation or
integration of `sin x` and `cos x` evaluate into `cos x` and `sin x` respectively,
possibly with a negative sign.
<p>
From the page cited above, choose as `u` any functions by this order of 
priority:
<ol>
<li>Logarithmic functions: `ln x`
<li>Inverse Trigonometric functions: `sin^(-1) x, cos^(-1) x`
<li>Algebraic functions: `x^a`
<li>Trigonometric functions: `sin x, cos x `
</ol>
<p>
If it helps, the order can be remembered as <q><b><u>L</u></b>earning 
<b><u>I</u></b>ntegrals <b><u>A</u></b>re <b><u>T</u></b>errific</q>
<p>
Forms of `e^x` should not be `u`, but instead `dv`. Have a look at the table:
<table id="liat-table">
<tr><th>Integral is...  <th>Let `u`=    <th>So `dv` =  <th>Why?
<tr><td>`int\ (x^2 + 1) ln (x - 1)\ dx`
  <td>`ln (x - 1)`
  <td>`(x^2 + 1)\ dx`
  <td class="why">logarithmic function before algebraic
<tr><td>`int\ sin^(-1)x cos x\ dx`
  <td>`sin^(-1)x`
  <td>`cos x\ dx`
  <td class="why">inverse trig function before trig function
<tr><td>`int\ (sin x)/x\ dx`
  <td>`1/x`
  <td>`sin x\ dx`
  <td class="why">algebraic function before trig function
<tr><td>`int\ e^x cos x\ dx`
  <td>`cos x`
  <td>`e^x\ dx`
  <td class="why">trig function before exponential
</table>

<h3>Other Ways of Teaching This Concept</h3>
<p>
Look at <a 
href="http://www.dummies.com/education/math/calculus/how-to-do-simple-integration-by-parts/">Calculus
for Dummies</a> on another way of learning about Integration By Parts.

<h2>Final Guidelines for Integration</h2>
<p>
There are basically two techniques of integration most likely to be used:
<ol>
<li>`u`-substitution
<li>integration by parts
</ol>
<p>
There are others, but those techniques are not a focus now. Try `u`-substitution
first, then integration by parts, if there is a roadblock.
<p>
<b>Trig functions</b>. Does the expression contain forms of `csc x, sec x, 
cot x`, and `tan x`? Try to convert everything to expressions of `sin x` and
`cos x` using the standard identities.
<p>
<b>Quotients</b>. Does the integral have the form `int\ dx / f(x)` or 
`int\ g(x) / f(x)\ dx`? Then you will want to perform a `u`-substitution that will
look like

<hr>

<h2>Practice: `u`-Substitution</h2>
<p>
You may be given a table of integrals to finish off problems, but no problem
will have its solution entirely in a table. You will have to get part way there.

<p class="prob">
Problem 1. `int\ tan^2 x\ dx`
<div class="soln">
This problem was solved without `u`-substitution, but was given as a problem
in the set.
<p>
This is a trig function that is not strictly in either `sin x` or `cos x`, so
get it in terms of that exclusively. (Remember, convert all `csc x, sec x, 
cot x` and `tan x` to terms of `sin x` or `cos x` as integration will be easier,
unless you have a table of integrals in front of you to get the easy answer.)
You should already know by heart that `tan x = sin x / cos x`
and `sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1` as well-known trig identities.
<p class="math">
`int\ tan^2 x` <br>
`\ \ \ = int\ sin^2 x/cos^2 x\ dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = int\ (1 - cos^2 x)/cos^2 x\ dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = int\ 1/cos^2 x\ dx - int\ dx`
<p>
Note that two identities were used and that the difference terms were separated
using integral rules. The second term is easy to solve, but the inverse `cos^2 x`
term requires some thinking.
<p>
Recall that `(d(tan x))/dx = sec^2 x`. This is usually in a table of derivatives
given to you, and this table will be available to you most likely on an exam.
(But see the shaded box at the end of this answer on how this derivative is proved.)
<p>
If both sides of the equation were integrated, then
<p class="math">
`int\ (d(tan x)) = int\ sec^2 x dx` which becomes `tan x = int\ sec^2 dx`
<p>
It is also important to remember that `sec x = 1 / cos x` so 
`sec^2 x = 1 / cos^2 x`. So now the solution to the expressions above is obvious:
<p class="math">
`int\ 1/cos^2 x\ dx - int\ dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = int\ sec^2 x dx - int\ dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = tan x + x + C`

<p>
Here is the problem using `u`-substitution. After converting `int\ tan^2 x\ dx`
to `int\ sin^2 x/cos^2 x\ dx`, let `u = cos x` because the expression is a quotient
and `cos x` is a form of a function that is the denominator.
Then `du = - sin x\ dx` which is equivalent to `-du = sin x\ dx`.
<p>
This is not going to work unless we change the integral expression to have a 
`sin x\ dx` and the rest of the terms must be in the form of `cos x` so that
there are `u`-substitutions possible.

<div style="padding:1em;font-size:90%;color:black;background-color:#ddd;">
Note that if you easily remember the derivative of `sin x` and `cos x`:
<p class="math">
`(d (sin x))/dx = cos x\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (d (cos x))/dx = -sin x`
<p>
then you can prove the derivative of `tan x` as follows:
<p class="math">

`tan x = sin x / cos x = sin x (1 / cos x)`  (trig identity) <br>
`(d(tan x))/dx = (d (sin x))/dx (1 / cos x) + sin x (d (1 / cos x))/dx` [Eq 1]
<div style="margin-bottom:0.5em;border:1px solid blue;padding:0.5em;font-size:90%;width:85%;float:right;">
note the rule of differentiation to explain what happened above:
<p class="math">
  `y = a(x)b(x);  dy/dx = (d(a(x)))/dx b(x) + a(x)(d(b(x)))/dx`
</div>
<p style="clear:both;">
The evaluation of `d (sin x)//dx` is straightforward. But the inverse of 
the `cos x` function requires some special handling.
<p>
Let `y = 1 / cos x` and `v = cos x`.  Now `y = 1 /v`.<br>
Because of the rule `(dy)/dx = (dy)/(dv) (dv)/dx`, then it is easy to evaluate
the two derivatives which are factors:
<p class="math">
`(dy)/dx = (d (1/v))/(dv) (d (cos x))/dx = -(1/v^2) (-sin x)` <br>
`= -(1/cos^2 x)(-sin x) = sin x / cos^2 x` [Eq 2]
<p>
The result [Eq 2] can now be entered into [Eq 1]:
<p class="math">
`(d(tan x))/dx = (d (sin x))/dx (1 / cos x) + sin x (d (1 / cos x))/dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = (cos x)(1 / cos x) + sin x (sin x / cos^2 x)` <br>
`\ \ \ = 1 + sin^2 x / cos^2 x` <br>
`\ \ \ = (cos^2 x + sin^2 x)/ cos^2 x\ \ \ \[ 1 + b/a = a/a + b/a = (a + b)/a ]`<br>
`\ \ \ = 1/ cos^2 x` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ trig identity ]<br>
`\ \ \ = sec^2 x` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ inverse of `cos x = sec x` ]<br>
</div>

<p class="prob">
Problem 2. `int\ cos^2 x\ sin x\ dx`
<div class="soln">
A clue to solving this is the term next to the `dx`. You know immediately that 
`d (sin x)/dx = cos x` and `d (cos x)/dx = -sin x`, so you can go back and
forth in this way.
<p>
In general when using substitution, try to substitute the term that has a 
power (exponent) not equal to one.  Therefore, `u = cos x` so `du = -sin x dx`.
Because the `sin x` term is positive, we need to alter the integral before
substitution:
<p class="math">
`- int\ (cos^2 x)\ (-sin x)\ dx`
<p>
Note that this is a multiplication of &minus;1 twice in order to generate the
negative `sin x` term. Now it is ready to substitute:
<p class="math">
`- int\ u^2 du = - u^3/3 = - 1/3 cos^3 x + C`
<p>
Any integral of the type `int\ x^n dx` is very easy to evaluate once you see
and are able to get it into that form by substitution! `int\ x^n dx = x^n/(n + 1)`
</div>
<p class="prob">
Problem 3. `int\ cos^3 x\ dx`
<div class="soln">
To solve this problem, you need to be aware of the trigonometric identity
`sin^2x + cos^2 = 1`. Always be prepared to use this identity with any integrals
involving trigonometric functions. It comes in handy. This identity will allow
you to switch from `sin x` to `cos x` and the reverse.  Now that simple 
algebra shows `sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x` and `cos^2 = 1 - sin^2 x`. Using this,
note that:
<p class="math">
`int\ cos^3 x\ dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = int\ (cos x)(cos^2 x) dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = (cos x)(1 - sin^2 x)\ dx`
<p>
This conversion using identities now has the power term where `n != 1` in the
`sin x` term. So
<p class="math">
`u = sin x;  du = cos x dx`
<p>
This is now easily substituted and solved:
<p class="math">
`int\ (1 - sin^2 x)\ cos x\ dx` <br>
`\ \ = int\ (1 - u^2) du` <br>
`\ \ = u - 1/3u^3` <br>
`\ \ = sin x - 1/3 sin^3 x + C`
</div>
<p class="prob">
Problem 4. `int\ 1/sqrt(25 - x^2)\ dx`


<p class="prob">
Problem 5. `int\ tan^3 x\ dx`
<div class="soln">
Again, `tan x` functions are somewhat difficult to work with, so it's probably
better to work with the identity form of `tan x` since `sin x` and `cos x` 
interact with each other in differentiation and integration.
<p>
The strategy will be to use `sin x` and `cos x` identities and get a trig function
combined with `dx`. Let's try expressing `tan^3 x` in a different way.
<p class="math">
`int\ tan^3 x\ dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = int\ ((sin^2 x) sin x)/cos^3 x\ dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = int\ ((1 - cos^2 x) sin x)/cos^3 x\ dx`
<p>
Note that the identity `tan x = sin x / cos x` and `sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1` have
been used here.  Now the <i>u</i>-substitution: `u = cos x` (why?). So 
`du = - sin x dx` or `- du = sin dx`. Perform the substitution:
<p class="math">
`int\ - (1 - u^2)/u^3\ du` <br>
`\ \ \ = - int\ (1/u^3 - u^2/u^3) du` <br>
`\ \ \ = - int\ 1/u^3 du + int\ u^2/u^3 du` <br>
`\ \ \ = - int\ 1/u^3 du + int\ 1/u du` <br>
`\ \ \ = - (-1/2 1/u^2) + ln|u| + C` <br>
`\ \ \ = 1/(2cos^2 x) + ln|cos x| + C` <br>
</div>
<p class="prob">
Problem 6. `int\ (dt)/(t ln t)`
<div class="soln">
There are a couple of possibilities for the <i>u</i>-substitution. First
`u = t` is pointless and can be discarded since you are just replacing
`t` with `u` and not making it easy to integrate. Second, you can try
`u = 1/t` with `du = `-1/t^2 dx`, but that is not a term in the integral.
Since you know that the derivative of `ln x` is `1/x`, and you have a form
of that in the integral, that could be a winner.  So `u = ln t` and
`du = 1/t\ dt`, which exists in the integral and makes it easy.
<p class="math">
`int\ (1/t)(1/ln t)\ dt = int\ du/u` <br>
`\ \ \ = ln|u|+ C`<br>
`\ \ \ = ln|ln t|+ C`
<p>
Thus the solution is a logarithm of a logarithm.
</div>
<p class="prob">
Problem 7. `int\ e^x/((e^x + 1)(ln(e^x + 1)) dx`
<div class="soln">
Whenever you see a logarithm containing a complex expression, you 
should probably try to contain the complex expression in the substitution.
Thus try `u = e^x + 1` first. `du = e^x\ dx`, and you can see that you 
can easily find a `e^x\ dx` expression in the integral, so `du` 
substitution is easy!
<p class="math">
`int\ (du)/(u ln u)`
<p>
This expression looks EXACTLY like the one just solved in the previous 
problem, so there is no more work:
<p class="math">
`int\ (du)/(u ln u) = ln |ln (u)| + C` <br>
`\ \ \ = ln |ln (e^x + 1)| + C`
</div>

Now the integration by parts: an algebraic and an exponential function,

`int_0^1\ (y^2 + 1)e^(y)\ dy = (y^2 + 1) e^y|_0^1 - int_0^1\ e^y\ 2\ dy` <br>

#876. int\ x^3 cos(x^2)\ dx
<div class="soln">
Immediately doing integration by parts will complicate things, since we
will want the part `dv = cos(x^2) dx` which is hard to evaluate. So let's try
a `u`-substitution first. (Instead use `y`, since the `u` will be used for
integration by parts in the next step.)  `y = x^2, dy = 2x dx, 1/2 dy = x dx`.
The integral can be re-expressed as `int\ x^2 cos (x^2) x\ dx` which now 
becomes `1/2 int\ y cos y dy` and this is far easier to evaluate.
<p>
Now the integration by parts: `u = y, du = dy, dv = cos y dy, v = sin y`
<p class="math">
`int\ y cos y dy = y sin y - int\ sin y dy` <br>
`\ \ \ = y sin y - (- cos y) + C` <br>
`\ \ \ = x^2 sin x^2 + cos x^2 + C`
<p>
Recall this was multiplied by `1/2`, to the final is
<p class="math">
`1/2 int\ x^3 cos(x^2)\ dx = 1/2 [x^2 sin x^2 + cos x^2] + C`
</div>
<p class="prob">
#879. `int\ e^x cos(2x)\ dx`
<div class="soln">
With an exponential and a trig function, choose `u` to be the trig function.
`u = cos(2x)`. The computation of `du/dx` involves the outer function of the
form `cos y` (still a function of `x`) and the inner function which is `2x`:
`du/dx = du/dy dy/dx`. Let `y = 2x`, so `u = cos y`. Now 
`du/dx = (-sin y) xx 2 = -2 sin y = -2 sin 2x`. So `du = -2 sin 2x\ dx`. 
Now the other part: `dv = e^x dx` and `v = e^x`
<p class="math">
`int\ e^x cos(2x)\ dx = e^x cos(2x) - int\ e^x (-2 sin 2x) dx`
`\ \ \ = e^x cos(2x) + 2 int\ e^x sin 2x\ dx` [Eq 879a]
<p>
Let's try that again with the new integral: `u = sin 2x, du = 2 cos 2x dx`.
The evaluation of dv and v are the same as above. Now fill in:
<p class="math">
`int\ e^x sin 2x\ dx = e^x sin 2x - int\ e^x (2 cos 2x) dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = e^x sin 2x - 2 int\ e^x cos 2x\ dx`
<p>
And put this into [Eq 879a]:
<p class="math">
`int\ e^x cos(2x)\ dx = e^x cos(2x) + 2 [e^x sin 2x - 2 int\ e^x cos 2x\ dx]` <br>
`int\ e^x cos(2x)\ dx = e^x cos(2x) + 2 e^x sin 2x - 4 int\ e^x cos 2x\ dx`
<p>
This circles back to the original integral. To make it easy to see this, let
`w = int\ e^x cos(2x)\ dx` (the original integral).  So now it is of the form
<p class="math">
`w = e^x cos(2x) + 2 e^x sin 2x - 4 w`
<p>
Now all that is necessary is to solve for `w`: Add `4w` to each side, then 
divide by 5:
<p class="math">
`w + 4w = e^x cos(2x) + 2 e^x sin 2x - 4 w + 4w =` <br>
`5w = e^x cos(2x) + 2 e^x sin 2x` <br>
`5w / 5 = 1/5 [e^x cos(2x) + 2 e^x sin 2x]` <br>
`w = 1/5 [e^x cos(2x) + 2 e^x sin 2x]` <br>
`int\ e^x cos(2x)\ dx = 1/5 [e^x cos(2x) + 2 e^x sin 2x] + C`
<p>
The last was to substitute for `w` to the original.
</div>
<p class="prob">
#881. `int\ cos sqrt(x)\ dx`
<div class="soln">
There are not two functions f(x) g(x) in the integral, so I don't see how 
integration by parts can be done, at least at first.
<p>
Let `u = sqrt(x)`, then du = `1/(2 sqrt(x)) dx`. Solving for `dx` with `x = u^2`,
then `dx = 2 u du` (watch the tricky algebra there. Substituting:
<p class="math">
`int\ 2 u cos u\ du`
<p>
Now we can try integration by parts using `y` instead of `u` so as not to get
confused, that is: `int\ y\ dv = yv - int\ v\ dy`.  So let `y = 2u` and 
`dv = cos u\ du`. Thus `dy = 2 du` and `v = sin u`.  Now plug it all in:
<p class="math">
`int\ 2u cos u\ du = 2u (-sin u) - int\ (sin u) 2 du` <br>
`\ \ \ =  2u sin u - 2 (-cos u)` <br>
`\ \ \ =  2(u sin u + cos u) + C`
<p>
Just one more step, which is getting `x` back:
<p class="math">
`2 (sqrt(x) sin sqrt(x) + cos sqrt(x)) + C`
</div>
<p class="prob">
#882. `int\ x^4 (ln x)^2\ dx`
<div class="soln">
There is an algebraic (`x^4`) and logarithmic (`(ln x)^2`), so select 
`u = (ln x)^2`. To get `du/dx`, note that `du/dx = du/dy dy/dx` where 
`y` is the inner function, `y = ln x`, so `u = y^2`. Thus 
`du/dx = 2y 1/x = 2 (ln x) / x`, so `du = 2 (ln x)/x dx`. For the other
part: `dv = x^4 dx`, so `v = x^5/5`. Now the integration by parts:
<p class="math">
`int\ x^4 (ln x)^2 dx = x^5/5 (ln x)^2 - int\ x^5/5 (2 ln x)/x dx` <br>
`\ \ \ = x^5/5 (ln x)^2 - 2/5 int\ x^4 ln x\ dx`
<p>
This is still complex, so another round of integration by parts on the new
integral alone: `u = ln x, du = 1/x dx, dv = x^4 dx, v = x^5/5`. So:
<p class="math">
`int\ x^4 ln x\ dx = x^5/5 ln x - int\ (x^5/5) (1/x) dx` <br>
`\ \ \  = x^5/5 ln x - 1/5 int\ x^4 dx` <br>
`\ \ \  = x^5/5 ln x - 1/5 (x^5/5)` <br>
`\ \ \  = x^5/5 ln x - x^5/25`
<p>
Now enter this into the first integration by parts:
<p class="math">
`\ \ \ = x^5/5 (ln x)^2 - 2/5 [x^5/5 ln x - x^5/25]` <br>
`\ \ \ = 1/5 x^5 (ln x)^2 - 2/25 x^5 ln x + 2/125 x^5 + C`
