It is intended that this glossary be authoritative at some level.
As such the definitions contained within are <b>always tentative</b>,
meaning that they are being revised continually so that the meanings,
descriptions, and style of presentation meet the strict and exacting
requirements of the maintainer and the readers (namely you), the purpose
of which is to make the glossary both readable and informative.
Corrections, suggestions, criticisms, and contributions are
not only welcome, but they are encouraged.

<dt>electromagnetic radiation
 <dd>a form of energy transmitted as an <a href="#emwave">electromagnetic
 wave</a>

<dt>electromagnetic spectrum
 <dd>

<dt id="emwave">electromagnetic wave
 <dd>[all sciences] a <a href="#wave">wave</a> of radiatiave energy in which
 the energy is composed of two oscillating fields in synchrony, one field
an electric (voltage) field and the other field a magnetic field.  Because all
matter is composed of atoms, and the subatomic components of atoms are charged
particles (protons, electrons), electromagnetic waves can cause oscillating
motions of atoms and molecules when the latter is present in these waves.
If the wave is in the radio part of the spectrum, the oscillations can drive
electrical circuits that produce the sound from radio transmissions.  If the
wave is in the microwave part of the spectrum, it can drive the rotation
of water molecules to make liquids hot.  If the wave is in the visible light
part of the spectrum, it can cause chemical reactions in the retina of the eye
that cause the perception of light.

<dt>gravity
 <dd>a <em>force</em> in nature that is the properties of all masses
 and which is proportional in magnitude to the size or amount of the mass;
 it achieves a significant (detectable) magnitude when that mass is on a
 large (planetary) scale
 <dd>[astronomy]  a force that has significant effects for masses (bodies)
 having a planetary scale, and is the primary force affecting motions of
 stars, planets and galaxies in relation to each other

<dt id="ion">ion

the charge is either positive or negative, and can be of an integer magnitude
that is 1 or greater, namely, +1, +2, +3, etc for positive ions, and &minus;1,
&minus;2, &minus;3, etc for negatives ions

which has all the properties of matter (for example, gravitational pull in
particularly planetary-scale masses) and which is important in understanding
forces and energy in physics.

<dt>temperature
 <dd>[astronomy]
 <dd>[physics]: a means to measure the amount of heat energy in a
 closed system.  The tool/instrument used to determine temperature is
 the <a href="#thermometer">therometer</a>

<dt id="thermometer">thermometer
 <dd>[all sciences] a device used to measure the temperature of a system containing matter in
 almost any phase or state (solid, liquid, or gas) and an indicator of the heat
 energy present in the system containing the matter.  The first and most simple
 of thermometers were constructed of glass tubes filled with a liquid that
 expanded within the tubing lumen when placed in a hot system and which
 contracted upon cooling.  The liquid could be elemental mercury or an alcohol
 to which a colored dye (often red in color) was added.  After sealing the
 tubing, the thermometer would have to be calibrated, often by sticking it in
 ice water and marking the glass at the point where the liquid contracted within
 the lumen as the 0 to 1&deg; C point, and sticking it in boiling water to where
 the liquid expanded and indicating the 100&deg; C point.  The markings in between
 would be done knowing the liquid expanded in a linear way.
