You have been unsubscribed from the Proteomics list discussion group
because of too many messages sent from the list server returned as
undeliverable for any of a hundred reasons.  This might be due to 
a misconfiguration of your email address or MTA server or because 
of a full mailbox reaching its limit.

In any event, re-subscribe yourself to the list if you like, and
if you continue to have trouble send a message to the list
administrator.
