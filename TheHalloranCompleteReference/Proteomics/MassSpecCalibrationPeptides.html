<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
It is a common mistake for those preparing their own in-house mixes of
peptides or proteins to prepare them in a mole-for-mole fashion.
For example there are five peptides useful for the external calibration
of MALDI mass spectrometers in that they effectively cover the mass range
that encompasses most tryptic peptides, which is <i>m/z</i> 1000-3000.
These five peptides were examined in this report.
<p>
The problem with preparing mole-for-mole in-house mixes is that the
ionization efficiency for the ionization type used routinely in
proteomics&mdash;matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization or MALDI,
and electrospray ionization or ESI&mdash;is not identical for each and
every peptide.  Thus, if the ionization efficiency of angiotensin II
is 90%, meaning that 90 of the 100 molecules of angiotensin II embedded
in a matrix become ionized (or can be shown to be detected), and only
10% of the Glu-Fib molecules get ionized, then the peaks signals
representing the intensities values (the intensity of the ions) in the
final mass spectrum will differ between angiotensin II and Glu-Fib
by nine-fold!
<p>
Actually it is not possible to know exactly what the <i>absolute</i>
ionization efficiency (Eqn [1]) of any ion without making certain
assumptions that are not credible to make.  When the MALDI laser points at
a small spot within the well containing the sample on the target plate,
the absolute count of peptide molecules at the surface of the matrix bed
which are potentially activatable (ionizable) to neighboring matrix molecules is
difficult to know since the crystallization process does not result in a
homogeneous distribution of peptide molecules and matrix.  This is apparent
from the so-called formation of <q>sweet spots</q> that routinely typify
MALDI sample preparation.   In a single laser shot, the count
the number of ions detected by the mass spectrometer is certainly known,
but since the number of molecules that were subjected to the laser shot (the
denominator in Eqn [1]) is not known, the value cannot be determined.

<table class="eqn left-indented">
<tr><td rowspan="2" class="eqn-left-side">
absolute ionization efficiency =
<td class="numerator eqn-right-side">count of ions detected at single <i>m/z</i>
<td rowspan="2" class="eqn-num">[1]
<tr><td class="eqn-right-side">count of molecules at the <i>m/z</i> that were potentially ionizable
</table>
<p>
What can be determined is the <i>relative</i> ionization efficiency (Eqn
[2]).  This is basically the ratio of ion counts of any two ions appearing
in the mass spectrum.

<table class="eqn left-indented">
<tr><td rowspan="2" class="eqn-left-side">
relative ionization efficiency =
<td class="numerator eqn-right-side">count of ions detected at <i>m/z</i> of molecule A
<td rowspan="2" class="eqn-num">[2]
<tr><td class="eqn-right-side">count of ions detected at <i>m/z</i> of molecule B
</table>
<p>
But since the typical mass spectrum is a plot of the relative intensities against
the <i>m/z</i> values, then another expression of relative ionization efficiency
would be the ratio of one relative intensity to another (Eqn [3]):

<table class="eqn left-indented">
<tr><td rowspan="2" class="eqn-left-side">
relative ionization efficiency =
<td class="numerator eqn-right-side">relative intensity at molecule A <i>m/z</i>
<td rowspan="2" class="eqn-num">[3]
<tr><td class="eqn-right-side">relative intensity at molecule B <i>m/z</i>
</table>
<p>
It is important to determine relative ionization efficiencies of all molecules
(potential ions) within the same physical and chemical environment, and the
most accurate way is to mix them within the same matrix sample to be spotted.
<p>
A problem arises however when the relative ionization efficiences differ by more
than 100- and perhaps even 50-fold for molecules present in equal molarity
during sample preparation.  Relative intensities of molecules with a very low
ionization efficiency would produce insignficant counts under the conditions
used to generate a good spectrum when other molecules have a much higher efficiency.
<p>
This study attempts to determine the relative ionization efficiency of peptides
normally used in the calibration of the MALDI MS and to provide guidance in
preparing a mix of peptides that should show relative intensities sufficiently
close to each other so that calibration can be employed.

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>
So each of the five peptides was prepared individually at three different levels
(75, 750, and 3000 fmol) intended to detect the most to the least ionizable of
peptides.  Spotting on the target plate was done as it normally would be:
to keep consumables use to minimum, matrix in its solvent is spotted first,
then using the same tip, sample in equal volume is obtained and mixed on-plate
with the matrix.  Details of the mass spectrometry and sample preparation
are given in Materials and Methods and in figure legends.

<b>Figure 1</b>.  Mass chromatograms of angiotensin II spotted at two levels, 75
and 750 fmol, in triplicate wells on a MALDI target plate.  The top three
chromatograms are the 75 fmol wells, and the bottom three are 750 fmol.  The
time axis represents the amount of time it took to complete all the requested
scans for the MALDI target well.  Thus time zero is the point at which the laser
began firing on the well.  The laser was fired at 10 Hz (10 shots per second),
with single shot spectra collected;  10 single shot spectra were required to
obtain a summed spectrum or <q>scan</q>; thus each scan takes about 1 second to
acquire.  Scans are qualified then as <q>pass</q> or <q>fail</q> based on
certain criteria, which include seeing a base peak that exceeds a
signal-to-noise ratio and which is not saturating on the detector.  To complete
the scanning of a well, 20 <q>passing</q> scans are required.  At certain points
(representing <q>maxima</q> of the point-to-point plot) the time at which that
scan was obtained since the start of laser firing on the well is labeled.  Thus
for the 1st and 5th chromatograms, the 1st scan was obtained virtually
immediately (at 0.03 minutes, in the first second).  For the 2nd chromatogram,
it took 0.26 minutes or nearly 16 seconds (with 14 or 15 failing scans) to
obtain the first passing scan.  The value on the vertical axis represents the
relative intensity of the base peak of that scan to the scan that had the
highest base peak intensity (BPI).  Thus in the first chromatogram, the 100%
value on the vertical axis represents <b>1.71e3</b> ion counts or 1710 ions,
which was the absolute intensity of the base peak of the scan acquired at time
0.41 (the 3rd scan of the 20 scans in that plot).  Note the value of the 100%
level is show in scientific notation to the right of each plot.
