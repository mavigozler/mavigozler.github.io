<H2>Radiocarbon Dating in Archaeology and in the Earth 
Sciences</H2>&nbsp;<SUP><FONT size=-1>14</FONT></SUP>C dating with Accelerator 
Mass Spectrometry (AMS) has reduced the sample size by about 3 orders of 
magnitude. As long as only a few milligrams of carbon can be extracted from a 
sample, absolute ages for the last 10,000 years can be assigned with accuracies 
that can be as low as 50 years. The limiting factor for absolute ages further 
into the past is due to the tree ring calibration curve ending at around 10,000 
years BP. A major effort of our research is the extension of the radiocarbon 
chronology range using lake varve chronologies. A result of this work has been a 
better fixing of the so-called Younger Dryas, an event that signifies the last 
major cold event of the last ice age. <SUP><FONT size=-1>14</FONT></SUP>C is 
also measured in ocean water and sediments to improve the understanding of 
events associated with the termination of the last glacial. In some special 
cases it is not even possible to extract milligrams of carbon, e.g. from samples 
of polar ice cores, if a reasonable time resolution is still be desired. Recent 
developments have shown that samples of 50-100 micrograms can be prepared 
without a significant increase in preparation contamination.
