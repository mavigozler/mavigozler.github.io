<h1>Extraction and Staining</h1>
<p>
Some experiments or studies were done in the Proteomics Unit to learn
or gain a first-hand experience as to the effectiveness of certain
techniques reported in the literature.
<p>
We had been having some difficulties seeing spots on 2-D gels of extracted
sea sponge tissue, and we noted some irregularities with certain stains,
particularly during re-use.
<p>
So we conducted some studies to look at the effectiveness of both extraction
methods and use of different types of stains for the gels.  We found some
generally useful information which we report below.

</div>
<div class="imgdescription-right">
Although this image shows a gel with significant horizontal and vertical
streaking (and is, of course, unacceptable for publication), it nonetheless
still has information for our purposes.
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;" class="listAsHeading">
<li><b>Review of staining method</b>.  This is sort of a &ldquo;control&rdquo; 
gel, since Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 is a routine protein stain.  This gel 
is labeled extensively, and what is labeled should be well noted. The staining 
method is standard:  fix in 40% MeOH + 10% acetic acid to eliminate excess SDS 
and fix the proteins, and then stain with this same MeOH/AcAc solution 
containing 0.1% CBB R-250.  The Coomassie R staining not mass 
spectrometry-compatible though, so this is why it is not to be used if MS is to 
be done.
<li style="clear:both;"><b>Streaking and its Causes</b>.  As already noted, 
there are way too many vertical streaks and horizontal streaks.  The horizontal 
streaks are even apparent outside the lanes (all across the gel). Horizontal 
streaks in this case are caused by use of dirty reagents; in this case, old 
SDS-PAGE running (electrode) buffer was used and probably contained stainable 
contaminants.  The vertical streaking is usually caused by precipitated proteins 
or, most commonly, by failure to centrifuge the sample after boiling in SDS-PAGE 
Sample Buffer.   Not all materials go into solution when put in hot SDS-PAGE 
Sample Buffer (although certainly a great many things get dissovled under these 
rigorous conditions), and when they do not go into solution, it is necessary to 
spin the insoluble components out or else severe vertical streaking occurs, as 
seen in this gel.  It is very interesting that vertical streaks are very 
apparent in the MW standard (marker) lanes as well (lanes 1 and 10), because 
lane marker preparations are generally quite clean, with no insoluble elements 
when prepared according to manufacturer directions. It is possible that the use 
of dirty electrode buffer could have caused vertical streaking as well.

<li><b>Lane Protocol</b>.  Because of the streaking, it was necessary to 
demarcate the lanes using thin vertical green lines in the image. There are 15 
lanes.  Each lane is labeled at the top of the gel.  The MW values of the 
standard proteins are shown at the left of the gel.  The idea was to try to load 
50 &micro;g of total protein per lane, based on the concentrations determined 
using the Bradford assay for these samples.

<li><b>Review of the Extraction Method</b>.  Two types of tissue were used as 
samples for this gel:  one from rat organ (testes? liver?) and sea sponge inner 
tissue.  Both were ground into liquid nitrogen powders. Both the rat and sea 
sponge tissues were extracted with the Bio-Rad Sequential Extraction Kit, made 
up of three different chemical extractions used in a particular sequence.  The 
first extraction is with the R1 reagent, composed of just 40 mM Tris base 
containing protease inhibitors (the Roche Complete protease inhibition reagent). 
2.5 &micro;l of R1 reagent per milligram tissue powder was used in the 
extraction, and after rocking for 30-60 minutes, the extraction was centrifuged 
at maximum speed for 10 min in the microcentrifuge (14,000 rpm in the Beckman 
18, equivalent to 18,000 <i>g</i>).   The supernatant was collected and volume 
measured, and represents E1 (Extract 1).  The pellet was re-extracted with R1 
reagent a second time for 30 min on the rocker and centrifuged as before, and 
the supernatant is E2.  For the sea sponge sample however, before spinning the 
2nd extract, it was divided into two:  one half continues the Bio-Rad sequential 
extraction (non-G tube), while the other is the Vogel/Meyers guanidine 
extraction (the G tube).  The rat tissue was not subjected to guanidine 
extraction.

<p>
In continuing the Bio-Rad sequential extraction, the E2 pellet is extracted with 
the R2 reagent to produce E3 supernatant, and repeated again on the E3 pellet to 
produce E4 supernatant.  The R2 reagent is composed of 8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 3-10 
ampholytes, 2 mM TBP, and protease inhibitors. The E4 pellet is only extracted 
once with R3 reagent.  The volumes of R2 and R3 for each extraction are the same 
as the starting R1 volume.  The time of 30 minutes differs from the instructions 
of the Bio-Rad manual (I think they mention only 5 min rather than 30 min), but 
this is based on things I have read in the literature.
<p>
The guanidine extractions use 4 M guanidine hydrochloride in a 40 mM Tris base + 
protease inhibitor mix.  This is repeated again, producing the G- E3 and G-E4 
supernatants.  Note that the '4' in '4G-E3' means sample #4 and not '4 M 
guanidine'  (this is just a coincidence).  The final extraction (4G-E5) is 4 M 
guanidine HCl + 10 mM DTT in 40 mM Tris base + inhibitors.

<li><b>Looking for Stained Bands</b>.  Despite the heavy streaking,
the experienced eye can find information in a gel of this quality.
For example, bands can be clearly seen in the rat tissue series of lanes
because these bands do not extend across the width of the gel
compared with bands that do extend across the gel and represent
horizontal streaking.  The most protein seems to be extracted in the aqueous
extracts (2-E1 and 2-E2); it is impossible to say that E1 extracts contain
more protein than E2 or vice-versa, because the attempt was to load
all lanes with equivalent total protein rather than equivalent volumes.
It is only possible to determine relative amounts
of protein WITHIN lanes, and not BETWEEN lanes therefore.  The first
detergent extraction of rat tissue (2-E3) pulls out a rather high MW
protein (close to 200 kDa), and this protein continues to be pulled out
in subsequent extractions (2-E4 and 2-E5).

<li><b>Getting the Right Exposed Image</b>.
The region circled with a thick magenta-colored line at the lower right
of the gel shows a &ldquo;white-out&rdquo; or bleaching of the image,
usually an indicator that the image exposure selected was probably
not the best one.  Perhaps a review of photography is in order.
Read this <a href="ProteomicsReference.html#gelimage">section</a>
of the Reference in Proteomics for a review of the principles of photography
in imaging gels.

<li><b>Looking for Degradation</b>.  Look at the bottom of the gel.
It can tell a great deal.  Lower MW proteins migrate to that location.
The low MW standard of 21.5 kDa can be seen just above the &ldquo;dye&rdquo;
migration front, which means that polypeptides of 21 kDa and less
actually move with dye front.   If the average mass of an amino acid
is 113 Da, then a 21 kDa (21,000 Da) polypeptide will be about
185 amino acids long!  That is quite a sizeable polymer!!
The question we really want to know is if the extraction
method is causing protein degradation because of active proteases in the
mix.  The extraction includes inhibitors (but they are not always 100%
effective, and can be less effective if not handled properly).  It also
includes urea and detergents, which often denature active enzymes.  But
many proteases are very resistant to inactivation in these ways, so it is
essential to see if any sort of degradation is ongoing.  Generally one
sees very little or even a clearing in the high MW zones, and heavy
staining in the low MW zones.  This quite streaked gel does not suggest
any protein degradation is occurring with our handling of the samples.

</div>
<div class="imgdescription-left">
The image at right is of a gel loaded with the same protocol as the
first gel described above, so the streaking in the horizontal and vertical
directions is no surprise.  The major difference here is that
this gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 rather
than the R-250.  The stain is the
MS-compatible colloidal form of the dye, and so must be tested.  Because
the gel is so heavily streaked in both directions in the same was as the
R-250-stained gel, it is impossible to see all lanes very clearly.  Lanes
that can be identified have thin lime-green-colored lines drawn vertically
on the gel image to identify the lanes.  Because some of the stacking gel
comb walls were destroyed during comb removal, only 13 lanes (i.e. 2 of them
wide lanes because they represent two lanes each) were available at load
time.
<p>
After fixing the gel in ethanol/acetic acid and then leaving in water
overnight, the gel was first stained with previously used Bio-Rad's colloidal
Coomassie G-250 stain (the &ldquo;Bio-Safe&rdquo; product), but it did
not stain at all.  The reason for this was likely because prior staining
was done on gels which had not been well washed with water to remove excess
SDS.  Free SDS not washed out of gels after electrophoresis significantly
reduces the ability to re-use colloidal G stain.  The gel was then stained
with fresh (i.e., previously unused) colloidal G stain prepared according
to a recipe provided online from the proteomics unit at Max Planck Institute,
which seemed to work well enough.
<p>
There is only one marker lane on the left.  The lane identifications for
2-E1, -E2, and -E3 are certain because the staining of the lanes is
clear.  2-E4 and 2-E5 and a 2nd marker lane could not be loaded because
of the broken well walls.

 alt="36 second exposure of SYPRO Ruby-stained sea spong and rat samples">
<p style="margin-top:3em;">
In the images above (or possibly to the left), the proteins in
the samples of sea sponge and rat tissue extracts are now stained with
the fluorescent dye SYPRO Ruby.  Previously used stain was used.
The one gel is exposed (shutter kept open) for a little more than twice
as long.  This was done to reveal possibly more bands or better defined
bands representing relatively lower abundance proteins.
<p>
The bands in the lanes representing rat tissue extractions (lanes marked 2-E1, 
2-E2, 2-E3, 2-E4, 2-E5) of the 36 second gel compare well with the bands in the 
same lanes of the R-250-stained gel above. The marker lanes show distinct bands 
as well.
<p>
The sponge tissue extraction shows up fairly well too.  Much of the protein is 
extracted in the R1 extractions #1 and #2 (4-E1 and 4-E2). Some extractions is 
seen with R2 (4E-3 and 4-E4).  Very little shows up in 4-E5, the R3 extraction. 
We can also see a great deal of protein extracted in the first guanidine.
<p>
The extractions really need to be repeated to verify that these proteins are 
extracted in this way.  But the SYPRO Ruby staining shows that extraction of sea 
sponge has promise.
<p>
The absence of vertical and horizontal streaking is noted in these same samples. 
This is because care was taken to centrifuge samples and to use clean/fresh 
electrode buffer in particular.

 alt="Comparison of USED and FRESH Sypro Ruby exposed for same time (17 sec)">
<p>
After staining with the <em>used</em> SYPRO Ruby, it was logical to try to stain 
the same gel with <em>fresh</em> SYPRO Ruby instead. So the gel was stained for 
3 hours (according to Bio-Rad's instructions) in new SYPRO Ruby, then washed 30 
min in 10% MeOH/7% acetic acid and then placed in water.  The gel is shown in 
images above at 4.5 and 7 sec exposure.  With <em>used</em> SYPRO Ruby, an 
exposure for this short a time at the camera settings used (f/2.8, or wide-open 
aperture) could not have possible been visualized with shutter times of 4.5 or 7 
seconds. Unfortunately the gel had been broken into several pieces during this 
manipulation, so the pieces that could be found were imaged.  The smaller pieces 
could not assembled on the gel, so they were re-oriented by image editing 
instead.  Not all the pieces could be found, but most of the gel appears and 
provides evidence that fresh SYPRO Ruby clearly has a significant effect on 
visualizing the gel.
<p>
The real contrast between the effectiveness of fresh vs. used SYPRO Ruby is in 
the two 17 second shutter times below.  While 17 seconds is barely enough to 
visualize the gel stained with previously used stain, it is really an 
overexposure of the same gel re-stained with fresh stain.

The figure at left is a multi-frame image animation (animated GIF) that shows 
the difference in time of exposure of the FRESH fluorescence stain.  Note that 
the exposure time is labeled in each frame of the animation.
<p>
We will continue to examine the staining and extraction protocols and then 
hopefully move on to 2-D work for the sea sponge, mushroom, and so on.
<p>
For sea sponge we may need to obtain larger tissue sample, extract these by 
grinding in liq. nitrogen, do a two-prong extraction, and then concentrate the 
protein extracts, perhaps either by TCA or by centrifugal ultrafiltration.

alt="Coomassie R-250 staining after (on top of) SYPRO Ruby staining of a gel">
</div>
<p>
One question was whether dyes could be used on top of one another: that is 
whether a gel could be re-stained with a different type of dye of the proteins 
had already been stained with another.  For example, we were curious about 
whether Coomassie dye would stain proteins already stained with SYPRO Ruby, and 
so the broken pieces of the gel above were stained with Coomassie R-250 on a gel 
already stained with SYPRO Ruby (gel at below right).  In the gel image the 
colored lines and boxes correspond to the samples studied.  The boxed region in 
the color <span style="color:cyan;">cyan</span> and its lane markings correspond 
to sponge tissue extracted with the Bio-Rad Sequential Extraction series. It is 
clear that many bands show up but others do not clearly show up that were 
evident in the fluorescent staining.  The <span 
style="color:magenta;">magenta</span> box and demarcated lines corresponds to 
sponge tissue whose extraction in guanidine was continued. Little to no bands 
appear with Coomassie staining, but the fluorescent dye staining showed little 
to nothing as well.  In the <span style="color:yellow;">yellow</span> boxed area 
is the rat tissue samples extracted using the Bio-Rad sequence.  These show 
clearly delineated bands although the fluorescent staining shows much more. 
Green arrows indicate the marker lanes.
<p>
The difference in staining could have been due the well-known inherent 
difference in the sensitivity of these stains, with SYPRO Ruby being very much 
more sensitive than Coomassie dyes.  The question is whether SYPRO Ruby-stained 
gels interfere with Coomassie staining, and vice versa.  Before doing the 
Coomassie stain, the gel was thoroughly put in standard 40% MeOH/10% acetic acid 
fixative, which generally is effective in removing SYPRO Ruby.  No fluorescent 
image was taken, so it is unknown if the Coomassie staining eliminated the 
fluorescence, either because of washing out the SYPRO Ruby or quenching its 
fluorescence.

  alt="Comparison of time of Coomassie G staining of same gel, for 3 hours and overnight">
</div>
<p class="imgdescription-right">
Staining with colloidal Coomassie Brill. Blue G-250 is complicated by lots of 
different formulations, some proprietary, some variations on the original method 
of Neuhoff et al.  Among those variations is the use of different times.  Some 
laboratories have reported that in order to visualize low abundance protein 
spots on 2-D gels requires staining with colloidal G for 3 to 4 days, with 
changing of the dye with fresh material daily!
<p>
Based on these reports, we wanted to know if the particular colloidal G stain we 
were using showed a difference in time of staining.  The same gel was used in 
the staining.  On the left side of the image above is the gel stained for 3 
hours in colloidal G with water used to rinse out the background (the lane 
loading protocol is the same sponge and rat tissue samples as above). On the 
right side is the gel stained overnight and then again rinsed in water to 
eliminate background.  The question is whether the observer can detect any new 
bands with the longer staining.  Unfortunately, because the samples themselves 
do not show bands whatsoever, this experiment requires re-doing since the two 
gels do not look significantly different from one another (and thus we might 
conclude that 3 hours is enough, but a conclusion based on a not so ideal gel).

  alt="17% SDS-PAGE gel on sponge samples">
</div>
<p class="imgdescription-right">
Using those sponge samples from above, samples were then run on a 17% SDS-PAGE 
gel. A major reason for doing this is because some of the 10% gels, especially 
the streaked ones at the top, had significant staining migrating with the 
electrophoresis front (the tracking dye front). This usually indicates 
significant protein degradation in such samples. In the gel image at left (or 
above left), the markers clearly indicate that this is a very dense gel (a 14.4 
kDa marker running at the midlength of the gel is good proof of that).  The 
guanidine-extracted samples provide no information (since there is no protein at 
all).  The samples extact with Tris base only (reagent R1 in the Bio-Rad 
sequential extraction method) show a good even distribution of weight (at least 
in sample 2-E1), and thus little to no degradtion is evident here.  The same is 
generally true for the re-extraction of E1 (namely E2) samples. 2-E3 and -E4 
(the re-extraction of E3) are complicated by the presence of CHAPS and/or urea 
or thiourea, which distorts the lane appearance. The heavy stainin at the dye 
front is unlikely to be protein:  Coomassie dyes do not really stain low 
molecular weight peptides that well.  The dye could be reacting with something 
else present in the sample.

<p class="imgdescription-left">
In the gel image at right, pure proteins were mixed and an <i>E. coli</i> 
extract provided as part of a sample kit from Bio-Rad were analyzed in 
preparation for 2-D gel work.   The proteins were selected from what was 
generally available in the laboratory without any consideration of what their 
molecular mass was.
<p>
First the proteins were prepared individually at about 20-25 mg/ml dissolved in 
ultrapure water, and then aliquots of their preparation used to create a mixture 
(the &ldquo;protein mix&rdquo;). Bradford assays were done on all samples to get 
equivalent total protein loading.  Unfortunately the protein assay results were 
less than ideal (glucose oxidase could not even be determined).  Myoglobin (Mb) 
and hemoglobin (Hb) probably should not have been chosen since they are low MW 
proteins (polypeptide or subunit &lt; 20 kDa) and thus out of the range of the 
gel.  The <i>E. coli</i> extract shows an expected distribution; the stuff ahead 
of the dye front is probably due to the presence of CHAPS or urea/thiourea (or 
boy).  This gel was done essentially as the Coomassie R-stained control.

These are the test gels (above).  They have the same protocol as the Coomassie 
R-stained gel with respect to samples analyzed.  These gels are stained with 
colloidal Coomassie G however.   The one at left was stained with 
AMRESCO&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blue Bandit&rdquo; dye.  The gel is washed 15 min in 
water (according to instructions) and then stained overnight in the AMRESCO dye. 
The gel at right is the same gel which was subsequently stained with the Max 
Planck dye (a dye known to stain effectively). This re-staining with different 
dye was done to see the effectiveness of the AMRESCO dye:  since no bands truly 
emerge or increase in stained area or intensity, it can be concluded reasonably 
that the AMRESCO dye performs as claimed.

<h1>2-D Gel Studies</h1>
<p>
These 2-D gel experiments were part of a training regime, and several
things were additionally learned from these activities.
<p>
Two 2-D gels in the 7 cm size were done by the trainer.  One gel was given a 
sample that had a mixture of proteins sold as pure by Sigma-Aldrich. These 
proteins are listed in the table with their known or predicted pI and 
<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> values.

<!--
<ol>
</ol>
-->
<p>
The amount of pure protein mix loaded was somewhat arbitrary.  Adjustments
were made for some pure protein stocks based on the 1-D gel studies above.
<p>
The other sample was of an <i>E. coli</i> extract sold by Bio-Rad with their
starter kit for 2-D gel work.   The amount of sample loaded on IEF strip
was according to manufacturer directions.  It is reported to have a 1.35 mg/ml
protein concentration (the Bradford shows 1.7 mg/ml without accounting
for interferences).
