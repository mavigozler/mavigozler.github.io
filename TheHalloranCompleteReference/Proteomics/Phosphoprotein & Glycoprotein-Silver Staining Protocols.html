For serial staining, do the phosphate stain first, then follow it with the 
Moller &amp; Poulsen stain. 

<h1>Moller &amp; Poulsen Method of SDS-PAGE Gel Staining</h1>
<p>
[from <i>Anal. Biochem.</i> <b>226</b>: 371, 1995]
<p> 
This stain is supposed to be a total protein silver stain that does a better job 
of staining glycoproteins. <p> The following steps are performed at 30° with 
reagents prewarmed: 

<ol> 
<li>Fix the gel in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min 
<li>Wash gel twice for 2 min each in 5% acetic acid 
<li>Incubate gel in 1% periodic acid in 5% acetic acid for 20 min
<li>Wash twice for 2 min each in 5% acetic acid
<li>Wash twice for 2 min each in water
<li>Incubate in 0.5% potassium metabisulfite for 12 min
</ol>
<p>
The following steps are performed at 50° with reagents properly prewarmed:

<ol>
<li>Wash the gel twice with 25% EtOH + 10% acetic acid for 2 min each wash.
<li>Stain with 0.125% Alcian Blue in 25% EtOH/10% acetic acid for 15 min
<li>Wash the gel three times with 25% EtOH/10% acetic acid for 1, 4, and 5 min 
in that order.
<li>Continue with the silver staining process, omitting any first fixation 
steps.

</ol>

<h1>Specific Phosphoprotein Staining</h1>
<p>
(Cutter &amp; Roth) [Cutting JA, Roth TF (1973). Staining of Phospho-Proteins on 
Acrylamide Gel Electropherograms. <i>Anal. Biochem.</i> <b>54</b>: 386-394.
<p>
This stain is for phosphoprotein staining.  It is modified from Cutting &amp; 
Roth and is the basis of the Pierce Gelcode Phosphoprotein staining kit.  I 
recommend doing the specific protein stain FIRST, then following it with a total 
protein silver stain. 
<p>
For all steps but the heated  hydroxide step, agitate (shake) gently.
<ol>
<li>Preheat an incubation oven at 65°. A water bath produces poor results.  Put 
the 0.5 N NaOH reagent in it to preheat it. 
<li>Wash the gel for 10 min in ultrapure water. In all steps the gel must be 
submerged. 
<li>Discard the water and add 10% sulfosalicylic acid for at least 60 min 
agitating gently. 
<li>Discard the 10% SSA  and incubate in 10% SSA containing 0.5 M calcium 
chloride for 1 h or more agitating gently. 
<li>Rinse gel with lots of ultrapure water for no more than 30-60 SECONDS to 
eliminate any CaCl2 on the gel surface. 
<li>Quickly remove the discard rinse water.  Place gel in 0.5 N NaOH and then in 
the oven for 20-30 min.  There is NO need to agitate/shake the gel for this 
step. (Note: the gel swells with an increase in 10% of its volume, so use a tray 
large enough to handle the increase in size. Formation of a white precipitate is 
normal in this step.) 
<li>Rinse the gel in 1% ammonium molybdate for 10 min (use only enough to cover 
the gel, since this reagent is expensive;  recover the reagent in a “used” 
bottle…you might be able to use it once or twice more).  
<li>Repeat Step 7. Note this is done to remove traces of NaOH. 
<li>Put gel in 1% ammonium molybdate containing 1 N nitric acid (HNO3) and 
agitate for 20 min.  Recover the nitric acid-molybdate in a “used” bottle for 
possible re-use. 
<li>Place gel in 0.5% methyl green in 7% acetic acid and incubate for 20 min. 
<li>Destain with 10% SSA for about 15 min, and repeat the de-stain. Green 
phosphoprotein bands should be visible against the faint green background. 
<li>Continue destaining in 7% acetic acid overnight. 
</ol>
<p>
To do total protein staining, wash the gel three times with 100 ml ultrapure 
water for 10 min each.

<b>Rabilloud et al</b>

<ol>
<li><b>Fix</b>:  40% EtOH + 10% acetic acid, 3 x 30 min
<li><b>Rinse</b>:  20% EtOH, 10 min, then water for 10 min 
<li><b>Sensitization</b>:  0.3 g/L sodium dithionite, 1 min, then water 
twice for 1 min each (alternative to dithionite is 0.2 g/L hypo)
