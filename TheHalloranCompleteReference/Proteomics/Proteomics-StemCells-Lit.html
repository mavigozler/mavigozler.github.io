Establishment of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis profiles of
proteome from CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract</b>. <i>Article in Chinese</i>.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differential expression of proteins
in bone marrow (BM) and mobilized peripheral blood (MPB)
CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.
METHODS: Immunomagnetic beads were used to separate and purify
CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from the BM and the MPB mononuclear cells
(MNCs) mobilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
of normal subjects.
The whole cell proteins in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were extracted by freeze-thaw
lysis, and applied for two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE),
the results analyzed with image analysis software.
RESULTS: The average purity of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells was 92.33% &plusmn; 2.65%
in output, with an average cell number of (1.12 &plusmn; 0.42) &times; 10<sup>6</sup>.
2-DE techniques were optimized, which yielded satisfactory 2-DE
profiles of the proteome, showing the different expressions of
the proteins between different CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunomagnetic beads in combination with 2-DE is
applicable for research of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
proteome. There are differences in the protein expressions
between BM- and MPB-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.

Preliminary 2-D Chromatographic Investigation of The Human Stem Cell Proteome
<p class="abstract">
<b>ABSTRACT</b>.
Stem cells represent a promising tool for the treatment of various hematopoietic diseases. In order to identify stem cell-specific
proteins, the proteome of human stem cells from umbilical cord blood was explored for the first time. For this purpose, the crude
lysate of 4 &times; 10<sup>5</sup> CD34+ cells was subjected to in solution trypsin digestion. The resulting peptides were then separated via cation
exchange followed by reversed phase chromatography and analyzed by nanospray MS/MS. Database search revealed a total of 215
proteins which could be reliably identified. To obtain a more complete picture of the human stell cell proteome and to also access
low abundant proteins, pooling of more than one CD34+ preparations seems necessary in order to increase the cell number and thus
the protein content.

Proteomic Profiling of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell upon Transforming
Growth Factor &beta;1 Stimulation
<p class="Para1">
Bone marrow stem cells are nonhematopoietic pluripotent stromal cells
which can expand in culture and differentiate to osteoblasts, chondrocytes,
adipocytes, skeletal and smooth muscle cells in response to microenvironmental
cues.  TGF-&beta;1 are multifunctional proteins regulating growth,
differentiation, migration, ECM production.  TGF-&beta; increases smooth
muscle &alpha;-actin in MSCs, but will induce chondrocyte differentiation
in presence of dexamethasone or cell aggregates.  Thus the effect depends
on microenvironmental cues not understood.
<p>
Proteomics is a systematic approach for the quantiative and qualitative
mapping of the whole proteome.  2D-PAGE is done because of its ease of
use and rapidity.
<p>
Human bone marrow MSCs were purchased and characterized by the company:
positive for CD105, CD166, CD29, CD44; negative for CD34, CD14, CD45.
The company supplied the medium and FBS (MSCGM medium).  Detached expansions
of cells were washed with PBS with 1% BSA for 30 min, then FITC-conjugated
antibodies to CD14, CD34, CD45, CD105, and CD166 incubated for 30 min
before characterization on Beckman-Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer.
Antibodies to CD29 and CD44 were incubated for 30 min followed by 30 min
with FITC-conjugated 2nd antibody and then flow cytometry; negative controls
were cells incubated only with FITC-2nd Ab.  Antibodies and FITC-antibodies
came from many vendors (Santa Cruz Biotech, BD Biosci, Chemicon, Serotec,
BIOSOURCE, and Molecular Probes).  Sigma TGF-&beta;1 at 10 ng/ml was
used for treatment (5 and 20 ng/ml were tried with same effect).  Medium
was changed every 2-3 d for longer incubations.  For immunostaining and
confocal work, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS 15 min,
permeabilized with 0.5% TritonX-100 in PBS 10 min.  Antibodies to gelsolin,
&alpha;-actin, and FLAG tag were incubated 2 h and then FITC- or rhodamine-conj.
2nd for 1 h.  F-actin was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin 30 min.
The Leica TCL SL confocal with Ar and He/Ne laser, a scanner and the Leica
DM IRB microscope were used.  Projection planes were 0.3 &micro;m thick.
Immunoblots were prepared in cells lysed with 25 mM TrisHCl pH 7.4,
0.5 M NaCl, 1% TX-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 10 &micro;g/ml leupeptin, and
1 mM sodium vanadate; with supernatants run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to NC
membrane, blocked (3% nonfat milk), and primary Ab incubated in Tris-buffered
saline with 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.1% BSA; goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
IgG-HRP with ECL detection used.
<p>
Cells passaged and expanded up to 10 times were used.  MSCs at passage 10
were positive for CD105, CD166, CD29, and CD44 but negative for CD14, CD45,
and CD34, indicating no change in phenotype.  Cells cultured 2 weeks
in chondrogenic medium became rounded and synthesized large amounts of
glycosaminoglycans, indicating chondrogenic potential.  Cells in osteogenic
medium for 2 weeks stained with Alizarin Red indicating matrix mineralization.
<p>
Cells were treated long term with TGF-&beta;.  After 2 d, MSC show a more
polygonal broad shape with myoblast-like morphology and which was maintained
by 6 d.  The fibrous-like appearance stained positive for actin filaments
and thick fibers.  Immunoblotting indicated a quantitative increase
in &alpha;-actin while total actin was not changed;  tubulin expression
was seen to be constant (internal control).  TGF-&beta; was seen to affect
SM &alpha;-actin and SM-22&alpha; at transcriptional level.
<p>
Proteome characterization involved 2D-PAGE and characterization of select
silver-stained proteins, determined by treated and untreated cells.
1500 spots were resolved (confidence &gt; 95%), and 60 showed up- or
down-regulation by &gt;2-fold in triplicate studies of 4-day treated cells.
30 of the spots were selected for identification using in-gel digestion
and LC-MS/MS on Q-ToF API US from Waters.  The LC system was a
20 &micro;l/min with pre-concentration on 300 &micro;m &times; 5 mm
PepMap C18 (Dionex) with peptides eluted to 75 &micro;m &times; 15 cm
PepMap C18 analytical.  Buffer A is 3% MeCN + 0.1% formic acid and Solvent
B is 95% MeCN + 0.1% FA; the program is loading with Solvent A and
elution with 3-40% gradient of Solvent B over 35 min at 0.25 &micro;l/min,
achieved by flow splitting pumps A and B running at 8 &micro;l/min.
A PicoTip emitter (New Objectives) was used to direct eluent to ESI source.
The MS had source temp of 100&deg; with 40 V on the cone; the PicoTip
was set at 2000 V.  The ToF was in V mode.   Calibration was of
Glu-fibrinopeptide B fragment ions obtained by CID.  MS/MS were obtained
by directed data acquisition mode in which peaks with <i>z</i>= +2, +3, +4
with highest intensity were selected for CID, collision energies set
at 10 and 30V for MS and MS/MS scans.  The NCBI nrdb (non-redundant database)
with masses from 1000-500,000 Da and pI 3-10 were selected; modifications
set for Cys (carbamidomethylation), N-terminus (acetylation), N-Gln (to
pyro-Glu), Met (oxidation), and Ser/Thr/Tyr (phosphorylation).  Predicted
MW and pI of the 30 spots using Z3 program agreed with theoretical values
(&plusmn;10%).  Proteins affected by TGF-&beta; include cytoskeletal
proteins gelsolin, T-plastin (and an isoform), &gamma;-actin and
&alpha;-cardiac actin. A series of annexin molecules (cell membrane bound).
Matrix synthesis proteins:  collagen-binding protein 2 precursors and isoforms.
Metabolic enzymes change include GA3P DH, thioredoxin reductase, malate DH,
Tyr-tRNA synthetase.  TGF-&beta; also modulates post-translational
modifications, e.g. HSP27 phosphorylation at Ser-82.
Both ProteinLynx and MASCOT agreed on protein
spot identity and scoring; two peptides were sequenced with good MS/MS
spectra.  Some spots had more than one protein co-migrating.
<p>
Gelsolin expression was reduced by TGF-&beta; according to the 2D gel.
Gelsolin severs actin, disrupting the cytoskeleton, but having roles in
cell motility and apotosis.  Its role in differentiation is unknown.
A time course study indicates expression falling off with 4-6 d growth factor
treatment.  qPCR was used to study transcriptional regulation.
After 24 h, gene expression decreases by 50% for gelsolin, with &alpha;-actin
up 4-fold.  At 48 h, the trend continues, indicating TGF-&beta; alters
both proteins through transcription.  Immunocytohistochemistry of 4 d
treated and untreated cells shows gelsolin in untreated cells co-localized
with actin (a weak background in cytoplasm).

Stem Cell Proteomes: A Profile of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived
From Umbilical Cord Blood
<p class="abstract">
<b>ABSTRACT</b>.
Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human umbilical cord blood
(UCB) represent promising candidates for the development of future strategies in cellular
therapy. To create a comprehensive protein expression profile for UCB-MSCs, one
UCB unit from a full-term delivery was isolated from the unborn placenta, transferred
into culture, and their whole-cell protein fraction was subjected to two-dimensional
electrophoresis (2-DE). Unambiguous protein identification was achieved with peptide
mass fingerprinting matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization  time of flight  mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), peptide sequencing (MALDI LIFT-TOF/TOF MS), as
well as gel-matching with previously identified databases. In overall five replicate 2-DE
runs, a total of 2037 6 437 protein spots were detected of which 205 were identified
representing 145 different proteins and 60 isoforms or post-translational modifications.
The identified proteins could be grouped into several functional categories, such as
metabolism, folding, cytoskeleton, transcription, signal transduction, protein degradation,
detoxification, vesicle/protein transport, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and
calcium homeostasis. The acquired proteome map of nondifferentiated UCB-MSCs is
a useful inventory which facilitates the identification of the normal proteomic pattern as
well as its changes due to activated or suppressed pathways of cytosolic signal
transduction which occur during proliferation, differentiation, or other experimental
conditions.
