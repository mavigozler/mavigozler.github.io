<h1>Aligning The Spot Cutter</h1>
<p>
There are many calibrations that the Bio-Rad Proteome Works Spot Cutter Plus 
must go through.
<p>
Perhaps the most important one is the alignment of where the user designates
the cut mark and making sure that the cutter cuts at that position.
<p>
When the cutter is not initially aligned, it is necessary to align it by
staining a 25 &times; 25 cm sheet of PVDF membrane in Coomassie Brilliant
Blue R-250, and then placing it on the cutting mat.  The PDQuest software is
then told to acquire an image using the spot cutter's camera, and then the
cutter cuts a grid of 5 holes &times; 5 holes.  The backlight in the platform
bed of the cutter is then turned on and the camera acquires the image.  That
image is then sent to the software so that it understands the coordinate 
positioning of the cutter.
<p>
One of the major headaches of this process is that one does not get another
chance if the cutting of the large sheet of Coomassie-stained PVDF goes wrong.
And many things can go wrong!  These are the things that can go wrong:

<ul>
<li>The Coomassie-stained sheet is not dark enough to provide contrast for
the PDQuest cutting calibration routine to visualize the holes; yes, this
has been a problem before.
<li>One of the 25 holes was not cut and removed...yes, it only takes one!
This is the REAL headache!
<li>The sheet somehow moved during the cutting: less of a chance of that if 
the sheet is placed on the cutting mat and not allowed to stay on it too long
before the cutting calibration commences.
</ul>
<p>
This section will not talk about how to calibrate the cutting position since
that is detailed in the Bio-Rad manual.
<p>
Instead, this shows how to confirm the cutter's cutting position is calibrated
and aligned.

<h2>Verifying or Confirming the Alignment/Calibration of the Cutter's 
Positioning</h2>
<p>
The image below is of the 1D (SDS-PAGE) gel used in this example.  It
was imaged with the VersaDoc 1000 with the ruler.  The ruler was used to 
help set the gel dimensions in the <b>Image Info</b>.  This is explained
in another section of the Proteomics Reference.
<p>
For doing manual excision, it does not appear to be necessary to set the
gel dimensions.  But if the gel image is processed for spot detection and
matching and into an analysis set that determines spots for cutting, it is
necessary to set gel dimensions.
<img src="imagesSpotCutterPlusHTML/versadocGel.jpg" class="image" 
 alt="1D gel with ruler as imaged in VersaDoc 1000">
<p>
So the gel was placed on the platform bed of the cutter and the camera
of the cutter was used to visualize the gel.  Using the zoom-in features,
the parts of the gel to be cut were marked:  usually the cut marquee rectangle
is larger than the 1 mm cut diameter, so multiple cuts are specified if the
multiple cuts option is set to greater than 1.  In this case it was set to the
maximum (11).
<p>
Below is the image shown as PDQuest presents it when the spot cutter camera 
takes the image.  That is, it is fully zoomed out and the whole platform is 
seen.  In this case, the cut marks are also seen, indicating that the zoom out 
was done to show the whole platform although the cut marks had already been 
specified.  Clearly the cut marks and the gel details are barely discernable
when the image is fully zoomed out.
<img src="imagesSpotCutterPlusHTML/ZoomOutCutMarkedGel.jpg" class="image" 
 alt="Spot cutter camera image after cutting (not zoomed-in)">
<p>
Thus it is necesary to zoom in to see the gel detail and see the cut marks. In 
the image below, four cuts were specified (click on the image to get a larger 
image in the original resolution in a new window).  The cuts are specified by a 
format of <b>plate number, well number</b>, where the plate is the 96-well 
microplate, and well number has the format <b>Row</b><i>Column</i> where 
<b>Row</b> is a letter from <b>A</b> to <b>H</b> for the eight rows of a 96-well 
microplate, and <i>Column</i> is from <b>01</b> to <b>12</b> for the twelve 
columns for a 96-well microplate with twelve rows.  So the cut designated 
<b>1,A01</b> will go to microplate 1 (the first microplate which should probably 
be written with a <q><b>1</b></q> somewhere on the plate using a Sharpie, and 
the gel cut(s) will all be put in well <b>A1</b>.
<img src="imagesSpotCutterPlusHTML/ZoomInCutMarkedGel.jpg" class="image"
 alt="setting up the cut marks: zoomed-in area of gel to show cut marks">
<p>
Note in the last sentence of the previous paragraph that the phrase <q>gel 
cut(s)</q> were used.  That is because a cut mark can have a large area into 
which more than one cut hole can fit within that area.  The cutter is a metal 
cylinder, and two types of cylinders can be fit:  one with a 1 mm diameter and 
the other with a 1.5 mm diameter.  The user has to know which one is fit. In 
this case, a 1 mm diameter cutter is fit, so the blue circles all indicate a 1 
mm-sized cut hole.  Since the cut mark was drawn with a large area, the PDQuest 
software tried to fit as many 1 mm cut holes as possible in the area. If the 
multiple cut option is set to 1 (that is, no multiple cuts in a designated cut 
mark or cut area), then only one cut hole will be specified, and it will be 
positioned as the center of the rectangular area designated for the cut.   In 
our case, the maximum multiple cuts of 11 were indicated, so up to 11 cut holes 
will be given.  In the case of the area designated for cutting, only 9 cut holes 
could be specified, and so nine cuts will be made and all of the cuts will be 
placed into well A1 of the first microplate.  That point must be understood. All 
multiple cuts are placed into one well.  This can be good thing, because it 
increases the sensitivity of detecting a protein if the protein is present in 
the gel in abundant amounts and it is absolutely not mixed in with other 
proteins in the stained region/band/spot of the gel.
<p>
The image below shows the image taken by spot cutter camera <em>after</em> all 
the cuts have been made.  This is called a <q>confirmation</q> image where the 
PDQuest software makes a request of the user to take this image to confirm the 
cuts having been made.  This image shows the whole platform and cannot be 
discernable.  So it is necessary to zoom in to the image to get the right 
detail.  This is done in the next image below.
<img src="imagesSpotCutterPlusHTML/ZoomOutConfirm.jpg" class="image" 
 alt="Spot cutter camera image after cutting (not zoomed-in)">
<p>
In the image immediately below, the area where there cuts occurred is a zoom-in 
on the image immediately above.  Without clicking on the image to get a bigger 
image at original resolution, white holes in a pattern similar to the cut marks 
are seen in three cut designations:  the 9-hole cut mark in the large band that 
is present in lane 2, the 7-hole cut mark in the band in lane 4, and the 3-hole 
cut mark at the bottom edge of the gel also in lane 4.  Not clearly seen in the 
single-hole cut mark designated in a band also in lane 4.
<p>
Thus it would be necessary to see the image very  much zoomed in by clicking on 
the image in the web page to get the larger image. When that is done, it seems 
evident that there is no cut mark.
<p>
What makes it difficult however to know if a cut occurred or not is that the 1 
mm cut hole is about the size of an image pixel.  To perceive any image object 
or artifact well, an object must really be bigger than a 3&times;3 pixel size.
<p>
But there is another means by which one can make sure that the gel cuts
were made or rather obtained, and this is explained after the image below.
<img src="imagesSpotCutterPlusHTML/ZoomInConfirm.jpg" class="image" 
 alt="confirming the cuts:  zoomed-in area showing gel after cutting">
<p>
Bio-Rad tells the spot cutter users to place the microplate on the gel 
platform&mdash;if possible, without moving the gel already sitting 
there!&mdash;and to take an image of the plate.  During excision of gels by use 
of analysis sets (not manual excision), the software offers this opportunity to 
the user, and it should definitely be taken.  The image below shows why. The 
image clearly shows stained cut gel pieces in the well in the numbers that would 
be expected.  Whether or not a cut was successful on the gel, the important 
thing is, did the cut gel piece make it into the microplate well?
<p>
For well A1, nine pieces were to be cut.  For well A2, three pieces were to
be cut.  For well A3, one piece is expected, and for well A4, seven pieces are
expected.  In A1, A2, and A4, what is expected appears to be seen.  For well
A3, it appears there is a drop of water rather than a single gel piece.
See below the image about how to deal with this.
<img src="imagesSpotCutterPlusHTML/MicroPlate.jpg" class="image" 
 alt="96-well plate which shows cut gel pieces in some of the wells">
<p>

If the image of the microplate wells do not confirm or verify what is expected
for many of the wells with respect to the cutting of the gel, then be sure to 
note this in the laboratory book.  Continue processing normally in most 
cases&mdash;for example, reductively alkylate (if necessary), do the 
protease (trypsin) digestion, and recover the peptides for mass fingerprinting
on a MALDI&mdash;but consider that no mass spectrum will be seen for the
exceptions.
<p>
Of course, it is possible, either in the manual or analysis set excision
mode, to repeat the cutting for cut marks that were clearly not cut.
<p>
In some rare cases, the gel holes are evidenc and the gel was cut, but
the gel pieces are not in the microplate wells.  How does that happen?
Well, the gel piece fell out the cutter during the transport of the cutter
from the cut site to the microplate well.  
<p>
Why?
<p>
A good reason may be that your gel has been soaked in a buffer containing 
glycerol.  All gels set up for cutting should really be soaked several times
in Type I (or distilled) water to remove anything that should not be in the 
gel.  That would include glycerol, organics (methanol or ethanol), and
acids (acetic acid).  Indeed, acids and especially alcohols shrink the gel
and this creates the possibility of making gel cuts that mix proteins
where that is unwanted.
