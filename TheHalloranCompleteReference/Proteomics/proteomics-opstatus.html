Operational Status

<hr>
The table below shows the operational status of the Proteomics Unit
within the Central Laboratory of the Ankara University Biotechnology
Institute:

<table style="margin-top:2em;" id="opstatus">
<tr><th>Functional Area   <th>Status
  <th>Date of Service<span class="red">*</span>
   <th>Required Sample
<tr><td>1st Dimension, or Isoelectric Focusing (IEF),
 	of Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2DGE)
  <td><div class="green">OPERATIONAL</div>
  <td>February 2005
  <td>Concentrated protein mixture extracted in
	protein-protecting (anti-proteolytic,
	anti-post-translational-modifying) chemicals.  Total protein depends
	on scale of preparation, strategy (general profiling or analysis
	of low abundance proteins), and physicochemical properties (e.g.,
	solubility of proteins in IEF) of target proteins within
	preparative technologies.  For miniature scales, at most 200 &micro;g
	total protein, up to several milligrams at the larger scales.
	Sample concentration should be 5-50 &micro;g/&micro;l.

<tr><td>2nd Dimension, or Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide
   Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), of 2DGE
  <td><div class="green">OPERATIONAL</div>
  <td>February 2005
  <td>Proteins separated in a single dimension by isoelectric focusing
with separation zones stabilized by appropriate media (polyacrylamide)
and loadable on to top of a 2nd dimension gel.

<tr><td>Immunoblotting (Western Blotting)
  <td><div class="green">OPERATIONAL</div>
  <td>February 2005
  <td>Proteins separated on a polyacrylamide gel, whether denatured or
non-denatured.  The gel containing proteins separated on a native

transfer.

<tr><td>2D Gel Documentation
  <td><div class="green">OPERATIONAL</div>
  <td>February 2005
  <td>one or more 2D polyacrylamide gel stained by identical methods
to illuminate well-resolved protein spots for optimal comparison of
multiple gels by spot analysis software;  identical methods for
staining are probably not an absolute requirement, although the gel
analysis software might operate less optimally

Mass Spectrometric-Related Analysis
 <td><div class="green">OPERATIONAL</div>
 <td>November 2004
 <td>Purified protein with minimum mass of 10 pmol, especially if
protein sequencing is expected.  Protein can be purified by any means.
Protein can be gel-purified, that is a stained spot cut from a gel;
there is no need to destain or extract the protein from the gel.

  <td>Possibly by March or April 2005 for some services
  <td>partially purified proteins or peptides; physical and chemical

<h1>Notes</h1>

<h2>SDS-PAGE</h2>
The standard Laemmli gel can also be used as a single dimension by itself,
both as an analytical and preparative technique.  As an analytical tool
it provides information about relative molecular mass of single
polypeptides (subunits in multimeric proteins).  It can also be used as
preparative technique for immunoblotting (Western analysis) and
peptide mass fingerprinting.

<h2>Native (Non-Denaturing) Gel Electrophoresis</h2>
All equipment and reagents typically used in 2DGE can be used to prepare
non-denaturing or native gels.  Native gels of two or more polymer
percentages that show only one stained protein band in a sample
definitively establish the homogeneity (purity) of the sample.
Moreover shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of proteins can be
used as indicators of protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions.

<h2>Protein Purification by Bio-Compatible Chromatography</h2>
The Bio-Rad BioLogic DuoFlow system is available for those wanting to
perform protein purifications.  This system shows the same capabilities
as the old Pharmacia FPLC system, for those familiar with this system.
The system has the following features:
<ul>
<li>DuoFlow pumps:  syringe pumps able to deliver up to 10 ml/min flow
[pressure limit of 3500 psi (250 bar)]
<li>Columns are replaceable cartridges
containing polymerized (non-particle) continuous-bed matrix [UNO
monolith] gels, with balance of resolution and high flow rates
(rapid separations)
<li>Bio-compatible plumbing:  all tubing and wetted (but non-wettable)
surfaces are non-metallic and made of materials known not to cause
denaturation or loss of biological (enzyme) activity
<li>Controlled injection and loading, with 50 &micro;l and 1 ml sample
loops available
<li>Detection of eluting proteins by ultraviolet selectable for
254 or 280 nm
<li>Detection of salt gradients by sensitive conductivity meter
<li>Collection of fractions with BioFrac fraction collector
<li>Easy user interface:  both manual and programmed modes for defining
the chromatographic run are extremely easy to learn, and data
collection is organized in a hierarchy by defining runs within projects,
and projects specific to users.
