<h1>Start-Up and Operation</h1>

Here is a general checklist provided by Waters for the CapLC power-up
sequence:

<ol>
<li>Check that the compressed air or nitrogen gas supply is at 35-45
psi on the pump.
<li>Verify the connections of cables
<li>The MassLynx PC should be on and MassLynx running.  Open up
the Inlet interface.
<li>Turn on the two power switches on to the CapLC pump and the autosampler.
The power switch on the pump is on the front of the pump, under two green
LEDs.  The power switch on the autosampler is on its back.  The autosampler
will make some noises in diagnosing itself, and the pump will begin homing
its syringes.
<li>Open the Diagnostic page from the Inlet interface.
<li>There may be a message indicating that the pump syringes are homing:
this procedure takes about 4-5 min.
<li>The CAP LC pump makes two long beeps.
</ol>

The daily startup of the CapLC system involves the following steps:

<ul>
<li>Wet priming all pump lines for 5-10 cycles
<li>Checking the injector syringe on autosampler for air bubbles
</ul>

Then equilibrate the column.

<h2>Dry Priming</h2>
Dry priming is required when introducing any solvent into the fluid
path when it is empty (air-filled).  All dry priming is done with
methanol (MeOH) which has been degassed by sonication.
<ol>
<li>You should have a syringe (10-20 ml) of good fluid-tight quality
and a steel tubing with a compression fitting/ferrule on one end
<li>Remove the plug at the front of the pump tray manifold
</ol>

<h2>Solvent Switchovers</h2>
<ol>
<li>Draw up solvent from inlet filter to manifold
<li>Dry prime the line for 20 cycles while pulling solvent through with
a syringe and adaptor connected to waste port of pump line
<li>Wet prime for 25 cycles (90 min)
<li>Again check injector syringe on autosampler for air bubbles
<li>Equilibrate the column
</ol>

<h2>Stand-By/Overnight Conditions</h2>
Waters recommends that a small flow be maintained in the pumps at all
times during relatively constant use.  Set all pumps to flow at 2 &micro;l/min.
The Stream Select valve should be set in the &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo;
position with 50% organic solvent running through it.

<p>
When not running the pumps over a long period, put the pumps in
a 50:50 mix of water:organic solvent, and store columns in 100% organic.

<h2>Errors/Exceptions</h2>
The pump module has two LEDs.  The Run light reports the following states:

<table>
<caption>Meaning of Pump Run LED Appearance</caption>
<tr><th>Appearance   <th>Pump Status
<tr><td>Off          <td>Pump is idle
<tr><td>On           <td>Pump is running a method
<tr><td>Fast Blinking<td>Communications between Pump and software (MassLynx)
    has been interrupted
<tr><td>Slow Blinking<td>The Pump reports an error
</table>

<h2>CapLC Status</h2>
The CapLC has several status indicators for solvents, valves, and detectors.
Red colored indicators show a Not Ready condition.  Click on the red control
to see the error message.

<p>
A yellow colored indicator shows that the injector is being made
ready.

<p>
A green colored indicator indicates a Ready condition.

<h2>Reset Communications</h2>

The CapLC Inlet and Diagnostics windows have a menu command
<b>Reset Communications</b>.  Use this command whenever the following
has happened:

<ul>
<li>The setup has changed
<li>After an ABORT has been used
<li>After any error reported by the pump, once the error has been fixed
<li>To stop a Wet Prime operation (Dry Prime operations cannot be stopped
by resetting communications)
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes the <b>Reset Communications</b> command fails to restore
proper communication.  In that case, trying opening the <b>Task Manager</b>
(by pressing the ctrl, Alt, Del keys simultaneously), and close down
the Diagnostic window (under the Applications tab) and a process
called <b>InletKernel.exe</b> under the Processes tab.  Attempt to
reboot MassLynx if that fails.  And reboot everything, including the
EPC, if necessary.

<h2>Priming Pumps</h2>
Dry priming must be done when the pump lines have air in them.  This
usually occurs if they have been sitting for a while without operation.
<p>
Dry priming is usually done with an organic solvent (HPLC-grade methanol)
and can be done with only one pump at a time.  The sequence for dry
priming is as follows:

<ol>
<li>Use the syringe and adaptor to draw up solvent from the inlet filter
to the pump manifold.
<li>Connect the syringe/adaptor to the waste port of the 10-port valve
of the pump line to be primed.
<li>Set the dry priming in software for 20 cycles (about 5 min).
<li>Do a wet prime when switching over to another solvent.
</ol>



<h2>Autosampler Priming</h2>
The autosampler wash syringe will need priming too.  Put on a bottle of
methanol on the wash bottle.  Run a fill/empty or wash to get the syringe
wet.  Replace with a solvent identical to solvent A, and repeat washing.

<h2>Solvent Filtering</h2>
Waters recommends filtering any unfiltered solvents through &le;0.45
&micro;m membranes.  The CapLC also features an in-bottle frit with
10 &micro;m porosity; design of these has been improved to ensure eluent
passes through the frit.

<h1>CapLC Systems, Modules Components</h1>
The Waters CapLC is composed of the following components:

<ul>
<li><b>Autosampler</b><br>
 <ul>
 <li>Able to sample 1.5 ml vials, 1.5 ml conical tubes, and 96- and 384-well
      microtiter plates
 <li>Contains wash station to rinse needle and tubing to prevent
    sample carryover
 <li>Has 6-port, 2-position injection valve
 <li>Temperature-controlled (heater and cooler) sample plate holder
 </ul>
<li><b>Pump</b><br>
 <ul>
 <li>Three pump system with one solvent from each pump
 <li>Ternary solvent system with isocratic and gradient delivery
 <li>Has a 10-Port Valve to control solvent flow
 </ul>
<li><b>Stream Select Module</b><br>
 <ul>

 </ul>
<li><b>Trolley/Cart</b><br>
 <ul>
 <li>Provides portability to CapLC
 </ul>
<li><b>Software Interface</b><br>
</ul>

The CapLC is primarily designed to interface with an ESI-MS (such as
the QToF) and not used preparatively (to a fraction collector).

<h2>Pump</h2>
Each pump present in the Pump module is composed of syringes working
in a reciprocating fashion to provide some continuous flow,
with one aspirating solvent while the other delivers it.
<p>
Four-port valves are present in the pump to change position depending
on pump state:  delivery, intake, and pre- or de-compression of solvent.
<p>
The <b>pump tray manifold</b>  connects each solvent reservoir to a
valve/pump syringe pair on the intake stroke, and a valve/pump-syringe
pair and the vent valve on delivery stroke.
<p>
Pump heads have a stainless steel frit on the outlet ferrule that filters
the solvent.
<p>
Transducers are present in each pump syringe system to sense pump head
pressure.
<p>
A pump is composed of a tray with two syringe pumps, each driven by
high resolution stepper motor.  A single step delivers 10 picoliter volume
for a total of 2,048,000 steps in a 20.5 &micro;l syringe volume.
The syringe moves 6.2 nm per step for a total distance of a bit more
than 1.25 cm.
<p>
The pump valve requires nitrogen or compressed air in order to operate.
Usually this is teed-off from the nitrogen line going to the MS.
A regulator or pressue guage should be between the Tee and the gas fitting
inlet on the CapLC pump.  6 mm tubing fits into the pump inlet fitting.
The pressure on the air/nitrogen should be 35-45 psi.

<h3>Column Heater</h3>
The pump has a place to place the column inside a column heater.  Up
to two 150 mm long columns can be placed, with maximum diameters of 13 mm.
The heating range is 5&deg; above ambient up to 65&deg;.
<p>
The column heater is below the cover <em>above</em> the solvent bottles
and <em>below</em> the 10-port valve and solvent lines.

<h3>Software Control/Connection</h3>
The CapLC pumps are connected to the computer operating the
MassLynx software through an IEEE 488 card (this card is built-in
on the CapLC pump and must be installed through the PCI slot on the
computer).  MassLynx operates the CapLC pump through its Inlet
Method interface.  All operations related to the pump are programmed
through the Inlet interface, including equilibration and gradient
methods.
<p>
The pump flow rate can be set from 0.0 to 40 &micro;l/min, in steps
of 0.01 &micro;l/min (10 nl/min, or 10 nanoliters per minute).
Thus nano-scale columns with flow rates between 100-500 nl/min can
be set without the use of a flow splitter.
<p>
The pump is also connected to the mass spectrometer (Q-ToF <i>micro</i>)
through contact closures that indicate the inject event.

<h3>Active Check Valve Replacement</h3>
The active check valve regulates flow to and from syringes.  During
refill the valve opens for intake and during flow, it switches open
to the eluent pathway from syringe to system.  The valve sees pressures
of 5000 psi at times.  Life of the valve is good for about 5000 of these
cycles in typical mobile phases, which is one year of use assuming
operation at 5 &micro;l/min for 8 h/d, 5 d/week for a 52-week year.
Service involves valve rotor replacement in the field  Newer check valves
have a longer life in excess of 4 times that previous cycles life.


<h2>Autosampler</h2>
The autosampler features a wash/rinse system for the needle sampling
system.  The needle is composed of an outer hollow needle for puncturing
and an inner fused silica capillary sample needle for sample transport.
<p>
The autosampler is controlled through MassLynx software by an RS-232-C
(serial) connection between the MassLynx PC and the autosampler.
The COM port (usually 2) needs to be selected from the MassLynx
interface in User or Service Diagnostics.
<p>
The Autosampler connect to the StreamSelect module through a parallel-type
connector.  Control of the StreamSelect with MassLynx software interface
occurs through the Autosampler.  This should be configured in
User Diagnostics from the MassLynx Interface:  select the checkbox
<b>Stream Select Valve</b>, and then make sure the <b>Autosampler</b>
radio button is selected.

<h2>Stream Select Module</h2>
PEEK tubing extends from the autosampler outlet to the Stream Select
Module (SSM), carrying solvent from pumps A and B to the pump vent valve
to the mixing T on the SSM.  Teflon tubing encloses the terminal ends
of fused silica lines as a shim/sleeve.
