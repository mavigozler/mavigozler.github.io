<h1>General Considerations</h1>
<p>
The instruments in the MS room&mdash;Q-ToF <i>micro</i>, M@LDI-LR, and 
CapLC&mdash;require some user maintenance and performance checking at regular 
intervals.
<p>
Details of the mass spectrometers are given below.

<h2 id="caplc-notes">Notes on the CapLC</h2>
<p>
The CapLC is a high resolution HPLC system connected to the Q-ToF <i>micro</i>: 
it provides the LC function in the LC-ESI-MS/MS system that we have, while the 
Q-ToF <i>micro</i> provides the ESI-MS/MS function.  It is composed of two units:
an autosampler and pump modules.  The autosampler sits on top of the pumps.  The 
autosampler has its own power switch on the back of the unit (with fuses as part
of the socket), as does the pump module, whose switch is on the front.  The autosampler
must be turned on even if only the pumps will operate, because the software communications
that control the pumps is also through the autosampler.  The pump module is composed
of three pump modules:  A, B, and C.  Generally pumps A and B produce the gradient
to the LC column, while pump C is used to deliver sample from a vial in the autosampler
on to the LC column, after which, a valve switch then takes the flow from pumps A and
B.
<p>
In order to maintain the CapLC properly, it must be under a 
<strong>constant</strong> flow of solvents in pumps A, B, and C <em>even when it 
is not in use</em> during experiments.
<p>
The CapLC pumps do <strong>not</strong> operate by electricity alone:  they are 
all gas-actuated, which is why there is a small nitrogen tank with gas tubing 
going into the back of the pump module.  The pressure to the pump module should 
be 45 psi.
<p>
For the constant flow of solvents that must be maintained, HPLC-grade water is 
necessary for pumps A and C, and HPLC-grade methanol (MeOH) is used for pump B 
(which is primarily used for organic phase).  The Institute must therefore 
maintain its own supply of HPLC water and MeOH.
<p>
The total flow rate maintained for the three pumps is 12 &micro;l/min, 
and the flow is distributed 34% A, 33% B, 33%  C, or 4 &micro;l/min for each pump.
This means that a total of about 4.2 L HPLC grade water is used by pumps A and C
each year.  Pump B will use 2.1 L HPLC grade MeOH in a year.  Since all reservoir
bottles are only 100 ml in volume, this means that the volume will last about two
weeks (15-17 days) at a flow rate of 4 &micro;;/min from that bottle.
<p>
It would be useful if the Institute sets aside the purchase of solvents for the 
CapLC in its budget.  The Institute should write on the bottle "For Institute 
Use ONLY" (in the customary Turkish) to discourage those from using it for their 
projects wrongly.


<h1>Reagent Preparation</h1>
<p>
Many of the reagents used especially for mass spectrometer maintenance routines 
are common for the many routines.  Follow the instruction below for preparation 
and use.

<h2>Notes on Conservation of Resources:  Pipet Tips</h2>
<p>
In another document, it has been discussed that the smart scientist knows how to 
get maximal use out of the liquid handling consumables he uses.

<ol>
<li>In general, when using pipet tips, think about how the pipetting is to be
done first.  Imagine the operation in your head.
<li><b>To get maximal use of a pipet tip, WORK FROM CLEAN TO DIRTY</b>.  This
means that if a simple dilution is to be made with water, first pipet the
water, and then if possible (that is the same tip size or scale can be used),
then pipet the solution to be diluted.  Only one tips is used.
<li>Improper carryover of concentrated solutions from diluted solutions to
a new dilution can be avoided by flushing transferred contents up and down in
a pipet several times.
<li>Imagine that the money for consumables was coming out of your pocket.
(In a way, it does.)  Decide what you can <q>live with,</q> and what
you can't live with (that is, where you must absolutely use a new consumable).
</ol>

<h2>Water</h2>
<p>
Only use LC- or MS-grade bottled water.
<p>
At the moment, do not trust the Milli-Q gradient water coming out
of the water purifier.  Its feedwater is abominable, and the maintenance
of purification system questionable at the moment.  This is on a to-do
list.

<h2>Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)</h2>
<p>
For MS use, we use so little TFA, so we buy them in the ampules.  These
should be of the highest quality.
<p>
If making up solvents in several liters for milliliter-per-minute scale
HPLC, buy TFA in bottles in a volume that you use in a 6-month period,
because generally that TFA will probably have to be thrown out six months
after opening.  Calculate wisely.
<p>
If bought in bottles or ampules that are never opened, generally the TFA
lasts for years if kept cool and in the dark.

<h3>Breaking Open an Ampule</h3>
<ol>
<li>First obtain one of the vials we use for HPLC-MS.  This is the
12&times;32 mm transparent glass vial with PTFE-lined screw cap.
(This is not the best storage container, but will do for the moment.)
<li>Crack open the TFA ampule.  You may want to do this in a fume hood
if you are sensitive to TFA vapors and if seeing the cloudy vapors
scares you.
<li>Carefully decant all the contents to the glass vial.  Generally
if the ampule is turned completely upside down toward the end of transfer and
the ampule moved round its broken edges, full transfer is possible.
<li>If there is still is more TFA remaining in ampule, use a P-100 or
P-200 pipet with yellow tip to transfer it.
<li>Screw on the cap firmly but do without too much force (the caps are
not made of the strongest material).
<li>Store at a cool (even 4&deg;) temperature when not in use.  Discard
what remains if not used in 3-4 months.
</ol>

<h3>TFA Stock Solutions: 10% and 1%</h3>
<p>
Generally you will want to make dilutions in water using the same glass
vial containers used to which you poured the pure contents from the ampule.
Store these stocks in the same place as the 100% TFA vial.
<p>
To make 10% stock:
<ol>
<li>To the glass vial, add 450 &micro;l of water.
<li>To the vial, add 50 &micro;l of pure (100%) TFA.
<li>Store in cool or cold dark place when not in use.
</ol>

<p>
To make 1% stock, first prepare/obtain 10% TFA stock:
<ol>
<li>To the glass vial, add 450 &micro;l of water.
<li>To the vial, add 50 &micro;l of 10% TFA.
<li>Store in cool or cold dark place when not in use.
</ol>
<p>
When using to prepare MALDI samples, to minimize the preparation of diluted TFA 
stocks and the volumes that remain, calculate how much volume of either the 10% 
or 1% stock is required.  Then prepare about 1.5 &times; that volume as the 
stock to be used.
<p>
For example, you determine that you will need 15 &micro;l of 10% TFA, and 800 
&micro;l of 1% TFA.  This means you will make 25 &micro;l (rather than 22.5 
&micro;l) of 10% TFA, and 1.0 ml of 1% TFA.  To make 1.0 ml of 1% TFA, we need 
100 &micro;l of 10% TFA, so we will first make 100 + 25 &micro;l of 10% TFA. At 
the end of the procedure, you can decide whether to discard what is left; if so 
make it in polypropylene conical tubes.  Otherwise, if you keep it, make it in 
glass vials.

<h3>Acetonitrile (MeCN)</h3>
<p>
This solvent has become extremely expensive.  (Here's <a
href="http://www.dddmag.com/article-hunt-for-acetonitrile-alternatives-031809.aspx">why</a>.)
<p>
It is therefore important to calculate your needs before preparing solutions in 
excess of what you need.  If you prepare solution at more than twice the volume 
of what you need, and must discard it, something is seriously wrong with your 
scientific abilities.  If you need help in computing your needs, ask an expert: 
the office door is open.

<h3><q>Solvent</q></h3>
<p>
The standard <q>solvent</q> used in preparing samples for mass spectrometry on 
MALDI or ESI usually contain 50% MeCN.  For the MALDI, the standard solvent is 
50% MeCN + 0.1% TFA.  For the ESI, it is 50% MeCN + 0.05-0.1% formic or acetic 
acid.

<h4>MALDI <q>Solvent</q></h4>
<p>
The 800 &micro;l volume is a quick useful volume if needs are not to be 
rigorously calculated.
<ol>
<li>Obtain a clean 1.5 ml conical polypropylene tube
<li>Add 400 &micro;l of MeCN to it.
<li>Add 80 &micro;l of 1% TFA.
<li>Add 320 &micro;l of water.
<li>Invert several times or vortex gently.
<li>Replenish as needed.
</ol>

<h3>MALDI Matrix / CHCA Solution</h3>
<p>
A saturating solution is the best in all cases.  CHCA is generally saturating at 
20-30 mg/ml in MALDI solvent.  A 10 mg/ml CHCA (not saturating) is also 
convenient and often specified by others.

<ol>
<li>Obtain fresh, dry recrystallized 2-3 mg 4-hydroxy-&alpha;-cyano <i>trans</i>-cinnamic
acid (CHCA) in 0.5 or 1.5 ml conical tube.  You should know the exact weight!
(See methods for making recrystallized aliquotted solid matrix).
<li>Per 1 mg of dry matrix, add 50 &micro;l of acetonitrile (MeCN).
<li>Sonicate this solution briefly to make a fine powder.  It may or may not
completely dissolve.
<li>If making solution with 0.1% TFA, add 10 &micro;l of 1% TFA per
1.0 mg of dry matrix.  If making solution with 0.05% TFA, add 5 &micro; of 1% TFA
per 1.0 mg of dry matrix.
<li>If making solution with 0.1% TFA, add 40 &micro; of water per 1.0 mg of
dry matrix.  If making solution with 0.05% TFA, add 45 &micro; of water
per 1.0 mg of dry matrix.
<li>Sonicate 30-60 s.  The matrix may or may not have completely dissolved
<li>If the matrix is not dissolved, spin it down hard in a microfuge
at maximum speed for 10 min.  There is no need to transfer supernatant to
new tube:  when pipetting, do not disturb the pellet with tip.
<li><i>Quick alternative</i>:  add 100 &micro;l of <q>Solvent</q> per 1.0 mg dry matrix
and sonicate well.
<li>This shall be called Tube <b>CHCA</b>.
</ol>

<h3>MALDI Matrix / Sinapinic Acid Solution</h3>
<p>
Used for proteins &gt; 10 kDa.  Prepare this for MALDI Linear mode maintenance 
test.
<ol>
<li>Only use the highest quality (HPLC- or MS-grade) water.
<li>Prepare 100-200 &micro;l of 1% TFA in a 0.5 ml conical tube or take
from a HPLC glass vial if stored there.
<li>Obtain fresh, dry 2-3 mg sinapinic acid in 0.5 or 1.5 ml conical tube.
You should know the extact weight to the nearest 0.1 mg.
(See methods for making recrystallized aliquotted solid matrix)
<li>Follow steps for preparing CHCA from step 4 forward.
<li>This shall be called Tube <b>SA</b>.
</ol>

<h3>ACTH 18-39 MALDI Lockmass Solution</h3>
<ol>
<li>Obtain two or three 0.5 ml conical tubes.  Label one <q>20 pmol 
ACTH/&micro;l</q>.  Label another <q>1 pmol ACTH/&micro;l</q>. If preparing 1 
pmol/&micro;l as a final tube for spotting, then put a red circle on the cap 
and/or underline the text in red or another pen color.  This indicates that the 
ACTH contains matrix.  (Do this for all tubes containing matrix.)  If the final 
tube is less than 1 pmol ACTH/&micro;l, obtain another tube and label its 
concentration.
<li>Add 38.5 &micro;l water to the <q>20 pmol/&micro;l</q> tube.
<li>If the 1 pmol/&micro;l tube is the spotting tube, then calculate X = count 
of wells to be spotted &times; 1.2.  If X &lt; 9, then make X = 9.  If the 1 
pmol/&micro;l tube is not the final spotting tube, calculate X = count of wells 
to be spotted &times; 2.4.  If X &lt; 18, then make X = 18.  Now add X &micro;l 
of MALDI solvent to the 1 pmol/&micro;l tube.
<li><b>Skip to the next step if the final spotting tube is 1 pmol/&micro;l</b>.
To the final spotting tube, calculate Y = count of wells to be spotted
&times; 1.2.  Y &lt; 10, them make Y = 10.  Calculate D as
the dilution factor:  if the final concentration is 250 fmol/&micro;l,
then dilution factor is 1 pmol/&micro;l / 250 fmol/&micro;l =
1000 fmol/&micro;l / 250 fmol/&micro;l = 4.  Now add MALDI solvent
to the tube:  0.5 &times; [ Y &minus; (Y / D) ] &micro;l.  If the final
volume is 20 &micro;l and final concentration is 500 fmol/&micro;l,
then this is 0.5 &times; [ 20 &minus; (20 / 2) ] = 5 &micro;l.  <b>Note</b>:
never try to calculate a pipetted volume to less than the P-20 minimum
accurate volume of 2.0 &micro;l:  adjust your parameters to make this true.
<li>Obtain 1 mg/ml ACTH 18-39 stock in water (see section below for
preparation).
<li>Obtain CHCA matrix solution (see section above for preparation).
<li>Transfer 2.0 &micro;l of 1 mg/ml ACTH to the 20 pmol ACTH/&micro;l
tube.  Mix/vortex gently.
<li>Calculate Z = (0.1 / 0.9) &times; X.  Now transfer Z &micro;l
from the 20 pmol ACTH/&micro;l to the 1 pmol ACTH/&micro;l tube.  Immerse
tip and flush up and down well.
<li>If the 1 pmol ACTH/&micro;l is the final spotting tube, add
(Z &times; 10) &micro;l of CHCA matrix to that tube.  Otherwise add
(Z &times; 10) &micro;l of MALDI solvent to the tube.  Mix/vortex gently.
<li><b>Skip to the next step if the final spotting tube is 1 pmol/&micro;l</b>.
Calculate Z = (0.1 / 0.9) &times; Y.  Now transfer Z &micro;l of
1 pmol ACTH/&micro;l to the final spotting tube.  Finish by adding (Z &times; 10)
&micro;l of CHCA matrix to the tube.  Mix/vortex gently.
<li>From the final tube, spot 1 &micro;l to each well.  Try to use this solution
within the same day as preparing it.  ACTH breaks down in CHCA/TFA within a
couple of days, even stored at cold temperature.
<li>Let air dry in an environment with no breeze.
</ol>


<h4>1 mg/ml ACTH 18-39 Stock</h4>
<p>
ACTH 18-39 should be prepared as a 1 mg/ml solution in water. The peptide can be 
purchased from Sigma at 0.1 mg (100 &micro;g) or 1 mg, usually.  Resuspend to 1 
mg/ml in HPLC- or MS-grade water:  to the 0.1 mg vial, add 0.1 ml (100 &micro;l) 
water, or to the 1 mg vial, add 1.00 ml water.

<hr id="maintenance-part">
<p>
The maintenance schedule for instruments in the Proteomics Unit is organized by
period:  
<a href="#daily">daily</a>,
<a href="#weekly">weekly</a>,
<a href="#monthly">monthly</a>,
<a href="#semiannual">semi-annually</a> (every 6 months),
<a href="#daily">annually</a>


<h1 id="daily">Daily</h1>

<h2>QToF-<i>micro</i></h2>
<p>At least once a day (at the end of the day), or better at least
twice a day (at the start and end of the day), do the following:
<ul>
<li>check that the Q-ToF micro is in Operate mode
<li>check that voltages are applied to the ToF tube and the
MCPs
<li>check the vacuum levels to see if they are normal
</ul>
<p>Keep an eye out for appearances, odors, or sounds apart from the usual.
At the end of the day, turn off

<h2>M@LDI-ToF (MALDI-ToF)</h2>
<p>At least once a day (at the end of the day), or better at least
twice a day (at the start and end of the day), do the following:
<ul>
<li>check that the M@LDI-ToF is in Operate mode
<li>check that voltages are applied to the ToF tube and the
MCPs
<li>check the vacuum levels to see if they are normal
</ul>

<h2>CapLC</h2>
<p>
It might be a good idea to check once a day on a tour through the MS room that
the maintenance flow (12 &micro;l/min) is ongoing and that no error condition
has occurred.  While several error conditions are possible, the typical ones will be
a lost prime in one of the pumps.

<h2>MassPREP</h2>
<p>
[this instrument is not operational because the cost of consumables is
ASTRONOMICAL, and for this reason, no one uses it;  which means it should have
never been purchased by the idiots who requisitioned it]

<!-- WEEKLY -->
<h1 id="weekly">Weekly</h1>

<h2>QToF-<i>micro</i></h2>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum pump gas ballast:	the electric pump requires venting weekly.
 <ol>
 <li>Put the Q-ToF micro into Standby, and set the ToF tube and MCP voltages
  to zero
 <li>Without shutting down the vacuum pump, open the gas ballast port
   all the way (turn counterclockwise all the way)
 <li>Leave this for 20-30 min (not less than 20 and not more than 30 min!!)
 <li>Tighten the gas ballast port cap
 <li>Put the Q-ToF micro back into Operate, and restore the voltage slowly
  to the ToF tube and MCPs
 </ol>
</ul>

<h2>M@LDI-ToF (MALDI-ToF)</h2>
<p>
Check the voltages and the vacuum.  If the M@LDI-LR has not been used for some time,
set the detector voltage at 1000 V, which is less than its operating voltage of
1850-2000 V.  Use an IPR file to set, rather than manual mode.

<h2>CapLC</h2>
<p>
Not weekly, but about every two weeks, the volume on one or more of the solvent
bottles for pump A, B, or C will start getting low.  When the fluid level comes to
the point of the inline fritted plastic filter, it would be useful to re-fill the
bottle(s) that is/are low.  Obtain the correct solvent and refill just below the 
bottom of the neck of the solvent bottle.   Pumps A and C bottles <em>require</em>
HPLC grade water;  do not use the MilliQ gradient water, as its quality is really
questionable.  Use only commercially purchased bottled water.  Pump B bottle requires
HPLC grade methanol (MeOH).
<p>
When re-filling the bottle, the flow of the pump whose bottle to be refilled must
be stopped.  While it is possible to stop flow to <em>all</em> the pumps with the
<b>Flow Off</b> command, do not use it.  Instead, shut off flow to only the pump
whose bottle is to be changed.
<p>
How is that done?  The <b>Inlet Method</b> window should already be active: 
bring its window forward.  If it is not opened, look at the MassLynx windows 
with the Tools menu options active and select <b>Inlet Method</b>.  There are 
three tools in the left panel:  <b>Status, Inlet</b> and <b>Autosampler</b>. 
The <b>Status</b> panel window reports the current values such as total flow of 
all pumps, column temperature, pump distribution as a percentage of the total 
flow, and valve positions.  The <b>Inlet</b> panel window, allows the user to set
the values for the things in the Status window.  
<p>
To stop the flow in pump A, refill its bottle, and restart the flow in pump A:
<ol>
<li>in the Inlet panel window of the software, set pump B and C to 50%, or set 
one of the pumps to 67%.  Note that no pump A setting is possible:  its 
percentage is determined as 100% &minus; the sum of the settings of pumps B and 
C.  
<li>Click the icon on the toolbar above to upload the settings to the CapLC (an 
icon on the toolbar above).  
<li>Select the "Yes" (or "OK") button to saving the changes to the inlet method.
<li>Click the Status panel window to make sure that pump A shows up as 0% while flow
is still occurring.
<li>On the CapLC, unscrew and refill bottle A with HPLC grade water, and then 
screw it back on.
<li>Go back to the Inlet window, and reset pumps B and C to 33%.
<li>Click to upload the change in method, say "Yes" to the
alert, and again verify the changes, with A being 34%, and B and C both 33%.
</ol>
<p>
For refilling bottle of pump B:
<ol>
<li>Go to the settings window described above for pump A, but set the B pump to 0%.
<li>Upload the method change, and check the status window as described in the next
three steps for bottle A.
<li>Refill bottle B with HPLC grade MeOH.
<li>Follow the rest of the steps for resetting %B to 33 and restarting the pump.
</ol>
<p>
For bottle of pump C, the same method changing to stop and start flow is done
and the bottle is refilled with water.

<!-- MONTHLY -->
<h1 id="monthly">Monthly</h1>

<h2>QToF-<i>micro</i></h2>
<ul>
<li>Inspect the oil in the vacuum pump.  It should be clear and at the proper
level.
</ul>
<p>BOC Edwards states that the vacuum pump oil requires changing after 3000
hours of operation.  That's about 125 days, or every 4 months.
The MS should be put in Standby, and then the system vented with nitrogen.
The vacuum pump is then shutdown, allowed to cool, the oil drained and
replaced, the oil mist filter replaced and then the pump turned back
on and the Q-ToF system vacuum restored before putting the voltages back
into operating mode.

<h2>M@LDI-ToF (MALDI-ToF)</h2>
<p>
Do a weekly check.  It might be useful to check the oil in the rotary pump.


<h2>MassPREP</h2>
<p class="warning">
[this instrument is not operational because the cost of consumables is
ASTRONOMICAL, and for this reason, no one uses it;  which means it should have

<div class="dimmed">
<ul>
<li>Deck Calibration:  the <i>x,y,z</i> positioning of the probes on
the arm need calibration for both the standard deck and the extended
deck.  See the details of the
<a href="MassPREPGuide.html#deckcalibration">deck calibration method</a>.
</ul>
</div>

<!-- Every Six Months -->
<h1 id="semiannual">Semi-Annually</h1>
<p>
Before conducting the performance qualifications on resolution, mass
accuracy, sensitivity, and function (protein identification), the mass spectrometers
must be properly conditioned and calibrated.  Calibration should be with the
mix of five synthetic peptides or better with tryptic peptides of a pure
protein (yeast ADH, BSA, or appropriate other substance).


<h2>QToF-<i>micro</i></h2>
<p>
[  ]

<h2>M@LDI-ToF (MALDI-ToF)</h2>
<p>At installation, the M@LDI-LR went through a performance or operational
qualification before it was signed over for use.  This needs to be
done at least every six months to make sure that the MS is operating as
it should for proteomics work.
<p>
Obtain the following peptides and proteins in the table shown below

<h3>Reflectron Mode</h3>
<p>
Resolution, mass accuracy, and sensitivity are tested.

<h4>Pulse Voltage</h4>
<p>
At least once every 6 months, and ideally once every 3 months, perform the
pulse voltage optimization to achieve maximal resolution in reflectron mode.
Use a peptide like ACTH or Glu-Fib or Renin-14 peptide to perform the optimization.


<h4 id="reflectron-resolution">Resolution</h4>
<p>
Do the following:
<ol>
<li>Put on gloves and a laboratory coat.  NEVER HANDLE target plates,
or liquid handling instruments and consumables for MALDI use without
gloves.  If you have long hair, tie it to the back; or better, wear
a head cap.
<li>Obtain a Micromass stainless steel target plate not bent
and with at least three clean wells.
<li>Obtain fresh CHCA matrix solution:  prepare according to
steps above.
<li>Make sure the M@LDI-LR is ready:  MCP detectors are conditioned
and voltages are at operational level.  Flight tube vacuum (Penning)
should be &le; 2e&minus;6, but better if &le;1e&minus;6.  Resolution
is strongly affected by vacuum.
<li>Obtain a calibrated P-100 or P-200, P-10, and P-2; yellow tips
(2-200 &micro;l) and tips for the P-2 (0.1-2 &micro;l)
<li>Turn on the particle-free laminar-flow hood and place all
materials and pipetting instruments inside it.
<li>Prepare 10 pmol ACTH 18-39 / &micro;l in CHCA matrix:

<h4>Mass Accuracy</h4>
<p>
Do the following:
<ol>
<li>Put on gloves and a laboratory coat.  NEVER HANDLE target plates,
or liquid handling instruments and consumables for MALDI use without
gloves.  If you have long hair, tie it to the back; or better, wear
a head cap.
<li>Obtain a completely clean MALDI target plate.  It must absolutely show
excellent plate flatness.
<li>Obtain a calibration set:  this can be a 5-peptide mix or it can be
tryptic peptides of yeast ADH or the like.
<li>Obtain Renin-14-peptide stock at 1 mg/ml in water.
<li>Prepare ACTH as an external lockmass solution, as described above.
<li>Prepare CHCA matrix solution (Tube CHCA) as described above.  (If you
prepared it from another test, you can use that.)
<li>Prepare solvent (50% MeCN + 0.1% TFA) as described above.  (If you
prepared it from another test, you can use that.)
<li>Obtain two 0.5 ml conical tubes.  Label one <q>20 pmol/&micro;l Renin-14
peptide</q> (or maybe <q>20 pmol/&micro;l R14P</q>) and label the other <q>1
pmol/&micro;l R14P</q>.
<li>Obtain a P-20 and P-100 or P-200 pipets.  Set the P-100
or P-200 to a volume of 54.8 &micro;l.  Pipet 54.8 &micro;l <em>water</em> into
20 pmol R14P/&micro;l tube.
<li>Transfer the yellow tip to the P-20 pipet.  Set the P-20 volume to 18.0 &micro;l.
Pipet 18.0 &micro;l of <em>solvent</em> to the tube <q>1 pmol/&micro;l R14P</q>.
<li>Set the P-20 volume to 2.0 &micro;l.  Transfer 2.0 &micro;l of 1 mg/ml
R14P (in water) to the 20 pmol/&micro;l tube.  Flush up and down a few times
to mix it all in.  Now mix (vortex) the tube gently.
<li>Transfer 2.0 &micro;l from the 20 pmol/&micro;l tube to the 1 pmol/&micro;l
tube.  Again flush up and down a few times to mix in.  Then mix/vortex the tube
gently.
<li>Obtain a new 0.5 ml conical tube.  If you prefer, label it
<q>R14P-matrix</q>. Keeping the same yellow tip from the previous step, set the
P-20 volume to 10.0 &micro;l, and transfer 10.0 &micro;l of 1 pmol R14P/&micro;l
to the empty tube.

  alt="MALDI target plate spotting for mass accuracy"
 style="float:right;width:65%;margin:1em 0 1em 1em;">
Using a new yellow tip (or the one you used in CHCA tube preparation),
transfer 10.0 &micro;l of CHCA matrix solution to the tube above.  You should
have 20.0 &micro;l of 500 fmol R14P/&micro;l with matrix.
<li>On the MALDI target plate, put 1 &micro;l in eight (8) wells that form two
single lockmass pentads (see figure).  These are the yellow-colored
wells in the figure.
<li>Spot ACTH lockmass in the lockmass wells colored red in the illustration.
The amount of ACTH can be from 100 fmol to 1 pmol per well, as long as the
signal:noise is &gt; 10:1.
</ol>
<p>Note that if you followed these instructions correctly, you used only two
yellow pipet tips and three conical tubes to achieve the preparation desired.
<p>
The mass accuracy at installation was 30.70 ppm when using external lockmass
correction, and 4.55 ppm when using internal lockmass corrrection.

 </ul>
<li>Add 2.0 &micro;l of 1 mg/ml Glu-Fib stock (in water) to the
10 pmol/&micro;l tube.  Mix/vortex gently.  When done using, store
the 10 pmol/&micro;l tube with the other stocks.
<li>Using same pipet tip, transfer 2.0 &micro;l fromo the 10 pmol/&micro;l
tube to the 100 fmol/&micro;l tube.  Mix/vortex gently.  Store this when
done only if the tube will be used within two weeks.

<li>Put the MALDI in negative ion mode.  Acquire spectra manually or
using an automated run for the 10 fmol Glu-Fib wells.
<li>Combine at least a dozen spectra, background subtract (polynomial
order 10, 40% of points below curve), smooth (Savitzky-Golay with two

<li>Produce spectra which magnify the baseline on either side of
the Glu-Fib peak.  Show that the magnified baseline amplitude is at
an even height with Glu-Fib intensity, and that Glu-Fib exceeds 5:1.
Magnifying a portion of the spectrum is done by holding the Shift key
down, and dragging the mouse cursor horizontally in the range to be
magnified while hold the left mouse button down.  To change the
magnification, double-click within the currently magnified region
(at 2&times;) and enter a value in parameter <b>Zoom</b>.
</ol>

<h4><a id="funcperform"></a>Functional Performance</h4>
<p>Do the following:
<ol>
<li>Obtain or prepare yeast ADH tryptic peptides.  To prepare:
 <ol>
 <li>Add 40 mg NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (ammonium bicarbonate) to
a 1.5 ml tube, and add 1.0 ml distilled water.
This is 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>.
 <li>Resuspend (WITHOUT FOAMING!!) yeast alcohol dehydrogenase [CAS 9031-72-5]
(e.g. from Sigma A8656) to 10-20 mg/ml in high-grade water.
 <li>Prepare trypsin at 1 mg/ml in 25 mM acetic acid.  (If you
use the Promega brand sequencing grade with 20 &micro;g lyophilized
trypsin per vial, do not add the 50 mM acetic acid reconstitution buffer!)
 <li>To a 1.5 ml conical tube (Tube A), add 40 &micro;l of 10 mg/ml
or 20 &micro;l of 20 mg/ml yeast ADH stock.  This is 400 &micro;g
of yeast ADH (~10 nmol monomer).  Bring Tube A volume up to 40 &micro;l (with water)
if it is less than 40 &micro;l.
 <li>If using trypsin in solution and not the Promega vial as source
of trypsin:
  <ol>
  <li>Add 30 &micro;l of water to Tube A.  It should now be
70 &micro;l.  Do not mix.
  <li>Add 10 &micro;l of 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> to Tube A.
  <li>Add 20 &micro;l of 1 mg/ml trypsin.  Mix gently but well.  Avoid
   foaming.
  </ol>
 <li>If using the Promega lyophilized trypsin:
  <ol>
  <li>Add 10 &micro;l of 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> to Tube A.
  <li>Add 25 &micro;l water to the Promega lyophilized trypsin vial.
 Reconstitute gently (no foaming).  Transfer it to Tube A.
  <li>Add another 25 &micro;l water to the Promega vial as a second wash
  and mix with the vial to recover as much trypsin as possilbe.  Transfer
  the entire volume to Tube A.
  </ol>
  Tube A should now have 100 &micro;l of yeast ADH with trypsin in a
 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer.
 <li>Place in a 37&deg; water bath (immersed to 1-2 mm below cap) or
  in 37&deg; oven with parafilm tight around it.  Avoid cooling on top
   which causes distillation.
 <li>Leave for overnight (or at least 4-5 h).  For the first 4-5 h, agitate
  the tube a couple of times every 90 min.
 <li>Let the reaction cool, then add 900 &micro;l water, mix well.
Total volume should be 1000 &micro;l, containing 1 nmol/ml or
1 pmol/&micro;l of peptides.  Aliquot this as 25-50 &micro;l per aliquot and
store in the deep freeze.
 </ol>
 <li>Add 2 &micro;l of 10 pmol ACTH 18-39/&micro;l stock to 18 &micro;l of
0.1% TFA. Label this tube <b>ACTH-1</b>.  Contains 1 pmol ACTH/&micro;l.
 <li>Take 5 &micro;l from <b>ACTH-1</b> and add 95 &micro;l of CHCA
 matrix.  Label this tube <b>ACTH-CHCA</b>.  This tube contains 50 fmol
ACTH/&micro;l.
 <li>Add 5 &micro;l of <b>ACTH-CHCA</b> to another tube, then add
5 &micro;l of CHCH matrix:  spot 1 &micro;l per well to 6 lockmass wells
forming a row which covers 2 rows &times; 12 wells for 24 wells.  The
external lockmass wells contain 50 fmol ACTH per well.
 <li>Remove an aliquot of yeast ADH peptides from freezer and thaw.
For the test, a minimum of 24 consecutive wells or 24 &micro;l of
50 fmol/&micro;l peptides is necessary for both external and internal
calibration check, or 48 wells, about 3 pmol total mass of peptides
used.  To conserve peptides, take 6 &micro;l (about 6 pmol) from the tube
and re-freeze. (Re-aliquot to keep freeze-thaw cycles to 3-4 at most.)
Add the 6 &micro;l to a tube marked <b>ADH</b>.  Add 54 &micro;l of solvent
(50% MeCN + 0.1%TFA) to the tube.
 <li>Add 25 &micro;l ADH to 25 &micro;l of CHCA matrix, and dispense
1 &micro;l to each well of the two rows of 12 wells which have ACTH spotted
in the external lockmass well.
 <li>To another clean tube, add 25 &micro;l <b>ADH</b> and 25 &micro;l
 <b>ACTH-CHCA</b>, mix well, and spot 1 &micro;l from this solution to
  another two rows of 12 wells for the internal lockmass calibration.
  Do not spot the external lockmass well.
  Each well for the internal calibration should contain 50 fmol yeast ADH peptides and 25 fmol ACTH
  internal lockmass.
 <li>Set up two automated sample runs created through PLGS and examine the
results of the internally and externally calibrated runs.  Each well should
be correctly identifed as yeast ADH (accession number P00330), with at least
5 peptides matched, 15% sequence coverage, and at the highest confidence
(green-colored wells on PLGS).  Identification time should be
less than 1 minute for each well.  The search parameters should include
a 0-100,000 Da mass search.
</ol>

<h3>Linear Mode</h3>
<p>Resolution, mass accuracy, and sensitivity are tested.
Before preparing proteins for this step, do the following:

<ol>
<li>Take the MS out of Operate, set Linear mode.
<li>If the instrument has not been in linear mode for some time, it might be a
good idea to briefly condition the Linear MCP: Set the maximum voltage
(1800-2000 V) and condition in 1-5 minute steps at least 30 min, or as long as
it takes you to prepare for use
<li>Increase all voltages to their operating levels
</ol>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>
According to the Waters-Micromass Operator's Guide, the pulse voltage for linear
mode needs to be optimized more often than for electron mode.  Since linear mode
is probably rarely used, it is probably a good idea to optimize pulse voltage
whenever it is used, and not assume that it was performed recently.
<p>
Linear mode pulse voltage optimization is actually done on a peptide like ACTH
rather than on a protein, even though peptide masses are usually never measured
in linear mode.
<p>
Generally the pulse voltage in lnear mode will be about 1000 to 1200 V, while
in reflectron mode, it will be between 2400-3000 V

<h4>Mass Accuracy</h4>
<ol>
<li>Obtain solutions of trypsinogen and of myoglobin at 10 mg/ml.
 Obtain 1 mg/ml of cytochrome c.  If 20 pmol/&micro;l solutions are
available from other performance checks, then skip steps below for
preparing 20 pmol/&micro;l proteins.  Also obtain sinapinic acid (SA)
matrix solution, prepared as above.
<li>Prepare four empty 0.5 ml conical tubes by labeling one each as:
 <ul>
 <li>20 pmol Trypsinogen/&micro;l  (<q>Tgen</q> or another abbreviation
  can be used)
 <li>20 pmol Myoglobin/&micro;l  (<q>MyoG</q> or another abbreviation
  can be used)
 <li>20 pmol cytochrome c/&micro;l  (<q>CytC</q> or another abbreviation
  can be used)
 <li>1 pmol Trypsinogen/&micro;l
 <li>1 pmol TCM/&micro;l
 </ul>
<li>Add the following reagents to the indicated tubes:
 <ul>
 <li>20 pmol Trypsinogen/&micro;l: 39.7 &micro;l water
 <li>20 pmol Myoglobin/&micro;l: 57.0 &micro;l water
 <li>20 pmol cytochrome C/&micro;l: 15.0 &micro;l water
 <li>1 pmol Trypsinogen/&micro;l: 18 &micro;l of MALDI solvent
 <li>1 pmol TCM/&micro;l:  14 &micro;l of MALDI solvent
 </ul>
<li>To the 20 pmol/&micro;l trypsinogen tube, add 2.0 &micro;l of the 10 mg/ml
trypsinogen.  Mix/vortex gently.  Store with the 10 mg/ml trypsinogen when
done using.
<li>Take 2.0 &micro;l from the 20 pmol/&micro;l trypsinogen tube and add it
to the 1 pmol/&micro;l trypsinogen tube.  Take another 2.0 &micro;l from the
20 pmol/&micro;l and add it to the 1 pmol TCM/&micro;l tube.
<li>To the 20 pmol/&micro;l myoglobin tube, add 2.0 &micro;l of the 10 mg/ml
myoglobin.  Mix/vortex gently.  Store with the 10 mg/ml myoglobin when
done using.
<li>To the 20 pmol/&micro;l cytochrome C tube, add 2.0 &micro;l of the 10 mg/ml
cytochrome C.  Mix/vortex gently.  Store with the 10 mg/ml cytochrome C when
done using.
<li>Take 2.0 &micro;l from the 20 pmol/&micro;l myoglobin tube and add it
to the 1 pmol/&micro;l TCM tube.  Take 2.0 &micro;l from the 20 pmol/&micro;l
cytochrome C tube and add it to the 1 pmol/&micro;l TCM tube.
<li>Add 20.0 &micro;l of SA matrix to the 1 pmol trypsinogen/&micro;l tube
and to the 1 pmol TCM/&micro;l tube.
<li>Obtain a MALDI target plate.  Spot each of six wells with 1 &micro;l of
the 1 pmol trypsinogen/&micro;l.
<li>Spot each of five wells with 1 &micro;l of the 1 pmol TCM/&micro;l.
<li>After letting the spots air dry completely, mount the plate in the MALDI-MS.
Acquire spectra manually or in an automated run.
<li>Process the spectra as follows:
 <ol>
 <li>Background subtraction: polynomial order = 15, % of points below curve = 40
 <li>Smooth:  Savitzy-Golay, with 4 channel wide, 2 iterations
 <li>Centering:  4 channel min peak width, 80% centroid top, area intensity
 </ol>
<li><b>External mass accuracy</b>.  From the six trypsinogen wells, pick one of the
masses for <q>calibration</q>; call this <i>m<sub>c</sub></i>.
Calculate the error RMS =
&radic;{&sum; [(<i>m<sub>i</sub> &minus; m<sub>c</sub></i>)<sup>2</sup>] / 5 }
Calculate error ppm:  (error RMS / <i>m<sub>c</sub></i>) &times; 10<sup>6</sup>.
If the error ppm is &lt; 300 ppm, the accuracy qualifies.
<li><b>Internal mass accuracy</b>.  Correct the mass of each myoglobin peak
in each of the five wells using the trypsinogen and cytochrome c peaks as
internal calibration peaks.  Compute the error RMS and then the error ppm for
the five myoglobin masses according to the equations above.  If the error ppm
is &lt; 200 ppm, the accuracy qualifies.
</ol>
<p>
The mass accuracy in linear mode at installation was 173.9 ppm when using external
calibration, and 45.0 ppm when using internal lockmass corrrection.

<h4>Sensitivity</h4>
<p>The sensitivity in linear mode is checked using Glu-Fibrinopeptide, the same
peptide used for checking reflectron mode.  <a
href="#reflectron-sensitivity">Follow the directions</a> to prepare the peptide
on a single plate, and check sensitivity in both linear and reflectron, in both
positive and negative ion modes.
