MassLynx Operation Guide

<p>
This is a somewhat summarized, somewhat detailed form of the user's manual 
provided by Waters-Micromass for the use of MassLynx for versions 4.0 and 4.1. 
All text is assumed to describe a feature or function of both versions and 
exceptions will be noted when a feature is missing or present.
<p>
The ProteinLyxn Global Server software setup and use of its interface has its
own <a href="ProteinLynxUse.html">document</a>.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
The <b>MassLynx</b> software has been designed to be the single interface to the 
multiple products (mass spectrometers and chromatography systems) manufactured 
by Waters (formerly Waters-Micromass).
<p>
MassLynx has the following features:
<ul>
<li>Provide an interface via a <q>Tune Page</q> window specialized for each 
mass spectrometer.  This Tune Page is opened from the MassLynx main window in the
Instrument toolbar via the <b>MS Tune</b> iconized button.  The Tune Page software
controls all physical elements of a device:  settings of voltages, temperatures,
and gas flows in mass spectrometers.
<li>Provide an interface via a <q>Inlet Method</q> window specialized for each 
chromatography system interfaced to a mass spectrometer.  This Inlet Method is opened from the MassLynx main window in the
Instrument toolbar via the <b>MS Inlet</b> iconized button.  The system provides
control over all device features of a chromatography system:  initialization and
preparation of an autosampler (valve position, washing syringe operation, temperature
setting of vial cooling platform, position of vial platform) and pumps (flow
rates, gradient operation) and column temperature.
<li>Provide an automated sample processing/analysis system in which the user
builds a sample list (table) in which each record/row is a sample to be analyzed
and each field/column of the table specifies required and optional settings for the
sample, including its data output file name, file names of the methods by which the
sample is to be analyzed by the mass spectrometer and chromatography system (both
are separate), and any scripts or other features involving the pre- or post-processing
of data.
<li>Provide tools to analyze the chromatographic output for all signals (total ion
counts, absorbance data, etc against a time axis) and to analyze mass spectra as
single or combined scans at any time point in collection.
<li>Provide the ability to look at spectra from automated runs, manually acquired
data collection, and to analyze beams without saving data.
</ul>
<p>
For all mass spectrometers, the common output is the mass spectrum, a plot of 
ion count or intensity (relative or absolute) against a plot of the 
mass-to-charge value of the ion (intensity vs. <i>m/z</i>).  So it makes sense 
that the presentation and analysis of this data in MassLynx is consistent. 
Chromatographic output is also a signal vs. time plot, so it too has a 
consistent interface.  The signal might be absorbance data, but in an MS setup, 
it is usually total ion current (TIC).

<h1>Sample Lists in MassLynx</h1>
<p>
MassLynx prepares sample lists with a similar interface (appearance),
but since different mass spectrometers in the Waters/Micromass product
line have different features, MassLynx has instrument-dependent features.

<h1>Chromatogram</h1>
<p>
This tool is opened from the main window as a menu item on top of the 
Sample List panel.
<p>
When the window is opened with a data file, the collection of multiple
mass spectra within a single run of an automated collection or manual 
acquisition is presented as a plot of a signal against either time
or scan (a scan represents the period of time taken to accumulate ions
and present them as a single spectrum).
<p>
The vertical axis part is the signal, and it important to understand
what types of signals can be presented:
<ul>
<li><b>Total Ion Current (TIC)</b>.  This is the count of ions at all
<i>m/z</i> values collected over the mass range.  Suppose that the mass
range during timed collection is <i>m/z</i> 100-1000, and that ions can be
counted at unit resolution.  This is 901 possible ion counts for each of the
901 <i>m/z</i> positions.  Most positions will have an ideal zero counts
(but background always has some counts at many positions) while signal
counts will be in the tens to hundreds and maybe thousands within a single
scan period (depending on the time of the scan period, usually one second).
Thus if there are 3 peaks, say at <i>m/z</i> 457, 732, and 912, and their
ion counts are 234, 91, and 167, respectively for a single scan period,
then the TIC will be 234 + 91 + 167 = 492 for that time point in the 
mass chromatogram.  Because of the counts at all points representing 
background, the actual TIC will probably be 10-20% higher, so long as
signal-to-noise is strong.
<li><b>Base Peak Intensity (BPI)</b>.  The most intense (highest signal)
peak in a mass spectrum in the range of <i>m/z</i> values measured 
is called the <q>base peak.</q>  A BPI vs. time plot chromatogram only 
presents the ion count of the peak with the highest signal against time,
ignoring the signals of other less intense peaks.  This presentation might
be used if there is only one component (the most intense) of interest;
it has the greatest apparent resolution and signal-to-noise in a 
chromatogram, since it only looks at one component.
<li><b>Mass</b>.  A chromatogram can be plotted which looks only at the
intensity of a specified <i>m/z</i> value and not just the base peak
(BPI) or whole mass range (TIC).  This is a general mass chromatogram.
<li><b>Analog</b>.  This is signal data that comes from a sensing or detection
device other than the mass spectrometer, such as absorbance or electrical
signal data from an inline spectrophotometer or other meter.
</ul>

<h2>Chromatogram Window Elements</h2>
<p>
The figure below shows what the chromatogram window looks like.  A single 
chromatogram data file is opened in both plots, but the top plot shows the
BPI vs time plot while the bottom is a TIC vs. time plot.
<p>

<p>
The data file name is at the upper left above each plot (it is the same name
in figure, indicating the same file).  At the upper right of each plot in
top-to-bottom presentation are:
<ul>
<li><b>Function</b>:  this will report the mode of data collection or
analysis of the mass spectrometer and what type of ionization was done
<li><b>Plot ordinate</b>:  what type of signal forms the vertical axis
(TIC, BPI, mass, analog, etc).
<li><b>Value of the highest point in the ordinate (vertical scale)</b>:
In the plot, the value of the highest signal (usually the largest peak)
is 5570 ion counts in the BPI plot and 5700 counts for the TIC plot.
</ul>

<h1>Strip Function</h1>
<p>
This tool provides way of removing unwanted background and noise from data
file.  The result data is created as a new file similar to a processed RAW
file.  Four processing options are available:
<ol>
<li><b>Enhance</b>.  Each point and its nearest neighbors are examined which
allows determination of whether it is noise or real feature.  Noise is removed
once determined.  Result file has a significantly reduced size.
<li><b>Subtract</b>.  Permits input file to be subtracted by a single background
spectrum or by a whole data file.  Processed spectra can also be subtracted
to enable spectra to be used as background.
<li><b>Cluster</b>.  This can detect paired or triplet peask separated by
a specified mass difference.  The specified parameters are mass differences
and expected intensity ratios and their tolerances, and time windows and 
global thresholds.  Only the wanted peaks appear in the data file.
<li><b>CODA: Component Detection Algorithm</b>.  Another option for removing
mass chromatograms that represent noise in the dataset.
</ol>

<h1>Combine Functions</h1>
<p>
Combines all functions in data file to produce a new result file containing
a single function that is sum of the multiple functions.  Combining of functions
can only be done if the same scan range and rate were used, or the same SIR
or MRM channels.  Useful for files often having different <i>cone voltages</i>
or <i>collision energies</i>.
