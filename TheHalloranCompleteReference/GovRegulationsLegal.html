		<h1>Glossary: Definitions, Terms</h1>
		<p>
			All of the defintions below are <em>verbatim</em> definitions taken from
			Directive 98/79/EC to harmonize in vitro diagnostic medical devices among the
			EU member states.
		</p>
		<p>
			A <b>medical device</b> is any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or
			other article, whether used alone or in combination, including the software
			necessary for its proper application, intended by the manufacturer to be used
			for human beings for the purpose of:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease,
			</li>
			<li>diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation or compensation for an injury
				or handicap,
			</li>
			<li>investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a
				physiological process,
			</li>
			<li>control of conception,
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			and which does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body
			by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but which may be assisted
			in its function by such means.

		</p>
		<p>
			An <b>in vitro diagnostic medical device</b> means any medical device which is a
			reagent, reagent product, calibrator, control material, kit, instrument,
			apparatus, equipment, or system, whether used alone or in combination, intended
			by the manufacturer to be used in vitro for the examination of specimens,
			including blood and tissue donations, derived from the human body, solely or
			principally for the purpose of providing information:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>concerning a physiological or pathological state, or
			</li>
			<li>concerning a congenital abnormality, or
			</li>
			<li>to determine the safety and compatibility with
				potential recipients, or
			</li>
			<li>to monitor therapeutic measures.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Included in the definition are specimen receptacles/containers.

		</p>
		<p>
			An <b>accessory</b> means an article which, while not being an in vitro
			diagnostic medical device, is intended specifically by its manufacturer to be
			used together with a device to enable that device to be used in accordance with
			its intended purpose. <b>Note</b>: invasive sampling devices or those which are
			directly applied to the human body for the purpose of obtaining a specimen
			within the meaning of Directive 93/42/EEC shall not be considered to be
			accessories.

		</p>
		<p>
			A <b>device for self-testing</b> means any device intended by the manufacturer
			to be able to be used by lay persons in a home environment.

		</p>
		<p>
			A <b>device for performance evaluation</b> means any device intended by the
			manufacturer to be subject to one or more performance evaluation studies in
			laboratories for medical analyses or in other appropriate environments outside
			his own premises.

		</p>
		<p>
			A <b>manufacturer</b> means the natural or legal person with responsibility for
			the design, manufacture, packaging and labelling of a device before it is placed
			on the market under his own name, regardless of whether these operations are
			carried out by that person himself or on his behalf by a third party. The
			obligations of this Directive to be met by manufacturers also apply to the
			natural or legal person who assembles, packages, processes, fully refurbishes
			and/or labels one or more ready-made products and/or assigns to them their
			intended purpose as devices with a view to their being placed on the market
			under his own name. This subparagraph does not apply to the person who, while
			not a manufacturer within the meaning of the first subparagraph, assembles or
			adapts devices already on the market to their intended purpose for an individual
			patient;

		</p>
		<p>
			An <b>authorised representative</b> means any natural or legal person
			established in the Community who, explicitly designated by the manufacturer,
			acts and may be addressed by authorities and bodies in the Community instead of
			the manufacturer with regard to the latterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obligations under this Directive.

		</p>
		<p>
			The term <b>intended purpose</b> means the use for which the device is intended
			according to the data supplied by the manufacturer on the labelling, in the
			instructions for use and/or in promotional materials.

		</p>
		<p>
			The term <b>placing on the market</b> means the first making available in return
			for payment or free of charge of a device other than a device intended for
			performance evaluation with a view to distribution and/or use on the Community
			market, regardless of whether it is new or fully refurbished.

		</p>
		<p>
			The term <b>putting into service</b> means the stage at which a device has been
			made available to the final user as being ready for use on the Community market
			for the first time for its intended purpose.

		</p>
		<p>
			The standard <b>ISO 13485</b> specifies requirements for comprehensive management
			of design and manufacture of medical devices (definition from Wikipedia);
			it supersedes EN 46001/46002, and the same standards published before 2003.
			Generally, product design and manufacture and a system of organization involving
			design and manufacture should conform to principles in ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485,
			and this Quality Management System is certified by a Notified Body. Other
			requirements may be specified in a EU directive in order to acquire the CE marking.

		</p>
		<h1>Directive 98/79/EC</h1>
		<p>
			This 37-page directive addresses all definitions, classifications, procedures and
			standards related to <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic medical devices wanting to be
			marked <q>CE</q> for sale in the EU member state markets.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are 35 <q>whereas</q> clauses (in four pages) that address the goals and
			reasons why the directive is issued, mostly to <q>harmonize</q> the varying
			standards and regulations among the many member states so that manufacturers can
			sell throughout the EU.
		</p>
		<p>
			In a second 10-page section are 24 Articles specifying how member states and
			manufacturers should govern themselves to make these devices marketable as
			well as safe and effective.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then there are 10 annexes in about 20 pages that provide details on the types
			of IVD medical devices as well as the rules on how to design and manufacture
			them for the CE marking.
		</p>
		<p>
			Annex I.A.3 specifies that devices should report analytical and diagnostic
			sensitivity and specificity, accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility,
			and control of known relevant interference and limits of detection.
		</p>
		<p>
			Annex I.B mainly deals with the safety of the device, including those transporting
			or distributing it, as well as the cleanliness and effectiveness of the device.
			Annex I.B.8 requires that manufacturers provide information for safe and proper
			use, taking into account training and knowledge of potential users, and identifying
			the manufacturer. Generally instructions for use and labeling must be done on
			a <q>per package</q> basis (a package may contain one or more of the devices).
			It is probably a good idea to write a <q>Safety</q> section for the user separately
			from a <q>Proper Use</q> section. The annex recommends use of symbols to
			inform/warn the reader: use of standard symbols must be done before manufacturer-specific
			symbols.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the device is considered <b>dangerous</b>, directives 67/548/EEC and
			88/379/EEC specifying how to label and use symbols and how to inform the
			user. It may be necessary to prepare a safety data sheet (conforming to
			an MSDS standard).
		</p>
		<p>
			All package labels must bear:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>name or trade name and address of manufacturer or authorized representative

				a serial number
			</li>
			<li>if required, a date by which device/part should be used, by year, month,
				and day, in that order (the day is not always required)
			</li>
			<li>use of <q>performance evaluation only</q> phrase if that is the intended
				purpose
			</li>
			<li>a statement that the device is for <i>in vitro</i> purposes where appropriate
			</li>
			<li>storage and/or handling conditions
			</li>
			<li>particular operating instruction where applicable

			<li>if intended for self-testing, it must be clearly stated
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Instructions for use</b> must contain all the package label details except for
			any lot/batch code and use-by date. It must also contain
