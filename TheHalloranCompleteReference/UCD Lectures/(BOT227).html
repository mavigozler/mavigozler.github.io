<p>
<i>Gene expression</i> can be defined as the phenotypic (or protein) presence
conveying the character of an organism.  RNA and protein are expression products 
of genes.  The processes that regulate this expression, of transcription and 
translation can be included within the definition.
<p>
Cell structure and function is based upon the expression of different 
populations (subsets) of genes.
<p>
What is the evidence of sporophytic DNA contents being the same?

<ol>
<li><b>totipotency</b>: differentiated tissue can be cultured in suspension
and a whole plant can be grown from it
<li><b>reassociation kinetics</b>:  <i>C</i><sub>0</sub><i>t</i> curves
for DNA isolated from two different tissue types will show identical patterns
of reassocation
<li>cDNA probe corresponding to an embryonic protein will hybridize
to DNA taken from different tissues, such as leaf and embryo tissue
</ol>

<p>
The following are mRNA populations:

<tr><td>GHI       <td>enzymes necessary for basic metabolism
<tr><td>ABC, DEF  <td>

                      qualitative difference</div>
                      unique proteins which confer specific character
<tr><td>JKL, jkl  <td>

                      quantitative difference</div>
                      genes which are identical but which affect the
                      cell by dosage (total amount)
