<p>
Citrate is a nonchiral molecule that produces a chiral (nonracemic) product in 
D-isocitrate with aconitase.  Normally in chemistry, chiral products cannot be 
formed from achiral reactants. The Ogsten hypothesis states that a symmetric 
(nonchiral) substrate being acted upon by an asymmetric enzyme enzyme can 
produce chiral products.  This is so because the binding sites of an enzyme to 
an achiral substrate are not such that it can bind its mirror image. For 
example,

<pre>
          X1     X2

              X3
</pre>
<p>
Suppose <tt>X1</tt> represents the &alpha;-carbon binding site to citrate, 
<tt>X2</tt> is the active site binding, and <tt>X3</tt> is the binding site to 
CH<sub>2</sub>COO<sup>&minus;</sup>.  In this case citrate binds the enzyme is a 
chiral way and the reaction done with an intermediate that allows formation of 
the racemic product.

<h1>Cellular Compartments</h1>
<h2>Mitochondria</h2>
<p>
A likely prokaryotic symbiont that formed within the eukaryotic cell
probably 1-2 billion years ago.  Evidence for this comes from several facts:
<ul>
<li>The presence of <i>cardiolipin</i> in the membrane found in no other
eukaryotic membrane, but which is a lipid found in several prokaryotes
<li>Mitochondrial-associated DNA is circular and not associated with
histones
<li>Synthesis of mitochondrial proteins occurs on ribosomes of mitochondrial
origin
</ul>
<p>
The <b>outer membrane</b> of animal cell mitochondria si permeable to substances
whose mass is &lt; 6000 Da.
<p>
An <b>intermembrane space</b> exists and its size and volume depend on the
changes in the inner membrane with its cristal folds.
<p>
The <b>inner membrane</b> is permeable to nothing, and the only substances
able to pass must have transporters (transport proteins).
<i>Succinic dehydrogenase</i> is bound on the inner membrane.
<p>
The <b>matrix</b> holds all soluble enzymes of the Krebs Cycle.
<p>
Many mitochondrial intermediate metabolites have the fates in biosythesis:
<ul>
<li>acetyl-CoA: lipids
<li>&alpha;-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate:  amino acids
<li>succinyl-CoA:  hemes, cytochromes
</ul>
<p>
The following reaction is of <i>pyruvate carboxylase</i> and is mediated
by <b>biotin</b> (covalently bound to the enzyme by a lysine
&epsilon;-NH<sub>2</sub> group).
<p>
pyruvate + ATP + CO<sub>2</sub> &mdash;&gt; oxaloacetate + ADP + P<sub>i</sub>
<p>
The structure of biotin is:
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesBiochem101HTML/biotin.gif" alt="biotin structure">
<p>
The carboxyl group of the co-enzyme forms an amide bond with an
&epsilon;-NH<sub>2</sub> group of a lysine to the enzyme to which it is
associated.  The sequence of reactions involving biotin-mediated carboxylation
are as follows:
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesBiochem101HTML/carboxylation.gif" alt="carboxylation reaction mechanism steps">
<p>
Pyruvate carboxylase is activated in high energy (anabolic) states.
When cells are in a high energy state, what sort of molecules would one
expect to regulate the enzyme?  Certainly ATP and acetyl-CoA are at
high levels, and in fact, <b>acetyl-CoA</b> is a positive effector because
oxaloacetate (OAA) reacts with acetyl-CoA in the citrate synthase reaction.

<h2>Proteins</h2>
<p>
Assays of proteins should be selected on three criteria:
<ol>
<li><b>selectivity</b>:  should be specific for protein and not detect
other substances nonspecifically, or have negative or positive interferences
<li><b>sensitivity</b>:  should strive to detect smallest amounts and
quantify in linear range
<li><b>convenience</b>:  should be rapid and require little effort, besides
being consistent (precise)
</ol>
<p>
Typically assays are spectrophotometric in which absorption of a chromophore
is measured.  A spectrum of absorption vs. wavelength shows continuous
maxima and minima representing vibrational state transitions.
<p>
The relative transmission, or <i>intensity</i> of light, <i>I</i> can
be related as follows:
<p class="eqnserif">
transmittance = <i>I</i> / <i>I</i><sub>0</sub> =
10<sup>&minus;<i>&epsilon;cl</i></sup>
<p>
where <i>I</i><sub>0</sub> is the incident intensity, <i>I</i> is the
intensity after transmission through an absorbing sample, &epsilon; is
a constant representing an <i>extinction coefficient</i>, <i>c</i>
is the concentration of the absorbing material, and <i>l</i> is the path
length of the transmission.
<p>
The expression:
<p class="eqnserif">
 <i>A</i> = &minus; log (<i>I</i> / <i>I</i><sub>0</sub>) = <i>&epsilon;cl</i>
<p>
defines the logarithmic decrease in transmission to be the <b>absorption</b>,
and the expression shown above is called the <i>Beer-Lambert Law</i>.

<p>
Spectrophotometers are instruments used to measure absorption of color.
The simplest spectrophotometers consist of a:
<ul>
<li>light source (lamp)
<li>prism to generate polychromatic light
<li>monochromator to select a particular wavelength (filter out one color)
of the polychromatic light
<li>cell for holding sample
<li>detector transducing light signal to electrical signal
<li>meter connected to the electrical output circuit of the detector
 (could be ammeter)
</ul>
<p>
The lamps of spectrophotometers can be hydrogen (deuterium) or
tungsten for UV. [also can use mercury].

<h2>pH, Buffer, Protein Digestion</h2>
<p>
Bronsted-Lowry theory holds that acids are <b>proton donors</b>.
<p class="eqnserif center">
HA &harr; H<sup>+</sup> + A<sup>&minus;1</sup>
<br><i>K</i><sub>a</sub>&prime; = [H<sup>+</sup>][A<sup>&minus;</sup>] /
[HA]
<br>p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>&prime; = &minus;log <i>K</i><sub>a</sub>&prime;
<br>pH = = &minus;log [H<sup>+</sup>] = p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>&prime;
 + log [A<sup>&minus;</sup>] / [HA]
<br><i>K</i><sub>w</sub> = 10<sup>&minus;14</sup>
<br>p<i>K</i><sub>w</sub> = 14
<p>
Other relevant equations in acid-base equilibria:
<p class="eqnserif center">
A<sup>&minus;1</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O &harr; HA + OH<sup>&minus;</sup>
<br><i>K</i><sub>b</sub> = <i>K</i><sub>w</sub> / <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> =
 [HA] [OH<sup>&minus;</sup>] / [A<sup>&minus;</sup>]
<p>
Formol titration of protein (such as BSA) hydrolysis attempts to use
pH to make a quantitative analysis of peptide cleavage sites and
ionizable groups.  Consider the amine group involved in the peptide bond:
<p class="eqnserif center">
R-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> &harr; R-NH<sub>2</sub> + H<sup>+</sup>
<p>
At pH 8, 70% of the form of the amine is ionized (+1 charge) while
30% has no charge (0 charge).
<p>
Suppose that the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the amine group is altered,
and this alteration produces a new pH = 7.  OH<sup>&minus;</sup> is
added to bring back the pH to 8, and the titration computed.  The
ionization proportion is now 60% in +1 state and 40% unionized (0 charge).
<p>
Changes in p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> can occur by trypsin digestion or by
addition of formol.  Release of protons (H<sup>+</sup>) can then be
determined by OH<sup>&minus;</sup> titration.  These protons come from
the newly created ionizable groups releasing their protons.  If
ionization is 60% after the method and 70% before the method,
10% of the ions comes from the newly created ionizable groups.
Thus the moles of protons is equal to 10% of the total moles of
ionizable groups.
<p>
The titration is usually set up to plot the volume of base (KOH) added
against time.  KOH is added to maintain a constant pH.  The plot is shown
to the right and the setup at left.
<p class="center">
<img src="imagesBiochem101HTML/FormolTitration-1.gif" alt="setup of formol titration">
<img src="imagesBiochem101HTML/FormolTitration-2.gif" alt="titration:plot of KOH added vs. time">
<p>
When hydrolysis is complete, the titration goes back to pH 8 and
[H<sup>+</sup>]/[HA] is computed from knowledge of pKa and pH, to determine
the count of peptide bonds cleaved:
<p class="eqnserif center">
moles of H<sup>+</sup> released = (<i>x</i> percentage)(moles of amino groups
formed)
<p>
To count the number of residues, suppose at the pKa at pH 8.5 there is
20% acid and 80% base from.  There are 1 mole H<sup>+</sup> for each peptide
bond hydrolyzed.  Thus 0.8 moles of H<sup>+</sup> were formed for each
mole peptide bond hydrolysis.  Thus to get the mole of peptide bonds, one
divides the moles of H<sup>+</sup> (as determined by OH<sup>&minus;</sup>
titration) by 0.8.  Other factors that must be considered include
dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> to increase acidity, and that action of trypsin
itself.
<p>
When formaldehyde is added, protons are released into the solution for
base titration.  This has also been used to determine the number of Arg
and Lys residues in a protein.
<p>
<b>Acetylation of proteins</b>.  Incubation of a protein like BSA with
<i>acetic anhydride</i> will result in acetylation of primary amines:
<p class="center">
-NH<sub>2</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)-O-C(=O)-CH<sub>3</sub> &rarr;
-NH-C(=O)-CH<sub>3</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub>-COO<sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>
<p>
Addition of formaldehyde should result in no pH shift and so the degree
of acetylation is determined by formaldehyde.  BSA so modified will now
hydrolyze only on Arg residues since Lys residues have been modified.

<h3>pH Meter Operation</h3>
<p>
The <b>glass electrode</b> of the pH metering system is the electrode
that is permeable to protons and thus measures the pH.  As proton move
in and out in reaching equilibrium, the change in potential energy is
governed by the Nernst equation:
<table class="eqnserif">
<tr><td rowspan="2"><i>E</i> =
 <td class="numer"><i>RT</i>
 <td rowspan="2">ln
 <td class="numer">[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>inside</sub>
<tr><td><i>nF</i>
 <td>[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>outside</sub>
</table>
<p>
where <i>n</i> = 1.  Suppose the solution inside the bulb is 0.1 N HCl.
The equation is transformed to make <i>E</i> a function of pH, taking
note that pH = &minus;log [H<sup>+</sup>] and ln [H<sup>+</sup>] =
pH ln 10 = 2.3 pH.  Thus it becomes
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>E</i> = <i>K</i> + 2.3 <i>RT</i> (pH) / <i>F</i>
<p>
The pH meter circuit is formed by a silver (Ag) wire surrouded by a
AgCl paste in the chamber that includes the permeable glass bulb with
0.1 N HCl present.  Another chamber contains a fritted portion
containing saturated KCl.  The AgCl paste is reduced:
<p class="eqnserif">
AgCl + e<sup>&minus;</sup> &rarr; Ag<sup>0</sup> + Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>
<p>
The pH meter must be standardized, which provides a reading of value
<i>K</i>.  A pH 7 solution finds a particular value <i>E</i> which is
<i>E</i><sup>0</sup>.   Note the equation includes <i>T</i> and thus
there is temperature dependence.
<p>
Problems can occur with pH metering:
<ul>
<li>In some cases, the glass bulb may also be permeable to Na<sup>+</sup>
ions and can distort the readings, if present.
<li>A protein coat that forms on the glass bulb can prevent permeability
to protons.
<li>High ionic strength, the activity coefficients become a significant
factor in measurement of ion concentration.
</ul>

<h2>Enzyme Kinetics</h2>
<p>
An enzyme (E) catalyzing conversion of a single substrate (S) to product
(P) is schematized by the following reactions:
<table class="eqnserif">
<tr><td rowspan="3" style="padding:0 0.5em;">E + S
  <td style="font-size:83%;"><i>k</i><sub>1</sub>
  <td rowspan="3" style="padding:0 0.5em;">ES
  <td style="font-size:83%;"><i>k</i><sub>P</sub>
  <td rowspan="3" style="padding:0 0.5em;">P + E
<tr><td style="line-height:0.5em;">&rarr;<br>&larr;
 <td>&rarr;
<tr><td style="font-size:83%;"><i>k</i><sub>2</sub>
</table>
<p>
We define the <i>velocity</i> of the reaction as the change in the product 
concentration, [P], over time.  Chemical reaction kinetics shows that the 
formation of the product is dependent upon a rate constant and the concentation 
of the reactant.  In enzyme kinetics, we can call the rate constant 
<i>k</i><sub>P</sub> and the reactant a complex of the enzyme and its 
substrate(s).  For a single substrate, this complex is defined as <b>ES</b>. 
Thus:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>v</i> = d[P]/d<i>t</i> = <i>k</i><sub>P</sub>[ES]
<p>
The formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, ES, is based on an equilibrium
of the enzyme and substrate, its dissocation constant <i>K</i><sub>S</sub>:
<p class="center">
<table class="eqnserif">
<tr><td rowspan="2"><i>K</i><sub>S</sub> =
 <td class="numer">[E][S]
<tr><td>[ES]
</table>
<p>
Define <i>E</i><sub>T</sub> as the total amount of enzyme in all its forms:
<p class="eqnserif">
 <i>E</i><sub>T</sub> = [E] + [ES]
<p>
True for the single-substrate enzyme.  When [S] is very high, all of the enzyme 
is like to be in the enzyme-substrate form ES and very little as enzyme E alone. 
Moreover, the velocity of the reaction is likely to be at its highest, its 
maximum.  Hence:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>E</i><sub>T</sub> = [ES]<br>
<i>v</i> = <i>V</i><sub>max</sub><br>
<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> = <i>k</i><sub>P</sub><i>E</i><sub>T</sub>
<p>
The last equation substitute the velocity equation above, and it says that the 
maximum product conversion rate is dependent upon the amount of enzyme.
