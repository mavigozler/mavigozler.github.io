Animal Virology Lecture Notes
<p>
These lecture notes from the course Veterinary Microbiology 128 taught at 
University of California, Davis in Fall 1982 (by Dwight Hirsh?) with notes taken 
by S. M. Halloran.

<p>
Grading in course is by three examinations, two midterms and one final.

<h1>History</h1>
<p>
Viruses first became known specifically through the disease <b>smallpox</b>. 
They were known as early as 10th century B.C. by the Chinese, who kept a record 
of them.  The Chinese treated it with lesions from the infected individuals to 
scarified skin of the uninfected.
<p>
Polio was recorded in Egyptian hieroglyphics.  In 1798 Jenner was able to 
prevent smallpox by rubbing cowpox exudate into skin. Pasteur developed a method 
for the treatment of rabies.
<p>
In the 1890s many tobacco plants mottled their leaves due to TMV. Scientists
had developed a porous bacterial filter made from clay, and the sterile
solution still contained infectious agent.  Viruses were then known
as a filterable infectious agent, or a <b>filterable virus</b>.  Later
they became known as just <b>viruses</b>.
<p>
In 1898 Loeffler and Frosch demonstrated that hoof-and-mouth disease
in cattle was a filterable infectious agent (a virus).
<p>
1911:  Rous demonstrated that ground-up tissue from a chicken sarcoma
was etiologically a virus, since it caused chicken sarcoma.
<p>
1917:  Bacteria were discovered to have their own viral agents (<b>phages</b>).
<p>
Methods to culture or &ldquo;grow&rdquo; viruses on artificial media
were not successful.  In 1935 Wendell Stanley knew chemists could crystallize
proteins, so why not any filterable agent:  so he successfully crystallized
TMV.  It was shown to be 95% protein and 5% nucleic acid.  He assumed that
it was the protein that conferred virulence, largely because of its sheer
mass.
<p>
Hershey &amp; Chase (1952) refuted this theory of the protein conferring
virulence with experiments making use of isotopic labels <sup>35</sup>S and 
<sup>32</sup>P.  They infected bacteria with phage and the isolated progeny had 
<sup>32</sup>P-labeled nucleic acid but no <sup>35</sup>S-labeled protein.  When 
they added the labeled phage, after a few minutes they shook and stirred the 
solution violently to strip off the phage. They filtered it and in the 
resuspended filtered part they found <sup>32</sup>P-labeled bacteria and the 
filtrate contained <sup>32</sup>S-labeled protein.  To show infectivity was not 
lost, the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled bacteria were cultured for 30 min and lysed 
with the new progeny.

<p>
Real proof that DNA (nucleic acid) conferred virulence was when experiments
using naked DNA to transform the cell were done.  A. Wulff (1957) described
the characteristics of a virus at this point in time:
<ul>
<li>it required intracellular conditions
<li>the genome is composed of either RNA or DNA, but never both.
Some instances occur when both nucleic acids are found, but only one
type represents the genome
<li>there is no binary growth or fission;  it is rather an assembly of
parts
<li>there is no internal complement of energy-yielding structures or
substances for genome replication, transcription, or translation;
there is total dependence on the host
</ul>

<h1>Phases of Infection</h1>
<p>
The following are described as the phases of viral infection:
<ol>
<li><b>Attachment Phase</b>.  This event is marked by a specific ligand
binding of moieties on the viral surface and the cell membrane surface
receptor.
<li><b>Penetration Phase</b>.  There are three types of penetration:
 <ol>
 <li><b>direct</b>:  when the viral genome itself is admitted
 <li><b>fusion</b>:  when the surface of virus and cell fuse, and then
the genome is admitted
 <li><b>viropexis</b>:	when the attachment process causes a rearrangment
 of the cell membrane components, forming a &ldquo;coated pit,&rdquo;
 and finally an intracellular vesicle (reminiscent of phagocyte action)
 containing virus.  The virus then penetrates the cytoplasm from within
 the cell
 </ol>
<li><b>Replication</b>.  The nucleic acid genome must be replicated by
the host machinery.
<li><b>Release</b>.	Once assembled the virion may be released via:
 <ol>
 <li><b>budding</b> off the cell membrane surface (most common)
 <li><b>lysis</b> of the cell, killing it, with millions of virions released
 </ol>
</ol>

<p>
<img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/ViralGrowthCurve.gif" class="img-left"
	alt="viral growth curve characteristics">

<p>
The figure at left shows the characteristics of a viral growth curve. The amount 
of virus measured on the ordinate is the actual <b>extracellular</b> virion 
number.  Note the extracellular curve of polio as well as of the feline leukemia 
virus will lag the intracellular count.
<p>
Certain time periods describe the growth curve.  The <b>eclipse</b> phase is the 
time after addition to first detection of intracellular virus. The <b>latent</b> 
phase is the time after addition to the first detection of the extracellular 
phase.

<h1>Virus Purification</h1>
<p>
After knowing specifics of the growth curve, purificiation becomes necessary to 
observe more properties of a single virus. Why purify?  Because it is necessary 
to isolate the etiological agent (the virus) causing pathogenic reactions from 
contaminating material.
<p>
The following methods are used:

<ol>
<li><b>Differentital centrifugation</b>.  The rpm (rotational energy)
and time spent centrifuging will separate particles based largely
upon sedimentation differences (densities and size)
<li><b>Concentration (precipitation) with ammonium sulfate or polyethylene
glycol</b>.  Because of the hydrophilicity of these substances, they
possess a large sphere of hydration and will take aqueous solvent from
the viral particles, resulting in precipitation.
<li><b>Ultracentrifugation</b>.  If centrifuging according to rate of
particle sedimentation, the following formula is of importance:

<table class="eqnserif">
<tr><td class="numer"> <i>dx</i>
 <td rowspan="2">&prop;
 <td class="numer">(&rho;<sub>p</sub> &minus; &rho;<sub>m</sub>)
 <i>R</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> <i>ng</i>
<tr><td><i>dt</i>
 <td> &eta;
</table>

<p>
where d<i>x</i>/d<i>t</i> is the particle or sedimentation velocity, 
&rho;<sub>p</sub> is the density of the particle, &rho;<sub>m</sub> is the 
density of the medium, <i>R</i><sub>p</sub> is the particle radius, <i>ng</i> is 
the number of gravities (<i>g</i> = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> and <i>n</i> is the 
integer representing the factor), and &eta; is the medium viscosity.  It should 
be noted that when &rho;<sub>p</sub> = &rho;<sub>m</sub>, then <i>dx/dt</i> = 0 
and the particle stops movement. This is the <b>isopycnic</b> condition.
</ol>

<p>
In the last method, consider the example of sucrose gradient purification. 
Suppose a virus particle has a density of 1.18 g/ml (&rho;<sub>p</sub> = 1.18), 
which is typical of the feline leukemia virus.  A 10% sucrose solution has a 
&rho;<sub>m</sub> = 1.09 and 50% sucrose has a &rho;<sub>m</sub> = 1.22.  Thus a 
10-50% sucrose gradient will produce a band for feline leukemia virus above the 
bottom of the tube. Poliovirus has a &rho;<sub>p</sub> = 1.33, and will pellet 
at the bottom of the tube.

<p>
In summarizing the viral purification methods, centrifugation is often done. 
When virus density is far greater than the medium, it is often useful to use a 
<i>rate zonal</i> method since the only way to recover virus is by pelleting. 
Other pelletable substances can be removed by spinning at various times to 
pellet these and keep it separate from virus.

<h1>Viral Morphology</h1>
<p>
Viral shape and appearance is revealed ultramicroscopically by electron 
microscopy.
<p>
Tobacco mosaic (TMV) is a root-shaped, unenveloped virus.  It has helical
symmetry with proteins arranged in a helix and the RNA tucked within.
<p>
Poliovirus is single-stranded (ss) RNA virus.  Its virion is icosahedral: it has 
20 faces and 12 vertices, and the symmetry is cubic.  When describing this and 
other virus with geometric bodies of this type, it is useful to speak in terms 
of <i>rotational symmetry</i>.  A square has 4-fold rotational symmetry.  A 
triangle 3-fold.  An icosahedron has 5:3:2 rotational symmetry, that it 3 levels 
of rotational symmetry.
<p>
The virion (virus bodies) are usually composed of a basic set of proteins
which form the coats or the bodies of the virus.  Thus the protein or
proteins represent the <i>structural subunits</i>.  A single protein
or set of them then aggregate or join together or assemble to form
20 such aggregates, in the case of the icosahedral virus, and this
forms the <b>morphological unit</b>, or a <b>capsomer</b>.  The viral
body or coat is also called a <b>cap</b> and the suffix <b>-mer</b>
means &ldquo;part&rdquo; or &ldquo;unit.&rdquo;  Thus the word
capsomer, means a part of the cap.  Poliovirus has 32 capsomers.
<p>
The herpesvirus is a ds DNA virus, composed of an icosahedral
<b>nucleocapsid</b> (like poliovirus) and an <b>envelope</b>.  If the
envelope is removed, the virus loses the ability to infect.  The envelope
is composed of a lipoprotein, glycoprotein, lipid, and other minor
constituents.
<p>
The virus that causes Western equine encephalitis is an enveloped
ss RNA virus.  The envelope is composed of lipoprotein that wraps so
tightly around the nucleocapside that the membrane assumes the shape
of the nucleocapsid.  This virus belongs to a class called the
<b>Togaviridae</b> (the robed viruses).
<p>
The mumps virus is a ss RNA virus whose envelope surrounds helical
RNA around a helical nucleocapsid.  It belongs to the <b>Paramyxoviridae</b>.
<p>
The rabies virus (<b>Rhabdoviridae</b>) is an ss RNA virus with an enveloped
helical nucleocapsid and RNA like the mumps virus.
<p>
Poxvirus is called a <b>complex</b> virus largely because little is
known about its nucleocapsid packaging.

<p class="date">
1 Oct 1982

<p>
A review of rate zonal and isopycnic sedimentation was done because of
its importance to virus purification and probably some confusion about
how it is used.

<h1>Viral Content &amp; Composition</h1>
<p>
It is know that viruses are composed largely of protein and nucleic
acid (either DNA or RNA).
<p>
Determining whether a virus is single- or double-stranded is relatively 
straightforward.  One can use:

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>endonucleases that are specific for either single- or double-stranded
DNA or RNA can reveal strandedness and type
<li><img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/MeltingProfile.gif" class="img-right" alt="A260 temperature 
profile to find double- vs. single-stranded nucleic acid"> a plot of the 
absorbance at 260 nm (A<sub>260</sub>) against the temperature (see figure at 
right) during the heating of the virus will reveal strandedness: double-stranded 
nucleic acid shows a sharp transition (increase) in A<sub>260</sub> whereas 
single-stranded nucleic acid shows a more gradual increase (ss RNA or DNA shows 
an increase because there is still base-pairing of the single strand by 
stem-loops)
</ol>
<p>
In addition, the nucleic acid genome of the virus could be <i>linear</i> or 
<i>cyclic</i>.  With circular DNA or RNA, the end-to-end is covalently bonded.
<p>
The Picornaviridae are ss linear RNA viruses with an icosahedral morphology. 
Note that &ldquo;picornavirus&rdquo; is a formation of three words: <i>pico rna 
virus</i>.  <b>Pico</b> comes from the prefix referring to a quantity meaning 
&ldquo;10<sup>&minus;12</sup>&rdquo; but which really means &ldquo;very small or 
tiny in quantity or mass.&rdquo;  The meaning of <b>rna</b> and <b>virus</b> are 
obvious. Poliovirus is a member of this viral family, and its nucleocapsid is 
composed of four different proteins:  VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4.

<p>
The Togaviridae include a member causing Western equine encephalitis
and are ss linear RNA viruses with a tightly wrapped envelope around
an icosahedral nucleocapsid.  The envelope is a complex of lipoprotein
and often referred to as a &ldquo;biological membrane.&rdquo;  A single
protein subunit makes up the shell nucleocapsid.  The lipid composition
is phosphatides, free fatty acids (FFAs), cholesterol, and triacylglycerols
(TAGs).  This invariably indicates that the lipid components of the
envelope are of host origin but that the proteins of the envelope are
viral origin.  Sometimes carbohydrates are found on the proteins, indicating
that some proteins are glycoproteins.

<p>
The Herpesviridae are ds linear DNA viruses with an enveloped icosahedral 
morphology.  The nucleocapsid surroundes the genome and is composed of 10 
different proteins.  The DNA itself is wound around a spool of protein and 
contained by a <b>tegument</b>.  The envelope itself is composed of lipoprotein 
and 8-12 different types of glycoprotein.

<p>
<img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/InfluenzaVirus.gif" class="img-left"
 alt="Structure of the influenza virus">
The influenza virus is a member of the Myxoviridae, which are linear
ss RNA viruses.  The Type A influenza virus is a spherical particle
which appears under the electron microscope to have the following features:
<ol>
<li>spikes with two different configurations, one simply rod-shaped, and the
other T-shaped
<li>a matrix &ldquo;M&rdquo; protein
<li>a nucleocapsid composed of ribonucleoprotein with 8 helically looped
units, each with a unique sequence of RNA.  Each segment of RNA has three
proteins wrapping it called P1, P2, and P3.  There is also an N protein.
<li>A virion-bound or -associated enzyme is attached to the ribonucleoprotein,
one per RNA segments (of the 8 segments), and it is a <b>RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase</b>.
</ol>
<p>
The T-shaped envelope protein is associated with a <b>neuraminidase</b> 
activity:  this hydrolyzes sialic acid groups from the terminus of 
oligosaccharides on glycoproteins.   The rod-shaped envelope protein is a 
<b>hemagglutinin</b>, but its principal function is to enable attachment to the 
target cells, via the sialic acid groups of glycoproteins. The neuraminidase 
removes sialic acids from mucopolysaccharides in the respiratory system to 
enable better access to the receptor for penetration.


<p class="date">
4 Oct 1982

<p>
Continuing the discussion of the influenza virus, it was shown that there is a 
<b>transcriptase</b> enzyme associated with each RNA segment. This is an 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.  The enzymatic activity appears to be associated 
with the P1 and P3 proteins, findings which can be determined by using 
mutational studies.  Each segment of RNA codes for a gene and polypeptide 
(except for one nonstructural spacer).
<p>
When multiple influenza viruses infect a single cell (causing superinfection)
new permutations (assortments) of the 8 segments of the genome can be obtained. 
This creates genetic variablility and also helps to narrow down the function of 
these proteins.
<p>
In one study, virus was disaggregated with Triton X-100 and the proteins 
purified.  Rabbits were immunized against pure neuraminidase (NA) and the 
hemagluttinating (HA) proteins, and the antisera from the rabbits incubated wtih 
intact virions.  When treated with anti-HA enzyme, infectivity was fully lost, 
and when treated with anti-NA activity, it was reduced.  When single base 
mutations were done in the the HA gene, infectivity was lost, but when done in 
the NA gene, infectivity was lost only if the virus was administered as an 
aerosol.
<p>
HA purified by SDS-PAGE shows three subnits to the protein, which all have
approx. the same MW.  When treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, one sees
two subunits per monomer.
<p>
The NA protein is composed of a pair of dimeric dimers in SDS, which are
then dispersed in reducing conditions.
<p>
When the mortality of influenza virus is plotted against year, it can be seen 
that mortality is high about once every 11 years (going in 11-year cycles). 
Mortality was high in 1933, 1946, 1957, 1968. When one also plots antigenic 
change against year, one sees minor changes in amino acid from year to year 
(<i>antigenic drift</i>) but in the years where mortality is high, the virus 
acquires entirely new genomes (<i>antigenic shift</i>).

<h1>Culturing and Assay of Viruses</h1>
<p>
The culturing of animal viruses requires cells which are targets. It is 
speculated that bacterial cells can also be targets, but this is unproven.  The 
target cells can be made available in various ways:
<ol>
<li><b>animals</b>&mdash;a good, easy source
<li><b>embryonated eggs</b>&mdash;or developing embryonic tissue
<li><b>tissue cell culture</b>
</ol>
<p>
Loeffler and Frosch actually used cattle to culture foot-and-mouth disease
making that rather expensive.  Of course it is better to use smaller laboratory 
animals.
<p>
The method involves isolating virus particles, then finding an inexpensive way 
of propagating the virus, finding the right species and tissues as its targets. 
It is also necessary to determine a suitable route of administration:  direct 
i.v. injection may not allow infection. Age of the host, if an animal, is 
important:  certain leukemia viruses are able to infect young (1-day old) mice, 
but cannot infect mice at a later age.  It is also essential to check for 
contamination with other viruses:  several re-isolation and re-infection cycles 
may be necessary not only to purify virus through host infection, but also to 
prove that it is the agent involved.

<h2>Embryonic Cells</h2>
<p>
Several factors should be considered when growing and purifying viruses
by the use of growing embryos.

<ol>
<li>the age of the embryo<br>when using chick embryos, 10 d seems ideal
<li>route<br>sometimes intravenous administration works, but direct
injection into target tissue is perhaps the best
<li>tissue type<br>
sometimes the egg membrane, a fluid, or the embryo itself is the best target
</ol>
<p>
Morphological changes in cells due to viral infection are called the 
<b>cytopathic effect</b>.  This is seen as a &ldquo;pock&rdquo; of changed or 
dead cells.

<h2>Testing for Viral Presence</h2>
<p>
Various useful tests are available for screening for the presence of viruses. 
Many viruses have hemagglutinating ability, and so mixing fluid from a harvest 
of viral culture with red blood cells (RBCs) can be done to observe for 
hemagglutination.
<p>
When hemagglutination is not available as a quick screen, fluorescence 
immunomicroscopy of infected cells is usually required, and requires expert 
handling to assure the presence of infection.

<h2>Tissue Culture</h2>
<p>
The best types of cells are immature &ldquo;blast&rdquo; forms rather than 
differentiated cells.   Cancer cell lines, as established continuously dividing 
cells, are quite useful are viral targets.
<p>
In 1940 Dulbecco took whole organs and cut them into blocks of tissue. He then 
used a chemical cocktail of proteases and metal chelators (pronase, trypsin, 
EDTA) to produce single cell suspensions.  In 1942 these cell suspensions were 
then spread on to glass and the cells preserved in a medium of glucose, amino 
acids, serum (with a growth promoting set of factors), buffers, electrolytes, 
vitamins, and minerals.  To keep it microbe-free, antibiotics were also added to 
the growth medium (if mycoplasma is a problem, gentamicin is a very broad 
spectrum antibiotic that stops growth of gram-positive and -negative bacteria as 
well as mycoplasma). These cells typically grow on the plate surface in a 
<b>monolayer</b> and then stop growth once cells are confluent (show contact 
inhibition).
<p>
Cells treated with trypsin and re-seeded (subcultured) will form another 
monolayer possibly.  After several passages (4 or 5) they lose their ability to 
expand altogether.  This could be due to accumulation of errors in <b>ploidy</b> 
of these cells.  Sometimes cells continue to divide for hundreds of passages, 
and never seem to stop growing.  These are immortalized continuous lines, 
typically polyploid.  They are no longer fit for developing vaccines, but useful 
for other types of research.
<p>
In using tissue culture cells to cultivate virus, it is important to be able to 
recognize the cytopathic effect (CPE) as well as other morphological changes;

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li><b>pyknosis</b>, namely swelling and lysis
<li><b>vacuolation</b>, often toxic chemicals accumulating in vacuoles and the
appearance of many vacuoles
<li><b>giant cell formation</b>, an indication of the formation of
syncytial, multinucleated cells
<li>uncontrollable cell division
</ol>

<p class="date">
8 Oct 1982

<p>
A single infected cell will release upon lysis or by evagination about 1 million 
total virus particles.  Total particles is the sum of active and inactive 
particles;  an inactive particle is incapable of infection, possibly due to an 
error in assembly or some other factor.
<p>
Cells transformed by virus show cytopathic changes ultrastructurally such
as intranuclear or intracytoplasmic <b>inclusion bodies</b> which can
be either acido- or basophilic, depending on the virus.  These inclusion
bodies are usually assembly sites for the virus particles.
<p>
Many viruses do not release by cell lysis (cell death).  They release by 
<b>budding</b> such as the influenza virus.  To detect infection and release of 
influenza, a <b>hemadsorption</b> test is done, taking note of this virus' 
hemagglutinating ability.  Monolayers of infected cells are infected with virus, 
and then RBCs are introduced and then washed away. RBC clusters that remain are 
adsorbed to infected cells.  As a control, cells can be pre-incubated with 
anti-HA antibody before the RBCs are washed in, which would block the 
hemagglutinating ability of this protein, and the monolayers should show no RBC 
clusters.
<p>
Other detection methods include <b>acridine orange</b> dye:  this fluorescent 
dye stains ds RNA and DNA green, and ss RNA and DNA red. Visualization of either 
color in the cytoplasm is a strong suggestion of viral infection.
<p>
<b>Fluorescent Antibody</b>.  Purified virus is used to prepare neutralizing or 
immunizing antibodies against it.  The Ig is isolated and then covalently 
attached to a fluorescent dye (such as rhodamine B sulfate).  Infected cultured 
cells are fixed in acetone (to make the cell membrane porous for 
intracytoplasmic staining) and then the fluorochrome-labeled antibody is flooded 
in the cells and then unbound material washed away.  This is then viewed by 
fluorescent microscope using long wave UV light source.  When conducting such a 
study, the use of a <b>negative control</b> (uninfected cells) is vital as a 
point of comparison

<h3>Problems with Cell and Tissue Cultures</h3>
<p>
Removal of potential contamination from viral solutions is necessary and useful. 
Because viruses are so small, separation from living forms can often be 
accomplished by filters.  The problem is that some organisms can pass through 
filters.  Mycoplasma are small enough to do this, and these organisms are human 
in origin (cotton plugs in pipets are not allowed as cotton is toxic).  The 
studies by Hayflick on mycoplasma has provided the most data.  There are 
pathogenic mycoplasma that can kill cells used as targets for virus.  Some 
mycoplasma can induce CPE and make it confusing about whether the cells are 
virally infected.  Other mycoplasma can interfere with analyses that are 
morphological or biochemical. There are few solutions with respect to ridding 
cultures already infected with mycoplasma.  Use of gentamicin as a preventative 
is typical.
<p>
Contaminating viruses can complicate the picture.  Rhesus monkey kidney cells 
are normally used to produce inactive polio virions for use in vaccination.  One 
NIH researcher tested inactivated poliovirus using African green monkey cells 
but still found CPE in the kidney cells, in which extensive vacuolation 
occurred.  Thus another virus was present in the inactivated polio suspension. 
This was SV40, an oncogenic virus present in monkey and rodents, and it produces 
malignant tumors in aged animals.  Thus many humans were now found to possess 
high titers of SV40.

<p class="date">
11 Oct 1982
<p>
A <b>clone</b> of cells is a pure population of cells derived as daughters from 
a single cell.  To establish a clone of pig kidney cells the following procedure 
might be used:

<ol>
<li>isolate and irradiate a &ldquo;feeder layer&rdquo; of beef kidney
cells; they will not replicate but they will metabolize
<li>take a terminal dilution of cells (1 cell to be seeded into a
plate)
<li>wait for replication to proceed
</ol>

<p>
<img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/RubinExpt.gif" class="img-right"
 alt="Rubin's experiment with cell density and conditioned medium">

<p>
In experiments by Rubin, cells in cell lines possibly secreted growth 
stimulating substances (as are present in serum).  He did certain experiments to 
produce conditioned media using chick fibroblasts. On the floor of a set of 
petri dishes, circles were drawn with various diameters.  Then chick fibroblasts 
were placed on the circles to fit the area:  Each petri dish received the same 
count of cells, so that the only difference would be the initial cell seeding 
density. Rubin determined that cell proliferation proceeded at a greater rate 
when the cell density was higher (i.e., when the cells were closer together).
<p>
In additional experiments, when Rubin used plain (unconditioned) medium, there 
was greater variation in the final cell numbers/counts.  When using conditioned 
medium, the final counts were nearly identical.

<p>
<img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/RubinExpt2.gif" class="img-right"
 alt="Rubin's data on conditioned medium">
<p>
Rubin also tried different dilutions/mixtures of conditioned and plain medium. 
He found that cell counts were greater when the proportion of conditioned medium 
was increased, indicating the presence of proliferation-promoting factors in the 
medium.  This was independent of initial cell seeding density.
<p>
Rubin reported that when coverslips containing presumed growth stimulating 
factors were placed in media, proliferation was stimulated.  Substances 
identified as having growth-promoting capabilities:
<ol>
<li>hormones
<li>serum
<li>platelets
<li>tissues &amp; organs
</ol>
<p>
Tumor cells grow independently of such factors.  An overdose of growth factors 
can however make normal tissue look like tumorigenic tissue.
<p>
Abercrombie discovered the phenomenon of contact inhibition when he
noticed the abrupt cessation of the expansion of mouse fibroblasts.
If he mixed cells of two different types or from even different species,
the observation was the same.  Cells expand in a monolayer in culture, and
then stop.
<p>
If cells were infected with oncogenic virus however, they were 
<i>transformed</i> and lost the feature of inhibition of expansion by contact. 
This was also true if large amounts of growth-promoting factors are added.

<h1>Quantitating (Assaying) Virus</h1>
<p>
Assays should consider both the counts of total and infectious virus that are 
released per cell or present per unit volume.
<p>
Hemagglutination assays work well with certain kinds of virus, such as influenza 
virus.  Virus can be titered through serial dilutions looking for 
&ldquo;buttons&rdquo; at the bottom of tubes.  The highest dilution showing 
agglutination represents the limiting titer of the virus. There are generally 10 
viral particles per RBC in an agglutination reaction, and so if 1 million RBCs 
are present, then 10 million virions are present. If the dilution was 1:60, then 
the concentrated stock can be said to have 600 million virions.  In this case 
this is <b>total</b> virus, for the hemagglutination does not test infectious 
virus.

<p>
Infectious virus quantitation requires some sort of bioassay, in which an 
LD<sub>50</sub> or TCID<sub>50</sub> is determined.  Logarithmic dilutions of 
virus are taken and injected into a set of animals, say <i>n</i> = 6 for each 
dilution.  Suppose the data reads according to the table at left.  Half the 
animals died when 0.1 ml of the 10<sup>&minus;2</sup> dilution was used.  This 
represents the LD<sub>50</sub>.  Thus the original stock contains 10<sup>3</sup> 
LD<sub>50</sub> units/ml.
<p>
Often it is necessary to interpolate either TCID<sub>50</sub> or LD<sub>50</sub> 
data because the halfway point is not an experimental point on the plot. 
Consider the tabular data obtained from a plaque assay in which CPE is the 
observable:

<table style="float:left;margin-right:2em;" class="centered">
<col><col style="width:12em;">
<tr><th>Dilution <th>Count of Plates of Cells with CPE / Total Plates in Group
<tr><td>10<sup>&minus;3</sup> <td>8/8
<tr><td>10<sup>&minus;4</sup> <td>8/8
<tr><td>10<sup>&minus;5</sup> <td>7/8
<tr><td>10<sup>&minus;6</sup> <td>2/8
<tr><td>10<sup>&minus;7</sup> <td>0/8
<tr><td>10<sup>&minus;8</sup> <td>1/8
<tr><td colspan="2" style="font-size:75%;text-align:left;">0.1 ml
of each dilution was used
</table>
<p>
A <i>proportional distance</i> formula is necessary to evaluate the true point.

<table class="eqnserif">
<tr><td rowspan="2">proportional distance =
 <td class="numer"> <i>P</i><sub>&gt;50%</sub> &minus; 0.50
<tr><td><i>P</i><sub>&gt;50%</sub> &minus; <i>P</i><sub>&lt;50%</sub>
</table>
<p>
where <i>P</i><sub>&gt;50%</sub> is an experimental data point representing the 
proportion just above the 50% level and <i>P</i><sub>&lt;50%</sub> is the 
experimental data point representing the proportion just below the 50% level. 
Thus the value is (7/8 &minus; 0.50) / (7/8 &minus; 2/8) = 0.6.  This is the 
distance from the value <i>above</i> the 50% mark.  Suppose that the dilution 
(<i>x</i> scale) has <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> with the value 7/8 and 
<i>x</i><sub>2</sub> with the value 2/8.  Now if the <i>x</i> scale is a linear 
scale, then the TCID<sub>50</sub> is calculated as <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> &minus; 
0.6 (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub> &minus; <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>).  For a log scale  the 
TCID<sub>50</sub> is 10<sup><i>x</i><sub>1</sub> &minus; 0.6</sup>.  In this 
case it is 10<sup>&minus;5 &minus; 0.6</sup> = 10<sup>&minus;5.6</sup>.  The 
measure of virus per milliliter is thus 1 / (10<sup>&minus;5.6</sup>) (0.1 ml) = 
10<sup>6.6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> units/ml.  As this is an assay of infectious 
virus, it is a true bioassay.  Normally it take 100-1000 infectious virus to 
produce CPE in a cell.
<p>
<b>Plaque assays</b> typically require the mixture of target cells with a 
semi-solification agent such as agar (about a 1% mix).  This prevents the broad 
diffusion of virus in a liquid medium.  When virus infect a group of cells, a 
&ldquo;plaque&rdquo; forms representing the contained grouping of infected 
cells.  A vital dye (such as neutral red) can then be used to visualize the 
infected cells in plaques against the uninfected cells. Theoretically 1 plaque 
represents 1 infectious virus, although in practice it could be 1-3 orders of 
magnitude more.  With plaque assays, it is typically to express the results as 
<b>plaque-forming units</b> (PFUs) since to express them as 1 infectious virion 
may not be correct.  Numerous factors can be misleading regarding the 1 pfu per 
infectious virion notion. First is virus aggregation or clustering.  Also for 
different viruses the multiplicity of infection (virus per infected cell) might 
differ. There may also be chemical influences, such as the agar causing 
inactivation of viral components.
<p>
There are many different ways of observing or noting viral infection or viral 
assay.  With the hemagluttinating influenza virus, it is aggregated RBCs around 
a cell (a plaque).  With poliovirus, immunofluoresence is used to count plaques. 
With a tumor virus, piling phenomena represent the plaque.

Frequently one type of infectious or defective virus will interfere with
the infection caused by another type.  <i>Autointerference</i> or
<i>homologous interference</i> are certain types of interference with the
infection process.
<p>
The <b>multiplicity of infection</b> (abbreviated &ldquo;MOI&rdquo; or
&ldquo;m.o.i.&rdquo;) is the ratio of virions or pfu to the ratio of
target cells exposed to infection.  Suppose there are 10<sup>6</sup> PFU
or virions to 10<sup>6</sup> cells:  then the MOI = 1.  If the MOI = 0.01
and there are 10<sup>6</sup> cells, then the count of PFU or virions used
is 10<sup>4</sup>.

<p>
In a study by Magnus 1940 of influenza virus, infection and re-infection of 
target cells by virus (passaging virus) showed that the count of infectious 
virus (shown by an LD<sub>50</sub> study) was reduced as a proportion of the 
total virus produced (shown by doing a hemagglutination titer). Total virus 
actually remained somewhat constant. Only the count of infectious virus fell 
(see table at right).
<p>
The <b>vesicular stomatitis virus</b> (VSV) is a member of Rhabdoviridae. Under 
EM, it shows the virus has two forms, <b>B</b> and <b>T</b> which differ in size 
and which can be separated by isopycnic equilibrium centrifugation.  Both 
viruses have a bullet shape, but the B form is larger, with a 65 nm width and 
175 nm on the long axis.  The T form is more square with a 65 nm in both width 
and length along the bullet axis. The B form is denser however, and bands lower 
on centrifugation.
<p>
In one study the B form virus was grown in cell cultures labeled with 
<sup>32</sup>P-UTP.  It was then mixed with T form virus and the plaques were 
counted.  What was seen was the T form virions were defective, containing 
deletion mutants of RNA.  The T form also interfered with B form particle 
replication of genome; there was no interference however with the infection 
process (attachment, penetration, etc.).  Also T form virus did not interfere 
with other viruses such as polio.
<p>
It was also found that when T virions are treated with intense UV light, no 
interference occurs with B form infection.  Because cells can make interferon 
that can also interfere with infection, actinomycin D (a DNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase inhibitor) was also included in the infection culture.  T virions 
were not entirely defective:  they replicated themselves and appeared to compete 
with B particle/genome replication, perhaps having a greater affinity for 
replicase.
<p>
A <b>persistent infection</b> in an animal is one in which infection is with a 
defective virus and one in which the infection shown subclinical symptoms of 
illness.

<h1>Viral Multiplication</h1>
<p>
The stages of viral infection are reviewed:

<ol>
<li>attachment
<li>penetration
<li>uncoating
<li>replication
<li>maturation
<li>release
</ol>

<h2>Attachment</h2>
<p>
This process is dynamic, occurs rapidly, and is effectively independent of 
temperature.  Indeed, infections of cultured cells are usually done at 4&deg;.	
Cations such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, DEAE are added to enhance 
attachment:  it could be that they neutralize charge repulsions in the membranes 
(or coats) of virus and target cell.
<p>
Attachment is usually quite <b>specific</b>, and strictly <b>lock-and-key</b>. 
Viruses usually target receptors on the cell to be infected.  But the 
specificity of the receptor can provide a broad or narrow host range. Poliovirus 
can infect only primates, whereas VSV has a much broader host range.
<p>
As a test that the viral coat/body determines infection, poliovirus was exposed 
to dog kidney cell cultures.   The cells failed to become infected.  When 
poliovirus RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the RNA mixed with 
calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>), the dog kidney cells became infected 
(actually <b>transfected</b>) and produced poliovirus.
<p>
An <b>attachment assay</b> is a plot or curve of the proportion or count of PFU 
against time of infection.  A negative control, which is a virus that cannot 
infect the target cell, must be used in such an assay.
<p>
<img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/SaturationStudy.gif" class="img-right" 
alt="A study of the saturation of attached viruses"> 
A <b>saturation study</b> is where virions are added to the cell culture until 
no more virions attach.  The cell and virion counts must be known. Typically 
radiolabeled virions are used and the cpm values followed to indicate 
saturation.  The curve at the right shows such a saturation plot, where the 
multiplicity of attached virus is plotted against an input multiplicity.  In the 
plot, 15,000 virions per cell were placed in the inoculum, but the attached 
multiplicity did not increase proportionally, and thus the virions saturated the 
cells.  In this particular plot, HeLa cells were the target, and both adenovirus 
type 2 and poliovirus used to infect the same cells. The fact that the viruses 
could infect the same cell indicate they had different receptors.

<h2>Penetration</h2>
<p>
There are three types of penetration by the virus into host cells:
<b>direct, fusion</b>, and <b>viropexis</b>.  Viruses usually use only
adapt a mechanism which makes use of one of these forms.
<p>
Penetration is temperature-dependent, with the optimal temperature being the 
host cell survival temperature (usually 37&deg; in mammals). To study the type 
of penetration done by a virus, cells can be infected at low temperature to 
attach virus, then the temperature raised and samples taken for study under 
electron microscope.  Poliovirus infection is <b>direct</b>
<p>
With <b>fusion</b>, the virus is equipped with a set of enzymes that cause 
degradation or which results in a fusion of the cells.  The nucleocapsid then 
enters the cell.
<p>
In <b>viropexis</b>, the virus enters the cell through ingestion into a vacuole 
(endocytosis).  The vacuole is then associated with a lysosome containing 
degradative enzymes that help assist the virus into the cell. Not in all cases 
does a phagolysosome formation enable viral infection; in fact many viruses may 
be inactivated that way. Viropexis can be inhibited by changes in NaCl, which 
inhibits electron transport, or by cytochalasin B, indicating the action of 
microfilaments involved in infection.

<p>
<b>Adenovirus</b> is a ds DNA virus with uncoated icosahedral body. At its 
penton vertices (there are 12 in an icosahedron), there are <i>fibers</i> that 
extend into <i>knobs</i>.  The virus attaches to its host cell via the knobs. 
The following study of adenovirus attachment, penetration and overall infection 
comes from the following types of data: (1) electron microscopy (EM), (2) 
biochemical studies using DNase activity and cell fractionation of the nucleus 
and cytoplasm. 15 min after attachment, the virus has penetrated the cell, and 
the nucleocapsid is broken down, with 30% of the DNA now in the nucleus. To 
study the progress of infection, <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA in adenovirus was 
used.  At different points in time in the infection, the virus is washed from 
the cells, and then cells are broken open in a medium maintaining an intact 
nucleus and the cytoplasm separated from the nucleus.  DNase can be added at 
different points in the infection, then stopped, and then the cytoplasm 
separated and acid added to precipitate it.
<p>
After 15 min, 50-80% of DNA is still associated with virus.  Pentons are thought 
to be lost and thus virus is susceptible to DNase attack. Penetrated virus 
migrates to the nucleus.  Treatment with NP-40 breaks open the cytoplasm without 
disrupting nuclei.  Count of the radioactivity shows 30% of the total is 
associated with the nuclear portion after 2 h.
<p>
Many labeling chemicals are used in viral studies.  5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 
also BUdR) as well as the fluoro- and iododeoxyuridine analogues are used.  They 
are incorporated both RNA and DNA (in DNA, they are thymine analogues).  FUdR 
(or FRdU) inhibits the enzyme <b>thymidylate synthetase</b>.  dTTP available for 
DNA synthesis is made by one of two processes:

<p class="eqnserif" style="margin-left:4em;text-align:left;">
[1a]&nbsp;&nbsp;thymine + 2-deoxyribose-phosphate &rarr; thymidine (TdR)
<br>
[1b]&nbsp;&nbsp;TdR + ATP &rarr; <b>dTMP</b> + ADP
<br><br>
[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;dUMP + S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) &rarr; <b>dTMP</b> +
 S-adenosylhomocysteine
<p>
Reaction [2] is catalyzed by thymidylate synthetase.
<p>
<b>Actinomycin D</b> is frequently used in viral studies.  This antibiotic
inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerases.  It does this by binding to
double-stranded DNA with sequences 5'-GC-3'.
<p>
Protein synthesis inhibitors used in viral studies include (1) cycloheximide
and (2) puqcmycin.  Both of these inhibit chain elongation by stopping
ribosome movement or dissociation of the ribosome.

<p class="date">
25 Oct 1982

<p>
Viruses take advantage of all the biological mechanisms used by eukaryotic cells 
to produce themselves.  A primary transcript is produced as RNA, then processed 
to form messenger RNA (mRNA).  A poly(A) tail is attached to the 3' end and may 
act to (1) guide the mRNA to the cytoplasm for translation and (2) protect the 
mRNA against RNase degradation.  In addition three enzymes put on a 5' <b>guanyl 
cap</b>.  First the 5'-phosphate on the mRNA is removed by a 5'-phosphatase 
(phosphohydrolase).  Then a guanyltransferase attaches a 7-methylguanine 
triphosphate to the 5'-end releasing a pyrophosphate which is later hydrolyzed. 
Then the first two bases of the mRNA get methylated on their ribose molecules 
using a methyltransferase and S-adenosylmethionine.  The mRNA is finally ready.
<p>
<b>Hybridization</b> is a technique typically used in virology. Double-stranded 
forms are either heat- or alkali-denatured (RNA degrades under alkaline 
conditions!)  and then pH or temperature is restored to native conditions and 
re-annealing or re-association followed. Hybridization is usually optimal at 
25&deg; less than the melting temperature.
<p>
<b>Nick translation</b> is a way of radiolabeling DNA of any type. Take the DNA 
preparation, add the correct amount of DNase type I to create 
&ldquo;nicks&rdquo; or cuts in the DNA without degrading it, then add Kornberg's 
<i>E coli</i> polymerase I, which has a 5'&minus;&gt;3' polymerase and 
exonuclease activity, along with dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and <sup>32</sup>P-dTTP.  The 
polymerase finds the nicks and removes the nucleotides ahead of it while adding 
them with its polymerase activity. It is important not to use polymerase which 
also has a 3'&minus;&gt;5' exonuclease activity.  As much as 10<sup>9</sup>cpm 
per picogram DNA can be incorporated.
<p>
Probes can be mixed with heat-denatured excess unlabeled nucleic acid of virus 
in ratios of &micro;g of probe to mg of unlabeled material. Hybridization is 
allowed to proceed.  At various times during hybridization aliquots are taken. 
S1 nuclease is added to each aliquot to digest single-stranded nucleic acid 
(unhybridized form).  TCA is added to bring it to 5% to precipitate undigested 
ds DNA.  The ppt. is collected on the filters.  If each aliquot had an initial 
1000 cpm and the filter has 250 cpm, the 50% of the DNA was digested.  This also 
means that 50% of the DNA was hybridized.
<img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/CotCurve.gif" class="img-left"
 alt="A Cot curve">
<p>
Now plot the percent hybridization (0 on top, 100 on the bottom) against the 
<i>C</i><sub>0</sub><i>t</i> (in moles L<sup>&minus;1</sup> s). 
<i>C</i><sub>0</sub> is the initial DNA concentration (suppose 3 mM, which is a 
1 mg/ml DNA concentration).  At 1 hour, the <i>C</i><sub>0</sub><i>t</i> = 10.8, 
and 2h, it is 21.6.  The curve is a descending sigmoid curve.  By analyzing the 
curve and its asymptote, one can learn about the kind or class of DNA and the 
homology.  In the plot to the left, curve 1 shows 100% homology since all of it 
hybridizes at some point.  Curve 2 shows only 50% homology.  Curve 3 shows 100% 
homology, and this may actually represent self-hybridized labeled DNA in the 
label.  If more probe DNA were added to the solution and curve 3 shifted to the 
left, then it would prove that curve 3 was the probe.
<p>
The assessment of transcription can be made using <i>R</i><sub>0</sub><i>t</i> 
curve analysis.  DNA is hybridized to labeled RNA and single-stranded from 
digested.  At different time points in the hybridization, aliquots are taken and 
plotted.

<h1>Poxvirus</h1>
<p>
<img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/PoxVirus.gif" class="img-left"
 alt="">
<img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/PoxVirus2.gif" class="img-left"

Also called <b>vaccinia</b> and <b>variola</b>. The pox virus is 300 nm long and 
200 nm wide and can be visualized in a light microscope.  The nuceloid is 
surrounded by an outer limiting membrane.  It is a member of the complex virus, 
and is associated with microtubules and microfilaments.  The outer envelope does 
not come from budding but is synthesized in the cytoplasm.
<p>
Viral DNA is inside the nucleoid.  The two strands at each terminus are 
covalently linked to one another, and thus any denaturation would result in 
rapid re-annealing.  The termini are actually inverted repeats and this makes 
them useful in replication (helping in the formation of a circular 
intermediate).  The genome has a size of 231 kb (150 MDa).

<p>
Infection begins with attachment and penetration by viropexis.  After the virus 
is phagocytically internalized, a lysosome associate and degrades the outer coat 
to reveal the core.  DNase sensitivity tests to see how long it takes to expose 
the DNA shows that this process takes an hour.
<p>
The core has associated with it several proteins/enzymes. A DNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase which then begins to transcribe a portion of the genome, marking the 
early phase of infection.  Also present is a poly(A) polymerase, a protein 
kinase, thymidine kinase, phosphatases for the DNA, methyl and 
guanyltransferases, and endo- and exonucleases for ss DNA. The early 
transcription product codes for an <b>uncoating</b> protein that removes the 
coat associated with the rest of the virus, exposing the DNA to more 
transcription.
<p>
The late mRNA sequences are made and these code for the coat proteins. These 
coat proteins are made in <b>viroplasm</b> or &ldquo;virus factories&rdquo; 
created out of the cytoplasm.  Proteins in the core have not yet been 
identified.
<p>
Much of the evidence for these findings come from the following data:
<ol>
<li>Cycloheximide added with the virus prevents uncoating, because uncoating
protein is not made.  The same thing occurs when actinomycin D is added.
<li>Virus was treated with Triton X-100 to dissolve envelope and obtain
cores, and was then incubated with dNTPs (with Mg<sup>2+</sup> and
Mn<sup>2+</sup>).  After some time, an acid-precipitable product was formed.
It was hybridized with pure viral DNA, digested with S1 nuclease.  All
product was ds DNA.
<li>Cellular activity continues for 6 h after infection after which RNA
synthesis is arrested, the protein synthesis after 1 h and after 4 h
the cell dies.
<li>When protein synthesis is arrested and early mRNA synthesis is monitored,
transcripts are hybridized to cDNA from the virus:  14% of the genome
is coded for and this corresponds to the uncoated part of the core.
</ol>

<h1>Adenovirus</h1>
<p>
The adenovirus has a genome of ds linear DNA with a 30 kbp size (20-23 MDa). 
With the exception of the poxvirus, which replicates in viroplasms formed in the 
cytoplasm, all DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus of the cell.

<p class="date">
29 Oct 1982
<p>
The 5'-end of the adenoviral genome is covalently bound to a protein
which possibly is used to circularize the DNA for replication after
attachment and penetration.  Inverted repeats are present on the terminals
to permit stem-loop formation.
<p>
Penetration is by a phagolysosome (viropexis).
<p>
Unlike the poxvirus, adenovirus does not code for its own replication machinery. 
Its DNA enters the nucleus, where transcription takes place and early mRNA is 
produced (15% of the code of the left and right strands). This is then exported 
to the cytoplasm where it codes for a viral DNA polymerase (T antigen). This 
polymerase then moves back into the nucleus to replicate the genome, which is 
also transcribed.
<p>
Late mRNA synthesis is on long polycistronic transcripts (mainly on the <b>r</b> 
strand). Somewhere between 10-15 structural proteins are expressed in the 
cytoplasm. These too are imported back into the nucleus and assembled around the 
viral DNA.  Cell arrest and lysis then occurs as a result of cell lysosome 
activity.  15 h after infection, all cell protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis is 
arrested.  This arrest is probably due to inhibition by viral proteins; purified 
penton and hexon proteins from adenovirus capsids can inhibit many of these 
activities.
<p>
The ds viral DNA is composed of an &lsquo;r&rsquo; (for &lsquo;right&rsquo;) and 
&lsquo;l&rsquo; (for &lsquo;left&rsquo;) strand.  80% of the &lsquo;r&rsquo; 
strand codes for late genes and 12% for early genes. 20% of the &lsquo;l&rsquo; 
strand codes for late, and 8% for early genes. Experiments with puromycin 
(inhibits protein synthesis) and actinomycin D (inhibits transcription) were 
done to make these distinctions between early and late genes.
<p>
The hexon is produced as a large transcript with 15 introns which are processed 
into the final message.  R loops are seen when mRNA is hybridized to viral DNA 
(loops are introns of the viral DNA).  Hence virus contains introns like 
eukaryotic DNA.
<p>
Adenovirus can hemagglutinate monkey and rat RBCs.  Adenovirus is classified 
into four (I-IV) subgroups and 31 types largely based on serotypes 
(immunochemistry).  This is due to variation in the immunological determinants 
on the hexons and the soluble antigen in the pentons.
<p>
Of the ds DNA viruses, pox carries its own replicative apparatus, but adenovirus 
and herpesvirus depend upon host cell's replicative apparatus.

<h1>ss DNA viruses:  Parvovirus</h1>
<p>
The <b>parvovirus</b> has a genome for 3 proteins on its ss DNA.  The terminal
ends of the virus are inverted repeats, which allows the virus to circularize 
quickly to form a double-stranded replicative intermediate.  The formation of a 
double-stranded form means primers are not necessary.
<p>
<b>Adeno-associated virus</b> (AAV) is a defective parvovirus type which cannot 
replicate itself, but depends on co-infection with adenovirus to persist. The 
single-strands come in a plus (lsquo;+&rsquo;) and minus (lsquo;&minus;&rsquo;) 
form, and both are packaged into capsids in equimolar amounts.  Only + 
parvovirus types can be infective.  There is one group of nondefective 
parvoviruses infecting cats and dogs in which the + strand alone is virulent.

<img src="imagesAnimalVirologyHTML/Herpesvirus.gif" class="img-left"
 alt="Herpesvirus biology">


<h1>Picornaviruses</h1>
<p>
These are ss RNA viruses with naked (unenveloped) icosahedral nucleocapsids.
Poliovirus is the classic example (types I, II, and III). Other viruses include 
enterovirus, echovirus, and coxsackie.
<p>
The genome has a poly(A) tail of about 90 bases and an associated viral 
glycoprotein (VPg) at the 5'-end.  The 5'-end has a pUp configuration without 
the eukaryotic cap.  There is a <b>D antigen</b> associated with the fully 
infectious viruses.  The <b>C antigen</b> is present in empty particles;  empty 
particles are missing VPg, VP2, and VP4.  Antibodies produced against poliovirus 
during immunization are both neutralizing and able to fix complement.  Humans 
are the only host to poliovirus.
<p>
Attachment and penetration of poliovirus is rapid, independent of temperature
but dependent upon certain electrolytes.  Only particles with D antigen
penetrate (and the presence of VP4 is required).  About 50% of particles
are infectious.
<p>
The genome of the virus is actually a plus (+) strand.  It is immediately 
engaged by ribosomes in the cytoplasm and translated into a high MW (250 kDa) 
polyprotein.	This polyprotein is then hydrolyzed at various points into 
functional proteins, one of which is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
(transcriptase).  The transcriptase then begins to synthesize negative (&minus;) 
strands as replicative intermediates for synthesis of + strands to be used in 
virion genomes. The synthesis of a + strand is 10 times faster than synthesis of 
the &minus; strand, probably a function of the promoter.
<p>
No hybridization of messenger RNA occurs with the virion RNA, indicating
that all coding is on the + strand.
<p>
During the replication of the RNA genome, VPg is covalently attached but will 
sometimes be cleaved to promote its use as a message for translation.

<p>
Release of poliovirus is rapid and intracellullar accumulation of virus rarely 
occurs.  For the enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, the envelope has a lipid 
membrane.  The herpesvirus cloaks itself in the nuclear membrane, while the 
para- and orthomyxoviruses use the plasma membrane.
