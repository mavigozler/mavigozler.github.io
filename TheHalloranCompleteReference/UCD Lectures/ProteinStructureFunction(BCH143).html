The following is a transcription of notes taken by S. M. Halloran
when he was an undergraduate student at the University of California
at Davis.
<p>
The lectures were given by Professor Jerry Hedrick.  The dates of the
lecture are noted.

Course is graded on a combination of homework problems and take-home
examinations.  Exams do not emphasize memorization but rather setting
up or predicting experimental results.
<p>
Synthesis gives rise to structure and structure gives rise to function.
A similar example of how scientists might look at proteins is that
they might see a moving object they call a car, then they would pulverize
it to its atomic form, then leave intact the functional parts, and this
sets the stage to examine the whole.

<h1>History</h1>
<p>
Begins in the 1930s with advent of molecular biology, the interaction
of cellular, organic molecules which function to create a perpetuating
system.  Molecular biology could be divided into two ways:

<ol>
<li>1 dimensional:  studying transcription, translations
<li>3 dimensional:  the study of protein structure and function
  (American school)
</ol>
<p>
Delbrooke led the American school as a physicist, whereas Watson and
Crick were the 1-D scientists.  Perutz and Kendrew (both physicists)
led a predominantly English school who said biology was explained
by laws of chemistry and physics.  Delbr&uuml;ck did not agree, but
current research has shown that chemistry and physical laws do apply to
biology.

<p>
History of Proteins &mdash; The discovery of the six axioms mentioned in the 
previous lecture were the result of research.  Amino acids were discovered about 
100 years earlier.  In 1820, while having an interest in the acid hydrolysis of 
sugar polymers, Brasconnot isolated a crystal from sugar that was 
<b>glycine</b>.  He called the sweet-tasting substance <i>sucre de 
gel&aacute;tin</i>  Brasconnot's reason for obtaining <b>Gly</b> was because he 
chose to boil collagen, which is 25 mol percent glycine.  Its structure was not 
elucidated until 1857, 37 years later.
<p>
Protein chemistry got its start by the first attempts to label substances that 
might have protein.  The first approach was rather drastic:  hydrolysis by acid. 
The first separation of products involved crystallization of the several, if 
any, components and then characterize them (MW, density, pH).  After all 
characterization, then efforts at synthesis are begun to reconstruct the initial 
substance.
<p>
By the start of the 20th century, 12 of the 20 amino acids were known. Emil 
Fischer shortly discovered three more:  proline, hydroxyproline, and valine. 
Curtis had found that esterification of amino acids made them volatile so that 
separation by fractional distillation could be achieved, and Fischer used this 
technique to make his own discoveries.

<p>
<b>Fischer's numerous contributions</b>. Fischer proposed a <b>lock-and-key</b> 
theory of enzymatic action at this time.  He also knew that amino acids were 
linked in a polymer, and called the linking bond the <b>peptide bond</b>. The 
terms <q>peptide,</q> <q>polypeptide,</q> and the naming of 
peptides as <q>glycinylalanyl...</q> are nomenclature that was used by 
Fischer.  Fischer also developed the <b>biuret</b> assay for proteins, an assay 
still used today.
<p>
By 1935, 17 amino acids had been discovered.  Certain scientists investigating 
essential vitamins and substances in the animal and one of them, Rose, found 
that the amino acid <b>threonine</b> helped against nutritional deficiency.  The 
last two, glutamine and asparagine, were not discovered until proteases were 
used to study amino acids;  the harsh methods used to tear proteins and peptides 
apart, especially even mild acid hydrolysis, destroy the side chain amide of 
these amino acids such that they are indistinguishable from two other amino 
acids, glutamic acid and aspartic acid.
<p style="margin-top:2em;">
Svedberg's studies revealed that proteins are discrete macromolecular entities 
and not colloids, which was hypothesized. Enzymes are proteins with a catalytic 
function, and this was found by the first purification of these class of 
proteins by the crystallization of urease and of pepsin.
<p>
In the last 20 years some conventions regarding proteins have been retained. 
For example the classification of proteins by the British Physiological Society 
is based on the solubility of proteins:

<table class="td-left th-center">
<caption>British Physiological Society Classification of Proteins
 By Solubility</caption>
<tr><th>Category  <th>Solubility
<tr><td>albumins  <td>very water soluble:  water itself is sufficient
<tr><td>globulin  <td>salted water is required to solubilize
<tr><td>protamines<td>insoluble in water, but soluble in 50-90% ethanol
<tr><td>glutelins <td>acid or base soluble
<tr><td>scleroproteins <td>insoluble in any case
</table>

<p>
Further classes include acidic or basic, fibrous or globular, structural or 
active (enzymatic).  Within the so-called <i>active</i> proteins, a numerical 
classification was developed:

<ol>
<li>Catalytic:  having a binding function that causes a chemical
action on the ligands
<li>Immune (defense):  having a binding action that immobilizes
<li>Carrier (transport): binding occurs followed by transport or transfer
<li>Regulatory:  binding of the ligand causes a change in the activity
of the ligand
<li>Contractile:  binding causes or affects movement with the use
of energy
</ol>

<h1>Structural Features of Amino Acids and Peptide Bond</h1>
<p>
The peptide bond is planar and its stability, i.e. strong resistance to 
breaking, is because of the resonance of electrons in the bond. In describing 
the successive of peptide bonds in peptides/proteins the planes they form show a 
relationship through various angles, which are called &phi;<sub><i>i</i></sub> 
and &psi;<sub><i>i</i></sub>. Using this information, Pauling hypothesized that 
proteins could form what he called an &alpha;-helix, largely because the angular 
planes of peptide bonds rotated on the pivot &alpha;-carbon, already so named.
<p>
<b>Alpha helix</b>.  The &alpha;-helix is a 3.6<sub>13</sub> helix, a 
nomenclature that means there are 3.6 residues per turn of the helix, and 13 
atoms in the hydrogen-bonding scheme.  A 3<sub>10</sub> and 4.3<sub>16</sub> 
(also called &pi;-helix) are also theoretically possible, although the pi-helix 
has never been found to exist.

<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/RamachandranPlot.gif" alt="Ramanchandran Plot"
style="float:right;margin-left:3em;">
Ramachandran developed a plot for the allowed peptide bond planar angles about 
the &alpha;-carbon.  The allowed angles fall within the shaded boxes, with the 
abscissa showing &phi; and the ordinate showing &psi;.
<p>
<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/PhiPsiBondAngles.gif" style="float:right;"
alt="Perspective of peptide bond planes and the phi and psi angles">
The &alpha;-helix is wound so tightly that water cannot get in. With the 
&beta;-pleated sheet, both a parallel and an anti-parallel activity are seen. 
In the &beta;-sheet, the side chains of the amino acids tend to line up in one 
plane;  more stable &beta;-sheets form if the side chain groups are sterically 
small.  The protein silk is an example of a &beta;sheet structure of protein. In 
1969, the &psi; and &phi; angles were changed so that they are now 180&deg; 
opposite.

<h1>Bonding Character</h1>

<table class="th-center" style="float:right;clear:right;margin-left:2em;width:25em;">
<tr><th>Bond                  <th>Energy<br>(kcal/mole)
<tr><td>H bond                <td class="data">3-4

</table>
<p>
Hydrogen bonding stabilizes structural formation to provide the lowest free 
energy.  Bond strength is ~3-4 kcal/mole.
<p>
Van der Waals bonding becomes important in the packing and ordering of 
molecules.  Denatured and native proteins show a tremendous difference in free 
energy:
<p style="text-align:center;">
  native&nbsp;&harr;&nbsp;denatured&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Delta;<i>G</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;4&nbsp;to&nbsp;&minus;15&nbsp;kcal/mol
<p>
Methods of denaturing proteins include the following:
<ul>
<li><b>detergents</b> &mdash; SDS is used to disrupt bonds but can
be removed to restore the native state
<li><b>heat</b> will permanently denature a protein
<li><b>urea</b> and <b>guanidinium chloride</b> are thought to act
on water and cause unravelling of the protein by taking away its
water.
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/ureates.gif" alt="urea and guanidinium chloride structures">
</ul>

<h1>Dynamic Character of Proteins</h1>
<p>
The molecular state of a protein would seemingly seem static, but evidence shows 
that the atoms making up a protein are quite dynamic. Experiments with tritium 
[<sup>3</sup>H] exchange demonstrate this. In equilibrium, an amine moiety takes 
on a proton:

<p style="text-align:center;">
&mdash;NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sup>+</sup> &harr; &mdash;NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>
<p>
but this does not occur in aqueous solution or on the surface of a protein 
rapidly.  The rate at which <sup>3</sup>H-labeled protein equilibrates with 
water will establish the dynamics.  The unlabeled protein is first incubated in 
tritiated water for days.  Then the protein is run on a gel filtration column to 
remove it from the triated water and exchange it is normal water.
<p>
A various times and temperatures, the solution is sampled and the protein 
removed in order to count isotope exchanged in the water. At 0&deg; the exchange 
takes many hours and never reaches completion. At 38&deg; the exchange occurs 
much more rapidly and is practically complete after 10 hours.  When urea is 
added to the 0&deg; protein, it occurs as quickly as the higher temperature 
protein, indicating that solvent access to the protein.
<p>
X-ray crystallography also shows the dynamic state of the amino acid
side chains for residues on the surface.  Anfinsen demonstrated that
the 2&deg; and 3&deg; structure of a protein depends on its 1&deg;.
His work on pancreatic RNase is typical.  8 M urea and mercaptoethanol
reduce -S-S- bonds and cause protein to assume random coil.  Dialysis
brought back a great percentage, but not all of the activity.  If the
-SH groups were oxidized, an inactive non-native structure persisted.
These experiments revealed that disulfide bonds do not determine
2&deg; or 3&deg; structure (laws regarding entropy demonstrate that),
but they stabilize it.  The native state is also not the most stable:
<ol>
<li>Stabilizing the interaction of the amino acid side chains
determines 2&deg; and 3&deg; structure
<li>Proteins are dynamic
<li>Bonds other than covalent are the primary ties that form the protein
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>
<q>A protein is not a solid house into which the visitor (the ligand) enters 
by opening doors without changing the structure.  Rather it is like a tent into 
which a cow strays.</q>	  
<br> <i>Modern</i> (Cf. Historical) <i>Axioms</i> (after 1960) [?]
</blockquote>
<p>
The current hypothesis about denaturants such as urea and guanidinium HCl
is that they are thought to change the character of the solvent.
<p>
Some observations about proteins:
<ol>
<li>Overall structure is compact, regular and irregular.
<li>No polar residues usually inside;  polar usually outside, ionized
groups are always outside.
<li>The conformation of residues is close to those of isolated units
(most residues follow the &phi; and &psi; angle plots).
<li>Atoms will remain fixed in space but are microscopically dynamic.
<li>Large proteins fold into <b>domains</b> about 40-150 residues in
size and each domain connects to another through a simple polypeptide
sequence
<li>Larger proteins are obtained by aggregation.
</ol>
<p>
Methods for ascertaining 2&deg; and 3&deg; structures based upon a
knowledge of the 1&deg; sequence come from known or correlated data
of proteins whose 2&deg; and 3&deg; structures are known.  Two approaches
are used:
<ol>
<li><b>Probabilistic</b>:  no proteins with an &alpha;-helix deviate
from the 3.6<sub>13</sub>.  At least 10-12 proteins necessary to
distinguish &alpha;-helix.  The possibilities are averaged and predictions
are made according to the average.
<li><b>Physicochemical</b>: uses a non-mathematical method.
</ol>
<p>(Carter and Schimmel in Chap. 5 address these methods).

<h1>Methods for Protein Isolation</h1>
<p>Various properties pertaining to proteins are used to achieve their
separation and purification.
<p>
Consider hemoglobin (Hb).  This tetramer is composed of &alpha;
and &beta; (&alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>) subunits.  35%
of the mass of the RBC is composed of Hb.  Homogeneity is essential
to study its physicochemical properties effectively.  Proteins possess
6 characteristics that are exploited:

<ol>
<li>solubility
<li>crystallization
<li>size
<li>charge
<li>adsorption
<li>density
</ol>

<p>
Before a protein can be isolated, a means of <i>detecting</i> it must
be forthcoming.  For an enzyme, the activity assay is used.
<p>
Once a means of detecting it is possible, the isolation can commence.
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is used to achieve resolution and
separation based on size and charge.  Tube discontinous gel electrophoresis
is one example.  Protein movement in these gels is characterized by
the equation:
<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>R</i><sub>M</sub> = protein movement / dye front movement
<p>
<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/GelMigration.gif" style="float:left;"
  alt="Plots of relative mobility vs. gel concentration">
<p>
Plots of the migration of protein A against different gel concentration show a 
logarithmic curve, which when transformed to plot the log of the migration 
coefficient (<i>R</i><sub>M</sub>) against the gel concentration becomse a 
straight line.  The slope of the line is &prop; to the molecular weight.  The 
figure shows that protein A has both a greater <b>charge density</b> and a 
greater size. Both size and charge are combine to cause separation by 
electrophoresis, but there are methods that make use of charge alone or size in 
separation.
<p>
Affinity chromatography is a purification method that can almost obtain
purity on the first run.   A chemical moiety is constructed on the bead
(particle) matrix which has either the same binding property either to
the active site or inhibitory (regulatory) site of the protein.
Starkenstein (1910)  was the first to employ affinity (bio-specific)
chromatography by the use fo a starch column to separate &alpha;-amylase.
<p>
Agarose is derived from agar agar and is chemically a water-soluble,
and inert copolymer of D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-D-galactose
(see structure).
<p>
<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/AgaroseStructure.gif" style="float:right;"
  alt="structure of agarose">
<p>
Porath (1967) treated agarose with CNBr at pH 12 at temperature 5-10&deg;
in water.  This derivatized agarose to be chemically reactive with protein.
The reactive product was washed with water and then protein added to it.
The reactive group is an amidocarbonate which occurs in both cyclic
and acyclic forms (the cyclic form is show as the blue-colored structure
in the figure).
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/affinity-deriv.gif" alt="activation of agarose">
<p>
A spacer arm is usually added, and it must contain a reactive group
that attaches the ligand.  Most spacers are alkyldiamines which react
at high pH to make the amine reactive (see figure below).
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/affinity-ligand-attach.gif"
   alt="attachment of the ligand to activated agarose">
<p>
At the other end of the <b>R</b> group, another amine group is present
to which the ligand will be attached.  The ligand will need an available
<b>-COOH</b> group in order to form an amide with the amine of the spacer.
Formation of an amide usually is done through the use of very reactive
derivatives of urea, known as <b>carbodiimides</b>.  Water can be removed
from urea (heating?) to form carbodiimide itself, but this is too
reactive and bond rearrangement instead produces <b>cyanamide</b>
(see reaction scheme below).
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/diimides.gif"
   alt="carbodiimide formation; structure of stable carbodiimide EDC">
<p>
Active carbodiimides that can be produced more stably reduce the
electronegativity of the diimide nitrogens.  EDC is an ionic carbodiimide
that is soluble in water and reactive; it is ionic in order to keep
it from adsorbing to the matrix.  Note that other than agarose, glass
and polyacrylamide are used as matrices for ligand binding.

<p class="date">
8 Oct 1981

<p>
In the previous lecture the following scheme was shown for the activation
of and coupling of spacers and ligands to an affinity chromatography
matrix.
<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/affinity-chymotrypsin.gif"
  style="float:right;border:1px solid blue;margin:1em 0 1em 1em;"
  alt="elution behavior of alpha-chymotrypsin on different affinity columns">
<p>
An example of how affinity works is shown by &alpha;-chymotrypsin.
On unmodified matrix (Sepharose or agarose), the enzyme elutes from the
column by gel filtration, i.e. according to its molecular size on a
sizing column.  A pH 3 elution buffer is added at the end to see
if anything comes off, and nothing does.
<p>
When a ligand D-Trp methyl ester is attached, the enzyme is slowed
down because it has some affinity for the ligand, but it does not bind to
it.  Addition of pH 3 buffer shows that nothing bound to the column.
<p>
When the ligand instead is &epsilon;-aminocaproyl D-methyl ester,
which is normally just a spacer arm, the chymotrypsin does not elute
until a pH 3 buffer is added.  This behavior is typical of serine
proteases.  The equation for expressing affinity is expressed as:
<p style="text-align:center;">
E + S &harr; ES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>K</i><sub>S</sub> =
  10<sup>&minus;3</sup>-10<sup>&minus;6</sup> M
<p>
The question here is the nature of the affinity.  It is a non-specific
binding or is it a bio-specific affinity.  Use of a competitive ligand
in the elution buffer might remove the protein without using methods
to deform or denature the protein (change in pH, use of denaturants
or chaotropes).
<p>
<img style="float:left;margin:1em 1em 1em 0;" src="imagesBiochem143HTML/HIC-GlycogenPhosphorylase.gif"
 alt="glycogen phosphorylase separation using hydrophobic chromatography">
The discovery (by Shaltiel) of the affinity by these proteins
for the spacer arm alone  has led to a new kind of
affinity chromatography called <b>hydrophobic interaction chromatography</b>.
Shaltiel was trying to isolate glycogen phosphorylase from glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase.  He found that many proteins were sticking
alone to the hydrocarbon chains and decided to experiment with these alone.
Using a column with a C<sub>1</sub> spacer arm, only one peak eluted;
adding a protein-deforming agent produced no protein
A<sub>280</sub>-absorbing) peak at all.   With a C<sub>3</sub> spacer
arm there was a slight but imperfect separation
of the two enzymes, with glycogen phosphorylase slightly retarded on
the column.  Using a C<sub>4</sub>, G-3PD eluted as always without showing
any affinity, but glycogen phosphorylase required the addition of the
deforming agent to elute it.  And with the C<sub>6</sub> spacer arm,
not even the deforming agent was sufficiently strong to elute the
phosphorylase.  Acetic acid was necessary to elute it, denaturing and
inactivating it in order to elute it.
<p>
Affinity chromatography has progressed to the point where the ligands
can be active enzymes and even living cells.  &beta;-Galactosidase has
been attached to column, and lactose load elutes as glucose and galactose,
the two monosaccharides that compose the disaccharide.

<h1>Purity and Its Criteria</h1>
<p>
The purification process usually is said to be complete when homogeneity
(purity) is established by using methods to disprove that heterogeneity
exists (that is, a substance behaves as single substance).
<p>
Physical methods can be used to establish purity.  These include
work on a molecule's (net) charge or size (relative or apparent mass).
<p>
Ultracentrifugation can examine sedimentation velocity or equilibrium.
An ultracentrifuge cell with a window can be examined along its length
for changes in refractive index, which are an indication of solution
density.  A plot of the change in refractive index (&Delta;&eta;)
against the length of the cell will show a single peak if the protein
is pure, multiple peaks otherwise.
<p>
For sedimentation equilibrium the forces of <b>sedimentation</b>
overcome the forces of <b>diffusion</b> to draw the material into
bordered static equilibrium.  The concentration is monitored using
A<sub>280</sub> reading and graphed against <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>,
where <i>r</i> is the radius of the ultracentrifuge cell.
A plot of ln <i>c</i> (<i>c</i> is the concentration effectively
related to the absorbance if the extinction is known) versus
<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> should be linear if the protein is pure.
<p>
Gel filtration is not a suitable test of purity.  The ability to
resolve proteins to check for contaminants is poor, although the
sensitivity is better than ultracentrifugation.  Conversely
sedimentation equilibrium gives excellent resolution but poor
sensitivity.

<p class="date">
13 Oct 1981

<p>
In the last lecture the discussion of affinity chromatography ended
with the highlight that elution of the bound ligand can be achieved
by adding competing ligand or by changes in ionic strength or pH.
Physical, chemical and biological tests can be used to evaluate purity.
<p>
<b>Biological (Functional) Tests</b>.	<b>Specific activity</b>
is a measure of the biological activity of a protein per unit mass
of the protein.  With each purification step, specific activity
increases, often one or two orders of magnitude with a single
purification step (and especially with an affinity step).
Once homogeneity is attained, specific activity
will remain constant in future purification steps.
Indeed, within a purification, if the elution is fractionated,
both the activity of the enzyme and the total protein of each (or
selected) fractions should be measured to assess the specific activity
within the purification.  The plot of specific activity against
fraction can reveal a great deal about selecting fractions for further
analysis, or for pooling.
<p>
<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/purity-immunodiffusion.gif" alt="purity shown by immunodiffusion"
  style="float:right;margin:1em 0 1em 2em;">
Some proteins are evaluated using antibodies.  Antibodies have
small segments which can attach to other proteins and render them
inactive if they have a destructive activity (IgGs in particular
are so and the most adaptable).	Most proteins have three or four
immunogenic determinants and thus 3-4 IgGs exist to bind the protein.
<p>
Suppose a crude extract is injected into a rabbit in order to produce
antibodies against all proteins present.  The antiserum is then collected
and the extract added to one well of an immunodiffusion plate and
the antiserum to another well.
Antibody-antigen precipitation occurs at a certain concentration of
antigen to antibody.  With an immunodiffusion plate, antigen
and antibody diffuse towards each other.
Three bands of precipitates identify at least three
proteins present in the crude extract to which antibodies against these
are present in the antiserum.  Since antibodies are all the same size
(about 150 kDa) and thus diffuse at the same rate, the fact that
one band is formed closer to the antigen well and than another band
indicates that the antigen (protein) diffuses at a slower rate, and thus
is larger in size.  Diffusion of proteins in the plate is through
an inert matrix, and so molecular size can be the only reason that
a molecule moves more slowly than another.  The fact that 3 bands
were present shows that at least 3 antigens were present in the crude
extract, and thus the extract is impure (as would be expected).
<p>
Once a purification step is (or several are) are performed, and it
is expected that purity is obtained, the pure material is added to a
3rd well and precipitin arcs analyzed.  The crude extract serves as
a control, and should produce the same number of bands as before.
One of the bands should form an arc however, which forms a band
with the pure fraction.  That identifies the protein and suggests
but does not prove purity.
<p>
<img src="imagesBiochem143HTML/immunoelectrophoresis.gif"
	style="float:left;margin:1em 2em 1em 0;"
  alt="immunoelectrophoresis to assess purity">
Another technique making use of antibodies involves separating
proteins electrophoretically.  After electrophoresis, a trough
is then cut along the side of the electrphoresis path, along the length
of the gel.  A dilute solution of the antiserum used in immunodiffusion
is then added to the trough, and time is allowed for diffusion to occur
and for visible precipitin arcs to form, as for immunodiffusion.
The precipitin arcs form in a fashion shown in the figure, with radii
indicating that the center of the arc comes from the antigen side.
<p>
Arcs that do not have spurs in them indicate that the antigens
are recognized by the same antibody.  In some cases there is one
spur off an arc while another intersecting/overlapping has no spur:
this indicates that the arc from the protein <i>with the spur</i>
shows partial identity somehow, a shared determinant.  A good
example of how this occurs is with multimeric (multisubunit) proteins.
If a protein has different isoforms with homo- and heteromeric subunits,
then such patterns are seen.  The figure shows the kind of precipitin
arcs that form when a protein can assume an &alpha;<sub>2</sub>,
&beta;<sub>2</sub>, and &alpha;&beta; dimeric forms.

<p>
<b>Chemical Testing</b>.  No one test in itself can determine purity.
Proteins have an N- and C-terminal end.  A test for this must be
stoichiometric to indicate purity.  Assays for non-protein moieties
can be used to compare to proteins:  for example, four Fe<sup>2+</sup>
can be counted in an assay per hemoglobin molecule.  Or one might
see one pyridoxal phosphate for one aminotransferase.
Thus a test for a non-protein moiety can reveal impurity to an extent.
<p>
Generally polypeptides do not get much larger than 40-50 kDa in forming
proteins.  Proteins seen to have a large relative size might be
assumed to be composed of subunits.  Svedberg in the 1930s invented
the ultracentrifuge and used it to report on subunit characteristics
of large proteins (he used the term <q>subunit</q> to indicate
the smallest <i>unit</i> of undefined structure).  The term <b>monomer</b>
might be reserved for structures which are held together by non-covalent
bonds and which can associate and dissociate without severely affecting
structure.
<p>

  style="float:right;margin:1em 0 1em 2em;">
A purification technique involving purification of a monomer or part of
a polymer:  a change in pH or ionic strength causes dissocation, or
addition of iodoacetic acid to modify reduced sulfhydryl groups.
The attached -CH<sub>2</sub>-CO<sup>&minus;</sup> moiety imparts a
negative charge to repel strands.  A polycation
(protein-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>)<sub><i>n</i></sub> can be
separated using succinic anhydride.

Addition of urea and/or guanidinium chloride will denature the strands
and monomers and will have a different effect.

A bifunctional reagent will yield data on subunits and the topology
of subunits.  A di-iodoacetamide derivative,
ICH<sub>2</sub>C(=O)NHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHC(=O)CH<sub>2</sub>I,
can link two sulfhydryls and has a length of 12 &Aring;.  Given a
tetramer of &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>, if the &alpha;
subunit has a intersubunit disulfide association with the &beta;
subunit, then reduction and alkylation with the bifunctional agent
will produce a covalently linked &alpha;-&beta; dimer.  After denaturation
only an &alpha;-&beta; linked product is obtained.  If an &alpha;<sub>2</sub>
is formed, then the disulfide is &alpha;-&alpha;.
<p>
But even after such bifunctional probes are used, this subunit characterization
may remain elusive.  More might be revealed by <b>hybridization</b>.
