<h1><b><u>Part 1</u></b> discusses <b>Knowers and Knowing</b></h1>
<p>
<u>Chapter 1: The Problem of Knowledge.</u> To get a bearing (in the sense of
organizing), we might start from the idea that knowledge is common sense. But
knowledge is more than that. Knowledge is perhaps a mental map of our concept
of reality. But is our view of reality what it should be? Consider the familiar
Mercator projection of the globe. We understand much from it, but the map is
actually a distorted nonproportional presentation of the world. It has the bias
of presenting north as oriented up. Moreover, there is a bias of putting Europe
in the middle (why not the Pacific?). In contract, the Hobo-Dyer is a much
better scaling and it puts north at the map bottom while making the Pacific and
Australia in the middle. Thus what we know may be controlled by biases we
introduce in learning.
<p>
<b>Certainty</b>.  Can we limit ourselvess to what is certain instead of using
knowledge that is distorted?  We shall become acquainted with the ways
of knowing: Language, Perception, Reason, and Emotion.  Perhaps we should begin
with a <b>radical doubt</b> like Descartes did.  We can adopt a <b>relativism</b>
position:  truth is in the eye of the beholder...each person has his own idea
of the truth;  but this brings up the problem that (1) we have a feeling that
people can be wrong with their own set of beliefs they call the truth and (2)
there are people with a wrong set of beliefs and this can injure them.
<p>
Common sense, certainty and relativism are not solutions to understanding the
problem of knowledge.  In the theory of knowledge, we are concerned with
<em>how</em> you believe rather than with <em>what</em> you believe.  Given there
are no certainties and obvious proofs, good <b>judgment</b> may be necessary
in deciding what to believe:  a balance of skepticism and open-mindedness.
Dangers in acquiring knowledge include avoiding being gullible (believing
everything you are confronted with) or overly skeptical (believing nothing to the
point of being impractical to living).  For example Wegener suggest a theory
of continental drift in 1912 which was rejected until someone showed the theory
of plate tectonics in the 1960s which made it acceptable.
<p>
<u>Chapter 2: The Nature of Knowledge</u>.  Knowledge is described as a
<b>justified true belief</b>.  Thus the first component is that it should be
a <b>truth</b>:  we have to have evidence or show beyond a reasonable doubt
that the knowledge under consideration is a part of reality (and that is a
truth).  It may not require absolute certainty.  Another component is <b>belief</b>:
if one knows that A, then A is true, and one must believe that A is true.
Truth might be an objective requirement, whereas belief is the subjective
requirement for knowledge.  Consider belief perhaps to describe a mental state
signifying someone knows something.  Beliefs might vary to the degree which
we are willing to believe something.  If we have a <q>vague</q> belief, we
might abandon it with the slightest counter-evidence.  If our belief is
<q>beyond a reasonable doubt,</q> it stands firm even despite an abundance of
counter-examples designed to cast doubt.   With the component <b>justification</b>,
you provide the evidence for why it is knowledge.  One might believe there are
nine planets, but you cannot be said to know that if you merely say you believe
it to be true and assert its truth.  One needs to provide enough evidence to
justify that true belief.  This justification comes from the <i>ways of knowing</i>:
<ul>
<li>language:  <q>someone communicated this information to me</q>
<li>perception:  <q>I experienced the phenomenon myself with my own senses</q>
<li>reason:  <q>I can prove it be deduction, induction, and other means of
analytical thought processes</q>
<li>emotion:  <q>it is axomatic, intuitively obvious</q>
</ul>
<p>
All of these ways of knowing furthermore are <em>reliable</em>.  They are not
learned or discovered by telepathy or use of crystals or magic.
<p>
Knowledge is not merely <b>information</b> or a database or a collection of
facts.  It refers to being able to make use of that information, perhaps
expertly, in a way that might be useful but which might also extend something.
Knowledge may require an understanding as well...how the information, which
is the parts of knowledge, cohere to become the whole of knowledge.
<p>
Much of our knowledge is second-hand.  Some of it is to authority, although we
must be aware of appeal-to-authority fallacies in advancing arguments.
Second-hand knowledge comes from cultural traditions:  for instance we measure
time in 12 divisions which are hours, but what is the basis of that?  Why not
measure time by 10 divisions (like the metric system)?  We get an education
from school, spending 14,000 hour of our youth;  it is not possible to teach
every subject and all that there is, so someone selects or prioritizes the
information we get, and that is a sort of bias (an <b>indoctrination</b>).
We get information from the Internet, but here we must be careful because
of being susceptible to <b>urban legends</b> (false information on the Net).
Naturally we get knowledge from experts (authorities) who have been known to
get it wrong, or whose competence might be limited either individually or
because of the state of the science/art/profession.  We also get knowledge
from news services, but there is a bias as well since they report sensational
news (bad news, extraordinary news), or maybe news of limited relevance to
certain groups.
<h1><b><u>Part 2</u></b> discusses <b>Ways of Knowing</b></h1>
<p>
<u>Chapter 3: Language.</u>  Language is clearly the means by which we gain
knowledge.  Words and sentences are used to communicate information to us
from other who also possess the knowledge.  It might be written or spoken
(in this case, additional information might be provided in non-verbal ways),
so it is essential to characterize both structure and function of language and
to learn its limitations.
<ul>
<li><b>rule-governed</b>:  Grammar combines words in correct order.  In addition
the words represent a vocabulary.  People need to agree on how to use language
to describe the reality in which they live.
<li><b>intention</b>:  language is a subset of communication in that not all
communication is language.  A yawn communicates something, but is not language,
because there is not intent to communicate a yawn to another.
<li><b>creative and open-ended</b>:  language is more useful if the rules permit
sentence formations with the possibility of communicating all possible messages
that describe reality or convey knowledge.  New words might be created in order
to describe an invention or discovery to the knowledgebase.
</ul>
<p>
There are limitations or problems associated with language.  Language must be
<b>meaningful</b>:  someone may communicate a message that can be parsed according
to its rules, but the person must understand the language (know meanings of the
words and sentences).  We can impose meaning on words in one of three ways:
<ol>
<li><b>definition</b>:  words get meaning by learning what they are in the
dictionary.  A definition does its best to give meaning by using a short sentence
or fragment of sentence to describe the meaning, perhaps by giving examples, or
by giving words with related meaning (synonyms).  Some words are physical
or real objects (<b>table</b>), others might be abstract concepts (<b>love</b>).
One problem is that with definitions, words are used to define the word, and so
what if one of the words is unknown?
<li><b>denotation</b>:  this has to do with words in the language that stand
for (denote, point to) something versus words that do not (typically nonsense
words).  A problem that might arise from this is that the words do not literally
represent an object, but are a reference to it;  another is that abstract concepts
do not really point to things such as a concrete, real, physical object;  most
people do not get caught up with these problems however.
<li><b>images</b>:  this suggests that words acquire meaning through images in
the mind or mental pictures.  Thus freedom might be imagined as a series of
mental images of a convict being outside of a prison.  A problem with believing
that meaning is formed this way is that different people can imagine or hold
different mental pictures.
</ol>
<p>
Perhaps language meaning is represented in <b>know-how</b>.  Thus how and when
and in what context a word or sentence is used is a demonstration that the user
knows the meaning of the language construct.
<p>
Meaning can be problematic:
<ul>
<li><b>vagueness</b>:  What does <q>fast</q> and <q>slow</q> mean?  It might
differ between people.  Fast might be set to mean anything with a speed greater
than 100 km/h.  Sometimes vagueness serves its purpose, since we do not always
have perfectly exact precise measurment.
<li><b>ambiguity</b>:  Consider the statement <q>the duchess cannot bear children.</q>
Does it mean she cannot get pregnant or she does not like children.  Or
<q>The author lives with his wife, an architect and an amateur musician in
Hampshire.</q>  Does the author live with three people or just one (his wife,
who happens to be an architect and amateur musician)?  This feature might be
exploited or it may need resolving.
<li><b>secondary meaning</b>:  words have a <i>primary</i> meaning (denotation)
but they also are used secondarily (connotation).  The use of euphemism is
classic example, in addition to words being double entendres.
<li><b>metaphor</b>:  When we say "that person has his head in the clouds," this
is not meant literally but figuratively (metaphorically).  Numerous examples
abound.  One might say that one's brother is a butcher (yes, he cuts meat for a
living), but if one says that one's dentist is a butcher, that person is trying
to intimate that his dentist is horrible at his job.
<li><b>irony</b>:  when irony is intended, it basically means that the person
wants to mean the opposite of what is said.  If the weather forecast was for
sun, but it is raining outside, someone might say "Nice weather, right?" in a
facetious or sarcastic way.
</ul>
<p>
Thus meaning is all about interpreting language elements correctly, which may
require word choice and position that provides context.  We must have or take
care of the meaning of words because they can be used to manipulate or trick us.
<p>
Translation from one language to another is also something to be considered.
There are some 3000 human languages, although many are spoken by very small
groups.  Among translation problems are
<ul>
<li>context:  in choosing the word that is the object of translation, should it
be "chat," or are the words "talk," "gossip," or "discuss" more appropriately
given the subtle shades of meaning
<li>untranslatable words:  there is often no direct word-for-word correspondence,
and so some words must be translated using a lengthy (inelegant) paraphrase.
Even simple language elements like 'du/tu' and 'Sie/vous' in German and French
lose something in translating to the English 'you.'
<li>idioms:  these are words and sentences that are very difficult to translate
because they refer to a popular or proverbial usage of words and sentences
("Don't beat around the bush" or "he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth").
This is metaphorical to some degree.
</ul>
<p>
The effective means of dealing with translation problems is to make sure of
three criteria
<ol>
<li><i>faithfulness</i>:  should be faithful to original text
<li><i>comprehensibility</i>:  those reading the translation must at least
understand it
<li><i>back translation</i>:  it should approximate the original text in translating
back
</ol>
<p>
Some texts are entirely difficult to translate since the arrangement of words
or sentences conveys a rich meaning, such as in poetry.
<p>
A function of language is as a labeling system.  <b>Labels</b> help us interact
safely or properly with reality.  Labels help us to categorize, organize, and
classify, to make sense of the information we have.  The use of <b>stereotypes</b>
is for the purpose of labeling people:  these are generalizations that may have
elements of truth, but usually have a negative connotation since we may use it
in an immoral way.
<p>
The <b>Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</b> states that language is a strong factor in
how we experience reality, and in how we see and think.  For exmaple the Inuit
have several different words for snow, because their entire existence is
in snow generally, and they have found a need to distinguish it.  For others where
snow is not a prominent reality in their lives, there is only one word for snow.
It was Whorf himself studying the Hopi Indians who found their language also
does not express the concept of abstract time as in English.  The hypothesis
proposes <b>linguistic determinism</b> in which language can or might be
purposely used to manipulate thought, as Orwell demonstrated with Newsepak in
the novel <i>1984</i>.  In one test of the hypothesis anthropologist P. Farb
examines how bilingual Japanese women married to U.S. servicemen and living
in the USA speak.  They used their language differently among themselves and
when speaking to non-Japanese, showing a difference in thought.  Critics of the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis say that just because the Inuit have different words for
snow is like claiming a printer has a different interface to reality because it
uses different fonts.  Moreover, living forms without language, such as infants
and pigeons, engage in thinking without the language.  Others claim that thoughts
and thinking are the same to all, but it is the job of language to describe
what is imagined, not that language influences what is imagined.  There could not
possibly be such things as ineffable thought if language structured it all.
Language might <em>influence</em> thought, but not basically determine it.
