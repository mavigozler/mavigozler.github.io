Philosophy 102 Lecture Notes

<p>
These are lecture notes of the course Philosophy 102 taught at University of
California, Davis in the Winter quarter of 1983 by Dr. George Mattey
with notes taken by S. M. Halloran.
<p>
This web document represents a transcription of the original handwritten
lecture notes entered into a spiral-bound standard university notebook.
The original notes were imaged using a scanner and the pages collected into a
<a href="/proteomics/LectureNotes/Philosophy%20102%20(Theory%20of%20Knowledge).pdf">non-text
searchable PDF document</a>.
<p style="margin:1em 2%;font-size:90%;">
Any egregious errors in concepts or fundamentals are mine (the student):
despite every attempt of the instructor to make the material stimulating and
interesting and to penetrate the thickest of skulls, you the reader certainly realize that
note-taking students are distracted by numerous other things during lecture and
will certainly miss the vital point(s) of the lesson. Do the proper thing in
resolving all doubts by looking up original works and references.
<p>
The motivation to transcribe these handwritten notes to searchable web document
form is <a href="#motivation">explained below</a>.

<p>
Among the great figures in philosophy related to the theory of knowledge are
Plato, Aristole, and particularly John Locke, in his <i>Essay Concerning
Human Understanding</i>, wherein he gives a thorough account of:
<ol>
<li>Nature of knowledge: <b>what are we discussing?</b>
<li>Degree of knowledge: <b>how strong is our conviction?</b>
<li>Extent of knowledge: <b>what kinds of things can be known?  what are the
objects of knowledge?</b>
<li>Reality of knowledge: <b>do we have any whatsoever?</b>
</ol>
<p>
As to nature, from the empiricist view, all knowledge derives from experience.

<table style="float:right:width:50%;margin:0 0 0 1.5em;">
<tr><th>world  <th>propositions about the world
<tr><td>Tootsie's being a man  <td>Tootsie is a man
<tr><td><b>fact</b>             <td>knowledge fundamental
</table>
<p>
In the film <i>Tootsie</i>, an unemployed man dressed as a woman in order to
get a job that was essentially given only to women.  It is a <b>fact</b> that
Tootsie is a man although appears to be a woman, and we can make a proposition
that <i>Tootsie is a man</i> which corresponds to the <b>fact</b>.  The <b>fact</b>
is the fundamental of knowledge.
<p>
If a proposition is true, is it still the case that anyone <i>knows</i> it?
Has anyone expressed it or had it as a thought?
<p>
<b>First Conditions</b>.
If someone <i>s</i> knows that <i>p</i>, then there must be a special relationship
between the person <i>s</i> who knows and the proposition <i>p</i>.  This is
called the <b>propositional attitude</b>, an <i>attitude</i> whereby one accepts
the truth which one asserts.   You must be convinced, and thus have a positive
attitude about the veracity of the statement.
<p>
The strongest degree of acceptance of a fact is called an <b>overt knowledge
claim</b>.
<ol>
<li><b>overt</b> knowledge claim is one that is a positive, emotional assertion
of a fact
<li>it is distinct from just a recitation of the proposition (repeating what
another might have said):  statement of something as a matter of fact, which is
an indifferent assertion of a fact
<li>there must be a willingness to defend what is being said or utter
</ol>
<p>
<b>Habit</b> or <b>memory</b> is stimulated when <i>s</i> <b>truly believes</b>
or <b>knows</b> <i>p</i>.

<p>
<b>Second Condition</b>.  If <i>s</i> knows that <i>p</i>, then <i>s</i>
<b>believes</b> that <i>p</i>.  Note that the converse is not true:  if
<i>s</i> merely believes that <i>p></i>, then it does not imply <i>s</i> <b>knows</b>
that <i>p</i>.  Beliefs can in propositions who truth status can absolutely be
in that which is false or not real.  Moreover a belief is not always (necessarily)
useful.
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>lucky true belief:  someone believes that something is true, and it is true,
but the person <q>got lucky</q> in believing it, since when asked to produce
evidence of that something being true, no evidence can be produced
<li>justified true belief:  unlike above, in this case, evidence (partial or
complete) can be produced making the proposition highly probable, and so the
reasons for belief are very good or substantiated.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Third Condition</b>.  If <i>s</i> knows that <i>p</i>, then <i>s</i>
<b>is justified in believing</b> that <i>p</i>.    These series of lectures will
focus on this aspect of knowledge.

<p>
Philosophers in epistemology divide into two camps, based upon the distinction
of

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>evidence:  reasons used to defend belief
<li>cause:  what made a person formulate a belief
</ol>
<p>
The camps include are:
<ol>
<li><b>internalists</b>:  called this because <q>it's inside you</q>, the
justification of belief is to question the reasons the believer possesses, and
these can be used as evidence for the truth of <i>p</i>.
<li><b>externalists</b>:  the justification is a question of what state the
believer is in, and how the believer comes to be in that state.
For example <b>reliable intuition</b> is a consistent discovery of the truth (such discovery
can be <q>lucky</q>), or by a reputation established for acquiring knowledge.
Those who believe in this view would state they are in a <b>frame of mind</b>
to be receptive to knowledge data.
</ol>
<p>
For the internalist, <i>s</i> believes that <i>p</i> is justified because
<i>s</i> believes <i>q</i>, and <i>q</i> is the reason or justification.
In addiiton <i>q</i> must be supported by <i>r</i> in a chain of support.
Aristotle's argument demands that we proceed <i>ad infinitum</i> in an
<b>infinite regress of justification</b>.  Aristotle recognized that this could
pose a problem in which the establishment of justification remains in infinite
regress, or that the justification might end up being circular (<q>everything
depends on everything else</q>).  Those who believe though in a justification
that might be circular are adherents of <b>coherentism</b>
<p>
<ol start="3">
<li><b>foundationalist</b>:  in this camp, there is no belief requiring
justification
</ol>
<p>
These will be explored in the series of lectures.

<h1>Formulation of (The/A) Theory of Knowledge</h1>

<p>
In understanding concepts of knowledge, it is important to have a sense of
what it is <q>to know</q>:
<ol>
<li>competence:  <i>s</i> knows how to ...
<li>acquaintance: <i>s</i> is familiar with (knows) ... {someone, something }
<li>information: <i>s</i> apprehends that ... (is information)
</ol>
<p>
The <i>information</i> item represents <b>factual knowledge</b>, knowledge which
is <i>the case</i>, and the word <q>that</q> is a pointer to the proposition
which is the case.
<p>
In the USA and UK, <b>analytic philosophy</b> is usually an approach in which
language is analyzed:  words and their meanings and how communication is
used to express meaning (meaning analysis, semantics).  <b>Meaning analysis</b>
essentially is an analysis of what conditions exist to make a person believe
what he knows.  <b>Denotative analysis</b> is an analysis is an attempt to
ascertain the conditions by which a person is said to know, and is a preferred
kind of state.
<p>
In semantics, the term <i>meaning</i> expresses what are the definition and
synonyms of words, and the term <i>reference</i> is a denotation which is
outside of the language.
<p>
Consider what conditions which establish that the weather is <b>foggy</b>.
What are the <i>necessary and sufficient conditions</i> for being foggy.
Of course the logical equivalent is:
<ul>
<li>if B then A:  A is a necessary condition for B;  B if A
<li>if A then B:  A is a sufficient condition for B;  B only if A
</ul>
Note that this is also the same as A iff B or B iff A (iff = if and only if).
<p>
Proceeding from this fundamental concept of logic, that of equivalence, the
essence of a <i>theory of knowledge<b></b></i> is proposed.
<div style="font:normal 115% Palatino,Bookman,serif;margin-left:3em;">
<i>S <b>knows</b></i> that <i>p</i> <em>iff</em>
<ul style="margin-top:0;">
<li><i>p</i> is true
<li><i>s</i> believes <i>p</i>
<li><i>s</i> is completely justified in believing <i>p</i>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
It is important to understand the meaning of this, because there is logical
equivalence here:
<ol>
<li>If <i>S <b>knows</b></i> that <i>p</i>
<ul style="margin-top:0;">
<li>then <i>p</i> is true
<li>then <i>s</i> believes <i>p</i>
<li>then <i>s</i> is completely justified in believing <i>p</i>
</ul>
<li>If <i>p</i> is true, then <i>s</i> knows that <i>p</i>
<li>If <i>s</i> believes that <i>p</i>, then <i>s</i> knows that <i>p</i>
<li>If <i>s</i> is completely justified in believing <i>p</i>,
then <i>s</i> knows that <i>p</i>
</ol>
<p>
For the three consequents of the iff statement, these are sufficient conditions
for <i>s</i> to <b>believe</b> <i>p</i>. But as Lehrer (a proponent of
coherentism) describes it, are all these conditions <em>sufficient</em> for <i>s</i> to
<b>know</b> <i>p</i>?  (Knowledge here is in the philosophical sense.)
And are all conditions above <em>necessary</em> for knowledge?  How do we verify
the analysis, Lehrer's definition of knowledge?
<p>
Take an object of indubitable knowledge, something that meets the condition
of being a <b>pre-analytical intuition</b>, and then compare it to the
statement of the theory of knowledge above to determine if the conditions
required for knowledge are not wholly there, yet not lacking any other condition.
<p>
Consider also the question of <q><i>S</i> knows that <i>p</i></q> expresses the
idea that <q><i>S</i> <em>claims to know</em> that <i>p</i>.</q>  Those who
claim to know something would assert that they are <q>knowing.</q>
<p>
Now looking at the three conditions above for knowledge, we have the condition
of truth, of belief, and of justification.

<p>
<b>Truth Condition</b>. There are two theories at work here related to <b>truth
condition</b>:
<ol>
<li><b>absolute theory</b>: the truth is a property of facts or events
<li><b>semantic theory</b>:  the truth is a property of sentences in a language
</ol>
<p>
Naturally it is (1) we are concerned with, although when (1) is true, (2) is
always true (q.v., Ch. 2 of Chisolm).

<p>
<b>Belief Condition</b>.  The concept of <b>conviction</b> and of absolute
certainty is seen as a case for what is <b>highly probable</b>.  Absolute
certainty is not a necessary condition for knowledge, for knowing something.
For knowledge, we must have:
<ol>
<li>conviction
<li>high probability of it being true
<li>a willingness to defend the claim to know
</ol>

<p>
<b>Justification Condition</b>.  This requires that other conditions of
knowledge above are established and which make knowledge complete.  Justification
is completely relative, internal, and subjective.  This condition demands that
there is <b>evidence</b> for all data which is required:  truth is not subjective,
whereas justification is.  In addition, for the <b>foundationalism</b> of the
internalists, justification requires <q>basic beliefs.</q>

<p>
Consider a counterexample:  that of <u>justifcation without falsity</u>.
If <i>p</i> is true (T), and believed (B), and justified completely (J), then
the basis for knowledge (of knowing it) is met: call this the JTB set of
conditions.
<p>
But Gettier (1963) found a flaw in this, in that there could be JTB set of
conditions, but it was possible <em>not</em> to have knowledge.  Note these
examples are called <q>Gettier-type</q> examples or <q>models.</q>
<p>
Suppose that <i>p</i> is justified, found true and also believed, but the
JTB conditions that were met were completely <em>accidental</em>.  <i>S</i>
had a plausible justification, believed it, and <i>p</i> was true, but did
<i>S</i> really <em>know</em> it?
<p>
Impose now a <b>fourth condition</b> for knowledge to tighten up the criteria:
this is that a justification cannot rest upon a false belief.  If there is
a dependence on unsound premises, then there is no knowledge.  It is still
possible to accept a falsehood, but remain justified.
<p>
For example:
<ol>
<li>(T):  it is highly probable that <span class="false"><i>S</i> is a philosophy
graduate student</span>
<li>(F):  <i>S</i> is a philosophy graduate student.
<li>There is one philosophy graduate student in this class.
</ol>
<p>
In statement (1), the part in blue is a false, but the whole statement is
true because it asserts a probability that is high that the clause is true.
In statement (2), the whole statement is false, and it is couched in the
statement (1) as well.  Statement (1) is not completely justified now despite
being true because of the truth status of statement (2).  Statement (3) becomes
less justified because statement (2) is false.

<h1>The Terms of Epistemic Appraisal</h1>
<p>
The terms of epistemic appraisal form the crux of
<ul>
<li>epistemic logic:  the logic of knowledge
<li>doxastic logic:  the logic of belief
</ul>
<p>
It should be noted that Chisolm's text on the theory of knowledge that the term
<dfn>belief</dfn> and <dfn>acceptance</dfn> are used interchangably.  Application
of a logic involves the use of rules and being able to represent these concepts
in the abstract.
<p>
Propositions are such that a state of affairs is described:  what is the case,
and what is true.  Key operative words (<q>operators</q>) are <u>and</u>,
<u>or</u>, and <u>not</u>, but also include <u>if...then</u> and other words
that can be represented in logic.  Chisolm uses the symbols <i>A</i> and <i>W</i>
to be variables expressing <dfn>attitudes</dfn> toward the proposition <i>p</i>
by <i>S</i> at time <i>t</i>.  Thus:
<ul>
<li><i>A<sub>st</sub>p</i>:  <i>S</i> <u>accepts</u> <i>p</i> at time <i>t</i>
<li><i>W<sub>st</sub>p</i>:  <i>S</i> <u>withholds</u> <i>p</i> at time <i>t</i>
</ul>
<p>
The analysis of <u>acceptance</u> indicates that <i>S</i> essentially <b>believes</b>
<i>p</i>, or <i>S</i> finds <i>p</i> to be true.
<p>
In <em>rejecting</em> a proposition <i>p</i>, there is the connotation that there
is an <em>acceptance</em> of its negation, ~<i>p</i>, a <b>disbelief</b>.
<p>
There is however a middle ground as well:  <u>withholding</u> is essentially the
withholding of belief, the suspension of judgment to believe.
<p>
Thus <i>S</i> does <em>not</em> believe (disbelieves) <i>p</i> iff <i>S</i>
<em>accepts</em> ~<i>p</i>.
<p>
It is also true that <i>W<sub>st</sub>p</i> iff <i>~A<sub>st</sub>p</i>
<u>and</u> <i>~A<sub>st</sub>~p</i>.
<p>
What is preferable:  to accept, withhold, or reject?  The decision should be based
upon objectively decided criteria, for useful knowledge applies to all
three decisions.
<p>
Consider the following definitions (statements with their symbolic representations):

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>Suppose these very different states:<br>
 <ul style="margin-bottom:0;">
 <li>it is more reasonable to accept <i>h</i> than to accept <i>i</i>
 <li>it is more reasonable to accept <i>h</i> than withhold <i>h</i>
 <li>it is more reasonable to accept <i>h</i> than reject <i>h</i>
 </ul>
 <p style="margin:0;">At this point a functional notation can be used as follows:
 <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) = it is reasonable to accept <i>h</i>, and so
 <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Ai</i>) = it is more reasonable to accept
 <i>h</i> than to accept <i>i</i>.
<li><i>Bh</i> = <i>h</i> is <em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em>:  so
<i>Bh</i> iff <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>)
<li><i>Gh</i> = the <em>gratuitous withholding</em> of the acceptance of <i>h</i>,
meaning there is motivation to accept <i>h</i>.  There is, more or less, a
reason to withhold.  Note that <i>Bh</i> is contradictory to <i>Gh</i>. Thus:
<i>Gh</i> iff <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &le; <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>) and <i>Bh</i> iff
<i>~Gh</i>
</ol>
<p>
Another term of <b>epistemic praise</b> is:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;" start="4">
<li><i>Sh</i> = <i>h</i> has some presumption in its favor<br>
Thus, <i>h</i> has some presumption in its favor if and only if it is more reasonable to
accept <i>h</i> than to accept <i>not-h</i>:
<p style="margin:0;text-align:center;"><i>Sh</i> iff <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt;
		<i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>)
<p style="margin:0;">its qualitative opposite is that there is <em>no</em>
presumption in favor of <i>h</i> if and only if it is more reasonable to
accept <i>not-h</i> than it is to accept <i>h</i>:
 <p style="margin:0;text-align:center"><i>Nh</i> iff <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &le;
		<i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>)
</ol>
<p>
From these definitions, we can make the following assertions
<ol>
<li>If <i>h</i> is beyond a reasonable doubt, then <i>h</i> has some presumpiton
in its favor: if <i>Bh</i> then <i>Sh</i>:
 <p style="margin:0;text-align:center"><i>Bh</i> &sup; <i>Sh</i>
<li>That <i>h</i> is beyond a reasonable doubt is equivalent to it being
reasonable to accept <i>h</i> than to withhold <i>h</i>:
 <p style="margin:0;text-align:center"><i>Bh</i> &equiv;
   <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>)

<li>That <i>h</i> has some presumption in its favor is equivalent to it being
reasonable to accept <i>h</i> than to accept <i>not-h</i> (reject <i>h</i>):
 <p style="margin:0;text-align:center"><i>Sh</i> &equiv;
   <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>)
</ol>
<p>
Consider the following arguments and their conclusion, which shows a derivation:
<ol style="width:10em;">
<li><i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>)
<li style="border-bottom:1px solid black;"><i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>)
<li class="no-symbol">&there4; <i>Bh</i> &sup; <i>Sh</i>
</ol>
<p>
This argument states that if it better to either accept or to reject <i>h</i>
than to withhold acceptance of <i>h</i> in either case, then if <i>h</i>
is beyond a reasonable doubt, then there is a presumption in favor of <i>h</i>.
This is a derivation of the definitions above.
<p>
Chisolm (p. 13) asserts that <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) and <i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>)
represent either extreme of <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>).  In general, the hierarchy
or progression of knowledge is at first to withhold (<i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>))
and then either to accept (<i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>)) or to reject (<i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>)).

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;" start="5">
<li>Sometimes a <b>counterbalance</b>  is observed, where
<i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) = <i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>), meaning that it is reasonable to the
same degree to accept or reject <i>h</i>:  if this condition occurs, then
<i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>) should have higher value than <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) or
<i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>), so choose to withhold.
<li><i>Uh</i> = <i>h</i> is <u>unacceptable</u> to <i>S</i> if and only
it is more reasonable to withhold <i>h</i> than to accept <i>h</i>:
 <p style="margin:0;text-align:center">
  <i>Uh</i> &equiv;  <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>)
 <p>Note that <i>U~h</i> &equiv; <i>r</i>(<i>W~h</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>)
</ol>
<p>
Because <i>Ah</i> iff <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>) &le; <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>), it can
be inferred that <i>Bh</i> &sup; <i>Ah</i>, meaning that if <i>h</i> is
beyond a reasonable doubt, accepting <i>h</i> is quite logical.
<p>
And we can continue to derive/extend definitions from what has been shown above:
<ul>
<li><i>Bh</i> &sup; <i>U~h</i>:  if <i>h</i> is beyond a reasonable doubt, then
it is unacceptable to reject <i>h</i>.
<li><i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>) &sup; <i>r</i>(<i>W~h</i>) &gt;
<i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>):  this is a restatement of <i>Bh</i> &sup; <i>U~h</i>, but
its component definitions are substituted, meaning if it is more reasonable to
accept <i>h</i> than withhold <i>h</i>, then it is better to withhold the
rejection of <i>h</i> than to accept the rejection of <i>h</i>
</ul>
<p>
A point not yet made but which is quite obvious is the equivalence of
withholding the acceptance or rejection of <i>h</i>, namely that
<i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>) = <i>r</i>(<i>W~h</i>).  Suspending judgment means not deciding
one way or the other., which is the statement of that (see Chisolm, p. 13).
<p>
Now given that <i>Bh</i> &sup; <i>U~h</i> and 
<i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>) = <i>r</i>(<i>W~h</i>), we can derive by substitution this
relationship:  <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>W~h</i>) &sup;
<i>r</i>(<i>W~h</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>).  This states that if is more
reasonable to accept <i>h</i> than to reject withholding that acceptance,
then it is more reasonable to reject withholding acceptance of <i>h</i> than
to reject acceptance of <i>h</i>.
<p>
Similarly it is true that <i>U~h</i> &sup; <i>Bh</i>:  if it is unacceptable to
reject <i>h</i> then <i>h</i> is beyond a reasonable doubt.  So the relationship
is also derived:   <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>A~h</i>) &sup;
<i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>).  This states that if is more
reasonable to withhold <i>h</i> than to reject <i>h</i> then it is more
reasonable as well to accept <i>h</i> than to withhold <i>h</i>.
<p>
The extreme skeptic Aggripa thought that the condition <i>U~h</i> &sup; <i>Bh</i>
demanded that everything should be doubted that did not rise to the level of
being beyond a reasonable doubt.  The modern skeptic however would choose to
accept rather than withhold judgment.  Positivists withhold judgment on metaphysical
questions, but accept propositions on practical matters.
<p>
<b>Certainty</b>.  On top of the scale of epistemic praise is being <u>certain</u>.
This is not the case of it being a <q>psychological attitude</q> or of
<q>undeniability</q>, rather it is an absolute, objective property in the theory
of knowledge.
<p>
We thus have a definition:  <i>Ch</i> = <i>h</i> is <u>certain</u>:
<p class="def">
 <i>Ch</i> iff <i>Bh</i> and ~(<i>r</i>(<i>Ai</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>))
<p>
which is equivalent to, when substituting for equivalent statements for <i>Bh</i>,
<p class="def">
 <i>Ch</i> iff <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Wh</i>) and
 ~(<i>r</i>(<i>Ai</i>) &gt; <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>))
<p>
This states that <i>h</i> is <em>certain</em> if and only if <i>h</i> is beyond
reasonable doubt and it is <em>not</em> the case that it is more reasonable to
accept an alternative proposition <i>i</i> than it is to accept the proposition
<i>h</i>.  The substitution can be stated that <i>h</i> is certain if and only if
it is more reasonable to accept <i>h</i> than to withhold judgment about <i>h</i>
and it is not more reasonable to accept the alternative.
<p>
Note this extra condition:  for no proposition <i>i</i>, which is an alternative
and which <q>displaces</q> <i>h</i>, is it more acceptable than <i>h</i>.  
<p>

<p class="def">
 <i>Eh</i> iff <i>Bh</i> and, for any <i>i</i>, if <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>) &gt;
 <i>r</i>(<i>Ah</i>), then <i>Ci</i>

Chisholm will aim his third condition, namely his justification condition,
upon what can be presented as evident (<i>Ei</i>).

<h1><q>The Directly Evident</q></h1>
<p>
Consider the purpose of advancing concepts concerning the relationships between
persons.  In the previous lecture it was noted that being <b>evident</b> was the
penultimate position for Chisholm's epistemological status.
<p>
The <b>directly evident</b> is a qualification for the <b>evident</b> to justify
tenets that will serve as a foundation for all knowledge.  The process of building
upon knowledge as a foundation is criticized by Lehrer.  Chisholm must respond
to the skeptics and answer how a justification for the directly evident begins.
<p>
In the first point, it is noted that Descartes was the first historically to employ
<q>methodological doubt</q> as a routine to discovering indubitable and clear
and distinct ideas.  Kant was a little more expedient and practical in his
wisdom:  radical skepticism served no purpose, and the business must proceed to
get down to setting up a system of metaphysics and ethics.
<p>
In the second point, Chisholm indicates that <b>justification</b> is an
internalist concept.  Belief and conviction with a perfect grounds and reason
can be <em>analyzed</em> as <b>knowledge claims</b> and give the stamp of really
knowing.
<p>
The third point is that upon discovering what is found to be directory evident
in the paradigm cases of justification, general principles are formulated and
applied to all cases that follow.
<p>
Many questions arise after a proposed conclusion or theory is presented with the
main question being <q>What is the evidence of <i>h</i> given by <i>S</i>?</q>
<i>S</i> then proceeds with an explanation in a logical format.  If proposition
<i>i</i> is evidence for proposition <i>h</i>, then <i>Eh</i> because <i>Ei</i>,
<i>Ei</i> because <i>Ej</i>, ..., until we attain a proposition <i>i</i> such
that it is directly evident, or self-evident, or <q>emotionally shaking.</q>
<p>
The justified position that <i>z</i> is <i>F</i> might be questioned when the
statement <q><i>z</i> is <i>F</i></q> is merely spoken or uttered.  Would
reiteration serve the purpose of establishing it to a point where it was no
longer questioned?  This principle might be represented as:
<p class="def">
<i>Fa</i> &sup; <i>E</i>(<i>Fa</i>)
<p>
Evidence to a certain person which follows belief and conviction is considered
<q>self-presenting</q> and is accompanied by a plainly obvious philosophy of
Leibniz.
<p>
<b>Ordinary perceptual propositions</b> are not self-presenting or directly
evident, and do not find their status high on the epistemological scale.
It can be expressed <q>If <i>A</i>, then it is <em>evident</em> that <i>A</i>,</q>
but not <q>If <i>A</i>, then it is <em>directly evident</em> that <i>A</i>.</q>
<p>
A definition for <b>self-presenting</b> involves:
<div class="def">
<i>h</i> is <u>self-presenting</u> for <i>S</i> at time <i>t</i> if
<ol>
<li><i>h</i> occurs at time <i>t</i>
<li>necessarily, if <i>h</i> occurs at time <i>t</i>, the <i>Eh</i> for <i>S</i>
at time <i>t</i>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
Sometimes in an existential instantiation an existential generalization can be
made of the type:
<ol>
<li>I think
<li>There is someone thinking
</ol>
<p>
This follows as a fact of the world.  From this there is a procession closely to
the status of what is directly evident.
<p class="def">
<i>h</i> is <u>directly evident</u> for <i>S</i> if:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>there is a proposition <i>e</i>
<li><i>e</i> is self-presenting
<li>necessarily, whoever accepts <i>e</i>, accepts <i>h</i>
</ol>
<p>For the example ahove,  statement <i>a</i> corresponds to proposition <i>e</i>
and statement <i>b</i> corresponds to proposition <i>h</i>.
<p>
The ancient Greeks brought up the problem of negative propositions, which confused
the issue of knowledge.  Consider the statement:
<p class="example">
I do not seem to see a dog now.
<p>
Chisholm asserts that a concept must be understood before it is (meaningfully)
used.  No one asserts that something is evident unless prior experience is
warranted.  The first step in establishing the system is the <b>self-presenting
proposition</b> (says Chisholm).
<p class="example">
I do seem to see a dog now.
<p>
This statement establishes that we are aware of the evidence of the dog.  In
considering the negative proposition, it is simultaneously necessary to assert
the proposition that is also positive.

<h1>Seeming/Appearance With Respect To Sense-Perceptions</h1>
<p>
These terms of perception can refer to <b>belief</b> (conviction), but  they
<b>hedge</b> on a commitment to epistemological status.  This use is
<q>incompatible</q> with knowledge.
<p>
When someone <em>claims to know</em>,  it is important that one will defend
the claim or the issue.
<p>
<b>Phenomenological <q>seeming</q></b> is a case of the state of mind itself
greatly influencing perceptions.  It generally argues for the idea that
sense data are themselves <i>self-presenting</i> propositions.  For example
<p class="example">
The apple looks or appears red.
<p>
This psychological datum is a formal cognition solely of one's mind (no other).
All verbs of the form <i>appears</i> can be changed to something more
substantive:
<p class="exmaple">
There is a red appearance before me.  {a sense datum}
<p>
This change in wording / syntax is necessary to convey exactly what happens,
so that the appearance is not in one's mind, but rather <em>given to</em>
one's mind.
<p>
In an <dfn>adverbial analysis</dfn>, the wording might look like:
<p class="example">
I am appeared to redly.

<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/Sense-Knowledge.png"
   class="float-right"
   alt="knowledge via the senses">
The main group of propositions whose knowledge is based on what is <b>directly
evident</b> according to Chisholm begin as <b>basic beliefs</b>:
<p class="example">
If <i>p</i> then <i>Ep</i>.
<br>
I am being appeared to redly
<p>
The reason for structuring the language this way is to show a subjective state
of the perceiver.  These are special subjective objects of perception.
<p>
Is one object, when in the mind, in the mind?  Is it consciousness of something?
The transcendental nature of the thing is an object-in-itself.
<ul>
<li>Old view:  the tree causes a green sensation in me
<li>New view:  I was appeared to greenly (by a tree)
</ul>
<p>
Chisholm discusses some objections to these <q>appeared-to</q> propositions:
while <q>blue</q> for example is an expression of objectivity, the sensation
is wholly subjective.  Any term used to fill in the blank to the statement
<q>I am appeared to &mdash;ly</q> states that there is a correspondence between
perception and an actual object which is self-presenting.
<p>
It is suppose to seem obvious that we will find it necessary that the
thing-in-itself exists.

<h1>Justification and Knowledge:  Foundation Theory</h1>
<p>
As an opponent of the concept, Lehrer offers a poor view of <b>foundationalism</b>.
What does belief have to do with?  On one side is the <b>foundational basis</b>
and on the other is <b>justification refutation</b>.
<p>
The first characteristic(s) of a <b>basic belief</b> are that they are:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
<li>self-justified
<li>not justified by any non-basic belief
<p style="margin:0.25em 3%;">
note that this characteristic is difficult to reconcile because any belief which
justifies it may lead to coherentism (recall these definitions from Chisholm)
(Directly for) accepting <i>p</i> is presupposed by accepting some
self-presenting <i>q</i>
<p style="margin:0 3%;">
<u>Cogito</u> is self-presenting: <q>someone thinks</q> is directly evident. We
can say the directly evident is less basic than the self-presenting in this
case. Here there is an order.
<li>is irrefutable, or refutable only by some basic belief
<li>is the basis of the justification or the refutation of all other non-basic
beliefs
</ol>
<p>
<b>Lehrer's Rationalism and Empiricism</b>.  <u>Rationalism</u> is chiefly
associated with Descartes:  the origin of knowledge is complete reason.
In empiricism, it is either sense-perception or self-perception (reflection),
which is an introspection, whose proponents were Hume, Berkeley and Locke.
Reason is employed by the empiricists however as a tool of deduction or analysis.
Some propositions, being <b>analytic</b>, are true because of logical form:
<p class="example">
All horses are horses
<p>
That statement is true by virtue of its structure, but it is an empty word
analysis, providing no substantive knowledge.  Other propositions, being
<u>synthetic</u> (as opposed to analytic), reveal their truth coming from
matters of fact and not of form or coming from experience:
<p class="example">
Horses run swiftly
<p>
Basic beliefs would be <b>observation sentences</b>, simple statements of
perception such as
<p class="example">
<i>a</i> is <i>F</i>
<p>
where <i>a</i> is the object of sense experience, either a physical object or
an appearance, and <i>F</i> is a quality or relation discernible by the senses.
<p>
The rationalists take a different track:  <b>observational</b> statements
are basic in that they are intuited, and that intuition is the part of reason
devoid of experience.
<p>
There is an argument that reason does certify certain sense-perceptions and some
elements are needed to have a good theory of knowledge.
<p>
Pure rationalism would (of course) not allow us to know that obects exist.
Principles of noncontradiction are analytic and do not help us to proceed toward
any knowledge.  They do not deny senses particularly.  They state or think that
if we were to have infinite minds that we would be able to deduce all knowledge
from first principles.  Lehrer in the end believes there is a necessary mixture
of rationalism and empiricism.  Quine tried to show that there is no distinction
between the <b>analytic</b> and <b>synthetic</b> (<q>Two Dogmas of Empiricism</q>).
He believed they <q>flowed into each other.</q>  Look at the principle of
noncontradiction:  there are elements which help us in experience to
not formalize this.
<p>
A <b>basic belief</b> must <u>guarantee the truth</u> of what is believed.
Anything which is self-justified is of this quality.  It is thus logically
impossible for <i>S</i> to believe that <i>p</i>, and for <i>p</i> to be false.
If there is a possibility of error, we are subject to the <q>epistemic indignity
of refutation.</q>  Justification sufficient to ensure knowledge must guarantee
the truth of what we believe.
<p>
There are instances here of Lehrer's inconsistency.  <q>Justification</q>
sufficient to ensure knowledge does matter as to whether <i>p</i> is
true or false, else we have no knowledge.
<p>
This notion of <q>guaranteeing the truth</q> does not follow from the true
concept of a foundation.  There are many foundations which are not completely
infallible.  (He will not set up....)

<h1><q>Complete Justification</q>:  What Does It Mean?</h1>

<p>
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/justification-circle.png"
alt="circle of jusitification and evidence" 
class="float-right" >

It is humanly possible to gather all relevant evidence.  Suppose there are
<q>potential defeaters,</q> which are false statements able to undermine
justification of a proposition.  It would seem that all that is necessary is
to sanitize the argument of false statements.  It would be necessary to show
that the argument is not dependent upon any false premises and that it can
thus stand alone.  For the moment, a reliance on intuitions, common sense will
suffice, in which a belief follows other such beliefs.
<p>

<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/beliefs-foundation.png"
class="float-left" style="width:33%;"
alt="foundation of beliefs on 'basic beliefs'">

Lehrer proposed the idea of <b>hard-core</b> beliefs.  Basic beliefs are the
kind of beliefs which make the object which is believed to be <b>true</b>.
<b>Incorrigible</b> beliefs are something Lehrer says cannot be corrected, and
there is no possibility of error.  Lehrer cites Armstrong as a proponent of
foundationalist incorrigible beliefs.
<p>
Lehrer first defines incorrigiblity as a condition, of course, where beliefs
<u>cannot be mistaken</u>:  <i>S</i> has one belief that <i>p</i> &equiv; it
is logically impossible for <i>S</i> to believe <i>p</i> and <i>p</i> be false.
<p>
Lehrer counters to say that beliefs cannot <u>make</u> something true.  He says
something like <q>I believe that I am thinking</q> is a statement such that
believing is already an act or type of thinking anyway.  Descartes would say,
<q>I doubt that I am thinking</q> and by such a statement, Lehrer contends that
Descartes would be wrong.  Lehrer asserts that the premise <q>I think</q>
(<i>cogito</i>) is not substantial by which to build knowledge.
<p>
<q>If I believe that I am believing, then I am thinking.</q>  In this statement
we see an act.  <q>If I believe that I believe that <i>p</i>, then I believe
that <i>p</i>.</q>  Here we have content to the statement.  Lehrer will try to
show in this conditional that the antecedent is true, but the consequent is
false. Thus the belief is corrigible.  The example is Lemmon's pi (&pi;).
<p>
At <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, I believe that &pi; = 3.1417.  Suddenly my memory
is jogged, and I say that &pi; = 3.141592 at <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>.  I merely
assert it at <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>.  I really do not believe it.
At <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, I might have been casually asserting it.  But what I
believe truly comes from my memory.   Note well we can substitute
<u>accepts that</u> (Chisholm) for <u>believes</u>.  We see the consequent
again.
<p class="exmaple">
if I believe that I believe <i>p</i> at <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, then I believe
<i>p</i> at <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>.
<p>
There are two possible arguments regarding this in response.
<ol>
<li>When I asserted that &pi; = 3.141592 at <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, and when I
asserted at <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> its wrong value, I could say that I never
really believed it, make the antecedent false and the conditional true.
<li>Then I could say that I believed something at <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> but say
also that I believed differently at <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>.  (A silly mistake is
not indicative of belief).  That's okay I am just flightly in my belief.
</ol>
<p>
Lehrer's point is essentially is that if you believe that you believe <i>p</i>,
you may later find that you erred and did not really believe it.  Montaigne
once said that <q>some make the world believe that you believe what you do
not believe.</q>  Self-deception is the key.
<p>
<q>I believe that I am thinking that <i>p</i>.</q>  There is a belief in an
activity occurring presently.  This is called the <u>transparency of thought</u>,
where we cannot be mistaken about what happening in the mind.  Lehrer objects
on the basis that thought is corrigible.  Consider the possibility:
<ol>
<li>I believe <i>A = B</i>
<li>I think <i>A = B</i>
<li>in fact, <i>B = C</i>
</ol>
<p>
According to transitive relation theory we can say that we would believe
<i>A = C</i>.  But the attitudinal statements <q>I believe</q> and <q>I think</q>
are opaque contexts and the substitution of equals for equals is not allowed.
For example,
<ul>
<li><i>S</i> thinks that Bacon = author of <i>Hamlet</i>
    <i>T</i><sub>s</sub> (<i>b = h</i>)
<li><i>S</i> believes that Bacon = Shakespeare
    <i>A</i><sub>s</sub> (<i>b = s</i>)
<li><i>S</i> is not thinking that Bacon = Shakespeare
    <i>~T</i><sub>s</sub> (<i>b = s</i>)
</ul>
<p>
Someone asks, what are you thinking?
<ul>
<li><i>S</i> thinks that Shakespeare = author of <i>Hamlet</i>
    <i>A</i><sub>s</sub><i>T</i><sub>s</sub> (<i>s = h</i>)
</ul>
<p>
<i>S</i> accepts that he is thinking that Shakespeare = author of <i>Hamlet</i>.
<p>
Now Lehrer, of course, says that <i>T</i><sub>s</sub>(<i>b = h</i>) and
<i>A</i><sub>s</sub><i>T</i><sub>s</sub> (<i>s = h</i>) are contrary to each
other.  At the moment, <i>S</i> is not <em>really</em> thinking that Shakespeare
= author of <i>Hamlet</i>:  he is not thinking it because he does not believe
it.  Thinking must be going on in the head, and cannot be just a sudden
<q>unconscious</q> assertion.  Belief and thought thus involve a state of the
mind.
<p>
Because belief and thought are so closely tied to sensations, it is the senses
which reveal the most they can about us.
<p class="example">
If <i>S</i> believes that <i>S</i> senses ___ly,<br>
<i>S</i> is having an _______ sensation.
<p>
The counterexample of Lehrer.  <b>Brain correlation</b>:  we can now measure
brain waves and know certain patterns always correspond to certain sensations.
Suppose state #143 corresponds to sensation of redness and the patient says he
senses redness but is told he is in state #145.  Doesn't my consciousness have
priority of what is in itself?

<p class="date">
27 Jan 1983

<p class="example">
I believe I am having a sensation <i>s</i><br>
I am being appeared to <u><i>s</i></u>ly.
<p>
We have seen that to be incorrigible is not be mistaken at all.  Armstrong's
argument is that I am in brain state #143, which corresponds to a state of mind
in which a red sensation occurs.  He is then being stimulated and in state #144.
He believes he is sensing red truthfully.   You can then have a fake belief about
your true sensations.
<p>
Lehrer disagrees.  The person is said to have privileged access to his own
consciousness.  None can penetrate.  Lehrer's response is that:
<ol>
<li>A woman has an itch.  She goes to her doctor.
<li>Her doctor has told her an itch is a pain.
<li>She goes around telling everyone she has a pain.  But she is mistaken.
</ol>
<p>
We might ask her what she conceives of as pain.  It seems a case of
misclassification.  Has the woman found correct usage?  She seems to have a false
belief of what pain is.  What he wants to show is that at some time, we have a
<u>sensation</u> but express what our sensation is with the inappropriate
language which would communicate our ideas to others.
<p>
In the final analysis we cannot allow for incorrigible beliefs as our sensations
can be mistakenly reported.  Our foundations must be rendered into pieces as
the incorrigible beliefs on which they stand are screwy (<i>sic</i>).

<h1>Corrigible Justification</h1>
<p>
Lehrer says that there can be no incorrigible beliefs, and that there can be
no foundation without incorrigible beliefs.
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>if a belief can be false, any justification guaranteeing its truth must
be supplied by independent information
<li>if a belief gets its justification from independent information, it cannot
be basic
<li>if a belief can be mistaken, it can not be basicfs
</ol>
<p>
Returning to the examples of Armstrong:  If I believe that I sense red, I also
need brain state #143.  Of the misguided woman, she has been mistaken based
upon outside information.
<p>
Lehrer exposes a flaw in the argument.
<ol>
<li>When Lehrer gave his definition of basic belief, he said it was either
self-justified or justified on the basis of other basic beliefs.
Suppose I have to <i>bb</i><sub>1</sub> (basic belief #1) which is not
self-justified, that is, it needs independent information about
<i>bb</i><sub>2</sub>.
<li>Deny premise 1:  there are some corrigible beliefs whose justification does
not depend upon independent information.  What is offered instead is that a
<u>guarantee of truth</u>, not certainty.
</ol>

<h1>Reid and Common Sense</h1>
<p>
Reid was a Scottish philosopher critical of all skeptics and believed that
it was important to get back to common sense.  The <b>right of ancient possession</b>
or <b>presumption of innocence before guilt</b> was a device of the common sense
advocates, a call to philosophers that the burden of proof had fallen upon them
basically to tear down what is common sense.  Their ideal was pragmatic:
to work with what has worked all along.  Thus past success is self-justified.
<p>
But suppose we discover that our common sense no longer helps us.  Something
cannot serve as a foundation because it has been good to us.  Reid also says
common sense is:
<ol>
<li>universally accepted
<li>coeval with reason (needed in conduct of reason)
<li>need in the conduct of life
<li>part of our constitution
<li>must be yielded to in practice, though disputed in theory
</ol>

<table class="th-middle">
<tr><th rowspan="2">Perceptual Beliefs

</table>
<p>
Lehrer objects to the notion that one needs a skill:  skills require information
which is inarticulated.  For example, a painter who is masterful requires not just
a skill but information.  Having a skill requires information.

<p class="date">
1 Feb 1983

<p>
Lehrer objects quite specifically to the notion that <em>corrigible</em>
beliefes can be self-justified and therefore <em>basic</em>.  Thus if you
have a belief, then you are justified in the same moment for having the belief.
<p>
The Noncomparative Use of Words, as Chisholm states, are adverbial beliefs:
I am sensing redly.  You need independent information to justify these assertions.
We are said not be justified.
<p>
We have the meaning of the term and believe it.  To be convinced we must use our
frame of reference consistently.  We distinguish the differences in the different
states.  The organization of experience must occur on the objective level.
<p>
In his sections on semantics, Lehrer will explore the concept of <u>truth
by virtue of meaning</u>.  Empiricists believed that the analytic was this sort
of dialectic.
<p>
Logical truth:  something true of the laws of logic
<p class="example">
if <i>p</i> then <i>p</i>, either <i>p</i> or <i>~p</i><br>
~ both <i>p</i> and <i>~p</i>: you get a logical truth by assigning a new term,
which is a synonym.  They are true by virtue of just being a synonym.
<p>
Kant's <q>gold is a yellow metal</q> was somewhat analytic and talk about
a yellow metal as gold.
<p>
A term has meaning by:
<ol>
<li>its realtions to other terms:  colors are described and perhaps given new
names, symbols, in reference to other colors
<li>its reference to a thing
</ol>
<p>
The question Lehrer asked was, if you believe you are sensing redly, then
are you justified in believing it?  What Lehrer is concerned with is whether
we are <q>justified</q> or <q>believing.</q>  Do we have a concept of justification?
In his argument on scepticism, Lehrer wonders about the epistemic use of such
words.
<p>
A sceptic denies self-justified belief possibility.  The sceptic is said to be
unable to know the meaning of <q>justify</q> and <q>believing.</q>  Lehrer
considers this a specious objection.  What is really needed is to get at the
notion of Chisholm's self-presenting and the directly evident (self-justified).
<p>
A sceptic might say that <q>it is true by virtue of meaning.</q>  Or if I have
a headache which is self-presenting, then Lehrer can again assert what is the
foundation of your foundation.  But foundation is itself by virtue of meaning.
<p>
The final line of defense in the foundational theory as <q>what else could it
be?</q>  How can we form a foundation based on an unbasic belief?  Remember the
form of a foundational belief.
<p>
Lehrer:  if you accept <i>p</i> then you are justified in believing <i>p</i>.<br>
Chisholm:  if <i>p</i> then you are justified in believing <i>p</i>.
<p>
Chisholm calls his the <u>self-presenting</u> as basic.  Lehrer makes the
<u>self-justified</u> as basic.  From Lehrer it is only a belief.  But from
Chisholm you are actually in a state of experiencing <i>p</i>.  Of course,
Lehrer argues that we can find no state without independent information.

<h1>The Indirectly Evident</h1>
<p>
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/IndirectlyEvident.png"
class="float-rigth"
alt="Relationship With the Evident">
Chisholm will prepare us for basic beliefs.  Other beliefs rest upon them in a
more complex way.  Recall the <b>reliability theory</b> (externalist theory)
which makes a proposition indirectly evident because it has been processed by a
reliable mechanism (this is justification based upon reliability:  percepetion,
memory).
<p>
The argument for reliability involves justifying.  When is a mechanism reliable?
How can we tell when our own mechanisms are reliable?  We must have reasons
or evidence for putting something on reliability, which must necessarily be
internal.  Chisholm even tends to the internal.   Chisholm demands that we
involve ourselves in Socratic method which means to make an assertion and
explain yourself.  Again justifying and proving that something is reliable are
identical.  Backing up knowledge claims is possible.
<p>
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/evidence-filter.png"
class="float-left"
alt="filtering the directly evident to the indirectly evident using epistemic principles">

The most straightforward way to base something upon another thing.  <i>A</i> is
based on ? by
<ol>
<li><b>Deduction</b>:  a drawing out of <i>A</i> or consequences by what is
implied by <i>B</i>.  What we find in deduction is that we get no more than
a re-explanation of the argument.
<p class="example">
Consider:  <q>It seems there is a cat on the roof.</q><br>
We want:  <q>There is a cat on the roof.</q>
<p>
This is not deduction:  before we are in a state of mind in which we are being
appeared to.  Thus we can say, <q>It seems I see something</q> which is less
informative.  Deduction will never yield more.
<li><b>Induction</b>:  You go beyond given evidence
 <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
 <li><b>enumerative</b>&mdash; reason from already observed cases to unobserved
cases and thus we see <b>regularity</b> and <b>uniformity</b>.  We might infer
the sun will rise tomorrow.  The problem with induction from the direct &rarr;
indirectly evident is that the premises may <em>not</em> be directly evident.
Thus we must arrive at the directly evident.<br>
 Induction yields the same kind of output as the input.
 <li><b>inverse</b>&mdash; might seem like a fallacy which is called <u>affirming
the consequent</u>:
<ul style="float:left;margin:0 1.5em 0 0;width:2.5em;padding:1em;border:1px solid black;list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>p</i> &sup; <i>q</i>
<li style="border-bottom:1px solid black;"><i>q</i>
<li>&there4; <i>p</i>
</ul>
 It is true that it is deductively fallacious and that it can be deductively
 valid.  This is called the <q>hypotheticodeductive method</q>
 </ol>
</ol>
<p>
In the mid-20th century, we draw a conclusion affirming the consequent or draw
a hypothesis, observe what follows, then deduce the truth of <i>p</i>.
<p>
Chisholm offers the following argument:
<ol>
<li>If there is a cat on the roof, and if I stand on the garden and look
toward the roof, then I will sense a cat-like appearance.
<li>I stand in the garden, looking at the roof.
<li style="border-bottom:1px solid black;width:25em;">I sense a cat-like appearance.
<li>&there4; It is evident for me that a cat is on the roof.
</ol>
<p>
Chisholm says this will not work because it does not appear directly evident.
<p>
Chisholm asks along the same lines that one thing may serve as well as another.
For instance, one theory could fit as well as another.  Berkeley had a point if
we were all agreed that all of our thoughts were for the mind and we were to deny
the existence of matter.

So we have seen that Chisholm's <em>evident</em> = Lehrer's <em>completely
justified</em>
<p>
A Gettier example is presented in the assigned chapter:  it introduces Meinong's
veridical hallucination, which is a hallucination of a thing that is coincidentally
there.
<p>
Consider Chisholm's examples:  Evident propositions:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(<i>e</i><sub>1</sub>) Jones has a Ford in his garage
<li>(<i>e</i><sub>2</sub>) Jones has always owned a Ford
<li>(<i>e</i><sub>3</sub>) Jones has always driven a Ford
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(<i>f</i>) Jones owns a Ford
<li>(<i>k</i>) Brown is in Barcelona
</ul>
<p>
But I conclude (<i>f</i>) &or; (<i>k</i>) in which (<i>k</i>) is true but
(<i>f</i>) is false.  I did not know (<i>f</i> &or; <i>k</i>) becaused I believed
?  The chapter will begin with the concept of knowledge by establishing a
foundation.
<p>
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/basis-foundation.png"
  class="float-right"
 alt="the foundation for a bais">
Definition:  <i>e</i> is a <dfn>basis</dfn> for <i>h</i> iff:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li><i>e</i> is self-presenting for <i>S</i>
<li>necessarily if <i>e</i> is self-presenting, <i>h</i> is evident for <i>S</i>
</ol>
<p>
Definition:  <i>e</i> <dfn>confers evidence upon</dfn> <i>h</i> iff:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li><i>e</i> is evident
<li>every basis of <i>e</i> is as basis of <i>h</i> for <i>S</i>
</ol>
<p>
Take a series of propositions:
<p class="example">
I perceive that there is a cat:  it is evident that I am appeared to catly.
<p>
What Chisholm tries to do is show that we have to trace the path in the right
way.

No basis proposition can lead to another false proposition such that
when conjoined with <i><b>e</b></i> that it tends to confirm (makes evident
<i>~h</i>).
What goes wrong when we move from <i>e</i><sub>1</sub>, ...,
<i>e<sub>h</sub></i> to <i>f</i>.  He will say that what makes <i>f</i>
&or; <i>k</i>  evident is not its truth.
<p>

<p>
Regarding how Gettier counterexamples are handled by Chisholm is truly different.
The main problem is his sloppy usage of logical terms.
<p>
In Lehrer's <i>Justification and Evidence</i> chapter concerning foundationalism,
he moves more easily.  Let us grant for the moment:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>there are basic beliefs
<li>they are subjective, self-justifed, self-presenting
</ol>
<p>
How does justification require evidence?  Chisholm said that induction and
deduction were inadequate and built upon the coherence view of foundationalsm.
<p>
If we have nonfoundational (nonbasic) completely justified beliefs, then the
truth must be guaranteed by basic beliefs (the criterin seems too strong).
Justification can be sought in:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>reliabllity
<li>causation = justification, reason, in answer to question
<q>Why do you have belief?</q>
</ol>
<p>
What Lehrer says is that the <em>cause</em> being different from the
<em>evidence</em> is what makes you believe something.  Goldman has said,
<q>if you that <i>p</i>, you were caused to believe that <i>p</i> <em>in
some appropriate way</em>.</q>  He thought this would oppose the Gettier
counter-examples.
<p>
Lehrer shows some cases where you are led to belief by a cause different from
knowledge.
<p>
The first case is of a love-stricken lawyer, who has a female client accused
of committing a crime.  The lawyer believes in her innocence, but only because
he is in love with her.  Later, because of an intense investigation, he discovers
she was in fact innocent.  Did he really know that before the discovery?
<p>
<b>Conditional cause</b>:  if the original cause of his belief were replaced
by another (more appropriate) cause, then he would still believe.  If that
cause is replaced, the lawyer still knows it anyway.
<p>
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/support-for-belief.png"
class="float-left"
alt="supports for belief">
Do evidence and cause coincide?  If yes, then cause is appropriate.
<p>
The second case is of a gypsy lawyer who reads tarot cards about the future,
and about occurrences.  He has a client who is factually guilty of seven
murders, but the lawyer's case involves the accusation of the client of an
eighth (8th) murder:  circumstantially the evidence is overwhelming.
<p>
The gypsy lawyer discovers more substantial evidence which asserts the client's
innocence.  Did the lawyer <em>know</em> his client was innocent before the
discovery of the more substantial evidence?  The gypsy lawyer says that he
would <em>not</em> believe anything else unless it were written in the cards
(i.e., revealed in a tarot card reading).
<p>
The criticism of Lehrer's example is that it is not clear that the cause itself
is not the evidence.  But now it must be asked whether the cause and the evidence
is <em>appropriate</em>.  It is not really conclusive that Lehrer's position is
wholly correct.

<h1>Phenomenalism</h1>
<p>
Suppose we want to know about the material world.  But all we have are ideas
in the mind, and that this does not allow for physical objects (Berkeley).
Thus we render physical-object language into sense-data language.  It is
because the things we directly perceive are external to the mind.  No
metaphysical experience or presuppositions can be allowed.
<p>
Carnap in <i>Logical Construction of The World</i> tried to show how one can
build the whole thing on sensations.  He failed basically because of such
arguments as that of Lehrer.
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/Carnap.png"
class="float-right"
alt="carnap">
<b>Analytical phenomenalism</b> involves two types of statements, which are
shown in the figure at right: physical-object (<i>L</i> statements) and
sensation (<i>S</i> statements) terms. This says that if translation is
possible, there is no real change in information. <i>L</i> statements will
be <em>as</em> informative <em>or</em> less informative.
<p>
Suppose:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>L</i> = the doorknob is turning
<li><i>S</i> = under standard conditions, a person would have the following
sensations
</ul>
<p>
We would have to deduce from certain principles, which does not seem plausible.

<h1>Meaning and Inductive Justification</h1>
<p>
Induction involves a repetition of experience such that in several cases
<i>A</i> is <i>B</i>.  For instance, ther raven is black on several days.  Thus
all <i>A</i> is <i>B</i> or all ravens are black (from the particular &rarr;
universal).
<p>
Pollock points out that in justifying, part of the term of that is that
induction works by moving from belief to belief.   This grows out Goodman's
riddle of induction.  But first Hume's riddle.
<p>
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/induction-uniformity-circularity.png"
class="float-right"
alt="circular argument">
Hume's old riddle:  in order to conclude from observing past cases to the
universal, you need an additional premise that the unobserved will resemble the
observed (the principle of uniformity).  How do we justify that principle?
Hume says in the past, we have always seen the unobserved resembling the
observed, which is a circular argument (see figure)
<p>
Goodman's new riddle:  up to now, all emeralds observed have been green.  From
this we can say some emerald is green iff it is observed to be green and blue
not observed.  This entails that all unobserved emeralds are blue.
<p>
If we can have justification, we must have induction.  Lehrer says you need to
show that if you have induction, then you have justification.

<p class="date">
17 Feb 1983

<p>
Lehrer concluded from Goodman's riddle that something  more is necessary for
we can create such contradiction and confusion.
<p>
Probability theory was developed first by gamers and then by insurance companies.
The theory itself has many features:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>the calculus of probability:  how to compute the same probabilities on the
basis of others
<li>interpretation of the calculus:  no one knows really knows what the
interpretation is:
 <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
 <li>some think it is an analysis or property of things or events
 <li>it is a measure of rational expectation
 </ol>
</ul>
<p>
The first one is known in statistics as a frequency interpretation.

<h1>Frequency and Justification</h1>
<p>
This interpretation makes general contingent statements about the world.  The
input will be <b>observed frequencies</b> such as some ratio of <i>m/n</i>.
The output is an induced probability then of <i>n/m</i>.   The problem: how many
times must one perform or observe the event before we get an accurate number?
Again the number will not be the real or ideally known number but a
<b>central limit</b>  This is a tendency and a propensity toward the real value.
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>I seem to be seeing a cat
<li>It is highly probable that if I seem to see, then I do see.
<li>I am seeing a cat.
</ul>
<p>
What we need to show is a frequency such as <q>95% of the time, I see a cat.</q>
Does a high probability allow for justification?  No, says Lehrer.  What follows
is the necessity of a nonbasic belief.

<h1>Logical Probability and Justification</h1>
<p>
This is an offshoot of classical interpretation developed by Carnap.  What you
do is to look at the possible outcomes of a situation and divide them into
mutually exclusive possibilities.  In a die there are six possibilities.
There is no reason to believe that one possibility is better or greater over
the other.  Carnap believes in how the the evidence confirms the hypothesis.
Carnap involved himself in <b>confirmation functions</b> (C functions).  How
much evidence does <i>e</i> give to <i>h</i>?  Carnap devolved this by saying
that we take all things {<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>a<sub>n</sub></i>} and
all properties {<i>F</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>F<sub>n</sub></i>} and that
we arrange them using all possible permutations to derive <b>states</b>.  Apart
from experience then, we can determine the probability.  Carnap's theories were
suppose to be free of frequencies and enable <i>a priori</i> probabilities.

<h1>Subjective Probability and Justification</h1>
<p>
In logical theory, subjective probability is all based upon what one <em>should</em>
expect.  Subjective probabilities are assigned according to the preference of
the individual doing the assignment, but the <u>rule of consistency</u> states
that you can assign your own probability as long as you do not allow <q>book</q>
to be made against you.  The criteria determined by what you would wager:
how strongly do you believe something?  Again Lehrer's contention is that
high probability &ne; justification.
<p>
The lottery paradox indicates this very principle.  There is a highly
probable statement that is inconsistent with the evidence which generated it.
Consider the lottery example again:  <i>e</i> = a drawing had been held and
one the tickets has the number <i>n</i> in which there are <i>n</i> tickets
distributed.  Computation of the likelihood of each ticket winning would be
<i>1/n</i>.
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>P</i>(ticket 1 [<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>]) = <i>1/n</i>
<li><i>P</i>(<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> |<i>e</i>) = <i>1/n</i>
<li><i>P</i>(<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> lost|<i>e</i>) = 1 &minus; <i>1/n</i> =
   (<i>n</i> &minus; 1)/<i>n</i>
</ul>
<p>
If <i>P</i>(<i>p</i>|<i>e</i>) = 1 &minus; 1/<i>n</i>, then <i>p</i> is evident
if <i>n</i> is large.  It will be discovered that the high probability makes
it evident that every ticket holder is a loser.
<p>
Lehrer's principles will be applied to this analysis as follows:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>If <i>P</i>(<i>p</i>|<i>e</i>) &lt; 1, then there is the lottery paradox and
no justification
<li>If <i>P</i>(<i>p</i>|<i>e</i>) = 1, then <i>e</i> logically implies <i>p</i>
</ul>
<p>
But what about deduction?  Lehrer says that this is the most rational thing for
accepting <i>p</i> on the basis of <i>e</i> when
<i>P</i>(<i>p</i>|<i>e</i>) = 1.  This is all part of his decision theory.

<h1>Decision Theory and The Objective of Truth</h1>
<p>
The best possible decision is the most rational.  Most people will assign
a <i>P</i> = 1 when (<i>i</i>) <i>e</i> implies <i>p</i>  and (<i>ii</i>)
<i>p</i> is a logical truth.  This means that it <em>must</em> happen, and there
is nothing else that can happen.  It also implies that we will use the
<i>P</i> value to make a decision.  The decision is based on two elements.
<ol>
<li> Probability:  that is, it is a measure of probability
<li> Desirability:  that is, it is a measure of value  &rArr; <i>v</i>(<i>q, p</i>)
</ol>
<p>
We decide what would happen based on 
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>what probability will happen if I do it?  Or not do it?
<li>what is the desirability if I do it? Or not do it?
</ul>
<table class="no-rules">
<tr><td rowspan="2">probability <span style="font-size:180%;">{</span>
   <td><i>P</i>(will happen) =  <i>P</i>(<i>0/a</i>) = <i>n</i>
<tr>    <td><i>P</i>(will not happen) =  <i>P</i>(<i>~0/a</i>) = 1 &minus; <i>n</i>
<tr><td rowspan="2">desirability <span style="font-size:180%;">{</span>
   <td><i>v</i>(will happen) =  <i>v</i>(<i>0/a</i>) = <i>n</i>
<tr>    <td><i>v</i>(will not happen) =  <i>v</i>(<i>~0/a</i>) = &minus;<i>n</i>
</table>
<p>
The general desirability formula is derived as follows:
<p class="eqn-serif">
<i>E</i>(<i>a/o</i>) =  <i>P</i>(<i>o/a</i>) &middot; <i>v</i>(<i>o/a</i>)  +
   <i>P</i>(<i>~o/a</i>) &middot; <i>v</i>(<i>~o/a</i>)
<p>
where <i>E</i>(<i>a/o</i>) is the expected value of happening, which is the
desirability of acting with reference to a certain outcome.  When you decide
to act given a certain outcome, the action is is accepting that <i>p</i>
and the outcome is the <b>truth</b> that <i>p</i>.
<p>
In most cases <i>P</i>(<i>p</i>|that I accept <i>O</i>) = 1, but I still might
insist on believing in an absurd outcome too.  Lehrer will say you ought to
<em>accept</em> it when
<i>P</i>(<i>o/a</i>) &middot; <i>v</i>(<i>o/a</i>) &gt;
   <i>P</i>(<i>~o/a</i>) &middot; <i>v</i>(<i>~o/a</i>)

<p class="date">
22 Feb 1983

<p>
The discussion from the previous lecture on decision theory is continued.
<p>
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/no-move-to-nonbasic-beliefs.png"
class="float-right"
alt="no nonbasic beliefs from basic by induction-deduction">

For something to guarantee the truth, this should b e the most reasonable thing
to accept&mdash;whatever has the highest expected (<i>E</i>(<i>o/a</i>)
value with <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>) = 1.  This is the most certain of course.  But
even Lehrer will not allow the possibility of justifying the indirectly evident.
Consider Lehrer's scheme of the expected value:
<p>
<i>E</i>(<i>Ap/p</i>) &equiv; the expected value of accepting <i>p</i> relative
to <i>p</i> (and <i>p</i> is true)
<p>
= <i>P</i>(<i>p/Ap</i>) &middot; <i>v</i>(<i>p/Ap</i>) + <i>P</i>(<i>~p/Ap</i>)
&middot; <i>v</i>(<i>~p/Ap</i>)
<p>
Whether we accept <i>p</i> (<i>Ap</i>) is independent of the truth of <i>p</i>.
For <i>P</i>(<i>p/Ap</i>) this is just <i>P</i>(<i>p</i>) because the truth of
<i>p</i> is independent of <i>Ap</i>.
<p>
<i>E</i>(<i>Ap/p</i>) = <i>P</i>(<i>p</i>) &middot; <i>v</i>(<i>p/Ap</i>) +
<i>P</i>(<i>~p</i>) &middot; <i>v</i>(<i>~p/Ap</i>)
<p>
Now we would rather accept what is true than false so we give opposite value:
<p>
= <i>P</i>(<i>p</i>) &middot; <i>v</i>(<i>p/Ap</i>) + <i>P</i>(<i>~p</i>)
&middot; <i>&minus;v</i>(<i>p/Ap</i>)
<p>
= <i>P</i>(<i>p</i>) &minus; <i>P</i>(<i>~p</i>)
<p>
If our value is assigned one, then <i>E</i> = 1 and not higher.

<h1>Coherence (Explanatory)</h1>
<p>
Knowledge of the world has been gained largely because of the support of the
explanations which scientists need to support each other.  Sellars has said
that this <b>explanatory coherence</b> is critical.
<p>
Lehrer first addresses the fact that Aristotle has said tht we need a foundation.
Coherence is not likely to be an answer.  The big problem with explanatory
coherence is that justification is based upon a reciprocal relation of coherence
of beliefs belonging to a system of kind <i>k</i>.
<p>
What is coherence?  What kind of system is necessary to give maximal coherence?
What makes something the best explanation?
<p>
Idealists like Bradley, McTaggert, and Blanchard beleived that all facts are
related in that every fact is tied to every other fact.  The world is a system
of inexhaustible relations.  It is against the grain of common sense to believe
in Bradleyianism.
<div style="float:left;margin:0.5em 1.5em 0.5em 0;border:1px solid blue;width:23em;">
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/coherence.png"
alt="coherence" style="float:left;" >
<p style="text-align:left;font:bold 110% Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Which system to choose?
</div>
The major difficult is determining what the propositions are.
<p>
The traditional answer to the question <q>What is Coherence?</q> is <b>entailment</b>,
but this is to be rejected.  Look at the explained and the explaining:
<p>
Self-presenting states:
<ul>
<li>I seem to see a cat.
<li>I do see a cat.
</ul>
<p>
Arrow from these propositions point to each other.  Because the existence of other
minds explains the existence of other bodies, and that they behave in a certain way
is sufficient proof that other minds exist.  Consider that believing in
molecules&mdash;the molecular nature of the world&mdash;is an appropriate model
for explaining a working of the processes in the universe.
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/coherence-systems.png"
alt="coherence systems" class="float-right" style="width:60%;">
Is explanatory coherence an externalist or internalist theory?  To determine
the tightness one must connect some proposition <i>p</i> to the system it will
affect.  But if <i>q</i> and <i>r</i> are incompatible in one belief system
(that is, <i>q</i> &and; <i>r</i> is a contradiction), which is a better explanatory
system given the possibility.
<p>
So now <u>mutatis mutandis</u>.
<p>
<i>S</i> is completely justified in believing that <i>p</i> &equiv; <i>S</i>
believes <i>p</i> consistently with  a system <i>C</i> having maximum coherence
in relation to other systems.
<p>
<i>Q</i> is a belief system:
<ol>
<li><i>p</i> must be consistent with <i>Q</i>
<li><i>Q</i> has the most explanatory coherence of any other system: <i>p</i>
must be part of the system.
<li>Either <i>p</i> explains or is explained better than anyting inconsistent
with it.  If yes, replace <i>p</i>, it is no logner the best system.
</ol>
<ol>
<li><b>deductive model</b>:  involves 3 elements: (i)<i>E</i> - what is to be
explained, (ii) <i>L</i> - a law, (iii)<i>C</i> boundary conditions.  Also
known as <b>covering law model</b>, namely that in a system, things obey
certain principles.  Counterexample:  does not explain, although it justifies,
and is necessary for knowledge.
<li><b>epistemic analysis of explanation</b>:  <i>S</i> explains <i>W</i> to
<i>B</i>.  <i>B</i> comes to know <i>W</i> &rarr; is justified &rarr; explains
&rarr; (cycles back to <i>B</i> comes to know <i>W</i>...coming full circle.
</ol>
<p>
Hempel then gives something on logical explanation.  The problem with
explanatory coherence is that it does not know what the hell <b>explanation</b>
is.  Neither (1) nor (2) are adequate.

<h1>Meta-Theory of Justification</h1>
<p>
The rules for choosing statements to believe are set out by:
<ul>
<li>lower level theories
<li>Chisholm
<li>explanatory coherence
</ul>
<p>
The aim of justification is to believe as many truths and not to believe
as many falsehoods as possible.  The aim is to seek the truth.  Chisholm in
Chapter 3 quotes James on that point.
<p>
Lehrer stated that the foundationalists seek to guarantee the truth, which he
demanded of them.  The main problem was that it was not general enough:  the
explanatory coherence is not a proper basis.
<p>
An objective way in which we move to justification is the input:  a fact and the
output, namely the justification.  Lehrer says this appeal is not likely to
persuade the skeptic.
<p>
The fact is, every statement of evidence that is used to justify a belief is
itself a belief, and so we have a <b>circle of beliefs</b>.
<p>
Sense (sensory) experience is <q>mute</q> in that it can tell us nothing.
Belief in the proper functioning of the parts is no justification.  If every
justification involves only beliefs, the best theory is one that is not
objective, but subjective.  How do you know?  Chisholm believe in an objective
language for epistemology.
<p>
For Chisholm justification is basically not to look for justification, but to
find an explanation for the justification.  Lehrer is serious in that we
do not explain what is supposedly common sense.  Lehrer says Chisholm does
not explain anything.
<p>
A term <dfn>synthetic <i>a priori</i></dfn> (p 199) is defined as <b>anything
that is not true by meaning of words and logic, and it must be independent of
experience.</b>
<p>
The version of coherence in justification, called <em>systematic justification</em>,
is that <i>p</i> is justified only if <i>p</i> coheres with statements of kind
<i>k</i>.  What does it mean to cohere?  What are statements of kind <i>k</i>?
Something is justified if it explains or is explained by other statements.
<p>
The essence of the theory is:  the notion of beliefs about the chances of a
statement has about being true.  Subjective probabilities are what is referred
to, and these have been discussed previously.  Thus <i>p</i> has a chance of
being true.  Statements of kind <i>k</i> are a system of statements with the
aim of discovering the truth.
<p>
A system of beliefs is a <dfn>doxastic system</dfn> (DS).  Lehrer makes certain
assumptions with the system such that:
<ol>
<li>a list of statements of the form <b><i>S</i> believes that <i>p</i></b> or
<b><i>S</i> accepts <i>p</i> at time <i>t</i></b>.   These statements will only
embrace statements likely to be true.  Such a list would be rather large to
say the least.  No one of us could tell what all this encompasses.  Lehrer is
not presenting an algorithm, but claims only that the statements are true.
<li>Certain beliefs in the set are not such that the person would believe them
if his or her only aim were to accept or believe only what is true.  These
statements must be purged from the truth.
</ol>
<p>
The set of beliefs with remain are the <em>classic</em> system of beliefs
(classic doxastic system, CDS).  The corrected set may say { <q>God exists</q> }
which serves as the primary belief upon which to found knowledge.  It seems that
what we choose to believe is arbitrary.  Arbitrariness rather casts doubt on
what is justified.  How can we show that we are justified through our beliefs
if we also need justification for the beliefs themselves?
<p>
This is still not going to be sufficient to justify us (our knowledge).  Recall
the lottery paradox where being <q>highly probable</q> is insufficient for
justification.  Now based upon probabilities, we cannot say that any ticket
is a winner.  Look at it though:
<ul>
<li><i>P</i><sub>1</sub>: Ticket #1 is a loser because <i>P</i>(<i>~w</i>) = 99/100
<li><i>P</i><sub>1</sub>: Ticket #2 is a loser because <i>P</i>(<i>~w</i>) = 98/99
</ul>
<p>
Note the <b>negative relevance</b>:
<p>
<i>P</i>(<i>P</i><sub>1</sub>) &gt; <i>P</i>(<i>P</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>P</i><sub>1</sub>)
and both probabilities differ.  Remember it in contrast with <b>positive
relevance</b>&mdash;Chisholm's notion of tending to confirm.  Negative relevance
moves the other way.
<ol start="3">
<li>For any two statements believed to be relevant to each other, either we must
consider one to be more probable than the other, or for it not to be the case.
</ol>
<p>
<i>P</i><sub>2</sub> <em>competes</em> with <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> (Lehrer's
intuition concept) in that they can lower the probability of one another.  The
question is, is the probability of <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> greater than
<i>P</i><sub>2</sub> or vice-versa.  Thus we can say
<ol start="4">
<li>if <i>p</i> is justified (coheres with CDS), then <i>p</i> coheres with all
its competition.
</ol>
<p>
Epistemic field propositions which you think are relevant.  The phenomenon of
rationalizing is exactly this foundation.  Examples of competition:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>one has an urn with 100 beans.  60% are green.  Within the epistemic field
we have:
 <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
 <li>60% of the jelly beans are green
 <li>drawing of the beans is random
 <li>the probabilility that I draw a green bean is 0.6  What would lower the
 probability?
 <li>there are non-green beans in the urn
 </ol>
<li>There is a desk before me.
 <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
 <li>I am not hallucinating
 <li>I am now asleep
 <li>Sometimes I hallucinate.

<h1>The Gettier Case (Again)</h1>
<p>
We were given <i>p</i>  Then we infer <i>p</i> &or; <i>q</i>  deductively.
<ol>
<li><i>Ep</i>
<li><i>E p</i> implies <i>p</i> &or; <i>q</i>.
<li><i>E</i> <i>p</i> &or; <i>q</i>.
</ol>
<p>
If anything, we <q>reduce</q> the knowledge or information content.  Lehrer
says his system makes it harder to generate the Gettier counterexample.
Does <i>p</i> or <i>q</i> beat the competition?
<p>
Well the <i>P</i>(<i>~q</i>) may be very high.  <i>~q</i> competes with
<i>p</i> &or; <i>q</i> because it reduces the probability of <i>p</i> &or; <i>q</i>.
N.B. competition affects the probability of the outcome.
<p>
Note we must consider what the competition is:
<p>
<i>p</i> &or; <i>q</i> may be such that we must consider both <i>P</i>(<i>q</i>)
and <i>P</i>(<i>~q</i>).  If you assume <i>P</i>(<i>p</i> &or; <i>q</i>) &gt;
<i>P</i>(<i>~q</i>) then we can be justified in Lehrer's system that we
have knowledge.
<p>
What about the possibility of <i>p</i> being false?  We rule this out.  Take the
principle of <b>infallibilism</b>:  no false statement is ever completely
justified (justification is a guarantee of the truth) but this is absurd because
we would never justified.  Somehow we must allow the propositions which are true
to prevail.
<p>
Justification contains not false beliefs;  this is the Gettier example again.
Some of our justifications have <b>redundancies</b> in which something
which does not work has a backup or prop. to help it.  We have to come up with
some notion of dependence where justification does not depend upon any false
statement.  If I accept <i>p</i> is false, I lose justification.
<p>
Lehrer's rivals Peter Klein and Risto Hilpinen have offered a proposal which
Lehrer find inadequate.  Recall that we have something like a defeater.
<ul>
<li><i>p</i>:  FALSE.  N.B. <i>p</i> serves as the defeater because it alone
ruins justification
<li>&there4; <i>p</i> &or; <i>q</i>:  TRUE
</ul>
<p>
<b>Internal defeaters</b>:  play a role in actual justification:  <q>Nogot
owns a Ferrari</q> was used and necessary.
<p>
<b>External defeater</b>:  plays no role but is relevant to it.
<p>
<b>The Klein-Hilpinen Condition</b>.  There must be no internal or external
defeaters such that no false statement which will ruin justification
if the statement was known to be false.  Because this is too strong, Lehrer
invented the <b>Grobit</b> example, and concluded that some false statements
would block justification but should not, the reason being that they are
misleading.
<p>
Counterexample:  (1) In the library Tom Grobit comes in, grabs a book, and
walks out.  What do we conclude:
<p>
(1C) It is <i>evident</i> that Grobit stole the book.  What is left:
(2) Tom's father, Mr. Grobit, says Tom is not in town but twin John is.
<p>
Thus (1C) was first justified but now that we know (2), (1C) is no longer
justifiedd.  We also know that (3) Mr. Grobit was under a delusion or
hallucination, even though he is normally reliable.  What we wasy here is
that one should not go beyond the system of beliefs to look for potentially
false statements.
<p>
Lehrer brings up the case of Harman's newspaper example, wherein some external
defeaters must be taken into account.  <q>There is some information which
is overlooked but must be taken into account in deciding whether one has
knowledge.</q>
<p>
<b>Newspaper example</b>&mdash; the reporter witnesses an assassination of a
leader.  But everyone involved tries to cover it up and denies the assassination.
The reporter is ignorant of what is going on.  There is massive evidence and
external, but if the reporter does not take it all into account, he does not
really know.
<p>
Lehrer says that (1) he would not knwo if the evidence of cover-up would have
made a difference in jusitification but (2) the justification was never complete
in the first place.  If (3) he does know, then he has taken the possibility of
additional defeaters.
<p>
<b>Verific alternative to the doxastic system</b>.  Note that a doxastic system
is a system of beliefs which we believe tend to the truth with comparative
probability estimates, and also with a list of which proposition competes with
what.
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>Change all the false beliefs to true ones:  that is, if <i>p</i> is false,
then <i>~p</i> is true, and you assert <i>~p</i>.
<li>Change or readjust the probabilities to reflect the new beliefs;  the
probabilities are now objective rather than subjective:  they are no longer
estimates,  they are real conditions or probabilities.
</ol>
<p>
Now we are verifically justified:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>original (Havit, Nogot)
<li>in the verific alternative, we believe ~Nogot owns an F.
</ol>
<p>
What is <i>P</i>(Nogot owns an F or Havit owns an F)?<br>
What is <i>P</i>(~Nogot owns an F) is very high
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>original:  sheep &mdash; there was a sheep which you guessed but it was a dog.
<li>in VA, what you took to be a sheep was not a sheep
</ol>
<p>
<i>P</i>(I see a sheep) goes weay down now.
<p>
In the Grobit example, we remain justified because we can not readjust what
Mr. Grobit said because we never have the belief to begin with.  What if
Tom Grobit did have twin brotherfs?

<p class="date">

<ul>
<li><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>:  James told me that Havit owns a Ford
<li><i>p</i><sub>2</sub>:  James is highly reliable
<li><i>p</i><sub>3</sub>:  James is Havit's best friend and confidant
<li><i>p</i><sub>4</sub>:  James is lying about Havit
</ul>
<p>
It is not evident that Havit owns a Ford:  <i>P</i>(<i>p</i><sub>1</sub> &or;
<i>p</i><sub>2</sub> &or; <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>) &gt; <i>P</i>(<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>
&or; <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> &or; <i>p</i><sub>3</sub> &or; <i>p</i><sub>4</sub>)
<p>
With a CDS:
<ul>
<li><i>P</i>(<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>):  Nogot has always owned a Ford
<li><i>P</i>(<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>):  Nogot was seen driving a Ford today
<li><i>P</i>(<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>):  Nogot showed me the ownership papers.
<li><i>P</i>(<i>p</i><sub>4</sub>):  Nogot has not just lost possession of the Ford
</ul>
<p>
It is evident that Nogot owns a Ford:
<i>P</i>(<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>-<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>) &gt;
<i>P</i>(<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>-<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>/<i>p</i><sub>4</sub>)
<p>
Changed into the verific alternative.  We shrink the beliefs in doxastic system
to all truth statements.  Now look at <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>-<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>
in both systems.  Alone they do not cohere to defeat the simple assertion of
<i>p</i><sub>4</sub>.
<p>
<b>Remember external defeaters</b>.  Go outside and bring in all external
defeaters.  Assume for the moment however that this potential defeater is
<em>doubtful</em>:  it is more reasoanble to accept than <em>not</em> accept it
(after Chisholm).  Doubtful information would have a marginal probability.
<p>
If the false statement:  <i>Nogot has not just lost possession of the Ford</i>,
then his doubtful statement will have little impact on justification.
<p>
Look at the statement <q>Jones is a liar.</q>  Assume it is doubtful.  If
certain key evidence becomes doubtful, then it cannot effectively&mdash;and
as Lehrer thinks&mdash;objectively present itself as a verific alternative.
<p>
Personal justification involves handling all the external defeaters
(see pp 238-234).
<p>
<b>Knowing That One Knows</b>.  This does not confer knowledge upon knowing that
<i>p</i>.
<ul>
<li>If <i>S</i> knows that <i>p</i>, then <i>S</i> knowws that he knows <i>p</i>.
<li>If <i>kp</i>, then <i>kkp</i>.
</ul>
<p>
Actually there is no difference between the two claims.   According to Lehrer
it is an absurd redundancy.  Suppose then that there are three conditions for
knwoledge.  Suppose <i>p</i> is not true:  then why would we say that I know
that I do not know, or on the other hand, I know that I know when <i>p</i> is
evident and I believe <i>p</i>?
<p>
If <i>K<sub>s</sub> p</i>, then <i>p</i> is true, <i>A<sub>S</sub> p</i>, and
<i>E<sub>S</sub>p</i>.<br>
Assume <i>K<sub>s</sub> p</i> to prove <i>K<sub>s</sub>K<sub>s</sub> p</i>
<p>
<i>K<sub>s</sub>K<sub>s</sub> p</i> implies <i>K<sub>s</sub></i>, so that
<i>Tp</i>, <i>A<sub>s</sub> p</i>, and <i>E<sub>s</sub> p</i> follow.  Or:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><ol>
 <li><i>K<sub>s</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;p</i> is true, or
 <li>it is true that <i>K<sub>s</sub>K<sub>s</sub> p</i>
 </ol>
<li><ol>
 <li><i>K<sub>s</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;A<sub>S</sub> p</i> or
 <li><i>A<sub>s</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;K<sub>s</sub> p</i>
 </ol>
<li><ol>
 <li><i>K<sub>s</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;E<sub>S</sub> p</i> or
 <li><i>E<sub>s</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;K<sub>s</sub> p</i>
 </ol>
</ul>
<p>
In addition,
<ol>
<li>It is true that { it is true that <i>p</i>, <i>A<sub>S</sub> p</i>,
  <i>E<sub>S</sub> p</i> }
<li><i>A<sub>s</sub></i>:  { it is true that <i>p</i>, <i>A<sub>S</sub> p</i>,
  <i>E<sub>S</sub> p</i> }
<li><i>E<sub>s</sub></i>: { it is true that <i>p</i>, <i>A<sub>S</sub> p</i>,
  <i>E<sub>S</sub> p</i> }
</ol>
<p>
Condition (2) is relevant.  Do I <em>believe</em> or <em>accept</em> that I know
when I claim that I know?  Anyone making a knowledge claim must be convinced that
he knows.
<p>
Look at Condition (3):
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li><i>E<sub>s</sub></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>p</i> is true  (this is trivial)
<li><i>E<sub>s</sub>A<sub>s</sub> p</i>:  (?&mdash; belief = conviction, seems
likely)
<li><i>E<sub>s</sub>E<sub>s</sub> p</i>:  (&darr;)
</ol>
<p>
Lehrer talks about the <u>doxastic system principle</u> in which we repeat
the statement.  This redundancy in 3C makes it evident that I find it evident.
We would have to evaluate the following:
<ul class="no-marker">
<li><i>P</i>(<i>E<sub>s</sub> p</i>) &gt; <i>P</i>(<i>E<sub>s</sub> p</i>*)
<li><i>P</i>(<i>P</i>(<i>p</i>) &gt; <i>P</i>(<i>p*</i>)) &gt;
<i>P</i>(<i>P</i>(<i>p</i>) &gt; <i>P</i>(<i>p*</i>)*)
</ul>
<p>
Recall that Lehrer's real fourth condition is to use the justification of the
verific alternative to say that <i>I believe that</i> p.
<ol>
<li>it is true that <i>Kp</i>
<li><i>A<sub>s</sub> K<sub>s</sub> p</i>
<li><i>E<sub>s</sub> K<sub>s</sub> p</i>
<li><i>E<sub>v</sub> K<sub>s</sub> p</i>
 <ol>
 <li><i>E<sub>v</sub></i> it is true that  (trivial)
 <li><i>E<sub>v</sub> A<sub>s</sub> p</i> How is it evident?
 <li><i>E<sub>v</sub> E<sub>s</sub> p</i> How is it evident?
 <li><i>E<sub>v</sub> E<sub>v</sub> p</i> How is it evident?
 </ol>
</ol>
<p>
Looking at 4b, according to Lehrer's system, the only beliefs we accept are
beliefs which are true.  If we run through our beliefs, we see <i>p</i> among
them, and we see that we have accepted <i>p</i>.
<p>
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/evidence-CDS-vs-VACDS.png"

alt="CDS vs VA/CDS for evidence">
Looking at 4c, the figure at left indicates that a classic doxastic system
gets its affirmation from one with a verific alternative in the system,
but also that the verific alternative is implied by what is evident about
<i>p</i> in the system itself.
<p>
Looking back at 3d (<i>E<sub>s</sub> E<sub>v</sub> p</i>), is someone justified
in believe that he is justified that all beliefs are rooted out?  We can say that
this is not likely because it may not be evident that all of our statements
are true.

<h1>Scepticism</h1>
<p>
The term <dfn>academic scepticism</dfn> refers to a concept developed within
Plato's Academy.  Its members denied that any of us has knowledge of any kind.
The Sceptics were led by Pyrrho, and were sceptical as to whether we know
whether we have any knowledge.   They suspend judgment as to everything being
known.  The criticism of this approach is that the Academics may have very
well contradicted themselves:  that is, how could they know at least one thing:
the knowledge that they know nothing?  The rise in Scepticism was seen during the
decline of the Roman Empire.
<p>
Further reading:  in Cartesian times, doubt as a form of scepticism reaches
a heyday.  Richard Popkin's <i>The History of Scepticism:  From Erasmsus to
Spinoza</i> is part of an interesting series on scepticism that treats the
Cartesian period particularly.
<p>
The foundationalist Chisholm asks about the problem of criteria of knowledge
to answer the sceptics.  The <em>criteria</em> of the <em>criteria</em> also
questions the authority which establishes the criteria.  Authority is then
self-subsuming  if it tries to to say that its authority is vested in virtue
of a feature description of itself.
<p>
<img src="imagesTheoryOfKnowledgeHTML/verifying-beliefs.png"
class="float-right"
alt="beliefs and the method of verifying them as knowledge">
<b>particularism</b>.  Particular things serve as paradigms of knowledge.  They
are self-justifying models and knowledge conditions are apprehended from that.
It begins with a division, uses a division to justify the method.
<p>
<b>methodism</b>.  rather than start with a model of knowledge, something we know
to be certain, we just conceive of a method and test it to see if we cannot
conceive of a counter example.
<p>
<b>scepticism</b>.  neither the methodist nor the particularist is satisfactory.
<p>
The only methods, for example, which Chisholm discusses are empirical methods.
David Hume started out as an empiricist and was later led to scepticism.  Lehrer
himself points out that his method is not absolutely certain, but it is the last.
It is not as arbitrary as Chisholm's absolute profession of the truth.  We have
to compromise with the sceptic in recognition of the defeaters which he offers.
<p>
Chisholm's point of view is that knowledge (<q>common senssism</q>) leads to
a method whcih incorporates at least three traditional sources:
<ol>
<li>perceptions of senses
<li>memory
<li>introspection (self-awarencess, self-presentation)
</ol>
<p>
Lehrer says that it is an advantage of his method that we are not mired to any
source of knowledge.
<p>
Scepticism is not viewed in the manner of Chisholm by Lehrer.  Scepticism is the
corpus of arguments which take away from our certainty, namely on the premise that
(i) we are fallible or prone to error:  if knowledge demands certainty, the sceptic
almost always loses.
<p class="example">
I claim to know that <i>p</i>
<p>
A competitor to <i>p</i> says that there is some chance for error, namely that I
think I am mistaken.  All data is subject to interpretation.  Interpretation
involves concepts, which are general terms of our experience.  We are constantly
replacing our concepts.
<p>
We can weaken and lower the propensity to error by really generalizing, but this
would give statements low informative value.  The sceptic is defeated if he
uses less than specific statements, for we can indeed be competitive with
the statement of the sceptic.  (Here the sceptic tries to attack a doxastic
system.)
<ol>
<li><q>I see a chair</q>
<li><q>You may be dreaming now</q>
<li><q>I may not be [seeing the chair] on the other hand.</q>
</ol>
<p>
Note how the progression from 1 to 3 works back in which statement 3 defeats
statement 2, and statement 2 defeats statement 1.

Both of the systems (shown in figure at right) may be justified, but who is
right?  We cannot know unless we step outside and consider the bare view of
reality.
<p>
Coherence is supposed to be a meta-theory of justification.  It has a social
dimension.  Society sets certain arbitrary standards which must be met.

<p>
What follows is a two-page handout on <q>Decision Theory</q> from the instructor
found in the notes.  (It is uncertain if there were more handouts;  if there were
they were lost after 25 some years.)

<div class="page">
<p class="title">
Decision Theory
<p>
Bayesian decision theory is a method for deciding which of several conflicting
alternative choices is the most rational under conditions of uncertainty. It
gives a formula for computing the expected desirability of the action. This
formula is a function of the comparison of the possible outcomes of taking the
action.  Both the probability and the desirability of these possible outcomes
must be taken into account.

<p>
<b>Probability</b>.  We have seen 1n class that there are two ways to look at
probability:
<ol>
<li>Absolute probabllity, pr(p). i.e. the probability assigned to
p without reference to additional evidence.
<li>Conditional probability, pr(p, q), 1. e. the probabllity that p
is true given condition q.
</ol>
<p>

For the sake of simplicity, we will use only a special kind of conditional
probability. The reason for this is that in decision theory. we must inquire
about the probability that a certain outcome will occur if the action is
performed.  For example, how probable is it that you will score significantly
higher on your final if you stay up all night? In making our decisions, we can
compare the probability of an outcome if the action is performed with its
probability if it is not performed, or we can compare it to the probability of
the outcome in the case of each of several alternative actions (but these must
exhaust the range of possible alternatives).
<p>
<b>Desirability</b>. Like probability, desirability is conditional. ~hether or
not you like the outcome depends in part on how you value the action itself. 
For example, for most people the desirability of achieving a certain grade on 
an exam is greater given that they do not have to stay up all night in order to 
do it than it would be if they did pull an all-nighter.  We can symbolically 
represent desirability in a manner akin to the symbolism for probability. The 
desirability of an outcome q given action p is symbolized as:
<p style="margin-left:3em;">
  v(q, p)
<p>
<b>Expected desirability</b>. This is the outcome of weighing the value of
performing an action against the likelihood of the outcome taking place.
Let E(a, 0) represent the expected desirability of performing an action
a with respect to an outcome o.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<span class="big">General Desirability Formula</span>
<p>
E(a, o) = pr(o, a) x v(o, a) + pr{-o, a) x v(-o, a)
</div>
<p>
Let us assign some numerical values to our example. Suppose that you are taking
the test pass/fail. and you are trying to decide whether to stay up all night.
<table class="none">
<tr><td>&nbsp;a = you stay up all night          <td>&nbsp;o = you pass the test
<tr><td>&minus;a = you don't stay up all night   <td>&minus;o = you fail the test
</table>
</div>

<div class="page">
<table class="td-center">
<caption>Probability</caption>
<tr><th class="none"><th>You Pass <th>You Fail
<tr><td class="left">pull all-nighter   <td>.9    <td>.1
<tr><td class="left">no all-nighter     <td>.5    <td>.5
</table>

<table class="td-center">
<caption>Desirability</caption>
<tr><th class="none"><th>You Pass <th>You Fail
<tr><td class="left">pull all-nighter   <td>.9    <td>-.9
<tr><td class="left">no all-nighter     <td>1    <td>-1
</table>

<p>
The probabilities here are self-explanatory. The desirability matrix is made up
on the following assumptions. First, the desirabilites of passing and failing
add up to 0 (the one is the opposite of the other). Second, you would rather
not pull an all nighter if you could help it. So the best possible outcome (= 1)
is passing with a good night's sleep. The worst outcome (= -1) is failing
without having made the all-out effort to pass.  Passing without sleep is still
pretty desirable (= .9), and failing without sleep (= -.9) would be very
miserable physically, but at least you tried.
<p>
We can now plug into the general desirability formula, which can be
arranged spatially by superimposing the two matrices over each other.

<div style="text-align:center;">
<span class="big">Expected Desirability</span>
<p>
E(a, o)  = .9 &times; .9 + .1 &times; &minus;.9 = .72
<p>
E(-a,o) = .5 &times; 1 + .5 &times; -1 = 0
</div>
<p>
This result is not surprising, given the way the case is set up. Studying all
night dramatically raises your chance of success, and you don't care all that
much about losing the sleep.
<p>
In general, when the expected desirability of an action is greater than
that of its alternatives, you should perform the action.
<p>
<b>Exercise (optional)</b>
<p>
Alter the above example by assigning values which reflect the following
circumstances. You judge that there is a very marginal difference between your
performance after staying up all night and after sleeping all night. (If you
are like me, your ability to think is diminished and impairs your ability to
process the extra information crammed in.) Further, you don't really care much
about whether you pass the course, since your GPA is not affected and you have
enough units without it. On the other hand, you do value your sleep. Try
assigning all the numbers and then guessing what decision theory says you
should do. Were you right?

Note-Taking Student's Motivation
<p>
I had always planned on transcribing lecture notes I had made as an undergraduate
student and putting them on the web.   I sorely doubt it would add to the
<q>knowledgebase</q> that is this thing that has become the <q>Internet Library.</q>
But I figured at least it would provide information about what university students
were learning in the epoch in which I was learning.  Or perhaps I should say,
<q>...in the epoch in which I was a student.</q>
<p>
My transcription of the Theory of Knowledge course notes was rushed however.
<p>
My daughter is a 17-year old high school senior who is part of the International
Baccalaureate (IB) program. This program apparently allows students the
challenge of taking college level courses while in high school.
<p>
Several weeks ago, my daughter told me she was taking a <q>TOK</q> course. I
asked what that was, and I almost fainted when she told me that it was a
"Theory of Knowledge" course.
<p>
You see, my daughter knew that I received an undergraduate education in which
one of my majors was in Philosophy (yes, I did get a degree in it, but don't
bring it up with my professors, who might only be enraged at the news), so she
naturally asked for my assistance.
<p>
Apparently my daughter had been given an assignment to write an essay and could
choose from several options.  She chose the following:
<div style="font:normal 100% Palatino,Tahoma,serif;color:brown;margin:1.5em 5%">
Given the statement:
<p style="font:bold 105% Tahoma,Verdana,sans-serif;">
Only seeing general patterns gives us knowledge.  Only seeing particular
examples gives us understanding.
<p>
To what extent do you agree with this?
</div>
<p>
When I asked what sort of guidance she had been given, where her lecture notes
were, and what sort of introductory monographs had been recommended or required
for her to read to prepare for such an assignment, she gave me a bewildered
look and said she had no lecture notes!
<p>

This was altogether shocking. The only way to treat this assignment is as a
scholar should and would do. And this is to develop a strong grounding by 
reading cover-to-cover well-known introductory texts (those of Chisholm and 
Lehrer would be a mandatory start, I would figure), in addition to having 
covered the sections in the <q>history of philosophy</q> texts on the 
epistemological systems developed by the ancients (from the Stoics to Plato and 
Aristotle), on through to St. Augustine, and into the enlightenment with 
Descartes, Locke, Hume, struggling with Kant and others&mdash;a struggle made 
easier by reading the works of contemporaries who have done the struggling for 
you by interpreting, summarizing and distilling their works.
<p>
Now with a couple of dozen excerpts to be used as footnotes, having strong
relevance to the assignment question, then any student with such an essay
assignment is now ready to outline and compose the essay from an informed
perspective, and offer impressive citations in support of the thesis taken. The
exercise was all about demonstrating if one had the proper discipline in
assembling the body of thoughts and ideas of others and from that perhaps to
develop one's own personal belief system.
<p>
But then perhaps I am wrong about all this.  Perhaps the TOK developers in the
IB program had a different idea in mind.  Perhaps professors considered
experts in epistemology were consulted and acted as advisors in developing this
program.  Perhaps I am quite ignorant of the goals of the TOK course in the IB
program as to how they will teach the fundamentals and concepts of subject matter
imbued with subtleties seemingly far beyond the grasp of a high school senior.
Certainly my daughter has no answer for me to these questions, and she is no
slouch academically (as hard as I am as a parent, I can vouch for this).
