<h1>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)</h1>
<p>Membrane glycoproteins mediate cell-to-cell interactions.  A slide is
presented showing an RBC encountering a lymphocyte.  The lymphocytes shows
tremendous number of microvilli and filopodia, while the RBC is relatively
smooth.  The contact was mediated by coating the RBC with complement, which have
glycoconjugates that enabled the interaction.  Glycoconjugates include
glycoproteins, GAGs, and glycolipids.
<p>
When RBCs pass through sinous capillaries in the spleen, they must deform their
shape, and this deformation process is mediated the glycoprotein <b>glycophorin</b>.
<b>Acanthocytes</b> in the spleen have a spiked, mace-lke appearance.
<p>
Malignant melanoma in humans has always been metastatic.  A slide is shown
in which melanoma cells invade a monolayer of cultured endothelial cells.
Such metastasis involved cell-cell recognition of surface glycoproteins
and proteolytic degradation.
<p>
In cell division, an in vitro examination of Chinese hamster ovary cells in
culture shows a rounded appearance of the cell in mitosis.  Other cells in
G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>0</sub> show a bipolar, spindle shape.
<p>
With transformation, cell shapes of most cells are grossly altered, and this
is likely due to glycoconjuages on the cell surface.  The properties of
transformation are:
<ol>
<li>loss of growth control &mdash; greater cell densities
<li>reduced/no requirement for growth factors &mdash; loss of surface
glycoproteins which serve as a receptor
<li>anchorage independence &mdash; no need for substrate contact for growth
<li>cell recognition systems altered or lost &mdash; <q>social architecture</q>
lost; migrating ability
<li>ability to form new foci &mdash; this contains the concept of metastasis
&mdash; natural killer cells (NKs) in mammals try to defend against the
autodestructive process
<li>connected to the previous feature &rarr; the ability to evade immune
surveillance &mdash; why are cell not recognized as foreign?
</ol>
<h2>Infection &amp; Disease</h2>
<p>
Immunoglobulins normally pick off normal flora if they are somewhere where
they are <em>not</em> supposed to be.  An <i>E coli</i> bacterium with
polysialic acid molecules can mimic neonatal neuronal cell adhesion molecules
and this enabled its pathogenicity (see figure).

<p>
Exopolysaccharides form cell skeletons in many respects.   The following
are so:
<ul>
<li>Animals:  proteoglycans, mucopolysaccharides
<li>Plants:  cellulose
<li>Fungi:  mannan proteins
<li>Gram-positive bacteria:  peptidoglycans
<li>Gram-negative bacteria:  lipopolysaccharides
</ul>
<h2>N-Linked Glycoproteins</h2>
<p>
 <img class="float-right" width="65%"

   alt="schematic of LDL receptor">
Model LDL receptor (see figure at right) sits on the surface of all cells and
culls circulating LDL from the blood.  Defects in the receptor may be involved
in atherosclerosis. The receptor mechanism is classical signal transduction.
<p>
The oligosaccharide portion provides a great deal of structural diversity, its
mass not correlated to any known function.
<p>
<b>&alpha;<sub>1</sub> glycoproteins</b> have terminal sialic acid residues.
When these terminal residues are removed, the protein itself is quickly removed
(half-life in minutes) from circulation by the liver.

Certain antibiotics inhibit enzymes important in glycoprotein synthesis.
Dolichol diphosphate (Dol-PP) needs to be converted to the monophosphate
by a phosphatase that is inhibited by bacitracin.  Bacitracin also inhibits
the conversion of undecaprenyl diphosphate to the monophosphate.
<p>
Oligosaccharide processing involves movement of the coded glycoprotein synthesis
from rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, and the Golgi is compartmentalized
in cis, medial, and trans regions.  Movement or transport appeears to
receptor-mediated, on proteins which themselves are sialylated glycoproteins.
<p>
High-mannose sugars on proteins are diverted to the Golgi.  In the cis Golgi
sugars are phosphorylated and detectable by lysosomal receptors.

<p>
In the handout there are reactions 2 and 3 show the oligosaccharide transferase
(exoglycosidases), and these early pruning reactions show little substrate
specificity (they are <q>promiscuous</q> enzymes).  An enzyme isolated in
thyroid gland has an <i>endo</i> &alpha;1&rarr;2 mannosidase activity which
generates a Glc-Man disaccharide.  Processing enzymes before did not show
pruning of Glc and Man together.
<p>
<b>Vesicular Transport Apparatus</b>.  In the rough ER (RER) there is protein
synthesis and then glycosylation.  This is followed by <b>vesicularization</b>
where processing is by a mechanism of clathrin-type endocytosis.  The vesicle
fuses to cis Golgi, reforms, then fuses to medial Golgi, then reforms, then
proceeds to the trans Golgi.  Another vesicle emerges from the trans Golgi
to produce any number of mature organelles:  lysosome, secretory granule,
or an exocytic vesicle to the plasma membrane.
<p>
Electron micrographs show a <q>budding</q> in the Golgi cisternae and this is
both a <q>budding off</q> and a <q>vesicle fusion</q>.  Studies of envelope
virus infection such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) which exploit the use
of host cell membrane in their virions show that glycoproteins can be processed
in 15 min and in 30-40 min the virus is ready for budding from the membrane.

<p>
<b>Fusion</b>.  Page 5 of the handout shows what is involved in the lumen of
the vesicle.  The extracellular orientation of a glycoprotein in vesicle transport
actually is located within the lumen of a transport vesicle.  In fusion with
the surface there is formation of a <b>hexagonal tube</b> which cannot be
reproduced through in vitro studies (see figure).
<p>
It was Blobel and co-workers who found that glycoproteins fated to be on the
plasma membrane or to be secreted should have signal sequences within the
polypeptide.  These signal sequences are about 10-15 aa long and do their
signaling during synthesis (translation).  The figure below shows how
signal recognition peptides (SRPs) enable the nascent polypeptide to combine
with translocating proteins and docking protein that probably brings in a
peptidase that cleaves the signal peptide (see figure below).  Proteins to be
sialylated are also sialylated there.

<p>
In experiments to determine the vesicularization required, compounds are
(radio)labeled which are known to move from teh ER to the Golgi, or if not
known to move, they are known to be present.  As saccharides are added, the
vesicle density actually increases, and so these vesicles can be separated using
density methods.  Ehzyme activities associated with density-separated fractions
can be ascertained (see plot below).  Thus in the earliest (low density fractions)
phases, there are phosphate-transferring activities.  Later mannosidases are
used to remove high-mannose glycosylations.  Then in the final processing
are sialyltransferases and galactosyltransferases.

<p>
<b>Glycosylation events</b>.  UDP-glucose and GDP-mannose are activated nucleotides
required for building the oligosaccharide.  A question occurs as to how
additional glucosylations and mannosylations occur if the initial glycosylation
occurs lumenally.  The proposed mechanism is that a dolichol intermediate is
formed, and the dolichol glycoform is flipped cytoplasmically to lumenal side.
