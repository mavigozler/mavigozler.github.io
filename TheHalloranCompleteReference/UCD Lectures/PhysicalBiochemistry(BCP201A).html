<p>
The following biomolecular reaction:

<table class="nothing"  style="margin-left:5em;">
<tr><td>        <td class="center-text"><i>k</i><sub>1</sub> <td>
<tr><td style="padding-right:2em;">
        A  + B  <td style="line-height:0.5em;">
                    &mdash;&rarr;<br>&larr;&mdash; <td style="padding-left:2em;">C + D
<tr><td>        <td class="center-text"><i>k</i><sub>2</sub> <td>
</table>
<p>
with rate constants <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> (underscore to be interpreted as subscripting
the text that follows) and <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> can be described by the rate equations:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
&minus; <i>d</i>A/<i>d</i>t = <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>[A][B] <br>
&minus; <i>d</i>C/<i>d</i>t = <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[C][D] <br>
<p>
At equilibrium (or in a pseudo-equilibrium called a "steady-state"):
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
<i>d</i>A/<i>d</i>t = <i>d</i>C/<i>d</i>t
<p>
and so
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>[A][B] = <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>[C][D]
<p>
which is rearranged:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
<i>k</i><sub>1</sub> / <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> = [C][D] / [A][B]
<p>
The ratio <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>2</sub> is equal to a constant, <i>K</i>,
the equilibrium constant (also <i>K</i><sub>eq</sub>).  And so:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
        <i>K</i><sub>eq</sub>   = [C][D] / [A][B]
<p>
under these equilibrium conditions, which also depend upon the system pressure,
temperature, and ionic strength.
<p>
The *activity* of a molecular component is described by:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
       <i>a<sub>c</sub></i> = <i>&gamma;<sub>c</sub></i> (<i>c</i>)
<p>
where <i>a<sub>c</sub></i> is the activity of component <i>c</i>,
<i>&gamma;<sub>c</sub></i> is the activity coefficient of component <i>c</i>,
and (<i>c</i>) is the concentration of component <i>c</i>.
<p>
It is better to express rate and equilibrium equations in terms of theactivity
of components rather than concentrations:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">

        <i>K</i><sub>eq</sub>   = { &gamma;<sub>c</sub> [C] &gamma;<sub>d</sub> [D] } /
   { &gamma;<sub>a</sub> [A] &gamma;<sub>b</sub> [B] }
the Thomas equation

<p>
The Debye-H&uuml;ckel Law will show that the activity coefficient, &gamma;, depends
a great deal on the ionic strength, &mu;, of a solution:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
        log &gamma; = -A z<sup>2</sup>  &radic; &mu;
<p>
Note that <i>z</i> is the integral charge of the molecule and <i>A</i> is a constant
depending on the molecule (which can be determined experimentially by
plots of log &gamma; vs. [<i>z</i><sup>2</sup> &radic;&mu;], and take the negative
of the slope).
<p>
In an experiment done by Livingston in which the following reaction was
tried:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
      [ Co(NH<sub>3</sub>) Br ]<sup>2+</sup> + Hg<sup>2+</sup>  &rarr;
<p>
there was a noted <em>increase</em> in the rate of the reaction when salt was
added to <em>increase</em> the ionic strength of the solution.  This is an apparent
violation of the Debye-H&uuml;ckel law, which indicates that activity should
DECREASE, which follows that the *rate* should DECREASE instead of INCREASE.
<p>
The following explanation was developed to explain the observed phenomenon:
<p>
Suppose A and B are the reactants.  A reacts with B to form a transition-state
<em>activated complex</em> which is not really a product!
<table class="nothing"  style="margin-left:5em;">
<tr><td style="padding-right:2em;">
        A  + B  <td style="line-height:0.5em;">
                    &mdash;&rarr;<br>&larr;&mdash; <td style="padding-left:2em;">AB<sup>*</sup>
</table>
<p>
Note that AB<sup>*</sup>  is the activated AB-complex and that it is in
equilibrium with A and B.  Now AB<sup>*</sup> also in an unstable, highly
energetic, thermodynamic unstable molecule which is not at all dependent upon
(influenced by) such factors as solution ionic strength (or if it is, the
influence/dependence is not even measurable experimentally).  It breaks down to
form C and D, and its equilibrium with C and D (if any) is such that the
products are highly favored.
<table class="nothing"  style="margin-left:5em;">
<tr><td>  <td><i>k</i><sup>*</sup>
<tr><td style="padding-right:2em;">
        A  + B  <td style="line-height:0.5em;">
                    &mdash;&rarr;<td style="padding-left:2em;">C + D
</table>
<p>
The following rate and equilibrium equations apply to describing this system:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
   <i>K</i><sub>eq</sub><sup>*</sup>   =
  { <i>&gamma;<sub>AB</sub></i><sup>*</sup>  [AB<sup>*</sup>] } / {
       <i>&gamma;<sub>A</sub></i> [A] <i>&gamma;<sub>B</sub></i> [B] }
<p>
Since &minus;<i>d</i>A/<i>d</i>t = <i>d</i>C/<i>d</i>t:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
&minus;<i>d</i>A/<i>d</i>t =  <i>k</i><sup>*</sup>  <i>K</i><sub>eq</sub><sup>*</sup>
{ <i>&gamma;<sub>A</sub></i> (A) <i>&gamma;<sub>B</sub></i> (B) } /
           <i>&gamma;<sub>AB</sub></i><sup>*</sup>
<p>
Note in the <i>d</i>C/<i>d</i>t equation that there is no activity coefficient (!) since
ionic strength has no actual consequence on the reaction.
<p>
Since -<i>d</i>A/<i>d</i>t = <i>d</i>C/<i>d</i>t, we can rearrange
<i>K</i><sub>eq</sub><sup>*</sup> to express it in terms of (AB<sup>*</sup>)
and substitute that into the equation of <i>d</i>C/<i>d</i>t,
which is &minus;<i>d</i>A/<i>d</i>t:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
&minus;<i>d</i>A/<i>d</i>t = <i>d</i>C/<i>d</i>t =
<i>k</i><sup>*</sup>  <i>K</i><sub>eq</sub><sup>*</sup> {
&gamma;<sub>A</sub> [A] &gamma;<sub>B</sub> [B] }  /
&gamma;<sub>AB</sub>
<p>
The only factor that could change such that -d<i>A</i>/d<i>t</i> would increase
rather than decrease with an increase in ionic strength would be
&gamma;<sub>AB<sup>*</sup></sub>, which must decrease in value.
<p>
Suppose that from that equation, it is assumed that:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">

     <i>k</i> = <i>k</i><sub>0</sub> { &gamma;<sub>A</sub> &gamma;<sub>B</sub> /
            &gamma;<sub>AB</sub><sup>*</sup> }
<p>
<i>k</i><sub>0</sub> is a theoretical quantity for the rate constant when &mu; = 0
<p>
So it follows:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
    log <i>k</i> = log <i>k</i><sub>0</sub> + log &gamma;<sub>A</sub> +
		log &gamma;<sub>B</sub> - log &gamma;<sub>AB<sup>*</sup></sub>
<p>
This allows substitution of the Debye-H&uuml;ckel Law:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
    log <i>k</i> = log <i>k</i><sub>0</sub> &minus;
  A(z<sub>A</sub>)<sup>2</sup>&radic;&mu; &minus;
A(z<sub>B</sub>)<sup>2</sup>  &radic;&mu; + A z<sub>AB<sup>*</sup></sub>&radic;&mu;
<p>
The effective charge of <i>z</i><sub>AB*</sub> is really the sum:
<i>z</i><sub>AB*</sub> = <i>z</i><sub>A</sub>  + <i>z</i><sub>B</sub>
<p>
Hence
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
<i>z</i><sub>AB*</sub><sup>2</sup> = (<i>z</i><sub>A</sub>  +
<i>z</i><sub>B</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = <i>z</i><sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup>  +
2 <i>z</i><sub>A</sub> <i>z</i><sub>B</sub>  + <i>z</i><sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup>
<p>
When this is incorporated into the equation and the equation simplified:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
      log <i>k</i> = log <i>k</i><sub>0</sub> +
2A<i>z</i><sub>A</sub><i>z</i><sub>B</sub>&radic;&mu;
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
[ At <i>T</i> = 298 K in a water solvent, it can be shown that A = 0.509.]
<p>
This equation clearly shows that as ionic strength (MU) increases, so
does the rate constant of product formation!  It also demonstrates the most
important concept of <em>catalysis</em>:  the formation of activated complexes
for the purpose of increase the rate of formation of products.
<p>
Hence, the chemical equation:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
        A + B &rarr; AB*  &rarr; C + D
<p>
which is really an expression of how the catalytic state works, can be
altered:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
        E + S &rarr; ES  &rarr;  E + P
<p>
in which E is an enzyme that remains unaltered by the process, S is the
substrate converted to P, the product.  The all-important activated
complex is ES, the substrate-enzyme complex.
<p>

In truth, one can draw an Energy vs. Reaction-Coordinate system to indicate
that there are really two activated complex in the E-S-P system.

Entropy is a measure of the randomness (and conversely, orderliness) of a system
of particles.  Suppose that W is the number of ways of arranging particles among
a fixed number of discrete energy levels, and that the state of the system
depends on its temperature:
<pre>

       T1            T2           T3           T4           T5
</pre>
<p>Note in the example above that the system contains 3 energy levels with varying
numbers of potential places in which to hold a particle with a certain energy
(these are *degenerate* levels of energy where energy equivalence exists, hence
E3 (lowest energy) has a degeneracy of 5, E2 has 4, E1 has 2.  The temperature
values T1 to T5 represent successive increases in temperature.
<p>
As temperature increases (by adding energy to the system from the universe),
particles can rise to the next energy level to occupy available positions within
that level.  At T2, one particle can occupy its position in E2 as well as 3
others, or return to ground state (E3) to occupy a position there.  Hence the
number of ways of arranging particles among available positions has increased,
and therefore entropy has increased.
<p>
The number of ways (W) can be calculated something like this:
<p>
At T1 (temperature is actually an expression of the state of a system at a
particular energy level), the number of particles occupy all available positions
to which they are permitted, and so there is only 1 combination (a combination
is <sub>n</sub>C<sub>r</sub> and is equal to
<i>n</i>!/<i>r</i>!(<i>n</i>-<i>r</i>)!, where <i>n</i> is the number of
available positions, and <i>r</i> is the number of items available to arrange):

<pre>
   T1:  n = 5, r = 5 &rarr;  5!/5!(5-5)! = 1  (note that 0! = 1)
</pre>
 <p>At T2, 4 particles can be arranged in 5 positions with degenerate
 energies E3, while 1 particle can be arranged among 4 positions at E2
as well as the available position at E3.
<pre>
   T2: for E3, n = 5, r = 4 &rarr; 5!/4!(5-4)! = 5
       for E2, n = 4, r = 1 &rarr; 4!/1!(4-1)! = 4
</pre>
<p>and the particle at E2 can assume ground state to occupy that position
so add 1.
<pre>
   T3: for E1, n = 2, r = 1 &rarr; 2!/1!(2-1)! = 2
       for E2, n = 4, r = 1 &rarr; 4 as for T2
       for E3, n = 5, r = 3 &rarr; 5!/3!(5-3)! = 10
</pre>
<p>and the particle at E2 can occupy 2 positions in E3, so add 2, and the
particle at E1 can occupy 3 positions in E2, and 2 positions in E1.
<p>
With T5, with a number of particles in higher energy levels available to
occupy degenerate and lower energy levels in many more combinations (ways),
the entropy is now much greater.
<p>
It can be shown that entropy S increases logarithmically with the number
of ways W of arranging a system.
<pre>
      S = k ln W
</pre>
<p>
Entropy S is expressed in Joules / K * mol.  The constant 'k' is
the Boltzmann constant.
<p>
The energy of a system is "partitioned" or made up of several components
(can be energy of a molecule too):
<table class="nothing typewriter">
<tr><td style="padding-right:3em;width:30em;">
Electronic level changes  (shell <i>n</i>=1 &rarr; <i>n</i>=2) <td>~400 kJ / mol
<tr><td>Vibrational                                     <td>~10 kJ / mol
<tr><td>Rotation                                        <td>0.5 kJ / mol
<tr><td>Translational                                   <td>10-100 J / mol
</table>
<p>
As for entropy, the values are reversed.
<table class="nothing">
<tr><td rowspan="5" style="padding-right:3em;vertical-align:top;">
   Example:  propane @ 231 K<td style="padding-right:3em;">Translational<td> 150.8 J / K * mol
<tr><td>Rotational  <td>97.8
<tr><td>Vibrational <td>4.4
<tr><td>Electronic  <td>   0
<tr><td style="background:none;"><td> 253 J / K mol total entropy
</table>
<p>
Note that in proteins, vibrational energies can be quite high since
the total energy of the component is proportional to the number of bonds,
and for proteins the number of bonds is indeed high.
<p>
Resonance (which is an electronic effect) contributes little to the
total entropy.
<p>
Phase (solid, liquid, gas) is actually an expression the translational
component and figures a great deal in the calculation of <i>S</i>.  The change
in entropy of water going to the gas phase is:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
     &Delta;<i>S</i><sub>vap</sub>   (H<sub>2</sub>O, g) = 108.8 J / (K mol)
<p>
From the principles of statistical mechanics, it is possible to derive
the term for absolute translational entropy:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
<i>S</i>&deg;<sub>trans</sub> = R ln [ (2&pi;<i>mkT / h</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>3/2</sup>
(<i>Ve</i><sup>5/2</sup> / <i>N</i>) ]
<p>
Note in particular the dependencies of <i>S</i>&deg;<sub>trans</sub>.
<p>
An increase in the volume of the system increases entropy, which would
be expected to increase the number of ways of arranging the system.
<p>
An increase in the count of molecules (N) would decrease the entropy.
<p>
Entropy also depends on the mass, as well.  The dependency is such that:
<p>
<i>S</i>&deg;<sub>trans</sub> = f(<i>R</i> ln <i>M</i><sup>3/2</sup>) =
f(3<i>R</i>/2 ln <i>M</i>)
<p>
The effect of molecular number vs. mass however is:  when molecular number is
doubled, the effect is greater entropy than when you double the mass:
<p style="margin-left:5em;">
       (3/2) <i>R</i> ln <i>M</i> + (3/2) <i>R</i> ln M  &gt;
(3/2) <i>R</i> ln 2*<i>M</i>
<p>
Consistent relationships have been found with respect to entropy of series of
molecules belonging to a class:
<table class="nothing">
<tr><td><i>S</i> = 75.3 + 24.3<i>n</i>    <td>for solid hydrocarbon where <i>n</i> = # of
  carbons  (thus, longer molecules have more <i>S</i> than smaller)
<tr><td><i>S</i> = 104.6 + 32.2<i>n</i>   <td>for liquid-phase hydrocarbons @ 298 K with
         <i>n</i> carbons
<tr><td><i>S</i> = 142.3 + 41.8<i>n</i>   <td>for gas-phase HC @ 298 K with <i>n</i> carbons
</table>
<p>
Note that based on these, the following is true:
<table style="border-top:2px solid black;border-bottom:2px solid black;margin:2em 0 2em 5em;">

<p>
Ions placed into solution experience a decrease (negative) in entropy, in
which size and charge (magnitude and polarity) play a large part. Note that
anions tend to be more solvated than cations.

is the effective radius, which is the sumb of the crystal radius + 1 &Aring;

<p>This entropy effect is important in enzyme biochemistry.  An enzyme might
bond in three places to a substrate.  There is a &Delta;<i>H</i> for each
of these bonds, but &Delta;<i>G</i> do little (?).

&Delta;<i>S</i> &gt;&gt; 0, so &Delta;<i>G</i> &lt;&lt; 0 and the reaction is
favorable.  The reason is because water hydrates both enzyme and substrate,
and less water hydrates when substrate and enzyme are combined (ES).  This
creates the reduction in entropy.  And so water drives the reaction.
<p>
Enzyme inhibitors (such as trypsin with soybean inhibitor) also increase
entropy when bound:  &Delta;<i>S</i> = +60-80 J/(K mol).  One exception

Why does ATP store a great deal of energy?   What is the barrier to hydrolysis and
how is the energy released?
<p>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/ATPHydrolysis.png"
  alt="reaction plot of ATP hydrolysis vs acid chloride hydrolysis"
  class="img-right" style="width:500px;">
Consider that acid chlorides placed in water will instantly hydrolyze and 
form the weaker acid.  In the figure at right, an energy vs. reaction coordinate
curve is shown comparing the changes in energy between acid chlorides and 
acid phosphates like ATP:
<p>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/ATPHydrolysisBarrier.png"
  alt="structure of phosphate esters and the barrier to hydrolysis"
  class="orig-size" style="float:left;width:450px;margin-right:2em;margin-left:-2em;">
What accounts for the high energy to proceed through the transition
for hydrolysis of ATP?  In the figure at left, it is because of the geometry
of the phosphate molecule compared to the acid chloride.  The ability of
H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to penetrate toward the molecular center where the
slightly positively charged phosphate atom is located is more difficult.
<p>
This penetration for hydrolysis (or any nucleophilic substitution reactions
including biosynthetic reactions) is made easier by certain divalent ions
such as Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which are of optimial size to
distort serial phosphate (di- or triphosphates) and enable nucleophilic 
substitutions.
<p>
Thus the energy transition is accounted for.  What about the large release of
energy from ATP?
<p>
There are generally two theories explained:
<ol>
<li>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/ATPEnergyRelease1.png"
  alt="high energy in phosphate esters due to electrostatic repulsion of negative charges in atoms"
  style="float:right;width:250px;margin-left:2em;margin-right:-2em;">
Negative charges on the oxygen atoms between the phosphates cause
an electrostatic repulsion.  This is illustrated in the figure at right.
<li style="clear:both;">
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/ATPEnergyRelease2.png"
  alt="resonance-based electrostatic replusion"
  style="float:right;width:250px;margin-left:2em;margin-right:-2em;">
Another theory is that bond resonance creates a localized positive charge
in the interphosphate oxygen atom which is near to a phosphate atom with similar
localized positive charge, and this repulsion has considerable energy.
This is depicted in the figure at right.

With the production of two H<sup>+</sup> ions, one might expect a large decrease 
in entropy, keeping in mind that water will aggregate around small cations. From 
the tables above, it is clear that &Delta;<i>H</i> values are larger for ATP 
than ADP or PP<sub>i</sub> because electrostatic repulsions are greater and 
cumulative when phosphate esters are linked.
<p>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/ATP-Rgroup.png"
  alt="resonance-based electrostatic replusion"
  style="float:right;width:300px;margin-left:2em;">
Suppose an R group is bound to a phosphate oxygen in a way to neutralize its 
negative charge by being a cation or is covalently bonded as an ester. The 
figure are right shows that the effect of the R group is to decrease the 
electrostatic repulsion between oxygen atoms on the phosphorous atoms 
(interaction A), or to create a greater repulsion between P and O atom directly 
bonded to each other as shown in interaction B.  It should be clear that 
interaction B would contribute more to the release of energy (see the tables
for &Delta;<i>H</i> and &Delta;<i>S</i> above).
<p>
Consider the following table:

<p>
At the higher pH, a proton can be released into the solvent, resulting in a 
clear decrease in entropy as expected.  However, there is very little free
energy change, since the proton release is also more exothermic, with a higher
enthalpy.
<p>
Consider the table below of basic organic compounds partitioning between 
an organic phase of benzene versus the aqueous phase (water solvent).

The reactions all have &Delta;<i>H</i>, which that H<sub>2</sub>O is frozen out 
(energy or heat is lost).  &Delta;<i>S</i>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;0 because of this 
tremendous freezing process.  Thus saturated hydrocarbons will not distribute 
between the phases.
<p class="eqnserif">
CH<sub>4</sub> [hexane] &rarr; CH<sub>4</sub> [H<sub>2</sub>O]
<p>
The change in specific volume &Delta;<i>V</i> = &minus;22.7 ml/mole.  This is
rather unusual, since the freezing of the water phase (liquid to solid phase) 
involves a &Delta;<i>V</i> &gt; 0.   The presence of an organic phase such as 
hexane can cause this change however.
<p>
Consider the two reactions below, in which <i>n</i>-butane transitions to the
gas phase either from its own liquid phase or in which it is dissolved in 
aqueous phase:
<table class="th-center">
<tr><th>Reaction       <th>&Delta;<i>H</i>
<tr><i>n</i>-<td>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> [H<sub>2</sub>] &rarr; 
   <i>n</i>-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> [g]

   <i>n</i>-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> [g] 
   <td>+20.1
</table>
<p>
A greater amount of heat is required to get n-butane out of water into the gas
phase.  While clearly butane is hydrophobic and might want to separate itself from
water molecules as opposed to itself, it is a fact that the liquid water aggregates
in a manner that traps the dissolved butane molecules.

<b>The Hydrogen Bond in Water</b>.  The hydrogen bond is effectively a force
between to oppositely charged centers:  nonbonding electron pairs in O and N atoms
usually, and a hydrogen proton nucleus.  The hydrogen bond between water molecules is
depicted in the figure at the right.  The charge separation has a voltage that
can be approximated in electron volts as:
<p class="eqnserif">
<i>V</i> = 9.92 / <i>Dr</i>
<p>
where <i>r</i> is the separation distance (in nanometers?) and <i>D</i> is the
dielectric constant of the medium.  In the data above, water is present as 
a phase with another phase.  It is instructive to examine how water molecules
behave in the presence of another phase, and how intermolecular interactions
occur at the interface of the two phases (see the figure below).
<p>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/water-oil-interface.png"
  alt="water molecules at an oil interface">
<p>
With an organic phase, the dielectric constant will be lower than that of the
aqueous phase.  This means that the lines of electrical force have a greater
strength (magnitude) in regions in which the dielectric constant is lower.
<p>
Consider the thermodynamic changes that occur when hydrophobic moieties which
are separated (perhaps by an aqueous phase) undergo nonpolar bonding in affinity
with each other.  The bonding is illustrated below.
<p>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/NonpolarBonding.png"
  alt="bonding between nonpolar moieties">
When this occurs in aqueuous phase, &Delta;<i>H</i> &gt; 0, with a disruption of
water molecules.  &Delta;<i>S</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, indicating that the randomness of the
system has increased overall.  Because this reaction is expected to be favorable,
it is expected that &Delta;<i>G</i> &lt; 0.
<div class="eqnserif">

<p>
<i>d</i> &Delta;<i>G</i>/<i>dT</i> &lt; 0  when &Delta;<i>H</i> &gt; 0

This thermodynamic relationship indicated that when temperature is increased,
it is expected that proteins held together by hydrophobic bonding would be more 
stable in aqueous solution.
<p>
<b>Transition states</b>.   Electronic transitions within molecular (not atomic)
orbitals are of critical importance.  In particular are transitions from bonding
or nonbonding molecular orbitals to orbitals that de-stabilize bonding (antibonding)
orbitals.  These transitions within molecules are affected by the environment of 
the molecule.
<p>
<b>&pi; &rarr; &pi;<sup>*</sup></b>.  With pi molecular bonding, the molecule
placed in a dielectric of a higher value (say from organic to aqueous), it will
be the case the longer wavelengths of light will be fluorescent or they will be
absorbed.  Any light whose electric field component is parallel to the orietation
of the pi conjuated bond will be absorbed, meaning parallel polarization is required.

wavelengths of light, of course.  It is the ground state rather than the excited
state energy levels that differ between low and high dielectric medium, as shown
at the right.  Thus shorter wavelengths (higher energy) photons are needed for
transition in higher dielectric medium.

<b>lone pair &rarr; &pi;<sup>*</sup></b>.  A lone pair is a specialized electron

at right.  Lone pairs hold a nonbonding status.  Lone pairs can resonate and appear
on another atom.  A different kind of lone pair is a non-resonating lone pair, 
such as the nonbonding pair on pyridine:  its lone pair cannot resonate to another
atom.
<p class="center">

The absorption of light at 340 nm in nicotinamide results in a transition of
an electron from a lone pair orbital into a &pi;* antibonding molecular orbital.
When the molecule containing nicotinamide is oxidized, this transition does not
occur.
<p>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/AbsorbanceSpectrumPiBonding.png"
  style="width:50%;float:right;"
  alt="absorbance spectrum ">
The absorption spectra can change significantly depending on whether a molecule
has bonds that improve conjugation of pi bonding.  In the figure at right,
the absorption maximum shift to a shorter wavelength with increased conjugation.
Conjugated pi bonding stabilizes a molecule, thus requiring more energy
(shorter wavelength light) to induce bond breaking (transitions from to an
antibonding orbital).  Nonbonding electrons can more easily (lower energy, 
longer wavelength) make a transition to antibonding orbitals and would thus be
less stable.
<p>
<b>Dissipation of Energy for Molecules In Excited State</b>.  Molecules that
get excited by various means (absorption of radiative/thermal energy, collisions)
need to dissipate energy.  The table below shows the various processes by which
that happens.

<table>
<tr><th>Process    <th>Description
<tr><td>Internal Conversion
 <td>Energy in electronic levels is transferred to the vibrational and 
   rotational levels of the molecule itself, which are seen as heat
<tr><td>External Conversion
  <td>Energy in the electronic levels is distributed instead to the vibrational
  and rotational levels of the solvent molecules
<tr><td>Predissociation
  <td>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/predissociation.png"
  style="float:right;margin-left:1em;width:200px;"
  alt="energy dissipation by predissociation">
Energy is such that the bond length goes beyond the breaking point, with bond 
breakdown.  The figure at right shows the bond breaking point at the dashed 
line.  This state is of little value in biochemistry
<tr><td>Photodissociation
  <td>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/photodissociation.png"
  style="float:right;margin-left:1em;width:200px;"
  alt="energy dissipation by photodissociation">
This process is common in the photo-induced dissociation of the iodine molecule 
(I<sub>2</sub>), or particularly in carbon-iodine (C-I) bonds.  In this case,
bonding electron is excited to another electronic level in which the state 
allows infinit bond length to occur.  This has the effect of bond breaking.
<tr><td>Fluorescence
  <td>
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/fluorescence.png"
  style="float:right;margin-left:1em;width:250px;"
  alt="energy dissipation by fluorescence">
In fluorescence, excitation occurs to another electronic level and then decays
to the energy well (energy minimum) of that level.  From that excited electronic
level, it emits a photon to the ground state energy level well (fluorescence).
The decay time is approximately on the order of 1 to 10 nanoseconds.

<h1>Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)</h1>
<p>
SPR is an optical effect in which an ultrathin (50 nm) surface of a metal like
gold, silver, or copper serves as an interface between media with different
refractive indices, which in practice is a prism on one side and a compartment
with an aqueous buffer.

<div class="img-left-caption" style="width:70%;">
<img src="imagesPhysicalBiochemistryHTML/surface-plasmon-resonance.png"
  alt="principle of surface plasmono resonance (SPR)">
Principle of surface plasmon resonance. A light source emits monochromatic
light that traverses a prism at a certain angle &theta; and is totally 
internally reflected at the interface of two media. A thin metal layer is at 
the boundary between the prism and a medium of lower refractive index (e.g. 
aqueous buffer). Interaction of the evanescent electric field and the electron 
constellations of the metal causes a reduction in the reflected light intensity 
(RI). This is illustrated as a gray shadow in the reflected light beam and as a 
decrease of RI in the graph RI versus &theta;. Changes in the dielectric 
properties in the vicinity of the metal surface change the resonance conditions 
and lead to a shift of &theta; (I→II). <small>(from Ganten and Ruckpaul, eds.
