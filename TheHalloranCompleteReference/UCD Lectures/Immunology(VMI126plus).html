Grading in course is by three examinations, two midterms and one final.
<p>
<b>Immunoglobulins</b> are agents against infective bodies (antigens). These 
agents are usually proteinaceous and present in blood. <b>Lymphocytes</b> 
represent the tissue of importance in immunology.

<p>
The <b>B lymphocyte</b> is the cell in this tissue that confers <i>humoral
immunity</i> when it assumes a mature form known as the <b>plasma cell</b>.
The differentation of this lymphocyte is determined by special immunostaining
techniques and by biochemical tests.  Typical cytological features of the
plasma cell are:

<ul>
<li>extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum
<li>an eccentric nucleus taking up half the cell area
<li>basophilic cytoplasm (due to abundant RNA)
<li>loss of proliferative capacity (unable to undergo mitosis/cell division)
</ul>

<p>
In the figure below is the typical protein profile of serum proteins separated 
by electrophoresis in a buffer such as pH 8.6 veronal. The gamma globulin 
fraction becomes a significant amount of the protein when the individual from 
whom the serum was taken is hyperimmunized. Within the gamma globulin fraction 
is great heterogeneity.

<h2>Ig Structure</h2>
<p>
The central element in immunology is the <b>immunoglobulin</b>.  Several 
experiments were done to examine its structure.  In 1959 Porter et al. treated 
the Ig with the plant protease <b>papain</b> and then examined the product by 
ion-exchange chromatographic separation.  They found three fragments.  Two 
fragments were named <b>F<sub>AB</sub></b> (for <i>fragment antigen-binding</i>) 
and both had a mass of about 45 kDa.  The bound the antigen monovalently.  The 
other fragment <b>F<sub>C</sub></b> (for <i>fragment crystallizable</i>) had a 
mass of about 50 kDa and was very homogeneous.  It bound no antigen in vivo, but 
did serve a useful purpose.
<p>
The protease <b>pepsin</b> also selectively cleaves the Ig molecule. Its 
products are 100 kDa fragment denoted <b>F&prime;<sub>AB</sub></b> (2) and is 
bivalent in binding antigen.  The <b>F<sub>C</sub></b> fragment found with 
papain digestion is not present at all with pepsin, but is totally lost 
(apparently being thoroughly digested).
<p>
Other interesting findings occur when reducing agents are used to disrupt 
disulfide bond formation.  The following findings are made:

<ul>
<li>Treatment of Ig molecule with reducing agents produces two fragments, one 
with a mass of about 50 kDa and the other about half the mass at 25 kDa.
<li>For the products of papain-digested Ig, reduction of F<sub>AB</sub> fragment 
produces two fragments, one about 25 and the other 20 kDa.  Treatment of 
F<sub>C</sub> produces one fragment about 25 kDa.  This suggests that dimeric 
units make up these fragments.
<li>For the pepsin digest product F&prime;<sub>AB</sub> (2), two fragments are 
produced, one slightly larger than the other, and both larger than the 
corresponding fragments produced from reduced F<sub>AB</sub> fragment from 
papain-digested Ig.
</ul>
<p>
From these analyses, it was determined that Ig is composed of two heavy chains 
and two light chains, with the heavy chains bound to each other by a disulfide 
bond and each light chain bound to its heavy chain by a pair of disulfide bonds.
<p>
Light chains come in two classes, which are based up differences in amino acid 
sequences in the (relatively) C (constant) region.  These classes are &kappa; 
and &lambda;.  In each Ig, there is only one class or type of light chain, not a 
mix;  thus an Ig molecule will not have one light chain &kappa; and the other 
&lambda;.  The same is also true for the heavy chain classes.  This is because a 
single Ig-producing cell makes a single type of immunoglobulin, not a mix of 
them, when it matures.  60% of all human Igs have &kappa; light chains, and 40% 
have &lambda;.  In mice, &ge; 90% of all Igs have &kappa; as light chains.  In 
the horse, most light chains are of the &lambda; type.

<p>
<b>Multiple myeloma</b> is a condition in which plasma cells proliferate 
uncontrolled (neoplastic plasma cell tumors).  Plasma cells normally are not 
proliferative.  Multiple myeloma is usually detected by serum electrophoresis in 
which multiple sharp bands appear in many parts of the gel.  Not just in the 
gamma globulin fraction, but even in the beta and alpha globulin fractions.
<p>
<b>Bence-Jones proteins</b> are seen when plasma cells become 
<i>myelomatous</i>.  These proteins are in fact light chains that become 
overabundant in the blood.  The typical reaction of the body is to eliminate 
these proteins in the urine.  The light chains dimerize with one another to form 
the Bence-Jones proteins.  Edelman recovered these proteins from urine and 
boiled them to denature the dimers. He then sequenced them.  In some regions or 
<b>domains</b> of the light chain (kappa type), he found a <i>variable light 
chain domain</i> (V<sub>L</sub>) and a <i>constant light chain domain</i> 
(C<sub>L</sub>) shown in the figure below.

<p>
	<img src="imagesImmunologyHTML/IgG1Structure.png"
	class="float-right"
	alt="IgG1 structure">
Some regions of the light chain were found to be hypervariable.  These 
hypervariable regions actually give the antibody its specificity to the antigen. 
The hypervariable region of the heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) comprise up to 
one-fourth to one-third of the total length of the chain.
<p>
Immunoglobulin G structures are divided into <i>subclasses</i>. IgG subclass 1 
(denoted IgG<sub>1</sub>) is distinguished by having constant domains with 
intrachain disulfide bonding.  IgG<sub>1</sub> has <i>two</i> disulfide bonds in 
the constant domain.  IgG<sub>2</sub> has <i>four</i> disulfide bonds. 
IgG<sub>3</sub> has multiple disulfide bonds, and IgG<sub>4</sub> has fewer than 
IgG<sub>3</sub> but more than IgG<sub>2</sub>.  They vary in their ability to 
cross the placenta, fix complement, bind to monocytes and mast cells, and to 
<i>Staph</i> protein A.
<p>
<b>Hybridomas</b> are a fusion of myeloma tumor cells and normal lymphocytes. 
Fusion can be achieved by incubating cells in the presence of polyethylene 
glycol (PEG) or sendai virus.  This produces a fused cell with a heterokaryon, 
but eventually the nuclei fuse and a cell that proliferates and secretes humoral 
antibody is produced. The mix of cells can be placed in a medium deficient in 
nutrients required by unfused myeloma cells, so as to starve them and keep them 
from competing for proliferative capacity.  Normal lymphocytes cannot 
proliferate at all.  But the hybridomas proliferate because they can overcome 
the nutrient deficiencies of the medium which they obtained from the lymphocyte 
genome, and they retain mitotic ability from the genome of the myeloma cell 
line.
<p>
Some definitions:
<dl>
<dt>isotypic determinants
 <dd>Ig classes such as IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD
<dt>allotypic determinants
 <dd>subclasses of Ig isotypes with no change in valence or ligand binding;
 these have minor but not functional variations in amino acid sequences
<dt>idiotypic determinants
 <dd>idiotypic means &lsquo;peculiar to the individual&rsquo;;
one antibody from one person against ovalbumin is not the same as another
person's anti-ovalbumin
</dl>
<p>
<b>Allotypes</b> show amino acid variation in the constant region of the heavy 
chain, while <b>idiotypes</b> shows variation the constant region of the light 
chain.

<p>
Evidence for the structure of immunoglobulin molecules thus comes from

<ol>
<li>use of enzymes and chemicals to degrade the structure and analyze
its degradation products
<li>study of tissue cell cultures of abnormal phenotypes of the cells
that produce immunoglobulins
</ol>
<p>
Bence-Jones proteins are L chains of the Ig that produced two different types
of L chains: &kappa; and &lambda;.  Only one type occurs in any one Ig however.
The occurrence of these L chain types varies among species (see table)

<table>
<caption>Frequency of L chain types among species</caption>
<tr><th>Species <th>&kappa;<th>&lambda;
<tr><td>Human   <td>60%    <td>40%
<tr><td>Murine  <td>&ge;90%<td>&le;10%
<tr><td>Equine  <td>less   <td>mostly
</table>
<p>
L chains have C<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domains.  Variable regions also
have <em>hypervariable</em> regions.  The V<sub>L</sub> domain makes up 25-33%
of the sequence length.
<p>
In one experiment with IgGs, antigens were labeled with diDNPs
(two dinitrophenols) and them mixed with their anti-antigen immunoglobulins.
Electron microscopy revealed the following structures:
<img src="imagesImmunologyHTML/Em-Ig-shapes.png"
 class="float-left"
 alt="two particular shapes of Ig molecules binding to form a complex as seen under EM">
<p>
Again, at phenotypic maturity, a plasma cell will make only a single
idiotypic Ig, thus the paired heavy and light chains making up an
Ig are molecularly identical.

<h3>IgG</h3>
<p>
85% of immunoglobulins produced are IgG immunoglobulins.  The proteins sediments
at ~7S, has a MW of 150 kDa.  The studies with papain and pepsin digestion, and
with anti-rabbit F<sub>C</sub> and F<sub>AB</sub> and goat IgG provide the
information about its structure. Precipitation reaxns with rabbit heavy and
light chains show that the heavy chain is present in the F<sub>C</sub> and
F<sub>AB</sub> portion, and that light chains are present only in the
F<sub>AB</sub> portion.
<p>
IgG shows for subclasses with different &ldquo;hinge lengths.&rdquo; There are 4
domains on the heavy (H) chain, and 2 domans on the L chain.  The H chain has a
constant domain designated as &gamma;, and the L chain has either a &kappa; or
&lambda; constant domain.

<h3>IgM</h3>
<p>
Studies show that this immunoglobulin sediments about 19S, and the MW ranges
from 750 to 900 kDa.  IgM can feature a <b>J chain</b> with mass of about 15
kDa, which appears to join a pentameric set of light and heavy chain
associations.  The H chain of IgM features 5 domains, and the L chain 2 domains.
The H chain has a constant domain designated &mu; while the L chain can be
&kappa; or &lambda; in its constant domain.
<p> IgM is good at fixing complement and agglutination.  The antigen has to be
relatively small because the pentameric IgM structure does not allow for it to
bind to bigger substrates if agglutination is to take place.

<h3>IgA</h3>
<p>
There are two classes of IgA, based on the composition of the heavy chain.
Class I has a &alpha;<sub>1</sub> heavy chain and makes up 80% of IgA in serum,
while class II has a &alpha;<sub>2</sub> heavy chain and makes up 20% of IgA. In
serum, IgA occurs as a monomer of the standard two heavy and light chains.  But
in exosecretory fluid (saliva, sweat, mucus), IgA is dimerized by a glycoprotein
called the <b>J chain</b>.

<h3>IgD</h3>
<p>
Formation of this antibody appears to be related to a histopathological
condition.  It is seen with rare myelomas.  The heavy (H) chain has five domains
(&delta; domains).  The light chain is mostly the &lambda; form.  These
antibodies sit on the B lymphocyte surface.
<h3>IgE</h3>
<p>This antibody is called <q>reagin</q>.  The H (heavy) chain is of type
&epsilon;, and the L (light) chain can be either &kappa; or &lambda;.
<p>
The F<sub>C</sub> portion of IgE binds to receptors present on mast cells.
Mast cells are mature eosinophils, with many granules containing powerful
chemicals, especially histamine.  Histamine causes smooth muscle relaxation,
particularly those around arterioles.  This allows blood flow to flood
a tissue in which the chemical is present, making the tissue appear red.
It is this redness that is seen in allergic reactions, which are caused by
IgE biology.

<p>
The <b>J chain</b> is small peptide associated with IgM and IgA, allowing multimer
formation.  IgA exists in mono- and dimeric forms in serum, but when secreted it
exists only as a dimer.  It might enhance its effectiveness in this way.
<p>
The <b>secretory component</b> is an epithelial cell-produced peptide which
combined with dimeric IgA and might enhance its
<ol>
<li>solubilization in mucus
<li>protection against enzymatic digestion by intestinal proteases
</ol>
<p>
It then becomes designated <b>sIgA</b>.
<p>
Two subclasses of IgA exist.  One has an interchain -S-S- between H and L, and
another has an -S-S- between the two L chains.  One subclass is sensitive to
an <b>IgA protease</b> secreted by certain virulent and pathogenic bacteria.
Both subclasses have secreted forms, with the more resistant subclass being secreted
in larger quantities.
<p>
IgM is usually a pentamer in most <q>higher</q> animals, but is a monomer in the
supposedly more primitive.  It is not permeable to blood vessel linings or
tissues.  The H chain (&mu;) has four C<sub>H</sub> and one V<sub>H</sub> domains.
It is typically reactive with flagella.  It is excellent at agglutination
(binding cells together).
<p>
<b>Functions of Ig</b>.  Several reactions are predominant functions of immunoglobulins:
<ol>
<li>Opsonization.  A fundamental role of IgG, which is to bring phagocytic cells
in proximity to Ags or the things attached to them
<li>Complement fixation or Activation.  This can be accomplished only by IgM
and IgG.
<li>Mast Cell Activation.  essentially a function of IgE, although a subclass
of IgG can do so in a lower animal
</ol>
<p>
Structural differences in the Ig chains are sequence variations, and the \
classification nomenclature is as follows:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li><b>isotypic</b> refers to differences in the &gamma;, &alpha;, &delta;,
&mu;, &kappa;, or &lambda; chains
<li><b>allotypic</b> refers to differences that occur between individuals.
Differences that occur between C<sub>H</sub> and C<sub>L</sub> domains in
individuals are allotypic
<li><b>idiotypic</b> refers to differences occurring in the variable region
to antibodies that bind the same epitope on an antigen
</ol>

<p>
An <b>immunogen</b> is effectively an antigen that elicits or stimulates Ig
production and the proliferation of T cell cloning lines.  It is distinguished
from a <b>hapten</b> (to grasp, to hold) which interacts or binds with Ig but
are incapable of eliciting this response.
<p>
The following conditions confer immunogenic properties:
<ol>
<li><b>operationally dependent</b>:  the nature of the Ag, its mode of
administration, whether given with adjuvant or not
<li><b>foreignness</b>:  the Ag should not exactly mimic current structures within
the organism and it must be a tissue not already <em>tolerated</em> by immune
system (some tissues are not tested against the immune system during tolerance)
<li><b>mass</b>:  generally the Ag must be of large size (&gt;10 kDa); smaller
size molecules can be immunogenic but often need to have a bizarre or exotic
chemical nature
<li><b>complexity</b>:  Ags should have a unique nature or complexity which
characterizes it.  Homopolymers (of say, an amino acid) are not sufficiently
immunogenic,  Evidence for properties essential for immunogenicity comes from studies with
artificially synhesized Ag.  Copolymers of two amino acids sometimes works.
Copolymers of 3 or more amino acids usually are immunogenic.  Use of aromatic
groups strongly confers immunogenic characteristics.  Often adding a tyrosine
(Tyr) residue will raise immunogenicity by 1000-fold.
<li><b>Genetic control</b> over immunogenicity is another factor:  while some strains
will respond to doses of BSA, 1 in 12 will be non-responders.  One guinea pig
strain (strain 2) responds significantly to the presence of histidine (His)
residues; strain 13 to the presence of tyrosine (Tyr) residues
</ol>
<p>
Substances that make good immunogens include:
<ol>
<li>polypeptides of nonrepetitive complexity
<li>polysaccharides of sufficient size and complexity, although the response is
subject to genetic control in various individuals and species
<li>unpurified nucleic acid, perhaps acting as haptens;  purified DNA and RNA are
not immunogenic
<li>lipids acting as haptens, generally combined with sugars and proteins; cardiolipin
is a good example of an Ag which causes this reaction
</ol>
<p>
<b>Carriers</b>.  By themselves they are immmunogenic.  However they are coupled
to haptens to enable them to be immunogenic.  B cells differentiate into plasma cells
which of course make the Ig.  B cell activation with hapten molecule alone
does not occur merely by surface contact.  T lymphocytes have a receptor that acts
with carrier somehow and the B cell does likewise.  They are a necessary signal
for B cells to produce Ig.  <b>Note</b>:  some polymeric repetitive molecules as
antigens can <q>turn on</q> B cells without T cell interaction.
<p>
<b>Hapten-Carrier Complex Formation</b>.  It was hypothesized that protein
carrier is diazotized to hapten.  <i>m</i>-Benzeneaminosulfonate is mixed as a
hapten with protein and Ig produced against it.  When a carboxyl or arsonate
group is substituted with the sulfonate, there is no reaction.  The <i>o</i>-
and <i>p</i>-isomers reacted, but very poorly.  Hence a <em>very rigid or strict
chemical regiospecificity</em> is clearly involved in the immune reaction.
Such stereochemical details cannot be excluded.  Electron clouds which surround
the molecules are very important.
<p style="float:left;">
<img src="imagesImmunologyHTML/Ligand-Binding-Lock-and-Key.png"
	style="width:75%;border:none;"
 alt="one key fits a lock, the other key does not">
<p>
Because ligand binding is noncovalent in Ab-Ag binding, ligands can attach and
detach itself according to equilibrium conditions.  When the fit is good in
lock-and-key theory, the binding is more stable.

<p>Antigenic determinants, of course, are parts (moieties) of one Ag.  The
properties of binding begin with chemistry.  Generally the hapten-carrier
complex is formed and the animal immunized.  Immunoglobulins against <em>both</em>
the hapten and the carrier are produced.  (When the hapten is dinitrophenol
namely DNP, it will be against DNP and its carrier.)
<p>
To make sure that the antibody is against hapten-carrier, and that Abs exist that
include the hapten, the hapten is bound to another carrier.

<p>
Antibodies specific for the amino benzene R group hapten were compared.  Again
the ability to combine (specificity) depends on chemical stereo isomerism.
For large molecules such as tartaric acid, the following reactivity is seen:

<p>
Penicillin is an excellent example of a molecule ingested which forms a RBC
complex  and produces Ig.  Consider three para-isomeric forms of aniline:
methyl, chloro, and nitro.  Antibodies against haptens at teh left would be
expected to cross-react as there is not too much difference in size or charge
density.  The <em>stability</em> of the Ag-Ig complex relies particularly on
binding character, the number of binding interactions and the type of binding.
<p>
While the issue of antigen size has been addressed, it is not so with the size
of the antigenic determinant (AD).  Dextran is a homopolymer of glucose with
&alpha;1&rarr;4 and &alpha;1&rarr;6 linkages, and produces Ig when the
mass &gt; 300 kDa.
<p>
When dextran combines with anti-dextran Ig, it forms a precipitate when
the amounts are considered:
<ul>
<li><ol><li> &alpha;-dextran (= anti-dextran)  + trisaccharide &rarr; mixture 1
  <li>mixture 1 + dextran &rarr; ppt. 1 </ol>
<li>dextran + &alpha;-dextran &rarr; ppt. 2
</ul>
<p>Measuring the difference between ppts 1 and 2 provides a measure of how
larger the antigenic determinant is.  At the point where a hexasaccharide is
used, there is no more precipitation.  Thus a hexasaccharide will not enable
further precipitation.  Additional studies show F<sub>AD</sub> binding to the
&alpha;1&rarr;6 linkages, proved by using strictly isomaltose and successive
&alpha;1&rarr;6 polymers.
<p>
With polypeptides, the size can be anything as it assumes various stereoforms.
The <b>valence</b> of large molecules is equivalent to the total number of ADs
in the molecule.  Repeating units do not constitute new ADs, as in the
polysaccharide.  <b>Accessibility</b> also determines the AD.  Poly-Ala on the
outside will not allow the formation of Ig against Tyr-Glue too readily,
as it is become inaccessible.
<p>
<img src="imagesImmunologyHTML/antigenic-determinants.png"
alt="accessibility of antigenic determinants">
<p>
<b>Immunodominance</b> is the effect when Ig against Tyr or other immunogroups
is overridden despite not being on the surface.  This is the only exception
to the need for surface accessibility.
<p>
AD are also determined by enzymatic analysis.  In one analysis glucagon was
bisected by trypsin.  The C-terminal of glucagon was found to stimulate Ig
production against N-terminal segment.  That is, the N-terminal is
haptenic and the C-terminal is immunogenic.  Thus some parts of the antigen are
haptenic and some are immunogenic.  This happens because of B and T cell
interaction.
<p>
Ag which are <b>thymus-independent</b> (T-independent) are those capable of
immunogenicity without T cell mediation.  These Igs are solely of the IgM class.
Igs will behave as Ags and it depends on whether they are of different iso- and
allotypes.

<h1>Valence and Affinity</h1>
<p>
If <i>S</i> and <i>L</i> bind to each other, then the affinity of <i>S</i>
for <i>L</i> is:
<p class="indent">
<i>K</i> = [S-L] / ( [S] [L] ) = <i>r</i> / {(<i>n &minus; r</i>) <i>c</i>}
<p>
where <i>n</i> = ligand count, <i>r</i> = Ig-Ag form.
<p>
This means that <i>r/c</i> = <i>K</i>(<i>n &minus; r</i>)
<p>
When half of the ligands adhere to Ig, then <i>r = n / 2</i>.  The term
<i>K</i><sub>0</sub> = 1 / <i>c</i> is the <b>average affinity</b>.
<p>
Sips Distribution Function:  log {<i>r</i> / (<i>n &minus; r</i>)} =
<i>a</i> log <i>K</i> + <i>a</i> log <i>c</i>, where <i>a</i> = index of
disperson of <i>K</i><sub>0</sub> values for heterogeneous Abs.
Differences in antibody affinity attributed to differences in the reverse
reaction of Ab binding, as the forward reaction is kinetically one of the
fastest.

<!-- ========= 4 October 1982 ============================================ -->
<p class="date">

<p>
Univalent Ags react with Igs usually to form soluble complexes and the
reaction rate is independent of temperature and electrolyte content.  No
precipitation would be evident so long as &rho;<sub>P</sub> &minus;
&rho;<sub>0</sub> &lt;&lt; 0.  This is the initial stage.
<p>
The final stage, where Ig with not that great a ligand specificity
(cross-reacting Ig) will form complexes which are temperature-, time-,
and electrolyte-dependent.  Thus the first stage is complex formation, and
the 2nd would include precipitation, agglutination, and complement fixation.
<p>
Ag-Ig reactions are reversible and the rate of the reverse reaction is a measure
of affinity.  Affinity is dependent upon pH, temperature, and electrolyte
concentration.  In addition the type of bonding (hydrophobic, ionic, etc)
is a factor in affinity.
<h1>Precipitation Reactions</h1>
<p>Antibodies bind with Ags such that a lattice structure is formed.  This
represents a <q>growing crystal</q> of Ig-Ag complexes.  At one point the mass
become insoluble and precipitates.  While the order of addition is not strictly
governed as in the mixing of BaCl<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
it does follow mass action laws.
<p>Sometimes the Ag is insoluble by itself and sediments alone.  Cells in solvent
are an example of a suspension that falls out of solution.  When insoluble Ag
reacts with Ig, it gives rise to an <b>agglutination</b>.  These are quite sensitive
reactions as it take little Ig to produce these large masses.  These are the
traditional <q>sticky clumps</q> which sediment faster and then form a loose
aggregate at the tube bottom.  When tube is agitated, it does not form a
<q>clear</q> suspension but instead visible clumps in the solvent.
<p>
Among Ig classes, IgM is the most suitable agglutinator with a molecular span
of 1000 &Aring; (100 nm).  IgG would have to stretch to 250 &Aring;, the
minimum repulsion test.  Serum albumin at pH 8.6 will reduce the zeta repulsive
force, causing IgG to be an ineffective agglutinator.  (The zeta force refers
to a combination of steric and electostatic repulsion.)  Albumin is amphophilic
and reduces this.
<p>
The <b>Coombs Direct Test</b> of agglutinating Ig is not an agglutination reaction
measuring IgG present.  However the titer of antibody is found to be the
dilution endpoint at which 50% binding occurs when agglutination is no longer
observed.  Different Ags cannot be compared with this test when assessing titers.
Indeed titers may differ between laboratories and technicians doing the test.
Also serum samples taken from different subjects or the same subject but at
different times will show different titers.  Titers are useful only in demonstrating
the progress of disease when Ag-Ig reactions are monitored for the same Ag.
<p>
<img src="imagesImmunologyHTML/coombs-direct-test.png" 
alt="diagram of Coombs' Direct Test of agglutinating Ig">
<p>
<b>Passive agglutination</b>.  Agglutination reactions are much more sensitive
than precipitations since it takes less antibody to see the reaction.  Ag can be
covalently (chemically) attached to and <q>inert</q> carrier such as a latex
particle or RBC.  Smaller amounts of Ig are now required.  This process is
thus passive agglutination.
<p>
Precipitation can be characterized by serially diluting Ag in the presence of
constant amounts of Ig.  A monospecific system profile is thus obtained.
When precipitate is formed, some soluble substances remain in the supernatant.
Ag can be added and these can be measured in another precipitation test.
Ab titer can be determined in the weight or mass units of protein (this
results in an <b>exact titer</b>).  In the region of Ag excess, the precipitate
does not occur.  Curves do not look symmetric namely because of differences in
valences.  Although the curve is used to determine Ig titer, it can also be used
to determine Ag titer.

In a multispecific system where more than one Ag exists, individual monospecific
systems are summed to produce the precipitation vs [Ag] curve.
<p>
Ag-Ig reactions beyond precipitation and agglutination include gel or agar
diffusion reactions.  In assessing this, the diffusion rate of molecules is

<b>Single Radial Immunodiffusion</b> (SRID).  This test can test the amounts of
Ag present.  Ag in known concentration is placed in wells, along with unknown
samples.  Agar overlay must be even and temperature constant (usually a 4&deg;
cold room).  After development a ring of precipitation is observed, and the
diameter of the ring (determined in the diffusion equation) will differ
proportionally with the serial decrease or increase in the concentration of
the known standard.  The unknown concentration is determined by check its
diameter on the plot of diameters versus the log of the concentration of
known standards.  In SRID, the antigen and not the [Ab] concentration is
varied.  The circular ring represents the equivalence zone.  Inside the ring
is Ag excess of soluble complexes, and outside the ring is Ab excess (in fact
the Ag has not mixed with Ab in some cases.

Generally properties of Ab and Ag placed in different wells for diffusion is
such that precipitation complexes [form] and where they will be found depends
upon (1) temperature and (2) molecular weight of the antigen, among other
things. In the figure is shown how double immunodiffusion forms precipitin
lines and how to determine whether two antigens are identical or not, nor
partially identical. In identity, all antibodies to the antigenic determinants
are the same. In nonidentity, antigens 1 and 2 must be distinct.

Curvatures of complex lines generally indicate differences in molecular weight
(MW).

In the figure below, two rows of wells are made.  In the bottom row, antibody
is placed with no change in concentration between well.  However, in the top
row, antigen is diluted serially.  The less diluted (more concentrated Ag is
on the right side of wells).  Time of development is shown at 24 and 72 hours.
The precipitin line is sharper at 24 h, less so at 72 h.

<p>
In diffusion techniques where multiple Ag or Ab exists (certainly so with
heterogeneous Ab forms), multiple lines will manifest themselves.  It does no
good to distance the well to get resolution as (1) sensitivity decreases with
the distance and (2) as a result of decreased sensitivity, no insoluble
complexes (precipitations) may occur.
<p>
Multiple line can be quite useful to show and identify the antigenic determinants
of an Ag, and to make a corresponding identity.

Electrophoresis is used to move antigen(s) down the lane and separate them
on mobility (charge-to-mass).  A trough is cut next to the lane, and then a
solution of antibody filled.  Diffusion takes place over several hours to days
to form one or more precipitin arcs.  This procedure is good for ascertaining
the existence of myelomas and agammaglobulinemia.

The ELISA is a procedure with the sensitivity of the RIA without its hazards.
The enzymes used in the development are alkaline phosphatase and
&beta;-galactosidase [presently horseradish peroxidase is the enzyme of choice,
but perhaps not in the early 1980s].
<img src="imagesImmunologyHTML/ELISA-reaction.png"

  alt="The ELISA reaction">
The procedure for the ELISA is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Incubate the Ag in the well.
<li>Wash with BSA.
<li>Incubate in anti-Ag serum.
<li>Wash with BSA again
<li>Incubate with enzyme-conjugated anti-Ig specific to the anti-Ag type
<li>Wash again
<li>Add the enzyme substrate to get color development
<li>Read in the spectrophotometer, plot the standards, compute the unknown

<h1>Complement</h1>
<p>
When large aggregates of Ag-Ig complexes gather in serum, certain proteolytic
effector systems which make up complement perform an altogether significant
defense mechanism.
<p>
50% of serum proteins are components of complement.  Required for the system
also are two divalent cations: Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.  Other
biological control proteins or modulators round out the system.
<p>
Two pathways have been shown: <b>classical</b> and <b>alternate</b>.  In vivo
they help in both host defense but also in tissue injury or destruction.

<h2>Classical Pathway</h2>
<p>
Composed of 11 proteins, many of which are multi-subunit pathways.  C3 is
the most prevalent and is the ultimate mediator of activities related to
complement.  C2 is present in the least amounts, and so the concentration of
C2 is the limiting reagent.
<p>
<img src="imagesImmunologyHTML/C1q-structure.png"
  class="float-left"
  alt="C1q component structure">
The complement component C1q is a subunit of high MW and is an initiator.  It
is composed of 18 polypeptides, most of which are in the &beta;<sub>1</sub>
and &beta;<sub>2</sub> globulin fraction of blood.  Complement component C9
is an &alpha; globulin.  Some complement components migrate with the
&gamma; globulin fraction although they are not Ig molecules.  C1q has been
visualized with negatively stained electron microscopy and it looks much like
the figure shown.  There are six groups of three propteins (making up the 18
peptides), where one group represents one valence, and so C1q has six
valences.  Each of these groups can react with the F<sub>c</sub> portion of
IgG<sub>1</sub> or IgG<sub>3</sub> or IgM;  that is, it reacts with the
heavy chains &gamma;1, &gamma;3, or &mu;.  Two F<sub>c</sub> binding sites
must be in close proximity for the activation of C1q.
<p>
<img src="imagesImmunologyHTML/C1-activation.png"
style="width:674px;"
  alt="activation of C1q scheme">
While the activation of C1q theoretically requires two IgG molecules, in order
to get them within proximity required for C1q activation, a statistically
computed minimum of 2000 IgG molecules would be required.  However, it actually
only requires one IgM molecule to activated C1q since it is an intramolecular
connection of five molecules brought in proximity of one another.
<p>
<img src="imagesImmunologyHTML/C1-membrane-interaction.png"
class="float-right"
  alt="">
Once C1q is complexed with Ig molecules, it attracts C1r and C1s to form
a larger complex.  The C1s activates to become an esterase.  The esterase
converts C4 to two fragments, C4a and C4b. C4a remains soluble, while C4b
is bound.  C2 is cleaved also into C2a and C2b.  C4b and c2a combine on the
membrane surface, becoming an esterase that acts on C3.

 style="width:375px;margin-left:-5%;" class="float-left"
  alt="classical pathway from C1qrs complex to C3">
This splits C3 to C3a and C3b. It should be noted that C4b and C2a must bind to
the surface right awya, or no activity results.
