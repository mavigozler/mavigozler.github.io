      Note that it is not true that all antigens are destroyed for purposes of
      immunochemical reactivity by paraffin infiltration of fixed tissues,
      although use of frozen sectioning is to be preferred.

      <h1>Sectioning of Frozen Tissues</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          label the base mold and partially fill mold with frozen tissue matrix
        </li>
        <li>
          Place tissues from animal in the pre-labeled base molds, in a way that
          the tissue is near the bottom and so that tissue is exposed with cut
        </li>
        <li>
          Plunge base mold into liquid nitrogen until it
          <strong>almost</strong>
          solidifies (about 30 s).
          <strong>Blocks left too long in nitrogen may crack</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Put block on dry ice (or keep tissue in base mold or transfer to
          plastic bag), and store at −70° until time for sectioning
        </li>
        <li>
          To section, mount block to the cryostat chuck by adhering it with
          small amount of frozen tissue matrix and allowing to freeze
        </li>
        <li>
          Typical depth is 5 μm, with sections collected on to glass slide
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover cut surface of block with frozen tissue matrix and freeze and
          store at −70° if block is to be re-cut later.
          <strong>
            Do not store tissues on cryostat; many have defrost cycle
          </strong>
        </li>
        <li>Fix sections in cold (−20°) acetone for 2 min</li>
        <li>
          Let fixed sections dry completely, label them, and store −70° until
          they are to be worked up further
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Paraffin Sections</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Paraffin blocks are sectioned at 4 μm and floated on deoinized or
          distilled water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Floating sections then picked up on glass slides (which may be
          poly-L-lysine- or chrome alum-coated). Dry these upright overnight at
          room temperature. After the drying, optional treatment for optimal
          adhesion is to place at 60° for 1 h prior to de-paraffinization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deparaffinization starts with xylene (or substitute) for 10 min, twice
        </li>
        <li>Then slides placed in absolute ethanol for 2 min, twice</li>
        <li>
          Incubate for 10 min in 3% H
          <sub>2</sub>
          O
          <sub>2</sub>
          in MeOH (1 vol 30% hydrogen peroxide and 9 vol methanol). This blocks
          endogenous peroxidase activity.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse in water, then soak in PBS.</li>
        <li>
          Rinse with PBS again, then apply 100 μL of each primary antibody at
          the correct titer
        </li>
        <li>Incubate 4° overnight</li>
        <li>
          Proceed with step 3 of the section on
          <a href="#stdstain">Standard Staining</a>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h1><a name="stdstain">Standard Staining Procedure</a></h1>
      In moving slide from one container to another, always allow slides to
      drain 15-20 sec to prevent carry over.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Remove frozen slides from storage and let come to room temperature.
          Make sure slides labeled in alcohol- and xylene-resistant ink. Rinse
          slides at least 2-3 × in PBS to remove frozen mounting medium.
        </li>
        <li>Remove excess buffer from around specimen</li>
        <li>
          100 μL primary antibody at correct titer is applied to slide and left
          for 60 min at room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Slide is rinsed in PBS for 2 min. Repeat rinse two more times.</li>
        <li>
          Remove excess rinse, and apply 100 μL labeled (biotinylated) secondary
          antibody at correct titer. This incubation is for 30 min
        </li>
        <li>Rinse in PBS three times, 2 min each.</li>
        <li>
          If biotinylated 2° Ab used, add a strepavidin-peroxidase conjugate
          (100 μL) and incubate half hour. Else skip to step after next one.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse in PBS three times, 2 min each.</li>
        <li>
          Prepare DAB peroxidase substrate (it's a suspected carcinogen).
          Without letting slides dry out, add 400 μL DAB solution to each slide,
          ensuring all tissue is covered. Incubate approx. 5 min.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pick up each slide in the order it received development solution.
          Drain away the solution, and place in water.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse in water three times</li>
        <li>
          Peform a counterstaining procedure:
          <ol>
            <li>Dip 2 times in Gill 1 hematoxylin</li>
            <li>Rinse well in water</li>
            <li>Dip 2 times in Bluing reagent of dilute ammonia water</li>
            <li>Rinse well in water</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          As a final step dehydrate thoroughly in absolute ethanol, changing
          solution 4 times. Then clear in xylene or substitute (3-4 times), and
          mount coverslip.
        </li>
      </ol>
