<!-- ======== Laboratory Management ======================================= -->

<h1>Current Issues in Laboratory Management</h1>

<h2>Management And Organizational Theory</h2>
<p>
<i>Management</i> or <i>administration</i> is the organization and control of
the operations of a business or a sector of a business, or the <q>working with 
and through people to accomplish a common mission.</q>
<p>
<b>Theories on management/leadership.</b>
One factor that impacts leadership success is management style.
There are primarily five leadership theories:
<ol>
<li>Tannenbaum and Schmidt theory. Styles can be plotted on a continuum from
authoritative to democratic.
<li>McGregor X and Y theory. McGregor X theory relates to authoritative leader,
whereas the Y theory relates to the democratic leader
<li>Blake and Mouton theory. Describes five types of management situations:
 <ol>
 <li>impoverished management:  low concern for people and production
 <li>authority-compliance: low concern for people, but high concern for production
 <li>middle-of-the-road management: medium concern for people and production
 <li>country club management. high concern for people, but low concern for production
 <li>team management: high concern for people and production
 </ol>
<li>Fielder theory. This theory indicates that the style used by the leader may
vary according to the situation, with a very favorable or very unfavorable
situation requiring a task-oriented leader, and a moderately favorable or
moderately unfavorable situation requiring a relationship-oriented leader.
<li>Hersey-Blanchard theory. Four leadership situations:
 <ol>
 <li>employee new to job
 <li>employee has mastered some of the job, but needs supervision
 <li>employee has mastered the job, but needs verification
 <li>employee has mastered the job and is confident
 </ol>
</ol>
<p>
Managers need following skills:
<ul>
<li>organizational skills
 <ul>
 <li>conceptualize and apply management process
 <li> systematize work flow
 <li>make decisions
 <li>communicate with coworkers
 </ul>
<li>people skills: understand basic theories of human needs and work motivation
<li>financial skills: effective use of and accounting for monetary assets of
the company
<li>technical skills:  involves the synthesis of the first three skills above
and the management of physical resources, namely supplies, equipment, and facilities
into the operational parameters, which are products and services
</ul>
<p>
Relevant management theories:
<ul>
<li><b>scientific management</b><br>
Proposed by Frederick Taylor, this is a systematic or scientific approach to
studying the structure, function (goals/mission) of organization, applying
a cause-and-effect analysis, breaking down each task into segments to improve
efficiency
<li><b>bureaucracy management</b><br>
Organizational structure and function of company is examined to explain how
institutions function and improve structural process. The hierarchical chain of
command is an example. Special attention is given to the bureaucratic
characteristics as they relate to rules, regulations, impersonality, and
division of labor.
<li><b>behavioral science</b><br>
focuses on the performance and interaction of people within the organization by
utilizing psychology and sociology, as well as management theories
<li><b>systems analysis</b><br>
This is an outgrowth of management science, which views the organization
as a continuous process interacting within itself and with its environment.
This concept includes Peter Drucker's five basic management operations:
 <ol>
 <li>setting objectives
 <li>organizing
 <li>motivating and communicating
 <li>establishing standards, including measurements of performance
 <li>developing people, including managers
 </ol>
</ul>
<p>
The process of management is a concept of management as a continuous
process of interacting functions, each dependent on the success of the other.
The four main functions are
<ol>
<li>planning
<li>organizing
<li>directing
<li>controlling
</ol>
<p>
<b>Management by objectives (MBO)</b>.  This program embodies the four functions
of management process described above (planning, operating, directing,
controlling) that were introduced by Peter Drucker in the 1960s. MBO core
is <i>communications</i>.  Success or failure depends on how well employees
understand the company's mission and objectives. Managers who allow employees
to share in the decision-making process will have effective MBO programs.
Managers must understand and be skilled at writing and monitoring objectives.
<p>
<b>Motivation</b> is the driving forces by which people act as they do. Could
also be described by alternative words: incentives, motives, purpose, drive,
desires, and needs.  There aret hree major theories relevant to motivation:
<ol>
<li><b>Maslow's hierarchy of needs</b>. These are needs based on a physiological
or healthy need (working allows personal survival: housing and nutrition),
and this has priority over another need described by Maslow, which is a social
need, in which the individual is motivated by achieving esteem or being loved.
or love.  This has priority over any social pressure that is a motivating factor.
<li><b>Herzberg's two-factor theory</b>. Herzberg (1959) described two factors
as components of motivation:
 <ol>
 <li>those described by Maslow is the one part:  basic needs, hygiene factors,
 corresponding with physical and social needs
 <li>motivators corresponding primarily with Maslow's needs for growth
 </ol>
<li><b>Vroom's expectancy theory</b>.  Namely effort brings reward.  The
actual effort expended will be related to the perceived value of the reward.
People make a choice between alternative courses of actions according to how
they perceive the resulting benefits.
</ol>

<h2>Professionalism</h2>
<p>
This is a judgment of the quality with which one practices the profession. It
also includes characteristics such as altruism, honor, integrity, caring, 
compassion, respect, responsibility, accountability, scholarship, and 
leadership.
<p>
<b>Professional ethics</b> is the study of standards of conduct and
moral judgments which provide a basis for right and wrong conduct. The American 
Society for Clinical Laboratory Science (ASCLS) has developed and published the 
Code of Ethics for Clinical Laboratory Science comprised of duties to patient,
colleagues, and society.

<h3>Employee Hiring, Evaluation and Discipline</h3>
<p>
The <b>job description</b> defines the functions and purpose of a specific
position a member of the organization. It should feature the following:
<ul>
<li>name of organization
<li>job title
<li>summary of duties for the position
<li>essential functions required for the position
<li>immediate supervisor (chain of command)
<li>working conditions/environment
<li>required qualifications and experience
</ul>
<p>
The <b>resume</b> is a means for an applicant to demonstrate strengths,
education, and accomplishments when seeking employment. The resume should
include the following:
<ol>
<li>applicant name (legal)
<li>contact information (including e-mail)
<li>career objective
<li>educational qualifications
<li>clinical experience
<li>military experience
<li>certifications
<li>professional society memberships
<li>honors
<li>publications/research activities/special projects
<li>volunteer work
<li>statement regarding references
</ol>
<p>
A cover letter should accompany a resume to focus attention on the applicant.
It is best to address the cover letter to a specific individual.
<p>
The purpose of the <b>interview process</b> is for confirming information is
valid in resume and/or job application. It also assesses applicant's
interpersonal communication skills. The interview also provides the candidate
with the opportunity to discuss information in more detail and to ask questions
pertinent to the specific position.
<p>
The selection process should be conducted after the interview and should
include an evaluation of the candidate's resume/application and information 
from the interview. The manager is seeking to select the candidate with the 
appropriate skills, certifications, and personality to fit the institution and 
the position.
<p>
Employee evaluation process is a method that both recognizes excellence
and determines areas for development and training.  The job evaluation is 
directly linked to the job description and should be formative and summarizing.
It should also be done frequently to provide feedback and direction for the
employee.
<ul>
<li>Criteria-based evaluations indicate specific performance expectations
that are linked to the job description.
<li>Competency-based evaluations are used to validate competency of skills.
</ul>
<p>
The purpose of <b>corrective action</b> is to provide ab employee with specific
goals to enhance their effectiveness and performance.  There are three steps:
<ol>
<li>Step 1: verbal counseling alerts the employee to the situation and opens
lines of communication
<li>Step 2: a verbal warning involves a statement of the problem, performance
in question, and offering resources and assistance.  This process should be
documented.
<li>Step 3: a formal written warning that states the problem, expected
improvement in performance, and a timeline for re-evaluation of performance. 
This document is signed by the immediate supervisor and employee. Failure to 
meet the stated requirements typically results in dismissal of the employee.
</ol>
<p>
Note that most institutions have a policy that allows the employee to seek an
appeal of the situation to a higher level.

<h2>Communication and interpersonal relationships</h2>
<p>
Communication is an ongoing process of interpreting symbols, decoding speech
and phrases, interpreting ideas and feelings, and encoding that information to 
formulate an appropriate response. Communication typically serves the following 
purposes:
<ul>
<li>exchange of knowledge
<li>expression of feelings
<li>expression of ideas and thoughts
<li>attempt to influence another's thoughts and actions
<li>meeting social expectations
</ul>
<p>
Barriers to effective communication are:
<ul>
<li>nonverbal expressions; body language
<li>cultural differences; unfamiliar phrases
<li>paraverbal issues:  tone and pitch of voice
<li>environmental–temperature, neatness of appearance
<li>overcommunication: too much information offered at one time
<li>undercommunication: not enough information provided for understanding the issue
<li>time issues
</ul>

<p>
Team building is essential for optimal employee performance and effectiveness
of the section, department, and institution. Tuckman (1965) suggests the
following phases of team development:
<ul>
<li>identifying the team members
<li>team members selecting their roles
<li>determining standards of behavior and expectations
<li>working together towards a common goal
</ul>

<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>
<b>Quality assurance (QA)</b> is a comprehensive set of policies, procedures, and
practices that are followed to ensure that a laboratory's results are reliable. 
QA evaluates the quality of the services provided. and it provides a way to prevent
problems as well as deal with problems that occur.
<p>
It differs from <b>quality control (QC)</b> in that QC is included as part of a
QA program. QC ensures that a particular test method is working properly and
that results of that test are reliable.
<p>
QA includes record keeping, maintenance and calibration of equipment,
proficiency testing, quality control, and training of personnel. QA is a
commitment to quality. Physician and patient relations are a part of this plan.

<h3>Quality Assurance Plan</h3>
<p>
A QA plan has the following:
<ul>
<li>All policies and procedures are in writing and available.
<li>Staff performance is routinely evaluated.
<li>Continuing education is used and documented
<li>A safety program is in place for both staff and patients.
 <ul>
 <li>Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards are met.
 <li>Hazardous materials are identified and labeled.
 <li>Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are available for each hazardous material.
 <li>Employee safety training is documented.
 <li>Records of any accidents (e.g., needle stick) are kept and reported to
   appropriate authors.
 <li>Hazardous waste is properly discarded.
 <li>Universal precautions are strictly followed
 <li>Safety equipment (e.g., fire extinguishers, fire blankets, safety showers,
 goggles) is available to staff, and training in the use of this equipment
 is performed and documented.
 <li>Electrical checks of all equipment are routinely performed.
 </ul>
<li>Specimen collection and handling (pre-analytical) as well as correct patient
preparation follows written guidelines and is documented.
<li>A quality control (QC) program is in place for lab testing (analytical).
This ensures that the instruments, reagents, and personnel are functioning
properly. A QC program comprises several areas:
  <ul>
  <li>A written QC program is required that specifies:
   <ul>
   <li>frequency of performing controls
   <li>number of controls to be used
   <li>type of controls
   <li>acceptable limits for control results
   <li>corrective action required if controls are out of range
   </ul>
  <li>QC plots of control results are used to detect:
   <ul>
   <li>shifts: a sudden upward or downward change of four or more
     consecutive values
   <li>trends:  the tendency of results to gradually increase or decrease
      over a period of time
   </ul>
   <li>Equipment maintenance is performed and documented.
   <li>temperatures of incubators, certain instruments, and the room are
     controlled and documented.
   </ul>
<li>Checklists are used to ensure that scheduled activities and duties are
performed.
<li>The laboratory must participate in and document results of proficiency
testing (PT). This allows comparison of results from a number of laboratories. 
Specimens from PT sponsors are to be treated exactly like patient specimens.
<li>The laboratory must be accredited by an appropriate agency. This gives
official approval and states that the laboratory follows all guidelines 
set forth by the accrediting agency.  Inspectors representing the accrediting 
agency view records, documents, and visit the laboratory.
</ul>

<h2>Laboratory Regulations</h2>

<h3>Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA 88)</h3>
<p>
CLIA 88 is intended to establish regulations for all laboratories, regardless
of size or location, where clinical testing is performed for the purpose of
diagnosis, treatment, or monitoring of patients' health. The law was published
in the February 28, 1992 issue of the Federal Register, and became effective
for all laboratories on September 1, 1992. Modifications to the law list the
complexity of tests. Additional modifications define alternative routes for
personnel qualifications.
<p>
<b>Laboratory Accreditation</b>.  All laboratories must have a CLIA certificate to
perform testing and receive federal reimbursement. Certification is based on
the level of test complexity.
<p>
Sites performing only waived tests comprise 58% (105,138) of the approximately
180,000 laboratory testing sites in the United States. Waived testing performed 
in these sites is often wellness testing, screening tests, or other critical 
testing that introduces a large population of persons into the health care 
setting.  Although the testing performed in Certificate of Waiver sites accounts 
for &lt;10% of the total U.S. testing volume, this percentage has been
increasing each year since the CLIA program began. Types of direct, unprocessed
specimens suitable for waived testing are listed below:
<ul>
<li>whole blood (fingerstick or anticoagualted blood collected via venipuncture)<br>
glucose, cholesterol, prothrombin time, infectious mononucleosis, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, hemoglobin-copper sulfate method, spun hematocrit,
HIV antibody
<li>urine  <br>
  dipstick urinalysis and pregnancy test (hCG)
<li>throat swab <br>
  Group A streptococcal antigen
<li>nasopharyngeal swab <br>
  influenza
<li>stool <br>
 occult blood
<li>saliva <br>
 alcohol
<li> oral fluid <br>
 HIV antibody
<li> gastric biopsy <br>
 <i>H. pylori</i>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Provider-performed microscopy (PPM)</b> includes:
<ul>
<li>wet mount, including preparations of vaginal, cervical or skin specimens
<li>potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation
<li>pinworm slides
<li>Fern test
<li>urine sediment
<li>vaginal smears
<li>nasal smear examinations for granulocytes
<li>fecal leukocyte examinations
<li>semen analysis:  qualitative examination, presence or absence, motility
</ul>

<p>
<b>Moderately complex</b> testing includes:
<ul>
<li>hematology
<li>chemistry
<li>serology
<li>coagulation
<li>therapeutic drug monitoring
<li>blood gases
<li>urine colony counts
<li>blood type and Rh factor
<li>limited immunology
<li>manual differential:  limited identification; normal cells only
<li>Gram's stain:  urethral for gas chromatography (GC), cervical for GC
<li>throat culture screen only: hemolysis, bacitracin, strep select agar
<li>microscopic urinalysis (non-PPM)
<li>rapid kits
</ul>

<p>
<b>Highly complex</b> testing includes:
<ul>
<li>microbiology
<li>immunohematology
<li>bacteriology
<li>cytology
<li>histopathology
<li>mycology
<li>manual hematology counts
<li>manual differential:  identification of abnormal cells,
  complete identification, non-automated chemistry tests
</ul>
<p>
The certificate fee and biennial inspection fee, which are based on the size of
the laboratory and number of tests performed annually, must be paid.
Accreditation by a private organization is an alternative option for
certification.
<p>
The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) may deem a laboratory to
meet all of the CLIA requirements if the laboratory is accredited by a private,
nonprofit organization that is certified as having deemed status. This means
that the certifying agency must:
<ul>
<li>provide reasonable assurance to HCFA that it requires the laboratories it
accredits to meet all of the requirements equivalent to the CLIA requirements
in the law
<li>inspect its laboratories per condition level requirements of the law
</ul>
<p>
Approved state laboratory programs are responsible for accreditation of
laboratories in their state, if this is a requirement of the department of
health of that state.
<p>
Personnel requirements must be met by laboratories performing moderately or
highly complex testing. These positions can be held by the same person or by 
different persons who meet the qualifications.
<p>
Moderately complex laboratories must have the following personnel:
<ul>
<li>Laboratory director
<li>Technical consultant
<li>Clinical consultant
<li>Testing personnel<br>
Each person performing moderately complex testing must follow laboratory
procedures, maintain records, adhere to policies, identify problems,
document corrective actions, testing personnel must have documented training
in all areas of testing performed.
</ul>
<p>
Highly complex laboratories are required to have the same personnel as a
moderately complex laboratory, but must also have:
<ul>
<li>General supervisor
<li>Technical supervisor
</ul>

<h2>Quality Control</h2>
<p>
Must be implemented in all operations performing moderately and highly complex
testing. General QC procedures are performed on all specialties and
subspecialties as specified within the Federal Register. Procedures not found
in the Federal Register must be conducted according to the manufacturer's
protocol that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
<p>
The laboratory must establish and follow written QC procedures for monitoring
and evaluating the test process to assure accuracy and reliability of results.
There must be documentation of all calibration procedures.
<ul>
<li>A minimum of two levels of control materials are run on each day of testing.
<li>All QC records must be retained for 2 years.
<li>QC must be tested in a manner that provides results within the
laboratory's stated performance requirements.
<li>The laboratory must have instruments, reagents, and supplies sufficient for the
type and volume of tests performed.
<li>There must be defined criteria for proper storage of reagents and specimens.
<li>A procedure for remedial actions must be established when QC fails.
<li>All reagents, solutions, medias, QC materials, and standards must be labeled.
<li>Different lot numbers are not to be interchanged unless specified by
the manufacturer.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Proficiency testing (PT)</b> is mandatory for all moderately and highly
complex tests listed on the Compiled list of clinical laboratory systems,
assays, and examinations categorized by complexity, published in the Federal
Register. There are numerous CMS-approved PT programs available. Laboratories
receive between three and five challenges for each analyte that requires PT.
Challenges are received three times a year. The same personnel who routinely
perform the test procedures must perform the PT. Laboratories are required to
score 80% on all analytes to be considered in compliance. Blood bank specimens
require a score of 100%.
<p>
A procedures manual must be written to include all testing methods used in the
laboratory. It must be available and followed by all testing personnel.
The manual must include:
<ul>
<li>the principle and methodology of each test
<li>criteria for specimen collection, processing, and rejection (pre-analytical
steps)
<li>instructions for microscopic examination procedures
<li>test procedures (analytical), including step-by-step instructions and
result interpretation
<li>preparation of materials, including of required solutions (e.g., reagents,
controls, calibrators, stains, slides) and their location; step-by-step
preparation of all materials needed; storage after preparation; labeling and
dating instructions; safety precautions needed; solutions used in preparation
(e.g., deionized water, diluent)

corrective actions taken when controls are not within limits
<li>actions taken when results deviate from expected values:  recalibration,
troubleshooting, repeats, dilutions
<li>limitations or cautions of the procedure, including both positive and
negative interfering substances (how they interfere) and (other) common sources
of error
<li>result reporting (post-analytical):  reference ranges especially for
range for different specimen types (e.g., serum, plasma, urine), for demographic
variables (e.g., age, sex); panic values:  what are life-threatening results or
results needing special attention (critical results)
<li>method or procedure references:  manufacturer's product literature
(e.g., inserts, manuals) and lit refs in textbooks, journals, etc.
<li>specimen retention:  period allowed for specimen to be consider valuid, and
proper storage conditions.
<li>system for reporting patient results (post-analytical):  understanding
unacceptable results (follow QC specifications); how reporting is done to
requesting entity; protocol for panic and critical values
<li>course of action for problems...solving problems...troubleshooting
<li>specimen referral:  testing personnel or section, and how specimen is
handled, and how results are to be received
</ul>
<p>
The manual or specific procedure in the manual is not approved until:
<ul>
<li>signed off by the laboratory director
<li>reviewed by all personnel using the procedure
<li>reviewed and updated by the supervisor or director
</ul>
<p>
The manual must be rewritten when new procedures are implemented.  The manual
must be retained for future reference.
<p>
A quality assurance (QA) plan must be established and followed to monitor and
evaluate the quality of tests.
<ul>
<li>The program must be an ongoing process.
<li>It must evaluate all facets of the testing process.
<li>The program must extend to the interactions of other health care
professionals in the ordering of tests.
<li>It must allow for actions to be taken to correct errors or problems.
<li>The program must monitor and evaluate:  specimen requirements, collection,
handling and processing, corrective actions taken in QC and PT, result reporting,
employee competence
<li>All QA activities must be documented and evaluated monthly.
</ul>
<p>
Inspections are conducted every 2 years by the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) or its designee.  Laboratory inspectors have the right to:
<ul>
<li>interview all employees
<li>access all areas of a facility
<li>observe all testing
<li>review all information and data records
<li>determine that the laboratory is operated in a safe manner
<li>determine that the laboratory is performing tests only within their complexity
category
<li>evaluate any complaints from the public
</ul>
<p>
The inspectors may also:
<ul>
<li>conduct unannounced inspections at any time during hours of operation
<li>ask personnel to perform testing on test samples that the inspector supplies
<li>reinspect a laboratory at any time to evaluate accurate and reliable results
</ul>
<p>
Sanctions may be imposed on laboratories that are found to be out of compliance
with one or more of the conditions for Medicare coverage.
<ul>
<li>Suspension, limitations, or revocation of a certificate can be imposed.
<li>A civil suit can be brought against a laboratory to forbid testing.
<li>Imprisonment or fines can be levied against persons convicted of violations.
<li>HHS publishes annually a list of laboratories that have been sanctioned.
</ul>

<h2>Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)</h2>
<p>
Regulations for Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens require
laboratories to establish workplace safety practices to prevent accidental
exposure to etiologic agents in blood.
<p>
The regulations limit occupational exposure to blood and other potentially
infectious materials that can transmit bloodborne pathogens and include but are 
not limited to: hepatitis B virus (HBV) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
<p>
The basis for all preventive measures is the practice of universal precautions.
These are recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). Laboratory personnel must treat all human blood and other potentially
infectious body fluids as if they were infected with HIV, HBV, and other
bloodborne pathogens, and this includes materials that are contaminated with
blood.
<p>
A written exposure control plan must be in place that describes the
procedures established to minimize employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
There must be identification of job classification, tasks, and procedures in
which there is the potential of exposure.  A determination must be made of the
job types in which exposure could occur. All tasks must be included in the
job description.
<p>
An explanation of personal protective equipment (PPE) available and in use
must be included.  Appropriate protective equipment must be supplied to employees
at no cost to them.  Equipment is considered appropriate only if it does not
permit blood or other potentially infectious materials (PIMs) to pass through
to an employee's clothes, skin, mouth, or other mucous membranes.  Types of PPE
are gloves, gowns, laboratory coats, face shields or masks, and eye protection.
All employers are responsible for providing, maintaining, laundering, disposing
of, replacing, and assuring the proper use of all PPE.
<p>
Engineering controls must be in place to minimize exposure.  These are devices
that isolate or remove the pathogen hazard from the workplace.  These devices
must be made available to all employees.  Examples of engineering controls
include:
<ol>
<li>sharps containers and biosafety bags
<li>splash guards and self-sheathing needles
<li>biosafety cabinets and fume hoods
<li>mechanical pipetting devices
<li>hand washing facilities, eyewash stations, and showers
</ol>
<p>
Work practices must be developed to reduce or eliminate employee exposure to
blood or PIMs during the execution of their work tasks. Employees must fully understand these procedures.
The procedures must be implemented, when appropriate.
Work practice procedures include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>hand washing
<li>no recapping of contaminated needles:  immediate discard?
<li>no food or drink allowed in the laboratory
<li>no mouth pipetting
<li>warning labels affixed where needed, and biohazard symbols placed appropriately
<li>a dress code that ensures safety
</ul>
<p>
Housekeeping procedures are necessary for maintaining a clean and sanitary work
site, which is a responsibility of employers. All equipment and work surfaces
must be decontaminated. Sharps containers must be puncture resistant.
Containers for biohazard materials must be constructed to contain all contents
and prevent leakage during handling, storage, transport, and shipping.
Procedure for disposal of biohazard materials will be based on federal, state,
and local regulations. All housekeeping personnel will handle contaminated
materials with the use of PPE.
<p>
An HBV vaccination program must be established. HBV vaccine and vaccination
series must be made available to all employees who are identified as being
exposed to PIMs. The vaccination series will be offered within 10 days of the
employee being assigned to an area of possible exposure. The vaccination series
must be offered at no cost to the employee. The program must be established
using the protocol outlined in the Federal Register. The program must include
procedures for evaluation of the circumstances of an exposure incident to
prevent further incidents. Exemptions to the HBV vaccination program are:
<ul>
<li>employees who have already completed the HBV series
<li>employees whose antibody tests reveal an immunity
<li>employees for whom vaccination is contraindicated for medical reasons
</ul>
<p>
Employees who decline the HBV series must sign the declination statement
published in Addendum A of the Federal Register. All records are part of the
employee's permanent file and are confidential information.
<p>
Postexposure and follow-up evaluations are available at no cost to any employee
who sustains an exposure.
<p>
The communication of hazards to employees is required by OSHA regulations. All
employees must receive free biosafety training during working hours. Training
sessions must be presented in a way that can be clearly understood. These
sessions must be designed for the particular situation and institution involved.
Generic information and signing of a statement will not satisfy the
requirements. Instructors must be knowledgeable and must demonstrate use and
location of all safety devices, document all training, ensure that employees
understand how to cope with hazards they may come in contact with during their
employment.
<p>
A record-keeping policy must be in place. All documentation of training and
exposure incidents must be a part of each employee's permanent record. All 
files are confidential information. Medical records are transferred when an 
employee leaves. All records are kept on file for the duration of employment 
plus 30 years.
<p>
<b>OSHA regulations for Occupational Exposures to Hazardous Chemicals in
Laboratories</b> are published in the Federal Register. The laboratory must 
develop a systematic approach to significant risk determination. The standard 
defines <q>employee</q> as an individual employed in a laboratory workplace who 
may be exposed to hazardous chemicals in the course of his or her assignments.
The standard defines <q>toxic or hazardous chemicals</q> as any substance that
has the capacity to produce personal injury or illness to man through ingestion,
inhalation, or absorption through any body surface.
<p>
The significant risk findings must be based on the following factors:
<ul>
<li>epidemiological information relating to disease and mortality rates
<li>evidence that shows significant risk for specific substances that are used in
the laboratory
<li>general recognition that safe work practices are necessary to prevent adverse
health effects
<li>reported information about adverse health effects resulting from exposures
to substances commonly used in the laboratory
<li>relevant policy considerations
</ul>
<p>
Exposure monitoring of employees is required only when there is reason to
believe that permissible exposure limits (PEL) or action levels for a substance
are routinely exceeded. The standard has a provision for a written chemical
hygiene plan (CHP) to be formulated and implemented by the employer. Under the
law, employees have the right to know any operations in their work area where
hazardous chemicals are present. The location and availability of the written
hazard communication program and material safety data sheet (MSDS) are required.
 A designated chemical hygiene officer (CHO) oversees the development,
implementation, and administration of the CHP. The duties of the CHO include:
<ul>
<li>developing a standard operating procedure that is relevant to the safety
and health of persons who work with hazardous chemicals (This need not be
developed for each chemical. A generic approach that groups chemicals by
their physical and chemical properties is acceptable.)
<li>setting criteria that will be used by the laboratory to determine the need
for and the implementation of measures to control and reduce employee exposures
(The criteria should address engineering controls and PPE.)
<li>describing the laboratory's employee information and training program
<li>explaining the laboratory's program to provide OSHA-required medical
examinations and consultations
<li>designating specific operations that cannot be performed without prior approval
<li>making provisions for providing additional protection for work with particularly
hazardous materials, including selected carcinogens, reproductive toxins,
substances with a high acute toxicity
<li>labeling all chemicals to reflect the degree of hazard involved in their use
</ul>
<p>
<b>OSHA's final rule for Occupational Exposure to Formaldehyde</b> was
published on May 27, 1992. The risk of exposure in the laboratory is great
without proper engineering controls and good work practices. A policy to
maintain the permissible exposure limit (PEL) must be in place. PEL must be at
or below 0.75 parts per million (ppm). The short-term exposure limit of 2.0 ppm
per 15 minutes of exposure. The action level is 0.5 ppm. The formaldehyde
exposure control plan must include
<ul>
<li>monitoring of employees prone to exposure
<li>limitation of access to regulated areas to authorized persons who have been
trained to recognize the hazards
<li>establishment of identified and located engineering controls and
work practices
<li>provision of the necessary PPE and clothing at no cost to the employee
<li>a quick-drench shower and eyewash facility located within the immediate work
area
<li>visual inspections for spills as a housekeeping procedure and cleaning
up spills using formaldehyde-resistant clothing
<li>performance by a licensed physician of all medical surveillance procedures
without cost to the employee
<li>training of employees at the time of employment, annually, and whenever
a new exposure to formaldehyde is introduced into the work area
<li>environmental monitoring record keeping for 30 years
</ul>
<p>
<b>Guidelines from OSHA for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis in Health Care Facilities</b> are published in the Federal
Register. Each laboratory is responsible for having a policy on prevention of M.
 tuberculosis transmission, based on their own personnel's exposure to
tuberculosis. This policy must include but is not limited to the following:
<ul>
<li>Control measures must include the use of administrative measures to reduce
the risk of exposure to persons who have infectious tuberculosis by developing
risk assessments.
<li>Engineering controls include preventing the spread and reducing the
concentrations of infectious droplets, as well as using personal respiratory
tract protective equipment in areas where there is a risk of exposure. The most
efficient of these is the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.
<li>Risk assessments must be performed to identify and manage personnel who
have tuberculosis. Management includes early treatment and isolation.
<li>A tuberculosis screening program for employees must be developed and must
include the use of skin tests and follow-up treatment of all employees who have
positive test results.
<li>All employees must be trained and educated in the use of PPE, hygiene, and
handling of patients who have tuberculosis.
<li>The evaluation of tuberculosis infection control programs must include the
effectiveness of the program and the outcome of exposures.
</ul>
<p>
Three levels for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis include the following:
<ol>
<li><b>First level</b> is to develop and implement policies for rapid
identification. If there is a suspicion of tuberculosis, there should be a way
to alert all other health care workers of the possibility. Each facility must
determine its own policy for rapid identification.
<li><b>Second level</b> is the use of PPE and respiratory tract protection
(e.g., HEPA filter) to protect health careworkers from the disease. This includes
education and training programs for all employees, as well as the prompt
evaluation of possible exposures to tuberculosis, including purified protein
derivative skin tests and radiographs, if necessary.
<li><b>Third level</b> is the coordination of activities with the local public
health department. This includes the reporting of all cases, as well as
continuation and completion of therapy.
</ol>
<p>
The <b>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</b> was
promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which
addresses the use and disclosure of individuals' health information called <q>
protected health information.</q> HIPPA created the first national standard to
protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information. The
major goal of the Privacy Rule is that the <q>individual's health information
is properly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to
provide and promote the public's health and well being.</q> It applies to all
health plans, health care clearinghouses, and any health care provider who
transmits health information in electronic form. For patients, <q>it means
being able to make informed choices when seeking care and reimbursement for
care based on how personal health information may be used.</q> Each entity is
responsible for HIPPA compliance via training and ensuring proper protocol is
followed.

<h2>Financial Management</h2>
<p>
The budget process usually begins in advance of the implementation date and is
prepared in phases dependent upon the fiscal year which consists of four phases.
<ol>
<li><b>Development of goals</b>. The goals must be in line with those
of the organization and must be achievable and measurable.
<li><b>Budget assumptions</b>. The organization provides a forecast of
available money based on past earnings, cash flow, and changes in state or 
federal laws affecting reimbursement.  Budget assumptions are based on annual 
test volume and revenue generated.
<li><b>Forecast of expenses</b>. Capital expenditure is an investment and thus
the rate of return must be evaluated and used as a criterion for budgeting decisions.a
<li>Monitoring. After operational budget is made and implemented, reports are
reviewed monthly for variances.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Employee scheduling</b>. One of the most challenging aspects of being a
supervisor/manager, which has a huge impact on the departmental budget.
Factors that impact scheduling:
<ul>
<li>test menu
<li>education and experience Level of staff
<li>number of employees needed for test volume
<li>number of emergency areas served
<li>turnaround time expectations (TAT)
<li>level of test complexity
</ul>
<p>
<b>Health care reimbursement</b>. Diagnostic related group (DRG) is a system to
classify hospital cases into one of approximately 500 groups. The system was 
developed for Medicare as part of the prospective payment system. DRGs are 
assigned by a <q>grouper</q> program based on diagnoses, procedures, age, sex, 
and the presence of complications or comorbidities. DRGs have been used since 
1983 to determine how much Medicare pays the hospital, since patients within 
each category are similar clinically and are expected to use the same level of 
hospital resources.
<p>
<b>Current procedural terminology (CPT)</b> is a listing of descriptive terms and
identifying codes for reporting medical services and procedures. The purpose of
CPT is to provide a uniform language that accurately describes medical,
surgical, and diagnostic services, and thereby serves as an effective means for
reliable nationwide communication among physicians, and other health care
providers, patients, and third parties. This system of terminology is the most
widely accepted medical nomenclature used to report medical procedures and
services under public and private health insurance programs.
<p>
<b>Medicare</b> is a social insurance program administered by the United States
government, providing health insurance coverage to people who are either age 65
and over, or who meet other special criteria.
<p>
<b>Medicaid</b> is the United States health program for individuals and
families with low incomes and resources. It is an entitlement program that is
jointly funded by the states and federal government, and is managed by the
states. Among the groups of people served by Medicaid are eligible low-income
parents, children, seniors, and people with disabilities.
<p>
Third-party payment is the practice of an insurer paying providers directly
for services rendered to an insured, as opposed to an indemnity contract that 
pays the insured person for the services incurred.

<h2>Laboratory Information Systems (LIS)</h2>
<p>
The benefits of an LIS are:
<ul>
<li>Reduces time-consuming paper work
<li>Stores patient data
<li>Stores QC data
<li>Provides immediate access to results
<li>Reduces the chance of an assay being ran on the wrong patient when barcode is
used
<li>Managerial reports (tests per month, workload units, TATs)
</ul>

<p>
The minimum requirements for LIS are:
<ul>
<li>Access codes or passwords per user for access to system
<li>Assign a unique accession number
<li>Provide a unique file for each assay (sample type, volume required, ranges)
<li>Record time collected, received, and unique identifier of who received it,
and who released results
<li>Print bar-code labels (ISBT for immunohematology/transfusion services)
<li>Interface with instruments and other information systems
</ul>

<h2>Instrument Selection Process</h2>
<p>
<b>Needs assessment</b>.
<ul>
<li>characteristics of the individual laboratory
<li>test volume (Random access vs. batch testing)
<li>throughput (TAT for STATs)
<li>connectivity (LIS)
<li>test menu for present and future needs
<li>fda approved
<li>maintenance downtime (mean time between downtime)
<li>sample dilution (manual vs. automatic)
<li>ease of troubleshooting
<li>special electrical or plumbing requirements
<li>waste management
<li>amount of heat generated
<li>safety features
</ul>

<p>
<b>Minimum standards for quality</b>
<ul>
<li>linearity
<li>sensitivity
<li>specificity
<li>accuracy
<li>precision
<li>stability of hardware/software (bar coding and ID features)
<li>stability and availability of reagents
</ul>

<p>
<b>Cost</b>
<ul>
<li>instrument itself
<li>reagents
<li>contracts (service, labor, travel)
<li>interface costs (LIS)
</ul>

<h2>Problem Solving</h2>

<ol>
<li>Define the problem
<li>Create scenarios
<li>Implement solution
<li>Examine solution
<li>Reflect (on problem/solution)
</ol>

<h2>Delivery Of Education Unit</h2>
<p>

A <b>goal</b> is a general statement which describes the instructor's purpose
for a particular instructional activity. <b>Objectives</b> are statements that 
describe the specific learning outcomes of an instructional activity and are 
written in greater detail than goals.
<ul>
<li>cognitive: intellectual learning outcome such as the recall of information,
the comprehension of that information, and the processes of analysis, synthesis,
and evaluation
<li>affective: emphasize values, attitudes, and interests
<li>psychomotor:  require neuromuscular coordination such as performing a task
</ul>
<p>
<b>Learning activities</b> allow the student to master the objectives and are
comprised of lectures, laboratory session, demonstration, computer assisted
instruction, Internet resources, tutorials, and online courses. <b>
Evaluation</b> determines the effectiveness of the learning activity and
provides feedback regarding the learner's attainment of the objectives for the
course.

<h2>Outreach Program</h2>
<p>
Physicians are treating patients more often on an outpatient basis;
therefore, outpatient volumes can potentially reach upwards of 60% of a
laboratory's total test volume.
The following <b>Added-value services</b> must therefore be considered:
<ul>
<li>phlebotomy
<li>turn around times (TATs):  outpatient volumes can cause TATs to increase for
inpatient testing
<li>supplies
<li>courier service
<li>reports:  electronic, hand delivered, or both
<li>customer service staff memmbers: knowledge of the outreach program and its
goals are critical
</ul>
<p>
Know your competition. In particular, do SWOT analysis: strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats.  One of the most important aspects of an outreach
program is also to be aware of pricing.

<h3>Quality Assessment</h3>
<h4>Pre-Analytical</h4>
Pre-analytical quality assurance involves variables such as:
<ul>
<li>Proper patient identification
<li>Procedures for proper labeling of specimen/sample containers
<li>Checklist/procedure for proper sample/specimen collection (e.g., correct
	anticoagulant in tube)
<li>Procedures for proper mixing of collected samples with reagents (stabilizing
	 or analyte-preserving)
<li>Timely delivery to analytical site
<li>Specimens evaluated for abnormal collection (e.g., clots in blood tubes)
<li>Interfering substances (medications) present in the sample/patient
<li>Prior confounding medical procedures (e.g., blood transfusions, IV line
	contamination)
</ul>
<h4>Quality Control</h4>
Statistically good quality control generally begins by reading at least 20 control
samples and establishing precision. <b>Normal</b> or <b>Reference Intervals</b>
must be established for each quantitative assay or method, and a sample size of
25 from clinically healthy male and female adults represents that principle,
in addition to establishing a pediatric population.
