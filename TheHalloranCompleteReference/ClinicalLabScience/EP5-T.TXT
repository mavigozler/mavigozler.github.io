               USER EVALUATION OF PRECISION PERFORMANCE OF
                       CLINCAL CHEMISTRY DEVICES


From Sec 1.2, proper estimation of precision requires:

   1. Familiarity with Device

   2. Familiarity with Protocol/Procedure

   3. Device being in control according to standard QC procedures
       during test of precision

   4. Obtaining data in sufficient numbers to meet a minimun level
       of statistical power/confidence

--------------

Section 4 describes the manner in which to set up an experiment for
reliable precision estimates.

The real goal is an understanding of "total precision" of the device
and associated procedure.  This may also be understood as "overall
precision" or "precision determined over the long run or over a long
period."  This implies that the experiment cannot be completed in a
day although many samples may be tested.  Devices and reagents typically
"decline" in quality or state of repair over time as well as frequency
of use.

Total precision has the following components and can be estimated as a
sum of partitioned quantities:

   (1) within-run precision

   (2) between-run precision

   (3) within-day precision

   (4) day-to-day (between-day) precision

   Sec 4.2 -- use only a single lot of both reagents, calibration materials,
              and controls (QC materials).  Mixing lots just adds another
   nuisance variable.  Plan the amount to be used.

   Sec 4.3 -- Attempt to simulate the matrix for the test; measuring
              an aqueous solution of enzyme is not really the same as
   measuring enzyme in serum or CSF or urine.

   Use at least 2 concentrations of the analyte.  They ideally should
   be concentrations above and below the level at which a clincal diagnosis
   or medical decision is made, or should span the analytic range.

   Sec 4.4 -- At least 20 separate days of testing should be conducted
              for an accurate appraisal of long term precision.

   During each day the following testing protocol is followed:

      (1) 2 runs or batches are run.

      (2) Runs rejected because of QC analysis shows it out of control
          or because of operating difficulty should be re-run.

      (3) Duplicate analyses should be done for each concentration
          within the run or batch

      (4) Each run should contain results from standard QC samples,
          as implied in item 2, to show the run is in control, and that
          control is also long-term

      (5) The order of analysis of test samples and QC samples should
          be changed for each run.  If possible the operator can be
          blinded to what the samples might contain.

      (6) Don't just run the test and QC materials in a single run;
          if possible, include at least 10 patient samples in the test run.

      (7) The second daily run for precision should not be done immediately
          after the first.  Separate the runs by at least 2 hours.

   Sec 4.5 -- maintain a written record of raw data, including date
              (perhaps time too), and lot numbers of reagents, calibrators,
              and QC samples used.  'Written' can be interpreted as
              'recorded electronically in a database' as well.

   Sec 4.6 -- QC Maintenance is essential for run data to be considered
              acceptable.  Run data shown to be out of control cannot
   be acceptable for precision estimations.  Record the number of
   acceptable runs used to calculate the precision with the number of
   (total) consecutive runs required to achieve the estimate;  the difference
   will therefore be the number of rejected runs.  Also indicate the ordinal
   of the runs in these group of consecutive runs in which the run data
   was used for the precision calculation.  Look at the following two
   sets of ordinal run data:

                               1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3
   Trial 1   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

   Rejected    X     X X     X   X       X     X   X     X     X
   
   
                               1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3
   Trial 2   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

   Rejected      X X   X X X   X                 X
   

   In trial 1, 30 consecutive runs were required to achieve the minimum 20
   called for in experim. design.  And it can be seen that loss of control
   was quite regular in pattern.

   In trial 2, only 27 runs were required, and there appears to be a point
   at which loss of control occurred early and consistently, but control
   was re-gained later.

   Sec 4.7 -- Computations

   Within-Run Precision Estimate (Swr) -- equal to the square root of
   sum of the squared differences between replicate 1 and replicate 2
   on run J on day I, this sum divided by 4 times the number of days
   of the experiment:
                         ________________________
                        / I   2               2
                       /  ä   ä  (X    - X   )
             S   =    /  i=1 j=1   ij     ij
              wr     /               1      2
                    /   __________________________
                \  /
                 \/              4I


       I = number of days of experiment  (usu. 20)

       j = run number in a day (1 or 2)

       X    = result of replicate 1 on run j or day i
        ij
          1


   Cannot be used for runs in which only sample is tested in a run.  Instead
   use this formula:



   Total Precision Estimate (S ) --
                              T


   This is calculated from a partition of the within-run, between-run,
   and day-to-day precision estimates, weighted appropriately to reflect
   the more important factors.  In addition to Swr, calculate two more
   parameters:
                          _______________________
                         /
                        /   I   _î     _î  2
                       /    ä  (X    - X  )
                      /    i=1   i      i
          A =        /            1      2
                    /   _______________________
                \  /
                 \/              2I


       I = number of days with two runs ( ~ 20 )

       _î
       X    = average the duplicate results of run 1 on day i
        i
         1


                          _______________________
                         /
                        /   I   _d     _t  2
                       /    ä  (X    - X  )
                      /    i=1   i      i
          B =        /                      
                    /   _______________________
                \  /
                 \/            I - 1


       I = number of days with two runs ( ~ 20 )

       _d
       X    = average of results for a single day i
        i
          

       _t
       X    = average of all results over all days
        i

    A is the square root of the square of the difference of the first
    run analysis mean and second run analysis for each day, summed over
    all days, then divided by 2I.
