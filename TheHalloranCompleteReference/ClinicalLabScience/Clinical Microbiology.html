<!-- =====  CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY   ====================================== -->

<hr>

<h2>Bacteria</h2>
<p>
Bacteria are unicellular organisms that lack a true nucleus and nuclear
membrane. The lack of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi bodies 
also differentiates the prokaryotic bacteria from eukaryotes. The bacterial 
genome is a single, closed, circular chromosome of double-stranded DNA called 
the nucleoid. Plasmids are small circular molecules of extrachromosomal 
circular DNA. Antibiotic resistance is often encoded by genes located on 
plasmids. Chromosomal or plasmid gene exchange via transformation, transduction,
 or conjugation are means of genetic recombination. Reproduction of bacteria is 
achieved by <b>binary fission</b>, a means of asexual reproduction. Prokaryotes 
do not reproduce sexually. Energy generation of bacteria is cytoplasmic 
membrane-associated via the electron transport chain.
<p>
Bacteria usually range in size from 0.2-2 &micro;m in diameter and 1-6 &micro;m
in length. The four basic morphological types are cocci (spherical-shaped cells),
bacilli (rod-shaped cells), spirilla (spiral-shaped cells), and <i>Vibrio</i>s
(comma-shaped cells) (see figure).
<p>

alt="basic morphology of bacteria">
<p>
Prokaryotic bacteria have three major nutritional needs for growth.
<ol>
<li>A source of carbon is needed for the synthesis of cellular constituents
<li>A source of nitrogen is necessary for the synthesis of protein
<li>Energy (ATP) is needed for cellular functions
</ol>
<p>
The optimum pH for the growth of most bacteria is 7.0 to 7.5. Acidophiles grow
at an acidic pH and alkaliphiles grow optimally at an alkaline pH. A wide range
of growth temperatures facilitate the growth of bacteria. The optimum growth
temperature for most human bacterial pathogens is 35&deg;C to 37&deg;C, the
temperature of the human body.
<p>
Bacteria may be classified based on the atmospheric requirement for the growth.
<ul>
<li>obligate aerobes require oxygen for growth
<li>aerotolerant aerobes can grow in the presence of oxygen, but grow best in an
anaerobic environment
<li>facultative anaerobes grow in both aerobic and anaerobic environments
<li>obligate anaerobes cannot grow in the presence of oxygen
<li>capnophilic bacteria require concentrations of 5-10% CO<sub>2</sub>
for optimal growth
<li>microaerophilic bacteria grow optimally in a reduced level of oxygen
</ol>
<p>
Metabolism is by two means. <b>Fermentation</b> is an anaerobic process by
which bacteria catabolize carbohydrates to produce energy. The process is 
carried out by both obligate and facultative anaerobes, and the final electron 
acceptor is an organic compound. <b>Respiration</b> (oxidation) is an efficient 
process by which obligate aerobes and facultative anaerobes generate energy. 
Molecular oxygen is the final electron acceptor. Respiration is a more 
efficient mechanism for energy generation than fermentation.

<h2>Bacterial Cell Structure</h2>
<p>
The <b>cell membrane</b> serves as an osmotic barrier and may be a site of
antibiotic action. An intact membrane is essential for bacterial viability.

<p>
Bacteria also have a cell wall.
<p>
<img src="imagesClinLabMedHTML/gram-positive-cell-wall.png"
class="img-right" style="margin-right:-5em;"
alt="Gram positive cell wall">
The most prominent layer of the <b>gram-positive cell wall</b> is the thick, rigid
peptidoglycan layer, the site of action of the penicillins and cephalosporins. 
Teichoic and lipoteichoic acids are unique to the gram-positive cell wall 
(see figure).
<p>
<img src="imagesClinLabMedHTML/gram-negative-cell-wall.png"
class="img-left" style="margin-left:-10em;"
alt="Gram negative cell wall">
More complex than the gram-positive cell wall, the <b>gram-negative cell wall</b>
contains a thinner peptidoglycan layer, but also an outer lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) layer. LPS is an endotoxin that is an important virulence factor. An 
endotoxin causes shock, sepsis, fever, disseminated intravascular coagulation 
(DIC), and leukopenia (see figure).
<p>
A <b>polysaccharide capsule</b> covers many bacteria and serves to prevent or
inhibit phagocytosis. For many organisms (e.g., <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>),
the capsule is the chief determinant of virulence.
<p>
<b>Pili</b>, also called <b>fimbriae</b>, are short, hairlike structures that
serve to attach bacteria to target cells. For many bacteria (e.g., <i>Neisseria
gonorrhoeae</i>), interference with attachment prevents infection. The exchange
of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) between bacteria during conjugation occurs
through the pili.
<p>
The presence of <b>flagella</b> determine motility and can be used in classification.
<p>
<b>Endospores</b> are a means of survival that make disease control very
difficult. The two spore-forming genera of importance are <i>Bacillus</i> and
<i>Clostridium</i>.

<h2>Stains</h2>
<p>
The <b>Gram's stain</b> is a fundamental property of bacteria. <b>Crystal
violet</b> is the primary stain. <b>Iodine</b> binds the crystal violet to the
cell wall (mordant). Decolorizer washes out any unbound dye. <b>Safranin O</b>
is a counterstain. Gram-positive cells retain the crystal violet and stain
purple. Gram-negative cells are decolorized, retain the safranin O counterstain,
and stain red or pink.
<p>
Gram's stain is especially useful for examining smears of clinical specimens.
Initial treatment, and often a presumptive identification, can be made from
Gram's stain results. White and red blood cells (WBCs and RBCs), as well as
cellular debris, stain pink. This can serve as an internal control.
<p>
<b>Acridine orange</b> stain is an orange fluorescent stain used to detect
bacteria in body fluids in which numbers of bacteria may be few (e.g., blood 
and spinal fluid). The stain can also be used to detect bacteria in direct 
smears with excess cellular debris. It is very sensitive and can detect small 
numbers of bacteria that are living or dead. The procedure consists of flooding 
a methanol-fixed smear with acridine orange for 2 minutes, washing, and then 
observing with a fluorescence microscope (see Web Color Image 7-6).
<p>
<b>Methylene blue</b> stain is especially helpful for demonstrating
metachromatic granules and characteristic morphology of <i>Corynebacterium</i>
diphtheriae from Loeffler coagulated serum medium. The procedure consists of
flooding a fixed smear with methylene blue, followed by washing (see Web Color
Image 7-7).
<p>
<b>Acid-fast stain</b> is used to detect organisms that do not stain well with
other conventional stains (e.g., <i>Mycobacterium</i> spp., <i><i>Nocardia</i></i>, <i>
 <i>Actinomyces</i></i>). These organisms have a high lipid content in their cell
walls. Once stained, they are very resistant to decolorization by acid alcohol.
The most commonly used method is a carbolfuchsin stain, the <b>modified Kinyoun
stain</b>. The primary stain is carbolfuchsin, which contains a surface-active
detergent to facilitate penetration of the stain without heating. After washing,
 methylene blue is used as a counterstain. Acid-fast organisms appear red
against a blue background. The <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> is a carbolfuchsin stain
that utilizes heat to drive the stain into the mycobacterial cell wall (see Web
Color Image 7-8).
<p>
<b>Auramine-rhodamine stain</b> is a fluorescent stain that detects mycolic
acids and can be used for staining acid-fast organisms. The smear is stained 
with auramine-rhodamine, decolorized with acid alcohol, and then flooded with 
potassium permanganate. It is observed with a fluorescence microscope. The 
cells appear yellow against a dark background (see Web Color Image 7-9).
<p>
<b>Calcofluor white stain</b> binds specifically to chitin, which is found in
fungal cell walls. It is used to detect yeast cells and hyphae in skin 
scrapings and other specimens. The fungal elements appear green or blue-white 
(see Web Color Image 7-10).

<h2>Normal Flora</h2>
<p>
This describes the microorganisms that are frequently found on or in the bodies
of healthy persons.
<p>
The general characteristic of normal flora are:
<ul>
<li>local conditions select for those organisms that are suited for growth in a
particular area.
<li>resident flora colonize an area for months or years.
<li>transient flora are present at a site temporarily.
<li>organisms that live at the expense of the host are parasites.
<li>organisms that benefit the host are symbionts.
<li>commensals have a neutral effect on the host.
<li>a carrier harbors the organism without manifesting symptoms, but is capable
of transmitting infection (carrier state).
<li>opportunists are organisms that do not normally cause infection, but can do
so if the condition of the host changes (e.g., immunosuppression).
</ul>
<p>
The normal flora of the skin describes a wide variety of microorganisms that
are not eliminated by washing or superficial antisepsis. <i><i>Propionibacterium</i>
acnes</i> colonizes the sebaceous glands. <i>Micrococcus</i>, <i>
Staphylococcus</i> spp., and <b>diphtheroids</b> are common. Intact skin is an
effective barrier to microbial invasion.
<p>
The mouth contains large numbers of bacteria, most commonly <i>Streptococcus</i>
spp. (especially <i>viridans</i> species), coagulase-negative
<i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Peptostreptococcus</i>, and other anaerobes.
<p>
The respiratory tract beyond the oropharynx is normally sterile. The ciliary
action of epithelial cells and mucus movement remove invading organisms. The 
nose and nasopharynx contain <i><i>Staphylococcus aureus</i></i>, <i>S. epidermidis</i>,
and <i>Streptococcus</i> spp. The following may be present transiently during 
community outbreaks of infection: <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, <i>
Haemophilus influenzae</i>, and <i><i>Neisseria meningitidis</i></i>. The normal flora 
in the oropharynx mirrors that of the mouth.
<p>
Most microorganisms are destroyed in the stomach due to the acidic pH. The
survivors multiply in the colon. More than 90% of the microbial population is 
comprised of anaerobes. Alteration of the normal flora by antibiotics may allow 
a superinfection by <i>Clostridium difficile</i> (necrotizing enterocolitis), 
<i>Candida albicans</i>, or <i><i>S. aureus</i></i>. The most commonly found organisms 
in the gastrointestinal tract are: <i>Bacteroides</i> spp., <i>Clostridium</i> 
spp., <i><i>Eubacterium</i></i> spp., anaerobic streptococci, <i>Enterococcus</i> spp.,
 and Enterobacteriaceae.
<p>
In the genitourinary tract, the outermost segment of the urethra is colonized
by skin organisms. The vagina is colonized with <i><i>Lactobacillus</i></i>, anaerobic 
gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, and gram-positive cocci.


<h2>Pathogenesis Of Infection</h2>
<p>
The host has resistance to infection and colonization of microorganisms.
<b>Innate immunity</b>, or <b>natural immunity</b>, is a nonspecific mechanism of
resistance to disease. Physical barriers such as the skin, mucous membranes,
and cilia help prevent the invasion of pathogenic bacteria. The cleansing
action of fluids in the eyes, respiratory, digestive, urinary, and genital
tracts are also effective host resistance mechanisms. Antimicrobial substances
such as secretory IgA, lysozyme, B-lysins, and interferon are produced in the
human host. Phagocytosis, inflammation, and complement activation are also
important nonspecific defense mechanisms of the innate immunity.
<p>
Indigenous microbial flora compete with invading bacteria for colonization sites,
as well as produce inhibitory bacteriocins.
<p>
<b>Acquired or specific immunity</b> develops in response to a specific foreign
antigen (e.g., invading bacterium). Acquired immunity may be active (a response
to immunization or disease) or passive (through placental transfer or infusions
of serum or plasma). The humoral response involves antibody production by B
lymphocytes. Cell-medicated immunity involves cells, such as macrophages,
cytokines, and T lymphocytes. The cellular response provides immunity against
intracellular pathogens, including viruses, fungi, and mycobacteria.
<p>

For a pathogen to be successful, the degree of pathogenicity of a microorganism
is directly related to its virulence.  A virulent strain is characterized by its
ability to evade or overcome host defenses and cause disease. Microbial 
virulence factors include adhesions, capsular polysaccharides, and production 
of extracellular toxins and enzymes that may cause damage to the host.
<p>
An appropriate portal of entry is necessary for successful transmission of
disease. For example, respiratory pathogens enter the respiratory tract via 
inhalation of aerosolized respiratory secretions. Gastrointestinal pathogens 
enter the GI tract via ingestion of contaminated food and water.
<p>
A sufficient infective dose is needed for a microorganism to be able to
cause disease in its host. Some organisms can establish an infection with a 
relatively low infective dose (e.g., <i>Shigella</i>), whereas others require a much 
higher infective dose to cause infection (e.g., <i>Salmonella</i>).
<p>
A successful pathogen must be able to overcome the host resistance
mechanisms, including the immune responses, and cause disease in a susceptible 
host.
<p>
For continued transmission of disease, pathogenic microorganisms must be able
to leave the host via an appropriate portal of exit. For most pathogens, it is
the same as the portal of entry.
<p>
Airborne transmission involves the respiratory spread of infectious disease
via aerosolized respiratory secretions or contact with contaminated inanimate 
objects or fingers and hands.
<p>
Ingestion of contaminated food and water is the usual means for transmission
of gastrointestinal infections. Infection can also occur via the fecal-oral 
route.
<p>
Sexual transmission is the route of infection for venereal diseases. Some
diseases can be also transmitted via skin-to-skin contact or via direct 
transfer of saliva (e.g., kissing).
<p>
Animal and human bites can result in serious wound infections, usually
caused by mouth flora. Rabies is an example of a viral infection transmitted 
from an animal bite. Opportunistic pathogens, including environmental bacteria, 
can enter the human via cuts and trauma wounds.
<p>
Arthropod vectors, such as ticks, fleas, and mites, are responsible for the
transmission of diseases such as malaria, Lyme disease, plague, Rocky Mountain 
spotted fever, and hemorrhagic fevers. The infectious agent multiplies in the 
arthropod and is transmitted when the arthropod feeds off a human host.
<p>
Zoonoses are diseases of animals that are transmitted to humans.
Transmission is usually via contact with infected animals, animal secretions, 
or animal products. Zoonoses can also be transmitted via animal bites or 
arthropod vectors.

<h2>Collection And Handling Of Clinical Specimens</h2>

<h3>Collection</h3>
<p>
A properly collected specimen is absolutely crucial to quality diagnostic
information and patient care. With respect to safety, universal precautions are
followed throughout the collection and handling process. Persons collecting or
handling specimens should wear gloves and a laboratory coat. Eye protection
should also be worn if splashing is a potential hazard. Accidents or injuries
must be reported immediately.
<p>
General guidelines

<ul>
<li>The specimen should be from the infection site and not contaminated by the
surrounding area (e.g., culture within a wound and not the surface or the
surrounding skin).
<li>Whenever possible, the specimen should be collected before antimicrobials
are administered.
<li>Appropriate collection devices and containers should be used and must be
sterile. Aseptic technique is required.
<li>The specimen container should be labeled with the patient's identification,
the date and time of collection, and the source of specimen.
</ul>

<p>
Collection of specimens from various body sites is specified:

<ul>
<li><b>Throat</b>. The tongue should be depressed before swabbing between the
tonsillar pillars and behind the uvula. The cheek, tongue, and teeth should not 
be touched.
<li>Nasopharynx. A flexible wire nasopharyngeal swab should be gently inserted
through the nose into the posterior nasopharynx, rotated, and then removed.
<li><b>Sputum</b>. Whenever possible, the patient should gargle with water (not
mouthwash) immediately before sampling. Early morning specimens are best.
Expectorated specimens from a deep cough should be collected into a sterile
specimen cup.
<li><b>Stool</b> should be collected in a clean, wide-mouthed container with a
tight-fitting lid. If the specimen cannot be plated within 1 hour of collection,
 it should be mixed with a transport medium (e.g., buffered glycerol saline,
Cary-Blair transport medium). The change in pH and temperature over time is
detrimental to <i><i>Shigella</i></i> spp. Stool specimens should never be taken from
the toilet and should not be contaminated with urine. Commercial systems with
preservatives are available for collection of specimens for both bacterial
culture and ova and parasite examination.
<li><b>Urine</b>. Midstream clean-catch is the most common collection method.
Proper cleansing of the urethral area is important, especially in women. The 
first few milliliters, which flush out the urethra, are discarded. The specimen 
should be collected into a sterile specimen cup and transported immediately to 
the laboratory or refrigerated, because contaminants grow readily at room 
temperature. Cultures of catheterized urine specimens usually have less 
contaminating bacterial flora.
<li><b>Blood</b>. Two to three cultures should be collected at random times
during a 24-hour period. Collecting more than three sets of cultures in a
24-hour period does not significantly increase the probability of detecting
bacteremia. Skin is disinfected with 70% alcohol, followed by iodine. The
disinfectant is allowed to dry. The puncture site should not be palpated after
disinfection. Ideally, 20 to 30 mL of blood per culture is collected from an
adult (1-5 mL from infants and small children). Iodine should be cleaned from
the puncture site with alcohol following the venipuncture.
<li><b>Cerebrospinal fluid</b> should be collected aseptically by a physician.
This specimen should be processed immediately and not exposed to heat or
refrigeration.
<li><b>Abscess aspirates</b> or <b>exudates</b>, as well as <b>synovial</b>, <b>
pericardial</b>, and <b>chest fluid</b> should be collected by a physician with
a needle and syringe. The use of swabs may inhibit growth of anaerobes or
increase the likelihood of contamination with indigenous bacteria flora from
adjacent tissues (e.g., mucous membranes or superficial skin surfaces). Care
should be taken not to inject an air bubble into the syringe.
<li><b>Genital tract</b>:
 <ul>
 <li><b>Men</b>. Exudates may be expressed from the urethral orifice or a
small-diameter swab may be inserted 3 to 4 cm into the urethra. The specimen 
should be plated immediately on the appropriate media and not allowed to dry or 
be exposed to cold temperatures. A direct Gram's stain smear should be prepared.
 <li><b>Women</b>. Cervical specimens are obtained by a physician with the
aid of a speculum. Lubricants, which may be lethal to <i><i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i></i>,
should not be used on the speculum. The cervical mucus plug is removed, and a
sterile swab is inserted into the cervix, rotated, and allowed to remain for
a few seconds.   The specimen should be plated immediately to the appropriate
media, and swabs should not be refrigerated, as refrigeration may be lethal
to genital pathogens.  A smear for Gram's stain should be prepared from the
specimen.
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Handling</h3>
<p>
Transport all specimens to the laboratory promptly. Anaerobic specimens must
be transported in an anaerobic transport system. If transport cannot occur 
immediately, most specimens can be held at 2-8&deg;C. Exceptions to 
this include specimens that likely contain temperature-sensitive organisms
(e.g., <i>Neisseria</i>), blood culture bottles, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
<p>
Generally, swabs are the least desirable collection and transport method.
However, organisms can be successfully cultured if the swab is handled and
transported properly (i.e., not allowed to dry out). Swabs are inappropriate
for culturing anaerobes, although in some clinical settings, <b>culturettes</b>
are often used. If swabs are used for the culture of anaerobes, is essential
that an anaerobic culturette be used. Use of aerobic culturettes for the
culture of anaerobes is criteria for specimen rejection.
<p>
In processing the specimens, selection of proper media is essential. Some
general principles apply to the use of primary plating media. In most cases,
the concern is that the primary media will grow and isolate all or a majority
of the possible organisms from a clinical specimen. In those cases in which
certain organisms are excluded, the decision of what media is used is based on
time, cost, and probability of isolation information. In many cases, the choice
of primary media is an individual laboratory choice. Selective and differential
media may be used in addition to all-purpose and enriched agars. These
specialized media are used for selective recovery and preliminary
differentiation of specific bacteria. It is especially important that the
microbiologist understands the range and purpose of each primary isolation
medium, as well as the various reactions of the organisms, since individual
organism groups may react differently on specific media.
<ul>
<li>Most isolation protocols call for the use of blood agar (with 5% sheep RBC).
<li>Chocolate agar is used for fastidious isolates.
<li>Specialized media [e.g., mannitol salt agar, bismuth sulfite agar, <i>Campylobacter</i>
agar, thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose (TCBS) agar] are used when specific
organisms are suspected.
<li>Substitutions may be made with acceptable results (e.g., MacConkey agar in
place of Eosin Methylene Blue agar).
<li>Prereduced anaerobically sterilized (PRAS) culture media is recommended
for the culture of anaerobes (see anaerobe section).
</ul>
<p>
<b>Incubation</b> conditions will vary.
<p>
The normal incubation temperature for bacterial cultures is 35-37&deg;C.
Culture plates may be incubated in ambient air, but incubation in an
capnophilic atmosphere of 5% to 10% CO<sub>2</sub> is recommended to enhance
the growth of fastidious bacterial isolates. Anaerobic cultures should be
incubated anaerobically at 35-37&deg;C. Anaerobic bags, jars, or an anaerobic
chamber are appropriate for incubation of anaerobic cultures. The recommended
incubation of stool cultures for isolation of <i><i>Campylobacter jejuni</i></i> is in
a microaerophilic, capnophilic atmosphere at 42-45&deg;C.
<p>
The rejection criteria for specimens should be part of the written policy of
every clinical laboratory. These criteria should be clearly listed and made 
available to anyone who might submit specimens for culture. Processing and 
culture of inappropriate specimens leads to increased costs and misinformation. 
In the event a specimen is rejected, the person submitting the request should 
be contacted and informed. In some cases, the difficulty of collection makes 
culturing necessary, although the results are not optimal.
<p>
The following situations or specimen types should be rejected (this is
not intended to be a comprehensive list):
<ul>
<li>urine or sputum collections more than 24 h old
<li>specimens received in nonsterile or contaminated containers (including those
in which the specimen has leaked out)
<li>specimens contaminated with barium or other foreign substances
<li>culturing of Foley catheter tips
<li>saliva instead of sputum
<li>unrefrigerated urine specimens two hours or more post-collection
<li>anaerobic culturing of midstream urine, upper respiratory tract, superficial
skin, or feces specimens (certain <i>Clostridium</i> species may be appropriately
cultured from feces)
</ul>

<h2>Micrococcaceae</h2>

<h3>General characteristics</h3>

1. Members of the family Micrococcaceae are gram-positive cocci (see Web Color
Image 7-1), aerobic or facultative anaerobes, and catalase-positive (except 
<i>Stomatococcus</i>).
<p>
The <b>catalase test</b> differentiates the Micrococcaceae from the
gram-positive, catalase-negative Streptococcaceae. Catalase converts hydrogen 
peroxide is converted to water and oxygen. The observation of vigorous bubbling 
when the bacterium is mixed with a drop of 3% hydrogen peroxide is a positive 
test (see Web Color Image 7-11).
<p>
Most Micrococcaceae are members of the indigenous flora and are commonly
isolated from a wide variety of diseases.

<h4><i>Staphylococcus</i></h4>
<p>
The staphylococci are catalase-positive, nonmotile, facultative anaerobes that
are normal inhabitants of the skin and mucous membranes. These organisms 
commonly cause human infections. The species in the genus are initially 
differentiated by the coagulase test (see Web Color Images 7- 12 and 7-13). The 
most important coagulase-positive species is <i><i>S. aureus</i></i>. Some animal 
species produce coagulase, but are rarely isolated from human samples.
Staphylococci that do not produce coagulase are called <q>coagulase-negative
staphylococci.</q> The most prominent species are <i>S. epidermidis</i> and
<i>S. saprophyticus</i>.

<h4><i>Micrococcus</i></h4>
<p>
Micrococci are opportunistic pathogens found only in immunocompromised persons.
<i>Micrococcus</i> is of low pathogenic significance, but may be isolated as a
contaminant or as part of the normal flora.

<h4><i>Stomatococcus</i></h4>
<p>
This genus is part of the normal oral flora and is rarely isolated from
infection. The colonies adhere strongly to the agar surface.

<h3><i><i>Staphylococcus aureus</i></i></h3>
This species of Staphylococcus is a pathogne in many diseases and conditions.
<p>
Skin and wound infections caused by <b><i>S. aureus</i></b> are suppurative and
pyogenic. Some common skin infections are boils, carbuncles, furuncles, and
folliculitis.
<p>
Staphylococcal<b> enterotoxins A</b> and <b>D</b> are associated with food
poisoning. The source of contamination is usually an infected food handler. 
Infection occurs when an individual ingests food contaminated with 
enterotoxin-producing strains. The heat-stable toxins are preformed in the food. 
Symptoms appear rapidly (2-6 hours after ingestion) and resolve within 8 to 10 
hours. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, and 
severe cramping.
<p>
<b>Scalded skin syndrome (Ritter's disease)</b> is an extensive exfoliative
dermatitis that occurs primarily in newborns and is caused by staphylococcal <b>
exfoliative or epidermolytic toxin</b>. It can also occur in adults, most
frequently among those who have chronic renal failure or are immunocompromised.
The mortality rate is low in children but high in adults.
<p>
<b>Toxic shock syndrome (TSS)</b> is a multisystem disease characterized by
high fever, rash, hypotension, shock, desquamation of the hands and feet, and 
possible death. The etiologic agent is a stain of <i><i>S. aureus</i></i> that 
produces <b>enterotoxin F [toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)]</b>. There is 
an association between the use of tampons and TSS, although the disease may 
occur in both sexes if a toxin-producing strain of <i><i>S. aureus</i></i> has caused 
infection.
<p>
Other staphylococcal infections include staphylococcal <b>pneumonia</b>
secondary to influenza can occur. The mortality rate is high.  In addition
<b>osteomyelitis</b> can occur secondary to bacteremia.
<p>
Other than the toxins associated with specific infections (e.g., exfoliative
toxin, enterotoxins A and D, TSST-1), other toxins and enzymes are also
virulence factors of <i><i>S. aureus</i></i>. <b>Coagulase</b> is the major virulence
marker of the species. <b>Protein A</b> is a cellular component in the cell
wall that helps the bacterium avoid phagocytosis. <b>Alpha and beta
hemolysins</b> cause the hemolysis of RBCs. In addition, <b>hyaluronidase</b>
prevents the spread of infection and <b>lipase</b> facilitates colonization of
the bacterium on the skin surface.

<p>

<b>Laboratory identification of <i><i>Staphylococcus aureus</i></i></b>. Microscopic
examination of stained smears from clinical specimens can be especially helpful.
Numerous gram-positive cocci with polymorphonuclear cells are usually seen. <i>
<i>S. aureus</i></i> grows readily on common laboratory media. On sheep blood agar, 
colonies appear as round, smooth and white or pigmented (yellow-orange). They 
are usually &beta;-hemolytic. (See Web Color Image 7-14.) <i><i>S. aureus</i></i> is 
most often identified by the coagulase test. Isolates may show cellbound 
(clumping factor) or free (extracellular) coagulase. Cell-bound coagulase is 
identified by mixing the suspected organism with a drop of rabbit plasma on a 
glass slide. (See Web Color Image 7-12.) If clumping occurs, the isolate 
demonstrates cell-bound coagulase and is identified as <i><i>S. aureus</i></i>. 
Isolates that do not clump are tested for free coagulase by the tube method 
(see Web Color Image 7-13), in which the organism is mixed with 0.5 mL of rabbit 
plasma, and following incubation at 37&deg;C for 4 hours, is observed for clot 
formation. Selective media that can be used to isolate <i><i>S. aureus</i></i> from 
heavily contaminated specimens or when it is the only isolate of concern are 
mannitol salt agar (MSA), phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) blood agar, and 
Columbia-naladixic acid Agar (CNA).
<p>
<b>MSA</b> provides mannitol as a fermentable carbohydrate source as well as 6.
5% sodium chloride (NaCl). Generally, only <i>Staphylococcus</i> species grow 
on this medium because of the high salt content. <i>S. aureus</i> ferments the 
mannitol to produce acid, which turns the pink agar yellow. The colonies are 
identified by a yellow halo. This test is presumptive because some strains of 
<i>S. epidermidis</i> and few other species can also ferment mannitol.
<p>
PEA and CNA agars both inhibit the growth of gram-negative organisms, whereas
the gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus species, grow well.
Five-percent sheep blood is incorporated in the medium for additional
enrichment and detection of hemolytic reactions.
<p>
Rapid methods make use of plasma-coated latex particles. The plasma detects
clumping factor and causes agglutination of the particles. Protein A in the
cell wall of <i>S. aureus</i> (with IgG) may also be detected with rapid methods.
Other species that produce clumping factor produce positive reactions, but are
tube-coagulasenegative.


<h4>Coagulase-negative Staphylococci</h4>
<p>
The coagulase-negative staphylococci are found as normal flora in humans and
animals. The incidence of infection by these organisms has increased. They are 
often hospital-acquired (nosocomial). Predisposing factors include 
catheterization, prosthetic device implants, and immunosuppressive therapy. The 
most common species isolated from clinical infections are <i>S. epidermidis</i> 
and <i>S. saprophyticus</i>. <i>S. saprophyticus</i> has been associated with 
UTIs in young, sexually active women. Other species of coagulase-negative 
staphylococci are not isolated frequently. Three species that can cause a wide 
range of infections, but do so only occasionally, are <i>S. haemolyticus</i>, 
<i>S. lugdunensis</i>, and <i>S. schleiferi</i>. The latter two produce 
clumping factor and may yield a positive slide coagulase test.
<p>
Laboratory identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci is done as follows:
<ul>
<li>on sheep blood agar, colonies are usually round, smooth, and white without
hemolysis. (See Web Color Image 7-15.)
<li>the most common isolates are <i>S. epidermidis</i> and <i>S. saprophyticus</i>.
<li>urine isolates that are coagulase-negative are further tested to
presumptively identify <i>S. saprophyticus</i>. This is done by testing for
novobiocin susceptibility using a 5-mg novobiocin disk. <i>S. saprophyticus</i>
is resistant to novobiocin, whereas other coagulase-negative staphylococci are
susceptible.
<li>species identification of the coagulase-negative staphylococci requires
differentiation using many biochemical tests. Various commercial identification
systems exist and may be used if appropriate.
</ul>

<h4><i>Micrococcus</i> species</h4>
<p>
<i>Micrococcus</i> species are environmental organisms, as well as normal skin
flora. They may also be normal flora in the respiratory tract or other sites in
the body, and are common contaminants. These coagulase-negative, gram-positive
opportunists can easily be differentiated from the <i>Staphylococcus</i>
species.
<p>
Laboratory identification of <i>Micrococcus</i> species is as follows:
<ul>
<li>The <b>modified oxidase test</b> uses a reagent (6% tetramethylphenylene
diamine hydrochloride in dimethyl sulfoxide), added to a small amount of
growth smeared onto a filter paper. Micrococci are modified oxidase-positive
and turn dark blue within 2 minutes.
<li>Is there bacitracin susceptibility? An isolate is streaked onto a sheep
blood Mueller-Hinton medium. A 40 mU bacitracin disk is placed onto the
streaked area, and the plate is incubated overnight and observed for a zone of
inhibition. Micrococci are susceptible to bacitracin.
<li><b>Furazolidone</b> susceptibility is tested exactly as for bacitracin
susceptibility, except a disk containing 100-&micro;g furazolidone is used. 
Micrococci are resistant to furazolidone. (See Web Color Image 7-16.)
</ul>

<h4>Antibiotic susceptibility</h4>

1. Penicillin resistance is often so high, especially in <i>S. aureus</i> isolates
(85% to 90%), that other antibiotics must often be used. There is variability
in the susceptibility patterns.

2. A common resistance mechanism of the staphylococci is a production of &beta;
-lactamase, an enzyme that inactivates the B-lactam antibiotics.

3. Various &beta;-lactamase resistant penicillins have been developed.
Methicillin is the most frequently used. Oxacillin is used for in vitro
susceptibility testing of methicillin resistance.

4. Methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S.
epidermidis (MRSE) have increased in number. These may also be referred to as
oxacillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (ORSA) and oxacillin-resistant S. epidermidis
(ORSE), respectively. Vancomycin has been used as an alternative treatment of
methicillin-resistant strains. However, vancomycin resistance is increasing.
MRSA are etiologic agents of serious nosocomial and community-associated
infections. The increased virulence of this bacterium is a major concern of
physicians, epidemiologists, and the health care community.

<h2>Streptococcus, Enterococcus, And Related Genera</h2>
<p>
The organisms included in this group are catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci
(old cells may stain gram-negative or gram-variable) that are arranged in pairs
or chains (see Web Color Image 7-2) and are facultative anaerobes. Growth
requirements may be complex, and the use of blood or enriched medium is
necessary for isolation. Their role in human disease ranges from
well-established and common, to rare but increasing.

<h3><i>Streptococcus</i></h3>

<h4><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i></h4>
<p>
<i>S. pneumoniae</i> is often part of the normal flora of the respiratory tract.
The key virulence factor is an antiphagocytic capsule. There are approximately
80 antigenic types.
<p>
<i>S. pneumoniae</i> is an important human pathogen, causing pneumonia,
sinusitis, otitis media, bacteremia, and meningitis. It is frequently isolated
as a pathogen and as a member of the normal respiratory flora. Direct smears
often reveal leukocytes and numerous gram-positive cocci in pairs. The ends of
the cells are slightly pointed, giving them an oval or lancet shape. (See Web
Color Image 7-20.)
<p>
Complex media, such as brain-heart infusion agar, trypticase soy agar with 5%
sheep blood, or chocolate agar are necessary for good growth. Isolates may require
increased CO2 for growth during primary isolation. Colonies are &alpha;-hemolytic.
Young cultures produce a round, glistening, wet, mucoid, dome-shaped appearance.
<p>
Laboratory identification. <i>S. pneumoniae</i> is susceptible to optochin
(ethylhydrocuprein hydrochloride). (See Web Color Image 7-21.) The bile
solubility test is also used for identification. An &alpha;-hemolytic
streptococcus that is optochinsusceptible or bile-soluble can be identified as
<i>S. pneumoniae</i>. Other &alpha;-hemolytic streptococci are negative for
both tests. Capsular subtypes of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> are detected using the
Quellung test, a microscopic <q>precipitin test</q> in which the capsules
surrounding the pneumococci appear to swell. (See Web Color Image 7-22.)

<h4><i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i></h4>
<p>
The cell wall contains the Lancefield group A carbohydrate. This organism is
also referred to as group A streptococcus or &beta;-hemolytic group A
streptococcus.
<p>
Several virulence factors are known for <i>S. pyogenes</i>.
<ul>
<li>The most well-defined virulence factor is <b>M protein</b>. There are more
than 80 different serotypes. Resistance to infection is related to the presence 
of type-specific antibodies to the M protein. The M protein molecule causes the 
streptococcal cell to resist phagocytosis. It enables the bacterial cell to 
adhere to mucosal cells.
<li><b>Streptolysin O</b> causes hemolysis of RBCs. Its role in virulence is
unknown. Antibodies to streptolysin O indicate a recent infection 
(antistreptolysin O titer).
<li><b>Hyaluronidase</b> (spreading factor) may favor the spread of the
organism through the tissues.
<li>All strains form at least one <b>deoxyribonuclease (DNAse)</b>. The most
common is <b>DNAse B</b>. These enzymes are antigenic, and antibodies to DNAse 
can be detected following infection.
<li>Some strains of <i>S. pyogenes</i> cause a red spreading rash referred to
as scarlet fever.  This condition is caused by <b>erythrogenic toxin</b>.
<li><b>Protein F</b> is a fibronectin-binding protein that facilitates adhesion
to epithelial cells.
<li><b>Streptokinase</b> causes the lysis of fibrin clots.
</ul>
<p>
There are several different infections caused by <i>S. pyogenes</i>.
<ul>
<li><b>Pharyngitis</b> is one of the most common <i>S. pyogenes</i> infections.
<q>Strep throat</q> is most frequently seen in children between the ages of 5 
and 15 years. Diagnosis relies on a throat culture or a positive quick <q>
strep</q> test, in which group A antigens are detected from a throat swab in a 
matter of minutes. A throat culture is recommended if the antigen-detecting 
test is negative.
<li><b>Skin infections</b> include <b>impetigo</b>, <b>necrotizing fasciitis</b>,
and <b>pyoderma</b>.
<li><b>Scarlet fever</b> is a red rash that appears on the upper chest and
spreads to the trunk and extremities following infection with <i>S. pyogenes</i>.
<li><b>Rheumatic fever</b> and <b>glomerulonephritis</b> may result from
infection at other sites in the body. Damage appears to result from
cross-reactivity of the streptococcal antigens with host tissue antigens.
<li><b>Streptococcal TSS (toxic shock syndrome)</b> is similar to that caused by
<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.
</ul>
<p>

For identifying <i>S. pyogenes</i>, colonies on blood agar are small,
transparent, and smooth, and they show &beta; hemolysis. Gram's stain reveals 
gram-positive cocci with some short chains. The bacterium is susceptible to <b>
bacitracin</b> or <b>Taxo A</b> (see Web Color Image 7-23) and resistant to <b>
SXT</b>. In addition, <i>S. pyogenes</i> hydrolyzes
l-pyrrolidonyl-&beta;-naphthylamide (PYR). A positive test is development of
a red color after the addition of dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde reagent to an
inoculated PYR disk (see Web Color Image 7-24).

<h4><i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i></h4>
<p>
The cell wall contains the <b>Lancefield group B carbohydrate</b>. This
organism is also referred to as <b>group B streptococcus</b>. It may be found 
as normal flora in the genitourinary tract.  Its capsule is the most important
virulence factor. Other factors (e.g., DNAse, hyaluronidase) have not been 
shown to be factors in infection.
<p>
It causes two infections. <b>Neonatal sepsis</b> (usually manifest as pneumonia
or meningitis) occurs soon after birth. The most important factor in infection 
is the presence of group B streptococcus in the vagina of the mother. <b>
Postpartum fever</b> and <b>sepsis</b> may occur after birth and may manifest 
as <b>endometritis</b> or a <b>wound infection</b>.
<p>
Identification may be done on blood agar, seen as grayish white mucoid colonies
surrounded by a small zone of &beta; hemolysis. They are gram positive cocci
that form short chains in clinical specimens and long chains in culture. Group
B streptococci are CAMP test-positive, demonstrating an arrowhead-shaped area of
synergistic hemolysis when streaked perpendicular to a &beta;-hemolytic <i>S.
aureus</i> (see Web Color Image 7-25). Group B streptococci are also hippurate
hydrolysis-positive, resistant to SXT, and PYR-negative.

<h4>Groups C and G</h4>
<p>
There are three hemolytic species in Lancefield group C that are occasionally
isolated from clinical specimens: <i>S. equi</i>, <i>S. zooepidemicus</i>, and 
<i>S. equisimilis</i>. The major species found in group G is <i>S. canis</i>. 
It occasionally causes infection, and is part of the normal skin flora. Minute 
colony types of group G are part of the <i>S. milleri</i> group, with <i>S. 
anginosus</i> being the most prominent species.
<p>
These groups produce a variety of infections similar to those caused by
groups A and B. Group C can cause pharyngitis.
<p>
In the laboratory, Groups C and G can be identified by extensive biochemical
tests. However, serologic tests to identify the group carbohydrate in the cell 
wall of the isolate (e.g., agglutination) are best.

<h4>Group D</h4>
<p>
The group D streptococci include <i>S. bovis</i> and <i>S. equinus</i>. They
may be found as normal intestinal flora.
<p>
The group D streptococci may be etiologic agents of bacterial endocarditis,
UTIs, and other infections, such as abscesses and wound infections. An
association has been made between bacteremia due to <i>S. bovis</i> and the presence
of gastrointestinal tumors. Isolation of <i>S. bovis</i> from a blood culture may be
the first indication that the patient has an occult tumor.
<p>
In the laboratory, hemolysis is usually absent, or &alpha; hemolysis is present.
Key reactions of group D streptococci include a positive bile esculin test 
(formation of a black precipitate due to the hydrolysis of esculin) with no
growth in 6.5% NaCl broth. Group D can be separated from <i>Enterococcus</i> by
the l-pyrrolidonyl- &beta;-naphthylamide (PYR) test because it is negative and
<i>Enterococcus</i> is positive. (The enterococci also grow in 6.5% NaCl broth.)
Serotyping should be done to identify an isolate such as <i>S. bovis</i>,
because it cannot be distinguished from some of the viridans group by
biochemical tests alone.

<h4>Enterococcus</h4>
<p>
This genus is found in the intestinal tract. The species found in this genus
include <i>E. faecalis</i>, which is the most common isolate, <i>E. faecium</i>,
<i>E. avium</i>, and <i>E. durans</i>. These enterococcal species share a 
number of characteristics with the group D streptococci, including the group D
antigen. They show resistance to several of the commonly used antibiotics, so
differentiation from Group D Streptococcus and susceptibility testing is
important.
<p>
The infections caused are similar to those caused by the group D streptococci.
The most common is a urinary tract infection.
<p>
It is not difficult to differentiate between <i>Enterococcus</i> and group D
streptococci. In addition to being positive for bile esculin (black precipitate),
<i>Enterococcus</i> species grow in 6.5% NaCl broth (see Web Color Image 7-26),
are PYR-positive (see Web Color Image 7-24), and SXT-resistant.
<p>
Enterococci may be screened for high-level aminoglycoside resistance because
aminoglycosides are usually used in combination with ampicillin or penicillin
for effective treatment of enterococcal infections. Resistant strains cannot be
used for synergistic treatment. Gentamicin and streptomycin resistance can be
detected with broth or agar dilution and disk diffusion tests.
<p>

The emergence of vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus</i> (VRE), encoded by the
<b><i>vanA</i> gene</b>, is a major concern of physicians, microbiologists, and 
hospital infection control personnel. <i>E. faecium</i> is the most common 
species, followed by <i>E. faecalis</i>. Most microbiology laboratories screen 
for VR colonization using vancomycincontaining agar. Susceptibility testing is 
performed only on clinically significant isolates.

<h4>Viridans streptococci</h4>
<p>
The viridans group includes those &alpha;-hemolytic streptococci that lack
Lancefield group antigens and do not meet the criteria for <i>S. pneumoniae</i>.
They are part of the normal flora of the oropharynx and intestine.
The most common infection caused by these organisms is subacute bacterial
endocarditis.
<p>
The viridans streptococci are fastidious and some strains require increased
CO<sub>2</sub> for growth. Identification of the viridans streptococci to the
species level is a difficult task. Part of the reason for this is that there is
not widespread agreement on a classification scheme. Species of viridans
streptococci include <i>S. mutans</i>, <i>S. salivarius</i>, <i>S. sanguis</i>,
<i>S. mitis</i>, and <i>S. milleri</i> (not &beta; hemolytic).

<h4>Nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS)</h4>
<p>
The NVS subgroup of viridans streptococci are nutritionally deficient and
have been isolated from patients who have endocarditis and otitis media. This
subgroup is also known as pyridoxal (vitamin B6)-dependent, thiol-dependent, or
symbiotic streptococci. Pyridoxal is not present in most liquid and solid
bacteriologic media, so bacteriologic media must be supplemented with pyridoxal
(vitamin B6) to support the growth of NVS. The NVS colonies are small,
measuring 0.2 to 0.5 mm in diameter. When gram-stained, the morphology can vary
from classic gram-positive streptococci to gram-negative or gram-variable
pleomorphic forms.  As the optimal concentrations or required nutrients decrease,
the cells become pleomorphic, even showing globular and filamentous forms.
<p>
NVS satellite around or grow adjacent to staphylococcal isolates. The
staphylococci provide the growth requirements needed to facilitate the growth
of the NVS. A clue to the presence of NVS is a positive Gram's stain, but
negative cultures.

<h4>Treatment</h4>
<p>
Treatment of streptococcal and enterococcal infections. Most species of
Streptococcus are susceptible to penicillin. <i>S. agalactiae</i> is less
susceptible than group A and may require a combination of ampicillin and an
aminoglycoside. Group D is susceptible to penicillin, whereas Enterococcus is
usually resistant. Enterococcus is often treated with a penicilli
n-aminoglycoside combination (synergy). Some isolates are resistant to this
combination therapy. Although most pneumococcal isolates are susceptible to
penicillin, some strains have shown resistance. Resistant streptococcal strains
are often treated with erythromycin. Linezolid is often used for treatment of
infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

<h3>Streptococcus-like organisms</h3>
<p>
<i>Aerococcus</i> is very similar to <i>Enterococcus</i> on blood agar. The
gram-positive coccus is susceptible to vancomycin and can be isolated from 
tissue samples of endocarditis and other varied infections.
<p>
<i>Leuconostoc</i> is very similar to viridans streptococci on blood agar. It
is found in the general environment. A Gram's stain shows gram-positive
coccobacilli in pairs and short chains. <i>Leuconostoc</i> has been found in
patients who have meningitis and endocarditis. It is intrinsically resistant to
vancomycin.
<p>
<i>Pediococcus</i> is also found in the general environment. A Gram's stain
shows gram positive cocci in pairs, tetrads, and clusters. <i>Pediococcus</i> 
is a rare isolate in patients who have septicemia. The bacterium is 
intrinsically resistant to vancomycin.

<h3>Laboratory identification of Streptococci</h3>
<p>
Hemolysis on blood agar is an important characteristic (see table above). (See Web
Color Images 7-17, 7-18, and 7-19.)
<p>
Bile solubility measures autolysis of bacteria under the influence of a bile
salt (sodium deoxycholate). <i>S. pneumoniae</i> is bile soluble.
<p>
<b>Optochin</b> (<b>ethylhydrocuprein hydrochloride</b>) susceptibility is
determined by a zone of inhibition (&gt;14 mm with a 5 &micro;g optochin disk)
after growing the organism on blood agar with a filter paper disk containing
optochin. Results correlate with bile solubility; that is, optochin-susceptible
isolates are bile soluble. <i>S. pneumoniae</i> is optochin-susceptible. (See
Web Color Image 7-21.)
<p>
<b>Bacitracin (Taxo A)</b> susceptibility is a characteristic of <i>S.
pyogenes</i>. The test is performed by placing a filter paper disk containing
bacitracin on an inoculated blood agar plate, and measuring the zone of
inhibition following incubation. (see Web Color Image 7-23.)
<p>
Group A and B streptococci are resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim
(SXT). This resistance can be measured with a filter paper disk or by
incorporating SXT into blood agar. The latter technique allows for selective
isolation. <i>Enterococcus</i> species are also SXT-resistant.
<p>
Group B streptococci hydrolyze hippurate. The glycine liberated can be detected
by triketohydrindene hydrate (Ninhydrin), which imparts a purple color.
<p>
The Christie, Atkins, and Munch-Petersen (CAMP) test presumptively identifies
group B streptococcus by measuring the enhanced hemolytic activity of
staphylococcal &beta;-lysin by S. agalactiae. Group B streptococci, plated
perpendicular to <i>S. aureus</i>, demonstrate a characteristic arrow-shaped
hemolysis pattern. (see Web Color Image 7-25.)
<p>
The ability of an organism to hydrolyze esculin is the basis of the esculin
test. A positive result is a black precipitate in the agar surrounding the
growth. Group D streptococci and Enterococcus are bile esculin positive.
(see Web Color Image 7-26.)
<p>
<i>Enterococcus</i> is able to grow in nutrient broth containing 6.5% NaCl.
(see Web Color Image 7-26.)
<p>
Hydrolysis of PYR can be detected by the development of a red color on the
addition of cinnamaldehyde reagent. This test is specific for <i>
Enterococcus</i> and <i>S. pyogenes</i>. (See Web Color Image 7-24.)
<p>
The LAP test (leucine aminopeptidase) is used to help differentiate <i>
Aerococcus</i> and <i>Leuconostoc</i> from the other <i>Streptococcus</i>
species. Both bacteria are LAP-negative, while other streptococci are
LAP-positive. LAP hydrolyzes the substrate, leucine-B-naphthylamide, to
B-naphthylamine. Development of a red color is detected upon addition of DMACA.
<p>
Serology testing for detection of the C carbodydrate of the cell wall is
used for serogrouping of the &beta;-hemolytic streptococci.

<h2>Aerobic Gram-Positive Bacilli</h2>
<div class="box-right left"> <!-- Box 7-1 -->

<p>
The members of this group that are seen most frequently in the clinical
laboratory are listed in the box at right. Except for <i>Corynebacterium 
diphtheriae</i>, these organisms are of low pathogenicity and usually require 
an immunocompromised host. With the exception of <i>Bacillus</i>, these 
organisms are all pleomorphic rods, and most grow well on standard media.

</div>

<p>
<i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> is widespread in the environment. It causes a
wide variety of infections, especially in neonates, pregnant women, and
immunosuppressed persons.  Meningitis is a common outcome.
It can be isolated from blood, CSF, or swabs of lesions. <i>L. monocytogenes</i>
grows well on blood agar and closely resembles group B streptococcus. Growth
occurs at 4&deg;C. This allows the use of the cold enrichment technique, which
requires inoculation of the specimen into broth medium, followed by incubation
at 4&deg;C for several weeks. This technique has limited clinical importance.
Gram stain shows a gram-positive rod or coccobacillus. (See Web Color Image
7-27.)  The bacterium is catalase-positive, hydrolyzes hippurate and esculin, and is CAMP
test-positive with block hemolysis. (See Web Color Image 7-28) A characteristic
tumbling motility is demonstrated when the organism is grown in broth at room
temperature and umbrella motility is observed in semisolid agar motility medium
following room temperature incubation. (see Web Color Image 7-29.) Identification
of this organism is summarized on the upper left.

<p>
<i>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</i> is an uncommon isolate. It is a
pleomorphic gram-positive bacillus that often forms long filaments (see Web 
Color Image 7-30). The usual route of infection is through the skin. It is 
catalase negative, and forms hydrogen sulfide. The bacterium is nonmotile, but 
produces a characteristic <q>bottle brush</q> extension laterally from the 
streak line in soft gelatin agar (see Web Color Image 7-31).
<p>
The most important species of <i>Corynebacterium</i> are <i>C. diphtheriae</i>,
<i>C. jeikeium</i>, and <i>C. urealyticum</i>. All <i>Corynebacterium</i>
species are pleomorphic, pallisading, gram-positive bacilli and resemble <i>C.
diphtheriae</i> on Gram's stain. The morphology was therefore termed <b>
diphtheroid</b>. The morphology may also be described as picket fence or
Chinese letters (see Web Color Image 7-32).

<table>
<caption>Media Used to Isolate <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i></caption>
<tr><th>Media   <th>Reaction
<tr><td>cystine-tellurite agar <td>colonies are black or gray
<tr><td>Tinsdale's agar <td>colonies are dark brown-to-black with brown-to-black halos

</table>
<p>
<i>C. diphtheriae</i> is the cause of diphtheria. The disease has a
presentation of local inflammation of the throat with a pseudomembrane caused 
by dead cells and exudate. The diphtheria toxin damages major organ systems and 
results in a high mortality rate when infected persons go untreated. Diphtheria 
occurs in nonimmunized populations. Treatment is with an antitoxin.
<p>
Laboratory diagnosis consists of culture and testing for toxin production.
Media that have been developed for the growth and identification of <i>C.
diphtheriae</i> are summarized in the table below. Suspicious colonies from
cystine-tellurite or Tinsdale's agar are gram stained. Catalase and urease
tests are performed on gram-positive rods with diphtheroid morphology.
(Loeffler's agar can be used to enhance the pleomorphic microscopic morphology
of the gram-positive rods.). Urease negative isolates are presumptively
identified as <i>C. diphtheriae</i>.

production by an isolate using an antitoxin-impregnated filter paper strip that
is laid perpendicular to lines of bacterial growth. Precipitin lines are formed
if the test stain of <i>C. diphtheriae</i> is a toxigenic strain.
<p>
<i>C. jeikeium</i> (group JK) is an extremely virulent organism. It may cause
infections following implantation of prosthetic devices, and it is resistant to
a wide range of antibiotics. This organism is suspected in those patients who
are immunocompromised or have undergone invasive procedures or in whom an
isolate with typical diphtheroid morphology is found.
<p>
<i><i>C. urealyticum</i></i> is a urinary pathogen that is slow growing (48
hours) and strongly urease positive. Urease production occurs within minutes
following inoculation on a urea slant.
<p>
The lesion that is formed develops a characteristic center of necrosis,
which has been termed a black eschar or malignant pustule. Handling of <i>B.
anthracis</i> is extremely dangerous and should only be done within a biologic
safety cabinet.
<p>
The two species of <i>Bacillus</i> that are of medical importance are <i>B.
anthracis</i> and <i>B. cereus</i>. These aerobic bacteria are
catalase-positive, gram-positive spore formers that appear singly or in chains 
with a <q>boxcar</q> morphology on Gram's stain (see Web Color Image 7-33).
<ol>
<li><i>B. anthracis</i> is the cause of anthrax, a rare disease in the United
States. It usually appears in the cutaneous form as a result of wounds
contaminated with anthrax spores.
<li><i>B. cereus</i> is a common cause of food poisoning.
</ol>

<p>
Laboratory identification is accomplished by growth on blood agar. Colonies
of both species are large and flat. <i>B. cereus</i> is &beta;-hemolytic. The
differentiation between <i>B. anthracis</i> and <i>B. cereus</i> is outlined in
the table above.
<p>
The aerobic Actinomycetes include <i>Nocardia</i>, <i>Actinomadura</i>, and
<i>Streptomyces</i> species. These microorganisms are similar morphologically to
fungi. They are gram-positive bacilli, but do not produce spores.
<p>
<i>Nocardia</i> species are saprophytes and are found worldwide in soil and
on plant material. They cause pulmonary and cutaneous infections in humans.
<i>Nocardia asteroides</i> is the most commonly isolated member of <i>Nocardia</i>.
This organism is usually found in immunocompromised patients as a chronic
infection, particularly pulmonary. It is pleomorphic and partially acid-fast.
(See Web Color Image 7-34). Growth is slow (up to 6 weeks). The colonial
morphology is dry and heaped, similar to a fungus (see Web Color Images 7-35
and 7-36). It also has a soil or musty-basement odor. Exudates may demonstrate
<q>sulfur granules,</q> which are masses of filamentous organisms with pus
materials.
<p>
<i>Actinomadura</i> are etiologic agents of <b>mycetomas</b>. Their microscopic
and macroscopic morphology is similar to that of the <i>Nocardia</i> species. 
However, the microorganisms are not acid-fast.
<p>
<i>Streptomyces</i> species are primarily saprophytes, found as soil organisms.
They may cause opportunistic infections similar to those caused by the other 
aerobic actinomycetes.
<p>
<i>Lactobacillus</i> species is a pleomorphic, nonspore-forming, gram-positive
bacillus. It is catalase-negative, and may growbetter under anaerobic
conditions. Lactobacilli are normal vaginal flora.
<p>
<i>Arcanobacterium haemolyticum</i> is a small, &beta;-hemolytic,
nonspore-forming, grampositive bacillus. It resembles the &beta;-hemolytic 
streptococci. The organism is the etiologic agent of pharyngitis and must be 
differentiated from <i>Streptocococcus pyogenes</i>. It is catalase-negative 
and exhibits a reverse CAMP reaction.

<h2><i>Neisseria</i> and <i><i>Moraxella catarrhalis</i></i></h2>
<p>
Members of this group are gram-negative cocci that are often seen in pairs. The
adjacent sides are flattened, producing a kidney-bean shape (see Web Color 
Image 7-37). They are all oxidase-positive and catalase-positive (see Web Color 
Images 7-38 and 7-11). Differentiation of species is often based on acid 
production from carbohydrate utilization. Some of the pathogenic species may 
have fastidious growth requirements.
<p>
Proper specimen collection is essential for successful isolation. <i>N.
gonorrhoeae</i> and <i>N. meningitidis</i> are especially sensitive to drying,
cold, and chemicals (disinfectants and antiseptics). Dacron or rayon swabs are
less inhibitory than calcium alginate and cotton and are preferred for
collection. Specimens should be kept at room temperature and plating should
occur as soon as possible following collection.

<h3><i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i></h3>
<p>
<b>Gonorrhea</b> is a frequently seen venereal disease. The majority of
infected men show symptoms such as burning and discharge from the urethra 
(gonococcal urethritis). Females may be asymptomatic, but infection in this 
gender may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. Gonorrhea may cause sterility 
in males and females and disseminate to blood, skin, and joints.
<p>
<b>Ophthalmia neonatorum</b> is primarily a gonococcal infection of the
conjunctiva of newborns as a result of passage through an infected mother's
birth canal. It can be successfully treated at birth to prevent blindness.
<p>
Penicillinase-producing <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> are a common problem. A
&beta;-lactamase test should be done on each isolate to detect resistance to
the penicillin antibiotics.
<p>
Direct microscopic examination of gram stained urethral discharge from males is
a valuable diagnostic procedure. The presence of gram-negative intracellular
diplococci (see Web Color Image 7-37) from a symptomatic male with discharge
has a 95% correlation rate with culture and is strong presumptive evidence of
gonorrhea. Correlation is much lower in females because of the normal flora.
<p>
Culture of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> can be accomplished with various enriched and
selective media. Specimens for culture should be collected from infected 
sources (cervix, urethra, rectum, or throat.) Swabs or exudates are acceptable 
specimens, and should be kept at room temperature prior to processing. <i>N. 
gonorrhoeae</i> grows on chocolate agar, but not on blood agar. In those cases 
in which normal flora may contaminate the medium, selective agars, inhibitory 
to organisms other than <i>Neisseria</i> species, may be used. Selective media 
include Thayer-Martin and modified Thayer-Martin (MTM), Martin-Lewis, and New 
York City. Other media are often packaged in self-contained trans
port/incubation systems that are inoculated at the site of collection. Examples 
include Transgrow, Gono- Pak, and JEMBEC plates.
<p>
Plates are incubated at 35&deg;C in a 3-5% carbon dioxide, humidified
atmosphere. Colonies of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> are flat, smooth, glistening, and 
gray to white. The oxidase-positive, catalase-positive, gram-negative 
diplococcus produces acid from glucose utilization. Identification and 
differentiation is outlined in the table below. Various tests are available for 
direct detection of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> from clinical specimens. These 
include detection of cellular antigens and those that detect gonococcal nucleic 
acid.

<h3><i>Neisseria meningitidis</i></h3>
<p>
<b>Meningococcal meningitis</b> is transmitted by respiratory droplets.
Prolonged close contact is necessary for infection. The onset is abrupt, with 
headache, stiff neck, and fever. Petechial skin lesions may be present.
<p>
Aside from meningitis (inflammation of both the brain substance and surrounding
membranes), <b>meningococcemia</b>, , also involves the blood vessels and
various major organs. Petechial skin lesions are common. This condition may
progress to DIC. Direct microscopic examination of CSF sediment may reveal
intracellular and extracellular gram-negative diplococci (see Web Color Image
7-37).
<p>
Specimens for culture include CSF, blood, and joint fluid. Nasopharyngeal swabs
are cultured to detect carriers. Specimens should be kept at room temperature 
and processed as soon as possible.  Swabs should not be allowed to dry out. 
Growth is seen on blood and chocolate agar and is enhanced with increased 
carbon dioxide and humidity. Colonies of <i>N. meningitidis</i> are flat, 
smooth, glistening, and gray to white.  Acid production from the utilization of 
glucose and maltose differentiates the bacterium from <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>. 
Identification is outlined in the table.
<p>
<i>Moraxella catarrhalis</i> is part of the normal upper respiratory tract
flora. It may cause <b>otitis media</b>, sinusitis, and respiratory infections.
<i>M. catarrhalis</i> grows on blood, chocolate, and nutrient agars.
Identification of the asaccharolytic gram-negative coccus is outlined in the table
above.
<p>
Other <i>Neisseria</i> species only rarely cause clinical infection. These
species may need to be differentiated from the pathogenic species, because they
are normal flora at the same sites at which the pathogenic species are located
(see table).

<h2>Miscellaneous Gram-Negative Bacilli</h2>

<h3><i>Haemophilus</i></h3>
<p>
Members of the genus <i>Haemophilus</i> are gram-negative, nonmotile bacilli
and coccobacilli, which are often pleomorphic. Members of <i>Haemophilus</i> 
require hemin (X factor) and/or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD; V 
factor) for growth (except H. aphrophilus). These fastidious bacteria grow on 
chocolate agar, but not on blood agar, due to its absence of the NAD.
<p>
<i>H. influenzae</i> is the most important species, causing meningitis, otitis
media, epiglottitis, pneumonia, and contagious conjunctivitis. Children,
especially those who have not been immunized, are particularly at risk. H.
influenzae is part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora. Capsular
serotype b is the most common cause of disseminated infections, but widespread
immunization with the Hib vaccine has resulted in a decreased incidence of
these infections.
<p>
<i>H. ducreyi</i> is the cause of chancroid, a sexually transmitted disease.
Organisms enter through breaks in the skin and multiply locally. Approximately
1 week later, a small papule appears that soon develops into a painful ulcer. A
Gram's stain of the lesion exudate may show small pleomorphic gram-negative
bacilli in clusters (<q>school of fish</q> morphology).
<p>
<i>H. aegyptius</i> (Koch-Weeks bacillus) is associated with acute, contagious
conjunctivitis, commonly referred to as <q>pinkeye.</q>
<p>
<i>H. parainfluenzae</i> and <i>H. aphrophilus</i> are human normal oral
flora and are seen primarily in endocarditis.

</table>
<p>
Differentiation of the <i>Haemophilus</i> species is summarized in the table
above. X and V factor requirements can be determined by placing X and V factor 
- impregnated filter paper strips onto a nutrient agar plate that has been
inoculated with the unknown species. X and V requirements are determined by
growth patterns (e.g., growth around X indicates a requirement for that factor).
As depicted in Web Color Image 7-39, <i>H. influenzae</i> requires both X and V
factors for growth. <i>H. parainfluenzae</i> requires only V factor for growth
(see Web Color Image 7-40).
<p>
Growth can also be seen surrounding colonies of <i><i>S. aureus</i></i>, <i>S.
pneumoniae</i>, or <i>Neisseria</i> species. These organisms produce V factor 
as a metabolic byproduct and lyse the RBCs in the medium, releasing the X 
factor. This is called the <b>satellite phenomenon</b> (see Web Color Image 7-41).
<p>
The porphyrin test is a sensitive method to determine X factor requirements.
Those species that do not require X factor yield a positive porphyrin test (e.g.,
<i>H. influenzae</i> is porphyrin negative).
<p>
Fermentation of carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, lactose) can aid in
identification of the species.
<p>
<i>H. influenzae</i> may be divided into biotypes. The site of infection by <i>
H. influenzae</i> can be correlated with biotype. Biotypes are determined by an
isolate's activity with indole, urease, and ornithine decarboxylase. The
disease association and biochemical characteristics of common biotypes are
summarized in the table below. Biotype I is most commonly associated with
meningitis and epiglottis. Because of similar biochemical characteristics,
additional testing is necessary to differentiate <i>H. aegyptius</i> and <i>H.
influenzae</i>.

<p>
Resistance to the penicillins is common due to &beta;-lactamases and other
mechanisms in <i>Haemophilus</i>.

<h3><i>Pasteurella multocida</i></h3>
<div class="box-right" style="width:21em;">
<p class="box-title">
Key Characteristics of <i>Pasteurella multocida</i>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>Gram-negative coccobacillus with bipolar staining
<li style="text-indent:-2em;margin-left:2em;">Growth on blood agar
  <br> (may have a musty or mousey smell)
<li>No growth on MacConkey agar
<li>Catalase positive
<li>Indole positive
<li>Oxidase positive
<li>Penicillin susceptible (2-U disk)
<li>Glucose utilization
</ul>
</div>
<p>
This is the most commonly encountered species in the <i>Pasteurella</i> genus.
It is found as normal flora in the respiratory tract of animals, especially 
dogs and cats. Isolation of <i>P. multocida</i> is always a strong possibility 
in an infected dog or cat bite or scratch. This species appears as a small 
gram-negative coccobacillus with bipolar staining. The key characteristics for 
differentiating <i>P. multocida</i> are listed in the box at right.

<h3><i>Bordetella</i></h3>
<p>
This species are very small gram-negative bacilli. There are three species that
cause human infection: <i>B. pertussis</i>, <i>B. parapertussis</i>, and <i>B.
bronchiseptica</i>. All cause respiratory tract infection, but <i>B.
pertussis</i> causes the most serious infection, which is whooping cough.
<p>
<i>Bordetella pertussis</i>, the cause of pertussis or whooping cough, is found
worldwide and is spread via droplets. a. Disease progression. The disease
begins with coldlike symptoms (i. e., runny nose, sneezing, malaise). This
catarrhal stage is the most infectious. After 1 to 2 weeks, the paroxysmal
stage begins, with violent coughs that often make it difficult for the infected
person to take a breath. Convalescence can take weeks to months with secondary
complications, such as pneumonia, seizures, and encephalopathy possible.
<p>
<i>B. pertussis</i> is very sensitive to drying and to trace toxic chemicals on
swabs and in media. Specimen collection and transport must be done correctly 
for successful culture. Cotton swabs are toxic; calcium alginate or Dacron 
swabs should be used. The best specimen is a nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate. 
Immediate plating is preferred, because the organism does not readily survive 
transport. A swab should also be collected for a direct fluorescent antibody 
and Gram's stain of smears.
<p>
Growth can be accomplished using Regan-Lowe or Bordet-Gengou agar
(charcoal-horse blood agar). <i>B. pertussis</i> colonies, often described as
<q>mercury drop</q> colonies, are small and pearl-like in appearance after 3 to
4 days. It does not grow on sheep blood agar and is urease-negative.
Identification is by microscopic and colonial morphology on selective media,
biochemical reactions, and reactivity with specific antiserum, usually in a
direct fluorescence test (DFA) (see Web Color Image 7-42).
<p>
<i>B. parapertussis</i> can be found in patients who have respiratory tract
illness that resembles a mild form of pertussis. This species grows on sheep 
blood agar within 2 to 3 days and is urease positive within 24 hours. <i>B. 
bronchiseptica</i> is rarely found in humans but causes respiratory tract 
disease in animals (<q>kennel cough</q>). Growth is observed on sheep blood 
agar within 1 to 2 days and it is urease-positive within 4 hours (see Web Color 
Image 7-43).

<h3><i>Francisella tularensis</i></h3>
<p>
This is the causative agent of <b>tularemia</b>, a zoonotic disease.
Transmission is via contact with infected animals (e.g., rabbits, deer),
arthropod bites (e.g., ticks, fleas), or inhalation. Isolation generally
requires extended incubation on media enriched with cystine or cysteine. The
gram-negative rod/coccobacillus is very small and stains poorly on Gram's stain.
Definitive identification is made with specific antisera (direct fuorescence).
This organism is very dangerous to work with in the laboratory. It should
always be handled under a biologic safety hood with safety precautions strictly
observed.

<h3><i>Brucella</i></h3>
<p>
Members of the genus <i>Brucella</i> cause disease in animals. Human disease
is normally a result of contact with the animals or their waste, meat, hides, 
or secretions. There are four species responsible for the majority of human 
disease: <i>B. melitensis</i>, <i>B. abortus</i>, <i>B. suis</i>, and <i>B. 
canis</i>.
<p>
The disease caused is <b>brucellosis</b> (also known as <b>Bang's disease</b>
or <b>undulant fever</b>). It is characterized by fever, chills, fatigue, 
weakness, and internal organ lesions. It can be chronic. Brucellosis is a CDC 
reportable infection.
<p>
<i>Brucella</i> species are most often isolated from blood or bone marrow. The
organism is slow-growing, and blood cultures may need to be incubated for 4 to 
6 weeks before they are considered negative. A Gram's stain shows a faintly 
staining, small, gram negative coccobacillus. Serologic tests (agglutination of 
the isolate) are valuable in identification. The CO<sub>2</sub>, requirement, 
along with urease, hydrogen sulfide, and growth in the presence of thionin and 
basic fuchsin can also be used in differentiation of the species. The table 
below summarizes the differential characteristics of the <i>Brucella</i> 
species. <i> Brucella</i> organisms should be handled under biosafety level 3 
conditions with safety precautions strictly observed.

<h3><i>Antinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</i></h3>
<p>
This is a slow-growing, small, facultative gramnegative bacillus associated
with endocarditis, bacteremia, and dental infections. It may be associated with
<i>Actinomyces</i>. It is catalase positive and oxidase negative (see table
below).
<h3><i>Kingella kingae</i></h3>
<p>
This species colonizes the upper respiratory tract and is primarily associated
with infections of bones and joints, as well as endocarditis in children and
young adults. It grows on sheep blood agar and is &beta;-hemolytic. A Gram's
stain shows short, plump, gram-negative rods with square ends (see table below).
Other less pathogenic species in the genus are <i>K. denitrificans</i> and
<i>K. oralis</i>.

<h3><i>Capnocytophaga</i></h3>
<p>
This is normal oral flora in humans. It may cause serious infections in
immunosuppressed patients. It has been associated with dog bites and is usually
isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. It grows on sheep blood agar, but
is capnophilic and must have CO2 for growth. Colonies are beige or yellow and
show a haze of growth at the periphery as a result of gliding motility (see Web
Color Image 7-44). Gram's stain shows fusiform, gram-negative bacillus (see
table below). (See Web Color Image 7-45.)

<h3><i>Cardiobacterium hominis</i></h3>
<p>
This is a pleomorphic, gram-negative rod that grows on blood, but not MacConkey
agar. It is normal human oral flora and is found in patients who have
endocarditis and bacteremia. The colonies are small, and growth is slow.
Differentiation of the miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli and coccobacilli is

<h2>Enterobacteriaceae</h2>

<div class="box-left" style="width:10em;text-align:left;">
<p class="box-title">
Medically Significant Enterobacteriaceae

</ul>
</div>
<p>
The Enterobacteriaceae is the largest and most medically important family of
gramnegative bacilli (see Web Color Image 7-4). Although there are numerous 
genera and species, more than 90% of the medically important isolates belong to 
just a few genera (see box at left).
<p>
The Enterobacteriaceae are found worldwide and are part of the normal flora
of all animals. They are a common cause of nosocomial infections.
<p>
Commonly seen sites of infection with members of the Enterobacteriaceae are
listed in the table below.

<table class="td-left">

</table>
<p>
All members ferment glucose, reduce nitrates to nitrites, and are
oxidase-negative. The oxidase reaction is especially important in making a
rapid distinction between the Enterobacteriaceae and the majority of the
gram-negative nonfermenters. However, the oxidase-positive <i>Plesiomonas
shigelloides</i>, formerly in the family Vibrionaceae, has been moved to the
family Enterobacteriaceae. Phylogenetic studies have shown that <i>
Plesiomonas</i> is closely related to members in this family, particularly the
genus <i>Proteus</i>. (Identification of P. shigelloides will be discussed in
Section XIII.)
<p>
Antigens of this group include the O or somatic antigen, found in the
bacterial cell wall, the H or flagellar antigen, and the K or capsular antigen.
<p>
Various culture media and tests are used for the isolation, selection,
differentiation, and identification of the Enterobacteriaceae.
<p>
Media used for isolation and selection of <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Shigella</i>,
 along with expected reactions, are summarized in the table below. (see Web

Media and tests used for the identification of the Enterobacteriaceae include the
following:
<p>
The <b>triple sugar iron agar (TSI)</b> medium differentiates gram-negative
bacilli by their ability to ferment glucose, lactose, and sucrose and to
produce hydrogen sulfide (Web Color Image 7-52). Nonfermenters produce an
alkaline slant and alkaline deep (no change in the red color of the medium).
Nonlactose fermenters (but glucose fermenters) produce an alkaline slant (red)
and acid (yellow) deep. Lactose fermenters and sucrose fermenters produce an
acid (yellow) slant and acid (yellow) deep. A lactose-negative, s
ucrose-positive organism will produce an acid slant and acid deep. Hydrogen
sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) production is indicated by a black precipitate in the
medium. <b>Kliger's iron agar (KIA)</b> is a similar medium, but only
incorporates the carbohydrates glucose and lactose. H<sub>2</sub>S production
can also be detected with this formulation (see Web Color Image 7-52).
<p>
To test <b>nitrate reduction</b>, a nitrate test medium is inoculated and
incubated overnight to determine the ability of microorganisms to reduce
nitrates to nitrite. The presence of nitrites in the medium is detected by the
addition of <i>N,N</i> -dimethyl-&alpha;- naphthylamine and sulfanilic acid.
The formation of a red color after the addition of the two reagents indicates
that nitrite is present (positive test). If a red color is not detected, all
available nitrate may have been reduced to nitrite and then completely
converted to nitrogen gas (N<sub> 2</sub>), nitric oxide (NO), or nitrous oxide
(N<sub>2</sub>O). No nitrite remains to react with the sulfanilic acid. This
can be detected by adding a small pinch of zinc dust to the tube (metallic zinc
reduces nitrate to nitrite). With the formation of nitrite upon addition of
zinc, the reactions can take place, resulting in the red color. A red color at
this point indicates that nitrate was still in the broth (negative test).
Absence of red color after the addition of zinc indicates that no nitrate was
left (positive test). All Enterobacteriaceae reduce nitrates to nitrites (see
Web Color Image 7-53).
<p>
The <b>oxidase test</b> determines the presence of the cytochrome oxidase
system that oxidizes reduced cytochrome with molecular oxygen. A positive test 
is the development of a purple when the bacterium is mixed with the reagent 
tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. The Enterobacteriaceae are 
oxidase-negative, with the exception of <i>Plesiomonas</i> species (see Web 
Color Image 7-38).
<p>
The <b>indole test</b> detects an organism's ability to produce the enzyme <b>
tryptophanase</b> and deaminate tryptophan to indole, pyruvic acid, and ammonia.
A positive reaction is a detected with the addition of Ehrlich's reagent, <i>
p</i>-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, or <b>Kovac's reagent</b>. A positive reaction 
is a pink color (see Web Color Images 7-54 and 7-55).
<p>
The <b>methyl red (MR)</b> and <b>Voges-Proskauer (VP)</b> tests are used to
determine the method by which bacteria metabolize glucose: the mixed acid 
fermentation pathway or the butylene glycol pathway. The tests detect the end 
products of glucose fermentation, in accordance with the pathway an organism 
uses to metabolize glucose. Isolates are inoculated into MR-VP broth and 
allowed to grow for 48 hours. At that time, the broth is split into two 
fractions: one to measure methyl red and one for the Voges-Proskauer test (see 
Web Color Images 7-54 and 7-55). Those organisms that carry out mixed acid 
fermentation produce vast amounts of acid that will convert the methyl red 
indicator to a red color (pH &lt;4.4). The Voges-Proskauer test measures the 
production of acetoin. The addition of 40% potassium hydroxide followed by 
&alpha;-naphthol results in a red complex (neutral pH), which indicates a 
positive test.
<p>
The <b>citrate test</b> determines whether an organism can utilize sodium
citrate as a sole source of carbon. Ammonium salts are the nitrogen source in
the medium and utilization of these salts results in the release of ammonia,
causing a pH change. The bromthymol blue indicator turns the medium from green
to blue (a positive test). (See Web Color Images 7-54 and 7-55.)
<p>
Organisms that produce <b>urease</b> will hydrolyze urea to form ammonia. The
ammonia reacts in solution to form ammonium carbonate, which increases the pH. 
This is detected by the phenol red in the medium and turns the medium a bright 
pink color (positive test). <b>Christensen's urea agar</b> is generally a 
preferred test medium. (See Web Color Image 7-43.)
<p>
Bacteria that produce <b>gelatinases</b> that break down gelatin into amino
acids. A slant of nutrient gelatin is inoculated and incubated at room 
temperature for up to several days. If incubation is at 35&deg;C, the medium 
should be chilled in a refrigerator before reading the test results. 
Liquefaction of the gelatin is a positive test.
<p>
A bacterium utilizes the sodium thiosulfate sulfur source to form H<sub>2</sub>
S, a colorless gas. H<sub>2</sub> S combines with the indicator, ferrous 
sulfate. Numerous media demonstrate the production of H<sub>2</sub>S (e.g., 
sulfide-indole-motiligy agar, motility-indole-ornithine agar, Hektoen enteric 
agar, <i>Salmonella</i>-<i> Shigella</i> agar, Triple sugar iron agar, Kligler 
Iron agar, and lysine iron agar.) (See Web Color Images 7-46, 7-47 and 7-56.)
<p>
The deamination of phenylalanine (removal of an amine group) by <b>
phenylalanine deaminase</b> results in the production of phenylpyruvic acid. 
Following overnight incubation and the addition of a 10% ferric chloride to an 
inoculated slant, a green color indicates the presence of phenylpyruvic acid, a 
positive test. <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Morganella</i>, and <i>Providencia</i> 
species are phenylalanine deaminase-positive. (See Web Color Image 7-57.)
<p>
The decarboxylation (removal of a carboxyl group, COOH) of lysine, ornithine,
and arginine (dihydrolyase reaction) may be detected by inoculating media with 
a specific amino acid and glucose, a carbohydrate source. Semisolid agar tubes 
are inoculated by stabbing. An acid pH and anaerobic environment are required 
for decarboxylation reactions to occur. A yellow color initially indicates 
glucose fermentation and results in an acid pH that is lowered enough to 
activate the decarboxylase enzymes. A positive test, caused by an alkaline pH 
shift, is a return to the original color of the uninoculated medium (purple). 
Text media include <b>Moeller decarboxylase base medium</b> (see Web Color 
Image 7-58), <i>motility-indole-ornithine (MIO)</i>, or <b>lysine iron agar 
(LIA)</b>.
<p>
&beta;-galactosidase and the orthonitrophenyl-B-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) test.
Organisms that are late or slow lactose fermenters may appear as nonfermenters
on primary media. The ONPG test determines if the organism is a slow or late 
lactose fermenter (e.g., lacks the permease that allows lactose to enter the 
cell, but has &beta;-galactosidase, which splits lactose). Lactose 
nonfermenters lack the &beta;-galactosidase. &beta;-galactosidase acts on ONPG 
to form a yellow compound (positive test), which indicates that the organism is 
a lactose fermenter. (See Web Color Image 7-59.)
<p>
Bacterial DNases are endonucleases that cleave phosphodiester bonds in DNA,
resulting in smaller subunits of the polynucleotide. A bacterial isolate is 
streaked onto a medium with 0.2% DNA and incubated for 24 hours at 35&deg;C. 
Following incubation, 1&nbsp;N&nbsp;HCl is added to the surface of the medium. 
Unhydrolyzed DNAis insoluble in HCl and forms a precipitate. A positive 
reaction is the formation of a clear zone (halo) around the inoculum.
<p>
Motility can be demonstrated by microscopic examination of wet mounts of
bacteria. In addition, semisolid medium, with agar concentrations of 0.4% or
less, can be used to demonstrate motility.  Following overnight incubation,
movement away from the stab line or a hazy appearance throughout the medium is
indicative of a positive reaction by a motile bacterium. (See Web Color Image
7-60.)
<p>
All Enterobacteriaceae ferment glucose, and lactose fermentation is used to
differentiate groups of genera within the family. Other carbohydrates can be 
utilized by bacteria. Phenol red carbohydrates or CTA sugars with phenol red 
indicators are most commonly used to detect fermentation of specific 
carbohydrates. A yellow color indicate a fermentation and a positive reaction. 
(See Web Color Image 7-61.)

Enterobacteriaceae can be accomplished using the information presented in the

<h2><i>Campylobacter</i>, <i>Helicobacter</i>, and Vibrionaceae</h2>

<h3><i>Campylobacter</i></h3>
<p>
The most clinically relevant species are <i>C. jejuni</i> subsp. <i>jejuni</i>,
<i>C. coli</i>, and <i>C. fetus</i> subsp. <i>fetus</i>.
<p>
Diarrhea is the primary disease caused by <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>. It is
often transmitted by means of contaminated water and animals, especially
poultry and carcasses. <i>Campylobacter fetus</i> is the causative agent of
bacteremia.

<div class="box-left left" style="width:16em;">
<p class="box-title">

 <li>catalase-positive</ul>
</div>
<p>
The characteristic gram-stain reaction and microscopic morphology of
<i>Campylobacter</i> is often described as faintly staining, <q>seagull-shaped</q> 
gram-negative rods (see Web Color Image 7-62). The organisms exhibit darting 
motility. Characteristics of <i>Campylobacter</i> species are summarized in the
box at right.

<p>
The isolation of <i>Campylobacter</i> is accomplished by inoculating the
specimen (usually stool) to <i>Campylobacter</i> blood agar. This contains 
several antibiotics that suppress growth of normal fecal flora. The plate is 
incubated in a microaerophilic atmosphere. Incubation at 42&deg;C also inhibits 
growth of normal fecal flora. The specimen of choice for isolation of <i>C. 
fetus</i> is blood with incubation at 35&deg;C to 37&deg;C.

<p>
The laboratory identification of <i>Campylobacter</i> is summarized in
Figure 7-5 and Table 7-16. The oxidase-positive, catalase-positive
<i>Campylobacter</i> species can be differentiated based on growth at 42&deg;C, 
hippurate hydrolysis, and susceptibility to naladixic acid and cephalothin. <i>
C. jejuni</i> grows at 42&deg;C, is hippurate hydrolysispositive, susceptible 
to nalidixic acid, and resistant to cephalothin. Reactions for C. fetus are the 
opposite.

alt="identifcation of Campylobacter">

<h3><i>Helicobacter</i></h3>
<p>
This is an organism very similar to <i>Campylobacter</i>. Diseases caused by <i>
Helicobacter</i> include gastritis and duodenal ulcers. Specimens are usually
gastric biopsy material. Isolates are strongly urease-positive (see Web Color
Image 7-43).

<h3>Vibrionaceae</h3>
<p>
These include <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Aeromonas</i>. <i>Plesiomonas</i>,
previously a genus in the family Vibrionaceae, has been moved to the family
Enterobacteriaceae. (<i>Plesiomonas</i> will be discussed in this section.) The
most commonly isolated species of <i>Vibrio</i> include <i>V. cholerae</i> (O-1
and non-O-1), <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i>, <i>V. alginolyticus</i>, and <i> V.
vulnificus</i>. All of these species are found in water sources and are
transmitted by contaminated food and water.
<p>
<i>Vibrio cholerae</i> is the cause of cholera, a disease in which vast
quantities of fluid and electrolytes are lost from the intestinal tract. The
liquid stools are often referred to as <q>rice-water</q> stools, because they
are colorless and contain mucus flecks. Cholera-causing isolates have a somatic
antigen referred to as O-1. Non-O-1 isolates do not cause cholera, but may
cause other infections. <i>V. cholerae</i> can be differentiated from other
species by a positive <q>string test</q> when mixed with sodium deoxycholate
(see Web Color Image 7-63).
<p>
<i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> and <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i> usually cause
gastroenteritis following ingestion of raw or improperly handled seafood and
wound infections following exposure to sea water. Both organisms require salt
for growth (halophilic).
<p>
<i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> is an extremely virulent organism that causes rapidly
progressive wound infections after exposure to contaminated water and
septicemia after eating raw oysters.

<p>
The laboratory isolation and identification of <i>Vibrio</i> is summarized in
the two tables, one to the right, one below. <i>Vibrio</i> species are usually 
described as <q> curved</q> gram-negative rods (see Web Color Image 7-64), but 
this morphology is often only seen in the initial Gram stain of the clinical 
specimen. Isolated colonies are straight to pleomorphic gram-negative rods. The 
organisms are usually isolated from stool specimens. <i>V. cholerae</i> can be 
enriched by using alkaline peptone water (pH 8.4). This suppresses the growth 
of other organisms. All <i>Vibrio</i> species grow well on routine media. The 
<i> Vibrio</i> species are <q> halophilic</q> or <q>salt-loving,</q> and with 
the exception of <i>V. cholerae</i> and <i>V. mimicus</i>, all species require 
salt for growth. The differential medium of choice is Thiosulfate citrate bile 
salts surcose (TCBS) agar (see Web Color Images 7-65 and 7-66). All isolates 
are indole and oxidase-positive (see Web Color Image 7-38), and have a 
fermentative metabolism. The reactions of the various <i>Vibrio</i> species on 
TCBS are summarized in the table below.

<p>
<i>Aeromonas</i> and <i>Plesiomonas</i> are found in fresh and salt waters.
They may cause diarrheal disease as well as other miscellaneous infections. 
Normally, only patients who have underlying disease are treated. This type of
diarrhea diarrheal infection is usually self-limiting. The role of
<i>Aeromonas</i> and <i>Plesiomonas</i> in diarrheal disease is not well
established. These organisms grow well on blood and MacConkey agar, are
oxidase-positive, and ferment glucose. These bacteria are gram-negative rods.
<i>Plesiomonas</i> may show long filamentous forms. Differentiation of
<i>Aeromonas</i> and <i>Plesiomonas</i> is summarized in the table below.

<h2>Gram-Negative Nonfermentative Bacilli</h2>
<p>
This large group of organisms uses biochemical pathways other than fermentation.
 Theymay be oxidizers (see Web Color Image 7-67) or they may be asaccharolytic
(nonoxidizers). Gram-negative nonfermentative bacilli account for approximately
15% of gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria isolated in the clinical laboratory.
They are found in the environment and cause disease in immunocompromised
individuals. Virtually all of these organisms are opportunists. An isolate that
grows on blood agar but not MacConkey agar should be suspected of being a
nonfermenter. This is especially true if the isolate is also oxidase positive.
Nonfermenters that do grow on MacConkey agar appear as lactose negative.

burns and cystic fibrosis.
<p>
<i>P. aeruginosa</i> is also found to cause UTIs, endocarditis, and external
otitis (swimmer's ear). Infections may be difficult to control because of 
antibiotic resistance; this situation is usually only a problem in 
immunocompromised persons.

(4&deg;C-42&deg;C). Identification of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is not difficult and
is summarized in theh box at left. This organism grows well on most media and
is easily recognized by its blue-green pigment (due to pyocyanin production)
(see Web Color Image 7-68) and corn tortilla odor (some describe it as a
grape-like odor). <i>P. aeruginosa</i> also produces the <b>pyoverdin</b> (see
Web Color Image 7-69) that fluoresces under UV light and is oxidase-positive
(see Web Color Image 7-38).
<p>
Other <i>Pseudomonas</i> species are of low virulence and rarely cause
clinical disease. Many are environmental organisms. They can be opportunists, 
but are often considered as contaminants when isolated form clinical specimens.
<p>
<i>P. fluorescens</i> and <i>P. putida</i> are in the fluorescent <i>
Pseudomonas</i> group, but are differentiated from <i>P. aeruginosa</i> as
neither produces <b>pyocyanin</b> or grows at 42&deg;C.
<p>
<i>P. stutzeri</i> is a rare pathogen, but may cause infection in an
immunocompromised host. The organism demonstrates characteristic yellowto brown 
wrinkled, leathery, adherent colonies.
<p>
Infections by <i>Burkholderia</i> (<i>Pseudomonas</i>) <i>cepacia</i> are
primarily nosocomial infections related to contaminated disinfectants used for
antisepsis. Community-acquired infections are rare except in intravenous drug
abusers. The bacterium has been associated with pneumonia in patients with
cystic fibrosis.
<p>
Pathogenic <i>Burkholderia</i> species are known to cause severe infections,
but are seldom seen in the United States. These species are considered by 
government agencies to be potential agents of bioterrorism. <i>Burkholderia 
mallei</i> causes <b>glanders</b>, which is a zoonosis primarily affecting 
livestock, and can produce local suppurative or acute pulmonary infections in 
humans. <i> Burkholderia</i> (<i>Pseudomonas</i>) <i>pseudomallei</i> causes <b>
 melioidosis</b>, an aggressive granulomatous pulmonary disease. Endemic areas 
include southeast Asia, northern Australia, and Mexico.
<p>
<i>Stenotrophomonas</i> (<i>Xanthomonas</i>) <i>maltophilia</i> is found in
the environment and causes a wide range of nosocomial infections.
<p>
<i>Acinetobacter</i> species are opportunists found in soil andwater. They
cause pneumonia and UTIs. On Gram's stain, this genus is characteristically a 
fat coccobacillus. The two species most commonly seen in clinical specimens are 
<i>A. baumannii</i> (previously <i>A. calcoaceticus</i> var. <i>anitratus</i>) 
and <i>A. lwoffii</i> (previously <i>A. calcoaceticus</i> var. <i>lwoffii</i>).
<p>
<i>Chryseobacterium</i> (<i>Flavobacterium</i>) <i>meningosepticum</i> is a
cause of neonatal meningitis or septicemia, especially in premature infants. 
The bacterium can cause pneumonia, endocarditis, bacteremia, and meningitis in 
adults.
<p>
<i>Eikenella corrodens</i> is found as normal mouth and nasopharyngeal flora.
 Trauma to the face or mouth, including dental work, may predispose an 
individual to infection. Human bite wounds are another source of infection. 
This isolate is often found as part of a mixed infection. The name is derived 
from the corroding or pitting of the agar by the colonies.
<p>
<i>Moraxella</i> species are normal flora of mucous membranes. They
infrequently cause infection. Conjunctivitis is caused by <i>M. lacunata</i>. 
<i>M. catarrhalis</i> is normal oral flora of the respiratory tract and may 
cause otitis media, sinusitis, and respiratory infections (see Section X).
<p>
<i>Alcaligenes</i> and <i>Achromobacter</i> are divided into asaccharolytic
and sacchrolytic species.
<p>
These opportunists are found in water and are resistant to disinfectants. The
asaccharolytic <i>Alcaligenes faecalis</i> is most often seen in clinical
specimens and has been isolated from urine, sputum, wound, and blood.
<i>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</i> subsp. xylosoxidans, an oxidizer, has been
associated with otitis media, meningitis, pneumonia, surgical wound infections,
UTIs, peritonitis, and bacteremia. L. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of
gram-negative nonfermentative bacilli are similar to those of the
Enterobacteriaceae. Some nonfermenters are resistant to most of the antibiotics
used.

<p>
The laboratory identification of the most common bacteria in this group is
summarized in the table above.

<h2>Miscellaneous Genera</h2>
<p>

<i>Legionella</i> species are found worldwide in the environment. Most
infections result from contaminated water sources. <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>
 is the most common isolate. Pneumonia (Legionnaires' disease) is the most 
common infection caused by <i> Legionella</i>. Pontiac fever is a nonpneumonic 
form of <i>Legionella</i> infection with flu-like symptoms. Its incidence in 
the general population is unknown.
<p>
Specimens for culture are generally from pulmonary sources. Various staining
methods can be used to visualize <i>Legionella</i>. The organisms are small
gram-negative rods and stain weakly on Gram's stain. Giemsa stain may be used.
A direct fluorescent antibody test is available and is very useful for
detection from direct specimens. Culture can be accomplished using special
media, because <i>Legionella</i> does not grow on blood agar. Cysteine is
required for growth. The recommended medium for isolation is buffered charcoal
yeast extract agar (BCYE). After several days of incubation, the colonies are
gray-white to blue-green. Definitive identification can be made with
fluorescent antibody or DNA probes.
<p>
<i>Chromobacterium</i> is characterized by a violet pigment. It is an
opportunist that causes wound infections and bacteremia with a skin lesion as 
the typical portal of entry. <i>Chromobacterium</i> is found in soil andwater, 
most commonly in tropical and subtropical climates. However, it has been found 
in the southeastern United States.
<p>
<i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i> is often associated with bacterial vaginosis. The
organism is not thought to be the etiologic agent, but coinfections with the 
anaerobe <i>Mobiluncus</i> and other anaerobic bacteria are common. Human blood 
Tween agar is used for isolation with incubation at 48 hours in 5% to 10% 
carbon dioxide. Colonies are &beta; hemolytic. Gram's stain shows small 
gram-variable or gram-negative coccobacilli. A presumptive identification can 
be made when clue cells, squamous epithelial cells covered with tiny bacilli, 
are observed in wet mounts or direct smears of vaginal discharge.
<p>
<i>Streptobacillus moniliformis</i> is the agent of rat-bite fever
(streptobacillosis), an infection characterized by fever, flu-like symptoms, a
macropapular rash, and lymph node involvement. Gram's stain shows pleomorphic,
long filamentous forms. In blood culture media, the organism grows as <q>fluff
balls</q> or <q>bread crumbs.</q> Serum antibodies can by detected by
agglutination tests.
<p>
<i>Spirillium minus</i> (minor) is also the agent of rat-bite fever
(spirillosis). Symptoms of infection are the same as those for st
reptobacillosis. Serum antibodies can also be detected by agglutination tests.
Penicillin G is the treatment of choice for both infections.
<p>
<i>Bartonella bacilliformis</i> is the etiologic agent of bartonellosis, also
known as verruca peruana. Geographically, the disease is restricted to the
high-altitude valleys of Peru, Ecuador, and southwest Columbia. The febrile
systemic infection is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected sandflies.
The organism is an aerobic, pleomorphic, poorly staining, gram-negative
bacterium.

<h2>Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, and the Chlamydiaceae</h2>
<p>
The organisms in the family Mycoplasmataceae are small, free-living organisms
that lack a cell wall. The three most common isolates are <i>Mycoplasma
pneumoniae</i>, <i>Mycoplasma hominis</i>, and <i>Ureaplasma urealyticum</i>.
<p>
<i>M. pneumoniae</i> is the causative agent of atypical or walking pneumonia.
This organism is not normal flora, and isolation is always significant.
<p>
<i>U. urealyticum</i> and <i>M. hominis</i> colonize the lower genitourinary
tracts of up to 60% to 70% of the normal population. They cause opportunistic
infections such as nongonococcal urethritis in males and postpartum infections
in females.
<p>
The organisms can be cultured on special enriched media. Mycoplasma colonies
are very small, requiring a dissecting microscope for observation. They
demonstrate a characteristic <q>fried egg</q> appearance (raised center with
flat edges). Colonies of Ureaplasma are much smaller.
<p>
Dienes (see Web Color Image 7-70) or methylene blue stains can be used to
visualize the colonies on agar media. Immunofluorescent stains and serology
testing are used for laboratory diagnosis. Differentiation of colonization and
infection may be difficult in test results positive for <i>U. urealyticum</i>
or <i>M. hominis</i>, because both can be normal flora.
<p>
Members of the family Chlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular parasites. The
three most common species are <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>, <i>Chlamydophila
pneumoniae</i> (previously <i>Chlamydia pneumoniae</i>), and <i>Chlamydophila
psittaci</i> (previously <i>Chlamydia psittaci</i>). There are two forms in the
growth cycle of the organism: the elementary body is the infectious form, and
the noninfectious reticulate body is the intracellular reproductive form.
<p>
<i>C. trachomatis</i> is the causative agent of <b>trachoma</b>,
<b>lymphogranuloma venereum</b>, and various other sexually transmitted diseases. 
Trachoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. <i>C. trachomatis</i> is 
the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen in the United States.
<p>
<i>C. pneumoniae</i> is an important cause of pneumonia and pharyngitis.
<p>
<i>C. psittaci</i> is the cause of psittacosis (ornithosis or parrot fever), a
respiratory tract disease seen in patients exposed to birds.
<p>
Laboratory diagnosis can be accomplished several ways. Shell vial tissue
cultures are used for detection of <i>Chlamydia</i>. Cell lines, usually McCoy 
cells, can be inoculated with specimens suspected of harboring <i>Chlamydia</i>.
 After 72 hours, staining with iodine shows darkly stained inclusion bodies 
within the cells. Fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies can also be used to 
detect the chlamydial inclusions in Shell vial vultures. Other methods of 
laboratory diagnosis available include immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay, 
nucleic acid probes, and polymerase chain reaction.

<h2>Spirochetes</h2>
<p>
Three genera in the order Spirochaetales cause human disease: <i>Treponema</i>,
 <i>Leptospira</i>, and <i>Borrelia</i>. These bacteria are characterized by 
their helical shape with spiral coils (see Web Color Image 7-71). The
pathogenic spirochetes and associated infections are listed in the table below.

<table class="td-left" style="margin:1em -10%;">

</table>
<p>
<i>Treponema pallidum</i> ssp. <i>pallidum</i> is the etiologic agent of
syphilis. The infection progresses through three phases: primary, secondary, 
and tertiary. Skin lesions called chancres are characteristic of primary and 
secondary syphilis. Chancres are extremely infectious and fluid from these 
lesions can be used to perform darkfield microscopy. The observation of motile, 
spiral-shaped treponemes from the chancre in the primary and secondary stages 
of syphilis is diagnostic. Diagnosis is usually done by serologic testing, 
which requires either a nonspecific or specific <i>Treponema</i> test.
<p>
The nonspecific tests include the <b>rapid plasma reagin (RPR)</b> and <b>
venereal disease research laboratory tests (VDRL)</b>.
<p>
<i>Treponema</i>l tests detect antibodies specific for <i>Treponema</i>l
antigens. These tests include the <b>fluorescent <i>Treponema</i>l antibody 
absorption test (FTA-ABS)</b> and the <b>TP-PA test</b>, a modification of the 
<b>MHA-TPtest (microhemagglutination test for <i>T. pallidum</i>)</b>.
<p>
<i>Treponema</i> species are the etiologic agents of nonveneral <i>Treponema</i>
diseases. These diseases are endemic to developing countries, humid tropical 
areas, or arid dry areas. They are not found in the United States. Transmission 
is via direct contact, person-to- person, or sharing contaminated eating 
utensils. Skin lesions, gummas, and dissemination are characteristic clinical 
manifestations.
<ul>
<li><i>Treponema pallidum</i> ssp. <i>pertenue</i> is the etiologic agent of
Yaws
<li><i>Treponema pallidum</i> ssp. <i>endemicum</i> is the etiologic agent of
Bejel or endemic syphilis
<li><i>Treponema carateum</i> is the etiologic agent of Pinta
</ul>
<p>
<i>Borrelia</i> is the cause of relapsing fever (<i>B. recurrentis</i>) andLyme
disease (<i>B. burgdorferi</i>), both of which are spread by ticks. Relapsing 
fever is also associated with louse-borne transmission. <b>Erythema chronicum 
migrans (EMC)</b> is associated with lyme disease, and is characterized by 
classic skin lesions at the site of the tick bite. Relapsing febrile episodes 
are caused by antigenic variation in the spirochete and are characteristic of 
infections caused by <i>B. recurrentis</i>. Laboratory diagnosis of relapsing 
fever is achieved by observation of spirochetes in blood smears stained with 
the Giemsa or Wright stain. Diagnosis of Lyme disease is determined by 
serologic means. Antibody in the patient's serum may be detected after the 
third week of the illness. Sensitivity of the various methods varies widely 
from poor to good.
<p>
<i>Leptospira interrogans</i> is the cause of leptospirosis or Weil's disease.
Animals reservoirs are dogs, rats, and rodents. The organism is transmitted via 
exposure to the urine of carriers or urine-contaminated soil or water. The 
organism can be cultured using Fletcher medium, a semi-solid, tubed medium. 
Growth occurs in a ring just beneath the medium surface. <b>Stuart liquid 
media</b> can also be used for culture. Diagnosis may be made from microscopy 
(dark-field, phase-contrast, or immunofluorescent microscroscopy) or culture. 
Serological diagnosis, most commonly used, is via slide agglutination or IgM 
dot-ELISA.

<h2>Mycobacteria</h2>
<div class="box-right left" style="width:15em;">
<p class="box-title">
Characteristics Used to Identify <i>Mycobacterium</i> Isolates
<ul><li>acid fast
<li>colony morphology
<li>colony pigmentation and photoreactivity
<li>growth rate
<li>growth temperature
<li>biochemical tests</ul>
</div>
<p>
The mycobacteria are aerobic bacilli. The cell wall is rich in lipids, which
makes them resistant to Gram's stain. After staining, the bacilli are difficult
to decolorize with acid solutions (e.g., they are acid-fast). Most members of
this group grow slowly with cellular division every 12 to 24 hours.
Identification of a <i>Mycobacterium</i> species isolate is determined by the
characteristics outlined in the box at left.

<div class="box-right">
<p class="box-title">
Decontamination and Digestion Agents
<ul>
<li>sodium hydroxide
<li>N-acetyl-l-cysteine
<li>benzalkonium chloride
<li>oxalic acid
</div>
<p>
The most common specimen collected and processed is respiratory secretions,
although mycobacteria can be recovered from virtually any body site. With 
sputum and other specimens collected from nonsterile sites, digestion and 
decontamination must be done before inoculation of growth media. See the box at 
right for digestion and decontamination agents.
<p>
Following digestion and decontamination, the suspension is diluted with buffer
and centrifuged to concentrate any organisms present. The sediment is 
inoculated onto mycobacterial growth media and used to make a smear for 
acid-fast staining. The most commonly used mycobacterial medium is an egg-based 
medium, <b>L&ouml;wenstein-Jensen</b>. An agar-based media are variations of <b>
 Middlebrook 7H10 medium</b>. All contain some inhibitory agents to suppress 
the growth of contaminating bacteria. The acid fast stains are based on 
carbolfuchsin and include the Ziehl-Neelsen and Kinyoun, with acid alcohol for 
the decolorizing agent, and a methylene blue counterstain. The Ziehl-Neelsen 
stain utilizes heat to drive the stain into the mycobacterial cell wall. The 
Kinyoun stain is a <q>cold</q> variation of the stain. Stained smears are 
viewed with a light microscope. Acid-fast organisms stain pink or red against a 
blue background. Nonacid-fast organisms stain blue (see Web Color Image 7-8).
<p>
The fluorochrome stains, auramine and auramine-rhodamine, are very sensitive
and require a fluorescence microscope. Acid-fast organisms fluoresce a
yellow-orange against a dark background (see Web Color Image 7-9).
<p>
Pigment groups are helpful in a presumptive identification of the mycobacteria.
The Runyon classification system was designed to classify the species within
the genus. Three groups are based on photosensitivity: photochromogens (Group I),
scotochromogens (Group II), and nonphotochromogens (Group III). The <q>rapid
growers</q> are Group IV. The species within the MTB group, although
nonchromogens, are categorized separately. The <i>Mycobacterium</i> species are
still categorized according to photosensitivity, but the designation as <q>
Runyon groups</q> is not often noted.
<p>
To determine pigment groups, or photoreactivity, a specimen is inoculated to
two tubes or plates of mycobacterial media. One tube is incubated in the light, 
and the other is incubated in the dark. Following growth, pigment production of 
each is noted. The medium initially incubated in the dark is incubated in 
bright light for several hours, and pigment production, if any, is noted.
<p>
The nonphotochromogenic (nonchromogenic) mycobacteria do not produce pigment
in either light or dark. Photochromogens produce pigment in light, whereas 
scotochromogens produce pigment in the light or dark. Pigment color may range 
from light yellow to a dark orange (see Web Color Images 7-72 and 7-73). The 
mycobacterial photoreactivity groups are summarized in the table below.

<table>

The growth rate is determined as rapid or slow. Rapid growers produce colonies
in fewer than 7 days. Slow growers require longer than 7 days for production of
colonies. The table at right lists some of the medically significant mycobacterial
species arranged according to pigment groups and growth rate.
<p>
The optimal growth temperature for most <i>Mycobacterium</i> species is

<p>
There are several biochemical tests that are valuable in identification of
the mycobacteria (the table above). Most of these tests are performed only in 
those laboratories that do complete identification. Some tests, such as niacin 
and nitrate tests, are easy to perform and can give presumptive identification 
of <i>M. tuberculosis</i>.
<ul>
<li>Niacin accumulation is detected by measuring nicotinic acid, which reacts
with cyanogen bromide in the presence of aniline to form a yellow compound.
<li>Nitrate reduction is performed as with the method used for En
terobacteriaceae. A positive test is a red pigment.
<li>All mycobacteria are catalase-positive (see Web Color Image 7-11). The
quantity of catalase and production of heat-stable catalase are s
pecies-specific. Semiquantitative catalase production (see Web Color Image 7-74)
 is determined by measuring the height of the column of bubbles when hydrogen 
peroxide and Tween 80 are added to a deep with mycobacterial growth. Catalase 
heat stability is determined by heating the specimen to 68&deg;C for 20 minutes 
prior to the addition of hydrogen peroxide. Production of bubbles is a positive 
reaction.
<li>Tween hydrolysis measures the presence of a lipase. Hydrolysis causes a
pink color change.
<li>NaCl tolerance is determined by inoculating an egg-based media with 5% NaCl
and observing growth or no growth following incubation.
<li>Iron uptake is determined by adding ferric ammonium citrate to the
mycobacterial colonies. Dusty-brown colonies are a positive reaction for iron
uptake and the formation of iron oxide.
<li>Arylsulfatase activity is detected by adding phenolphthalein to the
colony/substrate mixture and observing the formation of a pink color.
<li>The urease test detects an organism's ability to produce urease and
hydrolyze urea to form ammonia, which produces an alkaline reaction. The 
increase in pH is detected by a change of color to pink or red.
<li>Susceptibility to thiophen-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide (TCH) is determined
by observing growth or no growth of mycobacteria following incubation with this 
compound.
<li>Nucleic acid amplification is available for identification of some species
of mycobacteria, including MTB complex and MAC complex, Specificity is very good,
but use with clinical specimens may give false-negative results. Identification
with this technique is usually performed in reference laboratories.
<li>Gas-liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography are
methods to analyze mycobacterial lipids.
</ul>

<h3><i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i></h3>
<p>
This organism is a member of the MTB complex. MTB causes tuberculosis (TB), a
pulmonary infection transmitted by the inhalation of droplet nuclei. <i>M. 
bovis</i> causes tuberculosis in humans, cattle, and other animals.

Primary tuberculosis is the initial infection. The <i>Mycobacterium</i> is
eradicated by the host cellular immune response or walled off in a granuloma in
the lung. Reactivation of latent infections can occur in immunocompromised
individuals and cause secondary tuberculosis. <b>Miliary TB</b> is a
disseminated infection with multiple organ involvement. <b>Pott's disease</b>
is military tuberculosis in the bones or spine.
<p>
The tuberculin skin test is used to detect MTB-infected individuals. A purified
protein derivative (PPD) is the MTB antigen. A hypersensitivity reaction at the
injection site within 72 hours is a positive test.  A positive skin test does
not distinguish patients with active disease from those with latent infections.

Identifying characteristics of <i>M. tuberculosis</i>: slow growth,
nonchromogenic, <q>serpentine cording,</q> niacin accumulation-positive,
nitrate-positive, and susceptible to NAP. Web Color Image 7-75 depicts a
Kinyoun acid-fast stain with the characteristic cell aggregates of <i>M.
tuberculosis</i>, due to the cording factor.

<h3><i>Mycobacterium avium</i> comlex (MAC)</i></h3>
<p>
The complex consists of the environmental organisms <i>M. avium</i> and <i>M.
intracellulare</i>. It may colonize healthy individuals or cause opportunistic
infections in immunocompromised individuals.
<p>
It is most commonly associated with disseminated disease in AIDS patients.
<p>
Identifying characteristics of MAC: slow growth, semiquantitave catalase &gt;
45 mm, and most are tellurite-positive. Otherwise, it is relatively inactive 
biochemically.
<p>
The <b><i>Mycobacterium</i> other than tuberculosis (MOTT)</b> include several
species that are environmental organisms that may colonize individuals or cause 
a variety of opportunistic infections. They are classified according to growth 
rate and photosensitivity. The mycobacteria are also know as <q>atypical 
mycobacteria</q> or NTM, mycobacteria other than the tuberculoid mycobacteria.

<h3><i>Mycobacterium leprae</i></h3>
<p>
This is the etiologic agent of <b>leprosy</b> or <b>Hansen's disease</b>. The
<i>Mycobacterium</i> cannot be cultured in vitro, but can be grown in mouse
footpads or the armadillos.
<p>
Identifying characteristics of select <i>Mycobacterium</i> species are summarized
in Table 7- 25. Infections caused by mycobacteria are summarized in Table 7-26.

<h2>Anaerobes</h2>
<p>
Anaerobes constitute the majority of bacteria found in and on the human host.
Obligate anaerobes grow in the absence of oxygen and vary in their tolerance to 
oxygen. Oxygen and its derivatives (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) are toxic. Most 
require a low redox potential, because an environment with a high redox 
potential is oxidized and harmful to anaerobic bacteria. These bacteria can be 
divided into moderate and strict anaerobes. The majority of medically 
significant anaerobes are moderate anaerobes.
<p>
Anaerobes are classed as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Moderate obligate anaerobes</b> can tolerate an atmosphere containing
low levels of oxygen (2%-8%).
<li><b>Strict obligate anaerobes</b> are killed by exposure to oxygen. They
cannot tolerate more than 0.5% oxygen.
<li><b>Aerotolerant anaerobes</b> grow very poorly in ambient air (21% oxygen),
but grow well under anaerobic conditions.
<li><b>Facultative anaerobes</b> can grow aerobically and anaerobically.
</ul>

<p>
Direct examination of a specimen using Gram's stain is very helpful. Typical
anaerobe morphology (pleomorphic rods; gram-positive, boxcar-shaped cells; thin 
rods with pointed ends) may be evident. Also, a positive Gram's stain with 
negative aerobic culture results may indicate the need for anaerobic culture. 
If aerobic and anaerobic cultures have been performed, negative results may 
indicate a problem with collection, transport, or culture conditions. The 
Gram's stain can also determine the culture conditions and media to be used. 
A list of the commonly isolated anaerobes with their gram reactions are listed
in the table above. The table below summarizes the microscopic morphology of 
the more common anaerobes.

<p>
The media that are used to grow and identify anaerobes are as follows.
Anaerobic bacteria grow best on pre-reduced, anaerobically sterilized media 
(PRAS) that are sterilized and stored under anaerobic conditions. Culture media 
may be enriched with hemin and vitamin K.
<ul>
<li><b>Anaerobic sheep blood agar</b> is a general growth medium for all
anaerobes. It is supplemented with vitamin K and hemin, and the type of agar 
base may vary (e.g., Columbia, Schaedler, brain-heart infusion). <b>CDC blood 
agar</b> and <b>Brucella blood agar (BRU-BA)</b> are most commonly used as 
all-purpose, direct plating media.
<li><b>Bacteroides bile esculin (BBE) agar</b> is used for the selection and
presumptive identification of <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> group. The high 
concentration of bile is inhibitory to other organisms. Colonies of the B. 
fragilis group hydrolyze esculin and appear black, surrounded by a black halo 
(see Web Color Image 7-76).
<li><b>Phenylethyl alcohol blood agar (anaPEA)</b> inhibits the gram-negative
facultative bacilli, whereas most anaerobes grow well on the medium.
<li><b>Kanamycin-vancomycin laked blood agar (KVLB)</b> selects for <i>
Prevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>. Other gram-positive and gram-negative 
rods are inhibited by the kanamycin and vancomycin. Laked blood enhances 
production of a brown-black pigment by certain Prevotella species.
<li><b>Egg-yolk agar</b> is used to determine if an isolate produces <b>
lecithinase</b> or <b>lipase</b>. The lecithin in egg yolk is split by 
lecithinase, which results in an opaque halo around the colony (see Web Color 
Image 7-77). Lipase degrades triglycerides into glycerol and free fatty acids, 
and is detected by observing an oily or <q>mother-of-pearl</q> sheen on the 
colony surface (see Web Color Image 7-78). Proteolysis results in a small clear 
halo around the colonial growth.
<li><b>Cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar (CCFA)</b> is a selective and
differential medium for the isolation of <i>Clostridium difficile</i>. The 
organism produces characteristic yellow, ground-glass colonies on CCFA (see Web 
Color Image 7-79).
</ul>

<p>
Tests used for the identification of anaerobes are as follows.
<ul>
<li>The <b>catalase test</b> for anaerobes uses 15% hydrogen peroxide instead
of 3%.
<li>A <b>spot indole test</b> is easily and quickly performed. This test uses
p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde as the developing reagent.  A blue color is
produced when the test is positive (see Web Color Image 7-80).
<li>Special potency <b>antibiotic disks</b> can be very helpful in the
identification of anaerobic bacteria. The susceptibility of anaerobes to <b>
colistin</b> (10 &micro;g), <b>vancomycin</b> (5 &micro;g), and <b>kanamycin</b>
 (1 mg) varies. Most gram-negative anaerobes are resistant to vancomycin, while 
most gram-positive anaerobes are susceptible to vancomycin and resistant to 
colistin. Gram-negative anaerobes vary in their susceptibility to colistin.
<li>Growth in 20% <b>bile</b> separates the bile-resistant <i>B. fragilis</i>
group from <i>Prevotella</i>. Bile disks, broth, or bile-containing agar can be
used to perform the test. <b>Esculin hydrolysis</b> (see Web Color Image 7-76)
is often detected with the same agar, and the reaction may also be helpful in
the identification of anaerobic gram-negative rods.
<li>Susceptibility to a 1-mg <b>sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS) disk</b> is
characteristic of <i>Peptostreptococcus anaerobius</i>.
<li>The <b>nitrate test</b> is performed with a disk placed on an inoculated
anaBAP with the test organism. Following incubation, sulfanilic acid, 
dimethyl-&alpha;-naphthylamine, and zinc (if necessary) are added to the disk. 
The test is interpreted in the same manner as the tube test.
<li>A <b>reverse CAMP test</b> identifies <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>. In
this test, the <i>Clostridium</i> isolate is streaked perpendicular to a known 
group B <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>. A positive test demonstrates 
characteristic arrowhead hemolysis.
<li>The <b>Nagler Test</b> is a laboratory test for the detection of <b>
lecithinase</b>. This test uses <i>C. perfringens</i> type A antitoxin to 
neutralize lecithinase. The antitoxin inhibits the lecithinase reaction on 
egg-yolk agar. The test has been used for the presumptive identification of <i> 
C. perfringens</i>. However, it is not used as frequently, because other <i> 
Clostridium</i> species are now known to be Nagler test-positive. 9. 
Lecithinase, lipase, and proteolysis are all detected on egg-yolk agar (Color 
Images 7-77 and 7-78). Characteristic reactions are described above in the 
anaerobic media section.
</ul>
<p>
Alternate methods may be used for the identification of anaerobic bacteria.
<ul>
<li><b>Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC)</b> is used to detect metabolic end
products (e.g., propionic acid, lactic acid) or cellular fatty acids (membrane
components). Certain anaerobic bacteria have a characteristic GLC pattern.
<li>Conventional biochemical tubes (<q>roll-tubes</q>) are the <q>gold
standard</q> and are performed in reference laboratories. PRAS media
supplemented with substrates is used for biochemical testing.
<li>Commercial identification systems are miniaturized biochemical test panels
or rapid enzymatic systems that detect preformed enzymes.

<p>

The characteristics of the more commonly isolated anaerobes, including the
types of infections caused by each, are well established.
<p>
Gram-negative bacilli cause a wide variety of infections. These organisms are
part of the normal flora in the gastrointestinal tract, the female genital
tract, and the oropharynx. Key characteristics of the most common species are
summarized in the table above.
<p>
Members of the <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> group are bile-resistant, and
therefore grow in broth with 20% bile. Growth occurs on BBE agar with 
characteristic black colonies, because the organisms also hydrolyzes esculin 
(see Web Color Image 7-76) with few exceptions. This group of anaerobic 
gram-negative rods is resistant to vancomycin, kanamycin, and colistin. <i>B. 
fragilis</i> is the most common anaerobic isolate. In addition to the above 
characteristics, it is indole-negative and catalase-positive. <i>B. vulgatus</i>,
a member of the <i>B. fragilis</i> group, is indole-negative,
catalase-positive, and esculin-negative.  Presumptive identification of <i>B.
thetaiotaomicron</i> is based on positive indole and catalase reactions.
<p>
The <i>Bacteroides ureolyticus</i> group and Bilophila wadsworthia are
differented from the <i>B. fragilis</i> group in that they are nitrate-positive,
 vancomycin-resistant, kanamycin-susceptible, and colistin-susceptible.
<p>
<i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Porphyromonas</i> are bile sensitive. Most of the
clinically important species are pigmented dark brown or black (see Web Color 
Image 7-81). Laked blood agar enhances pigment production by these anaerobes. 
Both demonstrate a brick-red fluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet light.
<p>
<i>Porphyromonas</i> species are susceptible to vancomycin, whereas other
gramnegative anaerobic bacilli are vancomycin-resistant. <i>Porphyromonas</i> 
species will not grow on kanamycin-vancomycin laked blood agar (KVLB). They 
require hemin and vitamin K for growth.
<p>
<i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> and <i>F. necrophorum</i> are normal flora in
the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. <i>F. nucleatum</i> is a long,
slender, gram-negative rod with tapered ends (see Web Color Image 7-82) and is
indole-positive and lipase-negative. <i>F. necrophorum</i> is a pleomorphic
gram-negative rod that is indole-positive and lipase-positive. Both demonstrate
chartreuse fluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet light.

<p>
The gram-positive bacilli are found as normal flora and are also widely
distributed in the environment (e.g., <i>Clostridium</i> species).
<p>
<i>Clostridium</i> species (table above) cause a wide variety of infections.
These gram-positive bacilli produce endospores that survive in adverse
environmental conditions and germinate when conditions are favorable for
bacterial growth. <i> C. botulinum</i> is the etiologic agent of botulism. The
botulin neurotoxin is the most potent toxin known. <i>C. tetani</i> causes
tetanus (lockjaw). It is characterized by swarming colonies and rods with round,
 terminal spores and a <q>drumstick</q> or <q> tennis racket</q> appearance
(see Web Color Image 7-83). The clinical laboratory has little role in the
diagnosis of either <i>C. botulinum</i> or <i>C. tetani</i>. The diagnosis is
based on the clinical symptoms.
<p>
<i>C. difficile</i> is associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea and
pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics may 
suppress the normal intestinal flora. <i>C. difficile</i>, which produces a 
toxin, is able to proliferate, resulting in diarrhea or colitis. Tests to 
detect <i>C. difficile</i> toxin are available (e.g., tissue culture, latex 
agglutination, enzyme-immunoassay), and may be performed on bacterial isolates 
or stool specimens. Toxin tests should be performed, because not all strains 
are toxigenic. <i>C. difficile</i> has a characteristic <q>horse-stable</q> 
odor, produces yellow, ground-glass colonies on CCFA agar (see Web Color Image 
7-79), and demonstrates a chartreuse fluorescence upon exposure to ultraviolet 
light.
<p>
<b>Gas gangrene (myonecrosis)</b> can be caused by <i>C. perfringens</i>, <i>C.
septicum</i>, <i>C. sporogenes</i>, and <i>C. novyi</i>. Clostridial endospores
are introduced into tissue by trauma or surgery. The spores germinate in vivo,
and the organisms produce gas and cause extensive muscle and tissue necrosis.
<p>
<i>C. perfringens</i> demonstrates a characteristic double-zone hemolysis
(see Web Color Image 7-84) on anaerobic blood agar, is Nagler test-positive, 
lecithinase-positive, and reverse Camp test-positive. Presumptive 
identification of <i>C. perfringens</i> is summarized in the table below.
<p>
<i>C. septicum</i> is nonhemolytic and its colonies swarm and have a
characteristic <q>meduse-head</q> appearance. It is lecithinase-negative and
hydrolyzes esculin.
<p>
The gram-positive, nonspore-forming bacilli are normal flora in various body
sites. Their significance of infections is secondary when compared with infections
caused by the <i>Clostridium</i>.

<i>Actinomyces israelii</i> is the most frequently isolated member of the
anaerobic genus <i>Actinomyces</i>. Infections often involve periodontal
disease. Sulfur granules may be present in exudate. The gram-positive rods have
a pleomorphic, beaded and branching appearance (see Web Color Image 7-85), and
older colonies have a characteristic <q>molar-tooth</q> morphology (see Web
Color Image 7-86).
<p>
<i>Bifidobacterium</i> species are part of the normal intestinal flora. The
rods are pleomorphic and may have two forks. Identification is difficult unless
laboratory personnel are experienced with anaerobes.
<p>
<i>Eubacterium</i> species are normal intestinal and oral flora and also are
difficult to identify. <i>E. lentum</i> is a pleomorphic gram-positive rod and
is nitrate-positive and catalase-negative. Characteristics used for presumptive
identification are summarized in Table 7-31.
<p>
<i>Propionibacterium</i> are common on skin. <i>P. acnes</i> is the most
common isolate. This organism is seen as a contaminant in much the same fashion 
as coagulase-negative staphylococci. The proprionibacteria are often referred 
to as <q>anaerobic diphtheroids.</q> A pleomorphic, gram-positive rod that is 
catalase and indole-positive is presumptively identified as <i>P. acnes</i> 
(Table 7-31).
<p>
<i>Lactobacillus</i> species may be facultative or obligate anaerobes. They
are normal flora of the mouth, intestinal tract, and vagina. The lactobacilli 
are long chains of gram-positive rods and are catalase-negative.
<p>
<i>Mobiluncus</i> species are curved gram-positive rods that stain
gram-variable. They are associated with bacterial vaginosis, a poly-microbial
infection. Microscopic observation of <q>clue cells</q> in vaginal exudates may
be indicative of an infection. <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i> is often associated
with <i>Mobiluncus</i> and bacterial vaginosis.
<p>
Anaerobic cocci are normal flora in the mouth, gastrointestinal tract,
female genital tract, and on the skin. Presumptive identification of the 
anaerobic cocci is simple.
<p>
<i>Veillonella</i> species are anaerobic gram-negative cocci (see Web Color
Image 7-5). They are nitrate-positive, vanco mycin-resistant, and may fluoresce
red upon exposure to ultraviolet light.
<p>
<i>Peptostreptococcus</i> species are anaerobic gram-positive cocci. <i>P.
anaerobius</i> is susceptible to sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). <i>P.
asaccharolyticus</i> is SPS-resistant, indole-positive, and nitrate-negative.
<i>P. indolicus</i> is SPS-resistant, indole-positive, and nitrate-positive.
<p>
<i>Peptococcus niger</i> is the only species in the genus <i>Peptococcus</i>
and is rarely isolated. It is also a gram-positive coccus, demonstrates black 
pigmented colonies, and is catalase-positive.

Zoonotic infections are diseases of animals that infect humans who have
contact with infected animals. Animals are the natural hosts, and transmission 
to humans may be via inhalation, contact with animal secretions, carcasses or 
products, animal bites and scratches, or by arthropod vectors. Refer to the table
above for a list of bacterial agents and associated with zoonotic infections.
The natural host, vector, mode of transmission and associated infections are 
indicated for each bacterium.
<p>
Members of the Family Rickettsiaceae are obligate intracellular pathogens and
causative agents of arthropod-borne human infections (see table below). Animals 
or rodents are the <i>Rickettsia rickettsii</i>, <i>R. typhi</i>, <i>R. 
prowazekii</i>, and <i>R. akari</i>. <b>Rocky mountain spotted fever</b> is 
transmitted by the tick and is caused by <i>R. rickettsii</i>. Humans are 
accidental hosts. <b>Endemic typhus</b>, also called <b>murine typhus</b>, is 
transmitted by rat fleas and caused by <i>R. typhi</i>. Rats are reservoirs, 
whereas humans and other animals are accidental hosts. <b>Epidemic typhus</b> 
is caused by <i>R. prowazekii</i>. The infection is transmitted by lice and 
fleas. Flyinq squirrels and humans are the reservoirs. <b>Rickettsial pox</b>, 
a <b>spotted fever</b>, is transmitted by by mites and caused by <i>R. akari</i>.
The reservoir is the common house mouse.

hosts are dogs, deer, and other mammals. <i>Ehrlichia</i> species are major
veterinary pathogens. Scrub typhus is transmitted by chiggers and rats are the
reservoirs. The etiologic agent is <i>Orientia</i> tsutsugamushi, a major
veterinary pathogen. Q fever is transmitted by ticks or inhalation of infected
dust. It is caused by <i>Coxiella</i> burnettii. Arthropod-borne infections
caused by Rickettsii, <i>Ehrlichia</i>, <i> Orientia</i>, and <i>Coxiella</i>
species are summarized in the table above.

<h2>Agents Of Bioterrorism</h2>
<p>
Many highly infectious bacteria and viruses have been classified as potential
agents of bioterrorism.Amassive outbreak of infection in a population within a
geographic area could result in high rates of morbidity and mortality, as well
as contamination of food supplies, destruction of vegetation, and infections in
livestock. Inhalation of aerosols or ingestion would be the most likely means
of transmission.
<p>
Bioterroristic agents are classified in Categories A, B, or C according to
their pathogenicity. Category A agents are the most infectious because of the 
potential threat to humans and the ease with which these agents can be 
transmitted. These agents are listed in the table below with their respective 
clinical infections.

are classified as BSL-1, BSL-2, BSL-3, and BSL-4. The most infectious agents
are handled only in BSL-4 Laboratories, such as the CDC.

<h2>Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing</h2>
<p>
The changing pattern of antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates makes
susceptibility testing of each isolate increasingly important. The in vitro
results do not always give the complete picture. The antibiotic that should be
used depends on other variables, such as host conditions, site of infection
(e.g., CSF versus urine), route of administration, cost, and side effects.

<div class="box-right" style="width:22em;margin-right:-3em;">
<p class="box-title">Standardization of Susceptibility Testing
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:1em;">
<li>growth medium <li>pH 7.2 to7.4 <li>atmosphere: ambient air, no carbon dioxide
<li>temperature: 35&deg;C <li>inoculum: McFarland 0.5 standard
<li>proper storage of antibiotic disks and MIC panels
<li>quality control: use of stock cultures and regular control runs</ul>
</div>

<p>
An important part of any susceptibility technique is use of a standard inoculum
of bacteria. The most common procedure is to compare the turbidity of the
inoculum with a McFarland turbidity standard. The 0.5 McFarland standard is
usually used, and this is equivalent to 1.5 &times; 108 cfu/mL. The turbidity
of a chemical precipitate in the standard correlates with the number of colony
forming units of the bacterium per milliliter of inoculum. Regardless of the
test used, each susceptibility method is highly standardized. The most commonly
used tests are the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test and the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC). The table below summarizes the antimicrobial
susceptibility test procedures. Box 7-10 defines the areas of standardization
that apply to both the Kirby-Bauer and MIC tests.

<p>
Results may be interpreted according to the following four categories:
<ol>
<li>susceptible: the organism should respond to the usual doses of the drug
<li>moderately susceptible: the isolate may be inhibited by concentrations of a
drug that are achieved when the maximum parenteral doses are given.
<li>intermediate:  the results are equivocal or indeterminate
<li>resistant: the bacterium is not inhibited by achievable concentrations of
drug.
</ol>
<p>
The MIC is the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that inhibits
growth of the organism, as detected by lack of turbidity.
<p>
The antibiotic is added to broth in serial twofold dilutions (e.g., 0.5 &micro;
g, 1.0 &micro;g, 2.0 &micro;g). A standardized inoculum of the test bacterium
is added to each concentration of the antimicrobial agent. The MIC is the
concentration of the first well that shows no growth or turbidity. Most routine
MIC tests use commercially prepared broth microdilution trays with preselected
antibiotics. MIC tube macrodilutions and microdilution trays are depicted in
Web Color Images 7-87 and 7-88, respectively.
<p>
A sterility well monitors contamination. This well should have no growth. A
growth well monitors organism growth and should have growth. If there is
bacterial growth in the sterility well or the absence of growth in the growth
well, the test is invalid and should not be read, but repeated.
<p>
Quality control testing with known bacterial strains (e.g., American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) strains) is performed weekly to ensure the validity
of test results.
<p>
The <b>Kirby-Bauer</b> or <b>disk diffusion</b> (see Web Color Image 7-89)
method measures the diameter of inhibition around an antibiotic-impregnated 
filter paper disk. A standardized bacterial suspension is plated to Mueller 
Hinton agar so as to achieve a confluent <q>lawn of growth.</q> Antibiotic 
disks are dropped on the agar surface. As soon as the disk comes in contact 
with the agar surface, water is absorbed into the filter paper, and the 
antibiotic diffuses into the surrounding medium. The concentration of the 
antibiotic decreases with increased distance from the disk. With overnight 
incubation at 37&deg;C, a zone of inhibition surrounds the antibiotic disk in 
accordance with the bacterium's susceptibility or resistance to the 
antimicrobial agent. If the test is properly performed, the edges of the zone 
of inhibition are clear and easy to measure. There are times when the zone is 
not obvious.
<ul>
<li>Swarming by <i>Proteus</i> may result in a thin film of growth beyond the
outer margin. The zone of swarming should be ignored, and the outer margin
should be measured.
<li>Occasionally, colonies grow within the zone of inhibition. This represents
either resistant mutants or a mixed culture. If the inoculum is a pure culture,
the colonies represent a mutant, and the isolate is considered resistant.
<li>The disks must be placed so that the zones of inhibition do not overlap.
Overlapping zones may interfere with accurate interpretation of the results.
<li>Quality control testing is performed weekly using stock cultures with known
susceptibility results (e.g., ATCC strains).
</ul>
<p>
The <b>minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)</b> measures the lowest
concentration of antibiotic that kills 99.9% of a bacterial isolate. It is used
to demonstrate tolerance to an antibiotic. Tolerance is determined when the MBC
endpoints are five or more twofold dilutions greater than the MIC.
<p>
Synergy describes the enhanced antibacterial activity achieved by using a
combination of two drugs rather than either drug separately. This is helpful
information in treating cases with combination drug therapy (e.g.,
<i>Enterococcus</i>). A checkerboard MIC plate is used. Antibiotics are tested
separately and together at various concentrations with the test bacterium to
determine what concentration of each drug results in synergy.
<p>
The serum bactericidal titer tests the bacterial isolate from the patient with
the patient's own serum (containing the antibiotic). The lowest dilution of
patient serum that kills a standard inoculum of the bacterium is called the
serum bactericidal level. The <b>Schlichter test</b> is the most commonly used
test protocol; however, it is not routinely performed.
<p>
<b>E-test</b> is similar to the disk diffusion test, but produces MIC results.
Agar plates are inoculated in the same manner as those for disk diffusion tests.
 A plastic strip containing a gradient of the antimicrobial agent is placed on
the plate. Following incubation, plates are examined for an elliptical zone of
inhibition to determine the MIC value (see Web Color Image 7-90).
<p>
&beta;-lactamase tests indicate that bacterial isolates produce
&beta;-lactamase, but cannot be used to predict the organism's susceptibility or
resistance to a particular drug. In general, &beta;- lactamase-positive
bacteria are usually resistant to the &beta;-lactam antibiotics. Negative
&beta;-lactamase tests do not mean that an organism is susceptible to the
&beta;-lactam antibiotics. Direct &beta;-lactamase tests are not appropriate
for the Enterobacteriaceae and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.
<p>
Antibiotic levels in serum (e.g., gentamicin, vancomycin) are measured using
immunoassays or other chemical methods to ensure that therapeutic levels of the
antimicrobial agent are achieved in the serum. In addition, such monitoring
ensures that toxic levels of the antibiotic are not present in the serum.
<p>
Antimicrobial agents include antiseptics, antibiotics, sterilants, and
disinfectants. All have the capacity to kill or suppress the growth of
microorganisms. Antibiotics are used to treat infections. These agents may be
natural, semi-synththetic, or synthetic in accordance with how the agents are
produced. Antibiotics may be grouped in accordance with the target site or
mechanism of action. Antibiotic target sites include the following:
<ul>
<li>Interruption of structural integrity: interference with cell wall synthesis
or cell membrane composition (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, 
vancomycin, and polymyxins)
<li>Inhibition of protein synthesis (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines,
macrolides, chloramphenicol)
<li>Interference with nucleic acid metabolism (e.g., rifampin, metronidazole,
nalidixic acid, fluorinated quinolones)
<li>Inhibition of essential metabolites (e.g., sulfonamides, trimethoprim,
septra/bactrim).
</ul>
<p>
Some nonfastidious bacteria may require specials procedures to detect
clinically significant antibiotic resistance.
<ul>
<li><i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>
 <ul>
 <li> Methicillin-resistant (oxacillin-resistant) <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA or ORSA)
 are resistant to the penicillinase-resistant penicillins, the drug class of
choice for treating staphylococcal infections. The resistance is due to the
presence of a penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a or PBP'2) that is encoded by
the mecA gene. Oxacillin screening with Mueller Hinton agar supplemented with
4% NaCl and 6 &micro;g/mL oxacillin is used to detect MRSA. MRSA grows on the
medium, whereas methicillin-susceptible strains are inhibited.
 <li>Although uncommon, vancomycin-intermediate <i>S. aureus</i> (VISA) and
vancomycin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (VRSA) have apparently acquired a plasmid 
containing a plasmid containing the vanA vancomycin-resistant gene from 
vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The CLSI recommends use of broth 
microdilution (MIC) tests or vancomycin screening agar (BHI with 6 &micro;g/mL 
vancomycin) for detection of these bacteria.
  <li>If a staphylococcal isolate is erythromycin-resistant but clin
damycin-susceptible, the D-zone test must be performed for detection of 
inducible clindamycin resistance. The test is a disk diffusion test in which 
erythromycin and clindamycin disks are placed adjacent to each other on an 
inoculated agar plate. Following overnight incubation, a flattened clindamycin 
zone between the two disks indicates inducible clindamycin resistance due to 
the erm gene. The isolate must be reported as clindamycin-resistant. No 
flattening indicated the isolate is erythromycin-resistant only (due to msrA 
gene), and susceptible to clindaymcin.
 </ul>
<li><i>Enterococcus</i> species
 <ul>
 <li>Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) contain the vanA vancomycin-resistant
gene that encodes for resistance. These are detected by use of the vancomycin
agar screen agar plate (BHI with 6 &micro;g/mL vancomycin).
 <li>High-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci is detected by use of
broth, agar, or disk diffusion methods, testing for gentamycin and streptomycin
resistance.
 </ul>
<li>Resistance to later-generation penicillins, cephalosporins and aztreonam is
due to extended spectrum &beta;-lactamases (ESBLs) in <i>Klebsiella</i> species 
and <i>E. coli</i>. ESBL production is detected by disk diffusion screening or MIC 
breakpoints with the used of <q>indicator drugs,</q> followed by confirmatory
testing. ESBL-producing strains should be reported as clinically resistant to
all cephalosporins, penicillins, and aztreonam, regardless of in vitro
susceptibility test results.
</ul>

<h2>Disinfection And Sterilization</h2>
<p>
Disinfection is the elimination of a defined scope of microorganisms, including
some spores. Disinfectants are chemical agents applied to inanimate objects.
Antiseptics are applied to the skin to eliminate or reduce the numbers of
bacteria present. These agents do not kill spores. Pasteurization &amp; boiling
achieve disinfection but not sterilization, as endospores are are not destroyed.
<p>
Sterilization refers to the destruction of all life forms, including bacterial
spores. There are chemical and physical means of sterilization. Physical means
of sterilization include moist heat (autoclaves-heat under steam pressure) dry
heat, filtration, and radiation. Chemical agents used for sterilization are
known as chemosterilizers. These agents damage the bacterial cytoplasmic
membranes, destroy cellular proteins, or damage bacterial RNA and DNA.

<h2>Molecular Testing</h2>
<p>
The increased use of molecular diagnostic techniques in the clinical
laboratory is, in part, due to the increased sensitivity and specificity of 
these assays over routine culture techniques. The techniques allow for rapid 
detection of microorganisms and rapid answers for treatment options. 
Antibimicrobial resistance can be determined by the detection of resistance 
genes (e.g., the vanA gene in vancomycin-resistant enterococci). Three basic 
diagnostic techniques are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Nucleic acid hybridization techniques: detection of nucleic acid targets
with labeled probes
<li>Amplification techniques: exponential increase of the target nucleic acid or
the signal that binds to the target nucleic (e.g., PCR).
<li>Strain typing techniques: used in epidemiologic studies to determine strain
similarities in outbreaks
</ol>
<p>
The simultaneous detection of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> and <i>Neisseria
gonorrhoeae</i> from the same specimen is one example of molecular testing in
use in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Refer to the chapter on molecular
testing for a summary of diagnostic molecular procedures in the clinical
laboratory.

<!-- ====== Clinical Parasitology, Mycology and Virology ==================== -->

<h1>Clinical Parasitology. Mycology, and Virology</h1>

<h2>Parasitology</h2>
<p>
<b>Parasitism</b> is a symbiotic relationship in which one animal, the host, is
injured through the activities of the other animal, the parasite. Parasites of 
medical significance belong to four phyla: Protozoa, Platyhelminthes, 
Aschelminthes, and Arthropoda.

<h3>Protozoa</h3>
<p>
The protozoa are unicellular eukaryotes with organelles involved in nutrition
or locomotion. The <b>trophozoites</b> represent a growth stage, feeding by
engulfing particles and moving by flagella, cilia, or pseudopodia. The <b>
cyst</b> stage is more resistant to harsh environvments and typically is the
form shed in stools and transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
<p>
<i>Sarcodina</i> is a subphylum including the amoebae, organisms which move by
means of cytoplasmic protrusions called pseudopodia. <i>Entamoeba
histolytica</i> is the most medically significant species in this group, the
etiology for many illnesses:

<ul>
<li>amebic dysentery
<li>amebic liver abscess
<li>amebiasis
</ul>
<p>
Other species in this group are nonpathogenic commensals: <i>Entamoeba coli</i>,
 <i>Entamoeba hartmanni</i>, <i>Entamoeba gingivalis</i>, <i>Iodamoeba b&uuml;
tschlii</i>, and <i>Endolimax nana</i> are considered commensals. Identifying 
structures are summarized in Figure 8-1.
<p>
<i>Sporozoa</i> is a class that includes primarily tissue parasites with an
involved life cycle that alternates between sexual and asexual generations.
<i>Plasmodium</i> species are found as blood parasites and cause the disease 
malaria. <i>Toxoplasma</i>, <i>Pneumocystis</i>, and <i>Sarcocystis</i> species 
are spread throughout various organs and tissues. <i>Isospora</i> species 
colonize the intestinal mucosa.
<p>
<i>Plasmodium</i> are intracellular parasites causing malaria. The anopheline
mosquitoes are definitive hosts of these malarial parasites. The female
mosquito first must bite a human who is infected with malaria. Sexual
reproduction occurs within the mosquito with the development of <b>
sporozoites</b>. Sporozoites enter the salivary glands of the mosquito and are
inoculated into the next person bitten. The sporozoites enter the liver and
begin an asexual maturation stage. After several generations have developed,
they invade the red blood cells (RBCs). The four species of <i>Plasmodium</i>
are: <i>P. vivax</i> (benign tertian malaria), <i>P. falciparum</i> (malignant
tertian or subtertian malaria), <i>P. malariae</i> (quartan malaria), and <i>P.
ovale</i> (ovale malaria).

 Figure 8-1 Differentiation of Entamoeba histolytica and <i>E. coli</i>.

<ul>

<li>Early forms of <i>P. vivax</i> in the RBC are <b>trophozoites</b>, which
have a signet-ring shape. Later stages demonstrate fine red granules known as 
Sch&uuml;ffner's dots. RBCs continue to enlarge, and the mature trophozoites 
begin division (at this point, they are referred to as schizonts). Schizonts 
mature into merozoites. The infected RBCs finally rupture to release merozoites 
to infect more RBCs.
<li><i>P. falciparum</i> <b>gametocytes</b> are elongated or banana-shaped
compared to the ovoid morphology of the other Plasmodium species. The two
stages observed are the young trophozoites and gametocytes. The young
trophozoites are tiny ring forms. In later stages, Maurer's dots (coarse red
granules) are formed. Gametocytes have a distinct crescent shape.
<li><i>P. malariae</i> trophozoites demonstrate a band form. Schizonts mature
into merozoites.
<li>P. ovale demonstrates ovoid infected RBCs with early ring forms. Sch&uuml;
ffner's dots are present. In later stages, an average of 14 to 16 merozoites is
observed.
</ul>
<p>
<i>Toxoplasma</i>. The definitive host is the cat. <b>Oocysts</b> (containing
two <b>sporocysts</b>) are passed in the feces. Transmission to humans occurs 
from consumption or handling of infected meat or from contact with cat feces in 
litter pans or soil. Serology is used for differential diagnosis.
<p>
<i>Isospora belli</i> is characterized by release of immature oocysts from the
intestinal wall.  Maturation of the oocyst occurs in the stool. The organism (30 
&micro;m) has an ellipsoid shape and contains two <b>sporoblasts</b>. Recovery
is better with the zinc sulfate concentration technique.
<p>
<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> causes chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised
hosts. Diagnosis of <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> is based on observation of oocysts 
in the stool or biopsy material. Recovery of the acid-fast oocysts can be 
achieved by the <b>sugar flotation procedure</b>. Serologic testing allows for 
direct detection of the organism in fecal specimens.

 Figure 8-2 Hemoflagellate forms.

<p>
<b>Mastigophora</b> is a subphylum whose members move by means of specialized
flagella (Figure 8-2). The number and position of the flagella vary according
to species. The <i>Trypanosoma</i> are the blood flagellates. The <i>
Leishmania</i> are the tissue flagellates. <i>Giardia</i> and <i>Dientamoeba
fragilis</i> are intestinal flagellates, and <i>Trichomonas</i> can be
medically significant in the genitourinary tract. <i>Chilomastix</i> is
typically considered commensal.
<p>
<i>Trypanosoma</i> make up three medically significant hemoflagellates.
<ol>
<li><i>T. brucei gambiense</i> causes West African sleeping sickness and
transmitted by the tsetse fly (<i>Glossina</i>). The <b>trypomastigotes</b>
reside in the bloodstream, lymphatics, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). They are
slender-bodied organisms with long, free flagella and an attached undulating
membrane. A <b>kinetoplast</b> is posteriorly located, and the nucleus has a
central karyosome.
<li><i>T. brucei rhodesiense</i> causes East African sleeping sickness
and is a virulent form of <b>trypanosomiasis</b> also transmitted by
the tsetse fly. Its structure is difficult to distinguish from
<i>T. gambiense</i>.
<li><i>T. cruzi</i> is the causative agent of Chagas' disease. The reservoir
of this organism is infected wild rodents. An intermediate
host is the <b>reduviid bug</b> contained in rodent feces (not from bites). The
trypanosome in blood smears has a <q>C</q> or <q>S</q> shape, a large kinetoplast,
and a delicate undulating membrane. The <b>amastigote</b> stage is observed in
cardiac muscle and other tissues.
</ol>
<p>
There are four major species of <i>Leishmania</i> that are pathogenic. They all
have an intermediate host vector which is a sandfly (<i>Phlebotomus</i> spp.). 
The <b>amastigote</b> form is observed in man, and the <b>promastigote</b> form 
resides in the gut of the sandfly.
<ol>
<li><i>L. tropica</i> causes Old World leishmaniasis or cutaneous leishmaniasis
or <q>Oriental sore</q>.  It has a round amastigote form that can be observed
in monocytic cells. It also has a rod-shaped kinetoplast with a single nucleus.
<li><i>L. mexicana</i> causes New World leishmaniasis or cutaneous leishmaniasis
and has the same structure as <i>L. tropica</i>.
<li><i>L. braziliensis</i> causes mucocutaneous leishmaniasis or <q>espundia</q>
and results in disfiguration.
<li><i>L. donovani</i> causes <q>Kala-Azar</q>, or visceral leishmaniasis.
It demonstrates diffuse parasitization of the reticuloendothelial system.
The amastigote resides within phagocytic cells and causes enlargement of the
spleen, liver, and lymph nodes.
</ol>
<p>
<i>Giardia lamblia</i> (Figure 8-3) is the causative agent of <b>giardiasis</b>,
which is the most common waterborne diarrheal disease in the United States.
The structure of the trophozoite is pear-shaped (9-16 &micro;m).  <i>G. lamblia</i>
features the following:
<ul>
<li>four pairs of flagella
<li>two prominent nuclei
<li>an <b>axostile</b>
<li>an oval, concave-sucking disk (<q>old man with glasses</q>)
</ul>
<p>
Motility is described as <q>falling leaf.</q>  The cyst is the infective stage
and is ovoid (9-12 &micro;m) and contains two to four nuclei, as well as
two longitudinal fibrils in the center.

 Figure 8-3 Intestinal and urogenital protozoan parasites.

<p>
<b>Trichomonas</b> has three morphologically similar members that are
pathogenic: <i>T. tenax, T. hominis,</i> and <i>T. vaginalis</i>. Trichomonads
appear only in the trophozoite form, which is the transmissible form. <i>T.
vaginalis</i> (Figure 8-3) is one of the main causes of sexually transmitted
vaginitis. Differential diagnosis requires a saline wet mount of genitourinary
tract specimens. Trophozoites are pear-shaped with an undulating membrane. They
demonstrate a jerky, swift motility.
<p>
<i>Chilomastix mesnili</i> is a commensal organism, with pear-shaped trophozoite
form featuring three anterior flagella and visible nucleus, and the cyst
a lemon-shaped form with large nucleus and a large karyosome.
<p>
4In the <b>Ciliata</b>, <i>Balantidium coli</i> (Figure 8-3) has short,
bristle-like cilia. It is the largest
protozoan to infects humans, causing a dysentery.  The 60 &micro;m trophozoite
has two nuclei, and the cilia surrounds the organism.  The 50 &micro;m cyst
has a macronuclei and a micronuclei.  Cilia surround the membrane.

<h3>Platyhelminthes</h3>
<p>
The Platyhelminthes, or flatworms, are multicellular animals characterized by a
flat, bilaterally symmetric body. Generally, the flat-worms are hermaphroditic.
The two medically significant classes are <i>Trematoda</i> and <i>Cestoda</i>.
<p>
The trematodes feature <b>flukes</b> with attachment organs in the form of
hooks or cup-shaped suckers. The medically significant, order is <i>Digenea</i>,
with life cycles that have at least one intermediate molluscan host.
<p>
<i>Fasciolopsis buski</i> have reservoirs in pigs, dogs, and rabbits, and
snails are intermediate hosts. Transmission is by ingestion of <b>
metacercariae</b> encysted on freshwater vegetation (bamboo shoots, water 
chestnuts) which are then consumed raw. The ellipsoid egg is approximately 130 
&micro;m, with a small <b>operculum</b> at the pointed end.
<p>
<i>Heterophyes heterophyes</i> and <i>Metagonimus yokogawai</i>. Transmission
is through ingestion of raw or pickled freshwater fish.  The metacercariae
encyst under the scales or in the flesh of the fish. The egg is approximately
30 &micro;m; it possesses prominent opercular shoulders.
<p>
<i>Clonorchis sinensis</i> is the Chinese liver fluke is approximately
30 &micro;m. Transmission occurs with the consumption of freshwater fish
containing the encysted metacercariae. The adult worm harbors in the liver
and sheds eggs into the feces.  The eggs resemble <i>Heterophyes</i> but have
a small comma-shaped process at the abopercular end.
<p>
<b>Fasciola hepatica</b> is the sheep liver fluke in which infection occurs by
consuming contaminated aquatic vegetation (metacercariae encyst watercress).
Eggs are observed in the feces and are difficult to distinguish from <i>
Fasciolopsis</i>. The eggs are operculated and measure 130 &micro;m.
<p>
The <i>Schistosoma</i> are composed of three medically significant schistosomes,
 which are not hermaphroditic, but rather dioecious. Eggs are not operculated.
Hatched <b>miracidium</b> swim in search of the appropriate snail host. The <b>
cercariae</b> infect humans. Schistosomes directly penetrate the skin to invade
the circulatory system. The final locations differ for the host species.
<ul>
<li><i>S. mansoni</i>. Eggs are isolated from the feces. They are elongated,
ovoid, and possess a large lateral spine that is shaped like a thorn and
projects from the side of the egg near one end. These eggs measure
approximately 150 &micro;m.
<li><i>S. japonicum</i>. Eggs are isolated from the feces. They are spherical
in shape and possess a small lateral spine (sometimes this is absent or very 
difficult to view). These organisms measure approximately 65 &micro;m.
<li><i>S. haematobium</i> is the cause of urinary schistosomiasis. Eggs are
isolated in urine or in a biopsy of the bladder. The eggs have a terminal spine
and measure approximately 150 &micro;m.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Paragonimus westermani</b> is the lung fluke and is transmitted by the
ingestion of raw or improperly cooked crayfish or fresh-water crabs encysted
with the metacercarial stage. The eggs are discharged into the bronchi or
bronchioles; they can be expectorated in sputum or, if swallowed, appear in the
feces. The ovoid eggs have raised opercular shoulders and measure approximately
100 &micro;m.

<p>

<b>Cestoda</b>. The tapeworms have elongated segmented (proglottid) bodies with
a scolex (specialized attachment organ). They inhabit and gain nourishment from 
the small intestine. All cestodes of man have four muscular, cup-shaped suckers 
on the scolex, and a rostellum that can be armed with hooks. Transmission 
occurs when infective larvae are accidentally ingested with food.
<p>
<i>Diphyllobothrium latum</i> selectively absorbs vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from
the host's intestinal tract. The primary intermediate host is the ciliated <b>
coracidium larvae</b> (which has ingested the <i>D. latum</i> eggs). The larvae 
are ingested by copepods (<i>D. latum</i> develops and forms larvae). These 
infected copepods are then ingested by fish, and <i>D. latum</i> grows within 
the flesh of the fish to the <b>plerocercoid larva</b> stage. Only if the
infected fish is ingested by man will the larva pass into the intestine and
develop into adulthood. The adult worm <b>scolex</b> is elongated, spoon shaped,
 and has two longitudinal grooves. The uterus, within the <b>proglottid</b>,
has a unique morphology and forms a rosette. The eggs are ovoid with an
operculum and a thick, smooth shell. They are approximately 70 &micro;m.
<p>
<i>Taenia solium</i> is the pork tapeworm and is transmitted by ingesting cured
or undercooked pork. Embryonated eggs are ingested by the intermediate host
(the pig) and develop into the infective larval stage, or <b>cysticerci</b>, in
the muscles. Humans ingest the cysticerci; the larvae develop, and the scolex
attaches to the intestinal wall and begins to develop proglottids
(cysticercosis). The adult worm scolex has four suckers and a double crown of
hooks (armed rostellum). Differential diagnosis is by observation of 7-13
branches of the central uterine stem in a gravid segment. The egg contains the
oncosphere. A thick coat, called the embryophore, is a dark color, and is
radially striated. Observation of Taenia eggs cannot differentiate <i>T.
solium</i> from <i>T. saginata</i>.

<p>
<i>Taenia saginata</i> is the beef tapeworm transmitted by the ingestion of raw
or insufficiently cooked beef. Embryonated eggs are ingested by cattle and 
develop in the flesh into the infective cysticercus stage. (<i>T. saginata</i> 
does not cause cystercosis of humans.) The adult worm scolex has four suckers 
with a small rostellum that has no hooks (unarmed rostellum). The gravid 
segment is longer in <i>T. saginata</i>, and there are 15 to 20 branches off of 
the central uterine stem. Morphology of the eggs of <i>T. saginata</i> is 
similar to that of <i>T. solium</i>.
<p>
<i>Echinococcus granulosus</i> is the <b>minute tapeworm</b> and lives as an
adult in the intestines of the <i>Canidae</i>. Intermediate hosts are typically
herbivores (e.g., sheep, goats). The human is an accidental intermediate host.
Humans can ingest the eggs, which hatch and develop into oncospheres. The
oncospheres penetrate the intestinal mucosa, enter the circulation, and
progress to the liver. A <b>hydatid cyst</b> begins to develop, with buds
forming on the cyst. The cysts contain <b>protoscolices</b>, which appear as <b>
 hydatid sand</b> when the cyst begins to break down. The adult worm has a
scolex (with six hooklets) and three proglottids. Eggs cannot be differentiated
from <i>Taenia</i> eggs.
<p>
<i>Hymenolepis nana</i> is the <b>dwarf tapeworm</b>, and transmitted to humans
by ingestion of the egg, which develops into the adult worm in the intestines 
of the human. The reservoir is the house mouse. The adult worm has a scolex 
with four suckers and a rostellum armed with a circle of hooks. The eggs are 
ovoid and have a thin, smooth outer shell with two polar thickenings or knobs 
that have fine filaments (4-8) that are difficult to observe. The eggs are 
approximately 40 &micro;m.
<p>
<b>Hymenolepis diminuta</b> transmission is through ingestion of infected
insects from flour contaminated by the droppings of infected rats. Larvae grow 
into adults in the intestine of humans. Adult worms have a scolex with four 
suckers and an <q>unarmed</q> <b>rostellum</b>. Eggs are ovoid with a thick 
shell that also has two polar knobs, but no filaments.

<h3>Phylum Aschelminthes</h3>
<p>
The medically significant class is <b>Nematoda</b>, the roundworms. They posses
a stiff cuticle, and the sexes are separate. The roundworms can inhabit the 
intestines, the blood, or the tissues. The <b>filariae</b> are thread-like 
worms that inhabit the human lymphatic system, as well as subcutaneous and deep 
connective tissues. All of the filariae require an arthropod intermediate host 
for transmission of infection. Some species demonstrate periodicity. That is, 
they appear in the blood at specific times of the day.
<p>
<i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, like all <i>Ascaris</i> has a complex life cycle.
After the fully embryonated eggs are ingested, they hatch in the intestines and
begin to migrate (up to 20 days) through the blood and lymphatic system. They
finally reach the esophagus and once again enter the intestines, where the
mature worm then begins to lay eggs. The adult female worm is 30 cm long and is
as thick as a lead pencil. The adult male worm is 25 cm long and is slender
with an <q>incurved tail.</q> The eggs are broadly oval with a rough outer
coating, an albuminoid coat. They are referred to as fertilized <b>
corticated</b> eggs. Decorticated eggs have a thick, smooth shell. Infertile
eggs are narrow and have a thin shell (corticated or decorticated).
<p>
<i>Enterobius vermicularis</i> is the pinworm, the most common helminth
parasite in modern countries. Transmission is by ingestion of the eggs, which 
pass to the intestine and begin development. The females migrate down the 
intestinal tract to pass out of the anus and deposit their eggs. The cellophane 
tape preparation is useful for diagnosis. Typically, the eggs are not observed 
in the feces. The adult female worm can reach 13 mm, with a long, thin, sharply 
pointed tail. The adult male worm reaches 5 mm. The eggs are 50 &micro;m and 
have a translucent shell that is flattened on one side (football appearance).
<p>
<i>Trichuris trichiura</i> is the whipworm, and it is acquired through
ingestion of embryonated eggs. It can cause rectal prolapse and nutritional 
deficiencies in children. The female worm measures 3 to 5 cm and is typically 
longer than the male. The eggs are 50 &micro;m and have bipolar plugs.

<p>

<i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i> is the Old World hookworm. Its eggs are deposited
into moist sandy soil, and within 24 to 48 hours rhabditiform larvae develop 
and hatch. Further development transforms the larvae into the <a
href="http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/images/hookfila.jpg">infective
filariform larvae</a>. The filariform penetrate the skin of humans. Humans may
develop ground itch at the site of penetration. Hookworm infestation is 
associated with iron deficiency anemia. The <a
href="http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/images/aduodmf.jpg">female adult
worm</a> is grayish white with a <a
href="http://www.nematode.net/NN3_frontpage.cgi?navbar_selection=speciestable&amp;subnav_selection=Ancylostoma_duodenale">buccal
cavity that has four teeth</a>. The <a
href="http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/images/aduodmf.jpg">male adult worm</a>
is smaller, has a prominent copulatory bursa in the posterior. The eggs of
<i>A. duodenale</i> and <i>N. americanus</i> cannot be differentiated.
The eggs are approximately 50 &micro;m with a thin, smooth colorless shell.
Clearly visible are the two-cell, four-cell, or occasionally eight-cell stage
of embryonic cleavage.

<p>
<i>Necator americanus</i> is the New World hookworm. The adult female worm is 1
cm long, and has a <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/parasites/ParaSites2009/PinedaANDYang_Hookworm/PinedaANDYang_Hookworm.htm">buccal cavity featuring with a pair of cutting plates</a>. The
male worm is smaller than the female worm. The eggs have been described above. 
Hookworm eggs rarely hatch and release the rhabditiform larvae. The larvae can 
be differentiated from <i>Strongyloides</i> larvae by observing the buccal 
cavities. The hookworm buccal cavity has a long capsule between the oral 
opening and the esophagus. The <i>Strongyloides</i> buccal capsule is 
comparatively short.
<p>

<i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i> is the threadworm, less prevalent than the
hookworm and can exist as a free-living nematode. Transmission and life cycle
are similar to the hookworm. The female adult is longer than 2 mm and is
parthenogenic (capable of unisexual reproduction, no fertilization required).
The male is smaller, and may be eliminated from the body early in infection.
The eggs of the threadworm cannot be distinguished from hookworm. The eggs
hatch in the intestine to form the rhabditiform larvae and are usually passed
in the feces.  Occasionally, a few of these larvae transform into the filariform
larvae, which penetrate the mucosa wall, enter the bloodstream, and begin the
migratory cycle again. This is termed <b>autoreinfection</b>.
<p>
<i>Trichostrongylus</i> spp. Very similar to the hookworm but the life cycle
differs in that <i>Trichostrongylus</i> is transmitted by ingestion of
contaminated food. The adult worms are much smaller than the hookworms.
The eggs are much larger than the hookworm eggs (80 &micro;m).
<p>
<i>Trichinella spiralis</i> is acquired by ingesting uncooked pork or bear meat
that contains the encysted larvae. The larvae excyst and penetrate into the 
intestinal mucosa of the host and develop into adult worms. The male and female 
worms mate, and more larvae are produced (intestinal phase). The larvae enter 
the bloodstream and disseminate to the striated muscle, where they encyst, 
causing <b>trichinosis</b> or <b>trichinellosis</b>. Diagnosis is based on 
observation of the encysted larvae in biopsied muscle or postinfection 
serologic testing.
<p>
<i>Dracunculus medinensis</i> called the <b>guinea worm</b> is a parasite of
dogs and other carnivores in North America.  The larvae are ingested by the
intermediate host, a copepod crustacean, into which
it develops into the infective form.  The infective larvae are
ingested in drinking water and migrate to subcutaneous tissues of the host.
The larvae develop into the adult worm.  The female adult migrates to the skin
surface and forms a papule to discharge large numbers of larvae.  It attains
an immense length of 50-80 cm, and about 2 mm diameter. It can be removed
from the papule manually or excised surgically.  The adult male on 1/10 to 1/20
the length of the female (about 1.5-4.0 cm and 0.4 mm diameter).
<p>
<i>Ancylostoma braziliense</i> or <i>A. caninum</i> are the dog hookworms that
occasionally infect humans and cause cutaneous <b>larva migrans</b> or creeping 
eruptions. The larvae penetrate the skin and are unable to complete their 
migratory cycle; therefore, they begin to migrate through the subcutaneous 
tissues.

<p>
<i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i> causes Bancroftian <b>filariasis</b>, <b>
elephantiasis</b>, or <b>Bancrofti's filariasis</b>. Infective larvae enter the 
human host through the proboscis of the <i>Culex</i> or <i>Anopheles</i> 
mosquito. They migrate to the lymphatics (lymph nodes), where mating occurs and 
microfilariae are produced (can be observed in a blood smear).  The
<b>microfilariae</b> are sheathed. The anterior is rounded, and the posterior
tapers to a point. There are no nuclei in the tail.

<p>
<i>Brugia malayi</i> causes Malayan filariasis or elephantiasis is transmitted
by the <i>Mansonia</i> or <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito. Infection is bym igration
through the lymphatics. Microfilariae can be observed in the blood smear.
Microfilariae are sheathed, with two nuclei present in the tip of the tail.
<p>
<i>Loa loa</i>, or the African eyeworm, is transmitted by the Chrysops (fly)
and migrates through the subcutaneous tissues (especially across the
conjunctiva of the eye). Calabar swellings also occur. The microfiliariae can
be observed in the blood. They are sheathed and have a continuous row of
posterior nuclei.
<p>
<i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> is transmitted by the <i>Simulium</i> fly and
migrates through the subcutaneous tissues. They usually settle in groups of two
and become encapsulated to form nodules. These nodules can occur anywhere, but
are typically observed on the patient's scalp. The microfilariae can be
observed in <q>skin snips</q> taken from the nodules. The microfilariae are
unsheathed, with no terminal nuclei, and typically have straight tails.
<p>
<i>Mansonella</i> genus provides three species of interest.
<ul>
<li><i>M. ozzardi</i> is typically a nonpathogenic filaria. The microfiliariae
have no sheaths and no nuclei in their tails.
<li><i>M. streptocerca</i> (formerly <i>Dipetalonema streptocerca</i>) is
pathogenic and transmitted by <b>Culicoides</b>. The microfilariae are observed
only in tissue scrapings. They have no sheaths and have single nuclei in
their tails.
<li><i>M. perstans</i> (formerly <i>D. perstans</i>) is nonpathogenic.
The microfilariae have no sheaths and have paired nuclei in their tails.
</ul>

<h3>Specimen collection, transport, and processing</h3>
<p>
Specimens should be collected in a clean container and must not be contaminated
with urine.
<p>
If not examined within 1 hour, part of the specimen should be preserved in <b>
polyvinyl alcohol</b> (PVA) or <b>10% formalin</b> fixative. PVA is best for
later staining of cysts and trophozoites, while formalin preserves eggs, cysts,
and larvae for wet-mount examination and concentration.
<p>
Three specimens every other day is the optimal number for recovery of parasites.
Saline purges are satisfactory to obtain specimens.  Note: <em>castor and mineral
oils make examination for protozoa impossible</em>.  Specimens also should
not contain radiographic contrast media (e.g., barium salts).
<p>
Specimens should be processed for examination macro- and microscopically, and
a procedure to concentrate them should exist.
<p>
Macroscopic examination should include following:
<ul>
<li>description of specimen consistency:
soft stools suggest the presence of trophozoites or protozoa,
formed stools suggest the presence of cysts
<li>surface should be inspected for tapeworm proglottids or adult pinworms
<li>note the presence of blood or mucus, or both
</ul>
<p>
Microscopic examination should include direct saline and/or iodine mount.
The ocular micrometer should be checked against a calibration for length at
the various magnifications, and a size reported for features of the parasite
infection.
<p>
The fecal concentration technique should be routine.
<ul>
<li>The <b>Ritchie formalin-ether</b> method is the most commonly used
method for concentrating eggs and cysts.
<li>The <b>zinc sulfate flotation</b> method is used to recover oocysts, but is
not appropriate for operculated eggs, schistosomes, or infertile ascarid eggs.
</ul>
<p>
The trichrome stain is a rapid procedure that gives good results for routine
identification of intestinal protozoa in fresh fecal specimens. The specimen
must be fixed with either PVA or Schaudinn's solution.  The cytoplasm of
trophozoites and cysts appears light blue-green or light pink. The karyosomes
stain ruby red.  Degenerated organisms and the background material stain
pale green.

<h2>Mycology</h2>
<p>
Mycology is the study of the eukaryotic fungi, including yeasts, molds, and
mushrooms.  Eukaryotic fungi are non-motile and have definite cell walls.
They lack chlorophyll and absorb nutrients.  <b>Hyphae</b> are branching
filaments of molds and mushrooms.  The <i>mycelium</i> is the mass of
<i>hyphae</i> constructing the <b>thallus</b>, the vegetative
body of a fungus.  Hyphae may be:
<ul>
<li><b>dematiaceous</b> (dark) or <b>hyaline</b> (colorless).
<li>can be septate (with crosswalls) or aseptate.  Aseptate fungi are often
referred to a <b>coenocytic</b>
</ul>
<p>
Hyphae that are vegetative are food-absorbing, and either submerged or on top
of the growth (nutrient agar) substrate. Aerial hyphae extend above the agar
surface and may support reproductive structures, commonly called <b>conidia</b>.
<p>
<b>Pseudohyphae</b> are a series of elongated <b>blastoconidia</b> made by
some yeast. These remain attached to each other and form a hyphal-like structure.
Points of attachment and septations are constricted, while those of true
hyphae are not constricted (characteristic of <i>Candida albicans</i>).
<p>
Spores or conidia may be formed by either an asexual or a sexual process.
The asexual sporulation process has several different types:

<ul>
<li>Conidia are asexual spores formed from a <b>conidiogenous cell</b> or
at the end of <b>conidiophores</b>. The conidial types are used to identify
the <b>Fungi Imperfecti</b>, or phylum <b>Deuteromycota</b>. These fungi
have no known sexual stage.
<li><b>Blastic conidiogenesis</b> results in the production of <b>
blastoconidia</b> that bud from a mother cell. They can elongate to form
pseudohyphae. These conidia are produced by yeasts and some fungi. <b>
Poroconidia</b>, <b>phialoconidia</b>, and <b>annelloconidia</b> are all
produced by blastic conidiogenesis.
<li>In <b>thallic conidiogenesis</b>, the daughter conidium develops after the
formation of a septum near the end of a parent cell. <b>Macroconidia</b> and <b>
microconidia</b> are produced this way and characteristic of the dermatophytic 
fungi.
<li>Arthric conidiogenesis results in the formation of arthroconidia, which
fragment from the hyphal strand at the septation points. This is a type of
thallic conidiogenesis.
<li>Chlamydoconidia, seen in molds, are thick-walled survival conidia that
can occur either at a terminal site (end), an intercalary site (within the
hyphae), or a sessile site (on the sides). These germinate and produce
conidia under favorable environmental conditions.
<li>Sporangiospores are formed by internal cleavage of the contents of a
sporangium, a sac that is supported by a sporangiophore. This type of
free cell formation is characteristic of the Zygomygetes.
</ul>

<p>
Sexual spores are produced by the Perfect Fungi.

<ul>
<li><b>Zygospores</b> are formed by fusion of two compatible hyphal arms. Thye
are surrounded by a thick walled, protective <b>zygosporangium</b>. These
sexual spores are produced by fungi in the phylum <b>Zygomycota</b>.
<li><b>Ascospores</b> are sexual spores produced by fungi in the phylum <b>
Ascomycota</b>. Eight ascospores are inside an <b>ascus</b> that may be
surrounded by a protective <b>ascocarp</b>.
<li><b>Basidiospores</b> are sexual spores that protrude out of a mother cell
called a <b>basidium</b>. The basidiospores and basidium may be protected by an
outer <b>basidiocarp</b>, as in the mushrooms, members of the phylum <b>
Basidiomycota</b>.
</ul>

<h3>Specimen Collection and Transport</h3>
<p>
<i>Collection</i> of specimens for mycologic cultures must include the use of
sterile technique, obtaining and adequate amount, and sampling from the area
most likely affected.
<p>
The transport can depend on specimen type:
<ul>
<li><b>Blood</b> and <b>bone marrow</b> are collected into a <b>brain heart
infusion (BHI) broth</b> for transportation to the laboratory. The use of <b>
Dupont Isolator tubes</b> for transport and processing enhances fungal recovery 
from blood and bone marrow specimens.
<li><b>CSF</b> is aseptically collected and transported immediately to the
laboratory.
<li><b>Hair</b>, <b>nails</b>, and <b>skin</b> are initially cleaned with
<b>70% alcohol</b> to remove surface contaminants. <b>Scrapings</b> and
<b>plucked hairs</b> are placed in a <b>sterile Petri plate</b> for transportation.
<li><b>Respiratory tract specimens</b> (e.g., <b>sputum</b>) should be collected
in the morning and put into a sterile container for transport.
<li><b>Tissues</b> and <b>biopsy</b> specimens are aseptically collected and
kept moist with sterile saline for transport.
<li><b>Vaginal</b> and <b>cervical</b> specimens are typically collected on
sterile swabs, then placed into transport media or broth.
<li><b>Scrapings from wounds and lesions</b> may be placed into sterile saline
for transport.  <b>Aspiration</b> specimens can be collected from deep cysts
or abscesses by needle and syringe.
<li><b>Urine</b> specimens are collected in the morning in sterile container
and sent immediately to the laboratory.  Clean catch or catheterized specimens
are recommended.
</ul>

<h3>Media and tests</h3>
<p>
<b>Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA)</b> inhibits the growth of many bacteria
because its pH is 5.6.  However, this medium allows fungal contaminants and 
pathogenic fungi to grow. <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> and some strains of
<i><i>Nocardia asteroides</i></i> fail to grow on this medium.  The addition of
cycloheximide and chloramphenicol is done for specimens involving skin, hair,
and nails.
<p>

<b>BHI agar (BHIA)</b> is very nutritious and supports the growth of bacteria
and fungi, including <i>Histoplasma</i> and <i><i>Nocardia</i></i>. Add
<b>blood</b> to BHIA to convert dimophic fungi from mold to tissue (yeast) phase.
Add <b>blood</b>, <b>cycloheximide</b> and <b>chloramphenical</b> to create a
medium that inhbits the growth of <i><i>Nocardia</i></i>. (NOTE:
Chloramphenicol inhibits the yeast phase of dimorphic fungi.) It supports the
growth of dermatophytes, isolated from skin, hair and nail specimens.

<p>
<b>Corn meal Tween 80 agar (CMT 80)</b> is used for the demonstration of
blastoconidia, pseudohyphae, arthroconidia, and chlamydospores in the
identification of <i>Candida</i> species and other yeasts.
<p>
<b>Potato dextrose agar (PDA)</b> is a medium used to enhance sporulation and
pigmention.  It is used as a subculture medium rather than a primary plating medium.
<p>
<b>Inhibitory mold agar</b> is used primarily to recover pathogenic fungi
exclusive of dermatophytes.
<p>
<b>Mycosel agar</b> is used to recover dermatophytes
<p>
<b>Dermatophyte test medium (DTM)</b> is a screening medium used for the
isolation of dermatophytes.
<p>
<b>Birdseed agar (Caffeic Acid Agar)</b> is used for growth of <i>Cryptococcus
neoformans</i>.
<p>
<b>Trichophyton Test Agars</b> are used for speciation of the <i>Trichophyton</i>
species.
<p>
<b>Germ tube media</b> (rabbit, fetal calf, or human serum) is used to
demonstrate germ tube production by the yeast <i>Candida albicans</i>.
<p>
<b>Urea agar slant</b> is used to demonstrate urease production. A positive test
is development of a pinkish purple within 48 hours after inoculation.
<ul>
<li><i>Trichosporon</i>, <i>Rhodotorula</i>, and <i>Cryptococcus</i> are
urease-positive.
<li><i>Geotrichum</i>, <i>Saccharomyces</i>, and most <i>Candida</i> are
urease-negative.
</ul>

<h3>Microscopy</h3>

<p>
Saline wet mounts allow the observation of budding yeast, hyphae, conidia, and
hyphal filaments. These mounts are primarily used for the observation of
vaginal specimens.
<p>
<b>Lactophenol cotton blue stain (LPCB)</b> can be used for direct smears or
stains of fungal isolates. Tease mounts for permanent smears and scotch tape 
preps can be made using this stain. Phenol kills organisms. Lactic acid 
preserves the fungal structures. Cotton blue stains the chitin in the fungal 
cell walls.
<p>
<b>Potassium hydroxide (KOH)</b> is ideal for observing skin, hair, or nails.
Ten percent potassium hydroxide dissolves the keratin and enhances visibility
of the fungi.
<p>
With Gram's stain, the fungi appear gram-positive or blue. This stain is used
primarily to observe yeast and pseudohyphae present in clinical specimens.
<p>
The <b>modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain</b> is recommended for staining the
partially acid-fast <i>Nocardia</i>. The fluorescent auromine-rhodamine 
acid-fast stain may also be used.
<p>
India ink is a background stain is recommended for observing encapsulated
yeast, especially <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>.
<p>
Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains fungi (except <i>Actinomycetes</i>) magenta
against a light pink or green background.
<p>
<b>Calcofluor white stain</b> is observed using a fluorescence microscope. With
this sensitive stain, fungal elements fluoresce against a dark background. 10%
KOH may be added to dissolve keratin in the specimen.

<h3>Opportunistic Fungi</h3>
<p>
These are exogenous saprophytes capable of causing infections in
immunocompromised individuals. These fungi are routinely encountered in routine 
fungal cultures and must be differentiated from pathogenic fungi. This group of 
fungi includes the aseptate <b>Zygomycetes</b>, as well as many septate <b> 
Deuteromycetes</b> and <b>Ascomycetes</b>. Characteristic asexual conidial 
forms are primarily used to identify and differentiate these fungi. Production 
of sexual spores may be used to differentiate the Zygomycetes.

<h4>Hyaline (light) opportunists-septate fungi</h4>
<p>
<i>Acremonium</i> species microscopically demonstrate tapering conidiophores that
support closely packed balls of sickle- or elliptical-shaped conidia.
<p>
<i>Aspergillus</i> species have rough or smooth unbranched conidiophores with a
foot cell at the base and a vesicle (head) at the tip. Rows of flask-shaped
<b>phialides</b> in single or double rows support chains of rough or smooth
<b>phialoconidia</b>.
<ul>
<li>A. fumigatus</i> is the most common opportunistic pathogen in the genus. It
grows at 45&deg;C, and the phialides cover the upper two thirds of the vesicle.
Colonies are dark greenish to gray.
<li><i>A. niger</i> has a black radiate head with phialides and chains of
phialoconidia covering the entire vesicle. Colonies are dark black.
<li><i>A. flavus</i> has spiny (rough) conidiophores and phialides cover the
entire vesicle. Colonies are usually a yellow-green color.
<li>A. terreus</i> produces cinnamon-brown colonies.
<li>A. clavatus</i> has huge, elongated vesicles with short phialides.
</ul>
<p>
<i>Fusarium</i> species have single or branching conidiophores that
terminate in tapered phialides. Macrophialoconidia are banana or
cylindrical-shaped with two to five cells.
<p>
<i>Gliocladium</i> species produce terminal masses of phialoconidia
supported by flaskshaped phialides. Terminal masses of phialoconidia are held
together in a large ball by a gelatinous matrix. Mature colonies are a
characteristic <q>green lawn</q> of growth.
<p>
<i>Paecilomyces</i> species have single, short, or penicillus-type phialides with very
delicate chains of smooth or rough, oval conidia. This fungus resembles Penicillium.
<p>
<i>Penicillium</i> species colonies are characteristically blue-green with a
white periphery. Multiple, flask-shaped phialides support chains of round
phialoconidia. Microscopically, the fungus has a <q>brush-like</q> appearance.
<i><i>P. marneffei</i></i> is a dimorphic fungus that produces yeast-like
colonies at 37&deg;C. In the mycelial form (25-30&deg;C), chains of
lemon-shaped phialoconidia are supported by wide phialides on broad metulae
(conidiophores).
<p>
<i>Scopulariopsis</i> species have echinulate (spiny) lemon-shaped
annelloconidia in chains, supported on flask-shaped annellides. Unbranched
annellophores support the annellides.
<p>
<i>Sepedonium</i> species have simple or branched conidiophores supporting
single or clustered thick-walled, smooth or rough macroconidia. This hyaline
fungus resembles the yeast phase of the dimorphic pathogen Histoplasma
capsulatum.

<h4>Dematiaceous (dark) opportunists-septate fungi</h4>
<p>
<i>Alternaria</i> species colonies are dark brown to black, and the hyphae and
conidia are dematiaceous. Chained poroconidia with horizontal and vertical
septa have club-shaped bases with tapered apices.
<p>
<i>Bipolaris</i> species have dark, septate hyphae with cylindrical, four- to
five-celled poroconidia. <q>Bent-knee</q> shaped conidiophores support the
poroconidia, with truncate hila at the points of attachment. Bipolar germ tube
formation is produced by these fungi.
<p>
<i>Cladosporium</i> species produce short chains of blastoconidia from
repeatedly forking shield cells. There is a scar at the point of attachment to
the shield cells.
<p>
<i>Curvularia</i> species have large four- to five-celled poroconidia with an
overenlarged central cell and bent-knee conidiophores.
<p>
<i>Exserohilum</i> species have <q>bent-knee</q> conidiophores and protruding
truncate hila at the ends of dark cylindrical poroconidia with 6 to 14 cells.
<p>
<i>Epicoccum</i> species have thick clusters of sporodchia (short conidiophores)
 that support terminal dark, round conidia with horizontal and vertical septa.
<p>
<i>Nigrospora</i> species have dark hyphae and short fat conidiophores
supporting single, oval, smooth-walled, black conidia.

<h4>Zygomycetes-aseptate opportunists with large, ribbon-like hyphae</h4>
<p>
<i>Absidia</i> species have stalk-like, branching sporangiophores with a
columellae (base) supporting pear-shaped sporangia (a sac). Asexual 
sporangiospores are produced within the sporangia by free-cell formation. These 
aseptate Zygomycetes have rhizoids, or root-like structures, between the 
interconnecting runners (stolons) connecting the sporangiophores.
<p>
<i>Mucor</i> species have single or branching sporangiophores supporting round,
sporefilled sporangia. There are no rhizoids or stolons.
<p>
<i>Rhizopus</i> species produce black sporangia on unbranched
sporangiophores opposite rhizoids. Stolons connect the groups of rhizoids.
<p>
<i>Saksenaea</i> species have large, flask-shaped sporangia filled with
elongated sporangiospores. Rhizoids are opposite the sporangiophores.
<p>
<i>Cunninghamella</i> species have branched sporangiophores supporting
terminal, round vesicles. Denticles protrude from the vesicles and support 
one-celled round sporangiola.
<p>
<i>Syncephalastrum</i> species produce terminal, round vesicles. Rows of round
sporangiospores are in cylindrical merosporangia that radiate the surface of
thevesicle.

<h4>Single-celled yeasts</h4>
<p>
These are normal flora of the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal
tract and can be opportunistic pathogens.
<p>
<i>Candida albicans</i> is predominantly the causative agent of these
opportunistic infections. <i>C. albicans</i> form chlamydospores, blastoconidia,
 and pseudohyphae on CMT 80 agar. Germ tubes are formed following incubation in 
germ tube media. <i>C. albicans</i> assimilates the carbohydrate sucrose.
<p>
<i>Torulopsis glabrata</i> is normal vaginal flora and may be associated with
vaginal and urinary tract infections.
<p>
Emerging opportunistic pathogens are <i>C. tropicalis</i>, <i>C.
parapsilosis</i>, and <i>C. krusei</i>.

<h3>Opportunistic Mycoses</h3>
<p>
These include infections ranging from mild and self-limiting to serious
disseminated infections in severely immunocompromised individuals. These
mycoses are caused by exogenous, saprophytic fungi, and they are increasing as
the number of immunocompromised patients increases.

<h4>Candidiasis</h4>
<p>
This is an acute-to-chronic fungal infection that can involve the mouth, vagina,
 skin, nails, bronchi, lungs, alimentary tract, bloodstream, or urinary tract.
Typically, the causative agent is <i>Candida albicans</i>, but other species of
<i>Candida</i> are emerging as opportunistic pathogens. <i>Candida albicans</i>
 is part of the normal flora of the skin, mucous membranes, and g
astrointestinal tract.
<p>
Oral thrush is a yeast infection that forms white curd-like patches on the
oral muco-cutaneous membranes.
<p>
Vulvovaginitis or vaginal thrush manifests as a thick yellow-white discharge.
 Diabetes, antibiotic therapy, oral contraceptives, and pregnancy predispose 
the patient to this condition.
<p>
Candidemias, primarily caused by C. parapsilosis, occur in patients who have
indwelling catheters.
<p>
Other opportunistic yeast infections in debilitated patients may be caused
by Geotrichum candidum and Torulopsis glabrata. Infections range from oral and 
urinary tract infections to disseminated infections.

<h4><i>Malassezia furfur</i></h4>
<p>
This can be an opportunist, causing septicemia in patients who receive
intravenous lipid infusions. The fungus grows well in the sebaceous glands. It
is also the causative agent of the superficial mycoses pityriasis versicolor.
<p>
<i>M. furfur</i> requires a medium overlayed with a lipid, such as olive oil.
<p>
Microscopically, this septate fungus appears as thick, round oval cells in
clusters with hyphae (spaghetti and meatballs).

<h4>Cryptococcosis</h4>
<p>
This infection primarily involves the lungs and meninges and often occurs in
AIDS patients. The yeast <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is the causative agent 
of cutaneous and disseminated disease. Inhalation of fungal spores is usually 
the means of transmission.
<p>
<i>C. neoformans</i> has a capsule that is demonstrated with the India ink
preparation. It is urease-positive.
<p>
<i>C. neoformans</i> is associated with pigeon and bird feces. It may also be
associated with fruits, milk, or plants.
<p>
Capsular material in the CSF can be detected with an antigen latex
agglutination test.

<h4>Aspergilloses</h4>
<p>
These are a variety of infections and allergic diseases primarily caused by <i>
Aspergillus fumigatus</i>. <i>A. flavus</i> and <i>A. niger</i> may also be
causative agents of these infections. The <i>Aspergillus</i> species are
ubiquitous fungi with airborne spores.
<p>
Allergic aspergillosis involves inhalation of the conidia, colonization of
the mucous plugs in the lung, and subsequent asthma attacks. A high titer of 
IgE antibody to <i>Aspergillus</i> is present.
<p>
Otomycosis (outer ear infections) is a characteristic form of aspergillosis.
<p>
Fungus ball, a localized abscess that forms in the lung, is another form of
aspergillosis. However, there is no tissue invasion.
<p>
Invasive aspergillosis occurs in neutropenic patients. Initially, the
patient has sinusitis, followed by dissemination throughout the body (e.g., 
brain, bones) occurs.

<h4>Penicilliosis</h4>
<p>
This condition is caused by the penicillus-producing fungi, <i>Penicillium</i>,
<i>Scopulariopsis</i>, and <i>Paecilomyces</i>. Infections may include
otomycosis (outer ear), keratomycosis (cornea of the eye), infections of the
nails. Dissemination occurs in debilitated patients with transmission via
inhalation of spores and spread of an initial pulmonary disease. The dimorphic
fungus, <i>P. marneffei</i>, causes a disseminated form of penicilliosis with
flu-like symptoms, followed by enlarged lymph node, spleen, and liver.
Transmission may be via inhalation or ingestion of the fungal spores.

<h4>Zygomycoses</h4>
<p>
Also known as phycomycoses or mucormycoses, these are acute infections caused
by the aseptate fungi in the phylum Zygomycota: <i>Rhizopus</i>, <i>Absidia</i>,
 and <i>Mucor</i>. Predisposed patients have uncontrolled diabetes, 
malnutrition, or are on steroid therapy. Spores infect the nasal sinuses or 
orbital (eye) area and the infection disseminates rapidly. Without treatment, 
death ensures within two to ten days after the initial infection. Prompt 
treatment with amphotericin B is usually successful if initiated at the 
beginning of the infection.
<p>
Other opportunistic fungal mycoses may include <b>keratomycosis</b> (corneal
infections) and <b>otomycosis</b> (outer ear infections). These infections are
usually the result of trauma. Acute or chronic sinusitis may also be caused by
opportunistic fungi.

<h3>Systemic Mycoses</h3>
<p>
The systemic mycoses affect internal organs and disseminate to multiple organs
in the body. Primary or secondary cutaneous infections are often characteristic 
of these mycoses. Causative agents are typically the slow-growing, dimorphic 
fungal pathogens. These fungi (grow as molds at 25&deg;C and as yeast at 35&deg;
 C).
<p>
<b>Histoplasmosis</b>, or <b>Darling's disease</b>, is a granulomatous fungal
infection caused by <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>. The progressive disease is 
transmitted via inhalation or direct inoculation into the skin, and is not 
contagious or transmissible via person-to-person. The yeast or tissue phase 
(37&deg;C) is small, single-budding yeast cells. The mold (25-30&deg;C) 
demonstrates is a large tuberculate macroconidia and small rough or smooth 
microconidia along the sides of the hyphae. This is the diagnostic stage. The 
fungus resides in soil enriched with bat or bird guano (inhalation transmission).
The major endemic region is the Ohio, and Mississippi River areas, and along
the Appalachian Mountains.
<p>
<b>North American blastomycosis</b>, or <b>Gilchrist's disease</b>, is caused
by <i>Blastomyces dermatitidis</i>. Transmission is inhalation of the conidia.
The primary respiratory disease gradually disseminates hematogenously to other
organs. The diagnostic tissue (37&deg;C) phase demonstrates large yeast with a
double refractile wall and a broad-based bud. The mold phase (25-30&deg;C) is
single oval conidia at the ends of short conidiophores or directly on the
hyphae. The major endemic areas are south of the Ohio River and east of the
Mississippi River.
<p>
<b>Coccidioidomycosis</b> is caused by <i>Coccidioides immitis</i> and is
commonly known as <q>San Joaquin valley fever.</q> Transmission is via
inhalation of the arthroconidia from sand and dirt. The primary respiratory
infection rapidly disseminated in immunocompromised patients. The tissue phase
(yeast) is large, thick-walled spherules filled with endospores. Alternating
barrel-shaped arthroconidia between disjunctor cells are characteristic of the
mold phase. The major endemic area is the San Joaquin Valley and the lower
Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States. Diagnosis is based on
serologic and skin testing. In endemic areas, 3% of the normal population
convert to skin-test positive every year.
<p>
<b>South American Blastomycosis</b>, or <b>paracoccidioidomycosis</b>, is
caused by the systemic fungus <i>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</i>. 
Transmission is via inhalation and primary infections are pulmonary or 
mucocutaneous. The prognosis is death within 2-3 years of dissemination of the 
disease. The diagnostic tissue phase is large, thick-walled yeast with multiple 
buds, resembling a <q>ship's wheel.</q> Intercalary and terminal 
chlamydoconidia are observed in the mold phase. The endemic area is South 
America, especially in Brazil.

<h3>Superficial Mycoses</h3>
<p>
These are noninvasive infections that affect the outermost layer of skin and
hair.
<p>
<b>Pityriasis versicolor</b> is caused by <i>Malassezia furfur</i>, which infects the
stratum corneum epidermidis and causes hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation on 
the trunk of the body. Scaly patches of skin fluoresce with a Wood's lamp. 
Characteristic <q>sphagetti and meatballs</q> morphology is observed 
microscopically and a lipid oil overlay is required for culture.
<p>
<b>Tinea nigra</b> is a superficial infection of the stratum corneum
epidermidis caused by the dematiaceous fungus, <i>Exophiala werneckii</i>. The 
infection is characterized by brown to black, nonscaly patches on the palms of 
the hands Black, yeasty colonies develop short olive-gray mycelia with age. 
Microscopically, dark septate hyphae with one- or two-celled blastoconidia are 
demonstrated in clusters along the hyphae. The fungus hydrolyzes casein.
<p>
<b>Piedra</b> is an infection of the hair shaft that produces hair breakage.
Treatment is cutting or shaving infected hairs and use of topical antifungals. 
Infections may disseminate in immunocompromised individuals. <i>Trichosporon 
beigelli</i> is the causative agent of white piedra and forms soft, light brown 
nodules around the beard and mustache hairs. Microscopically, the fungus 
demonstrates hyaline hyphae with blastoconidia and arthroconidia on CMT 80 agar.
 Black piedra is caused by <i>Piedraia hortai</i>, which forms firmly attached 
hard, black nodules around the outside of scalp hairs. Microscopically, it 
produces dark thick-walled hyphae with swellings.

<h3>Cutaneous Mycoses</h3>
<p>
These are typically caused by the dermatophytic fungi. Some cutaneous mycoses
can be caused by <i>Candida</i> species. The cutaneous mycoses involve skin,
hair, and nails. Infections may be acquired from animals (e.g., <i>Trichophyton
rubrum</i>, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton verrucosum) or from humans (e.g.,
<i>Epidermophyton floccosum</i>, Microsporum audouinii). Diagnosis is made by
microscopic examination of skin, hair, and nails with 10% KOH. Infections are
commonly referred to as tinea infections or dermatophytoses. <q>Ringworm</q> is
another name for dermatophytic infections. Microscopically, the fungi
demonstrate microconidia and macroconidia. Both conidia types or only one type
may be demonstrated by a fungus. Diagnosis is made by macroscopic and
microscopic observations of the fungi and the location of the infection on the
body.

<p>
<b>Tinea capitis</b> (head) is a dermatophytic infection of the scalp.
<p>
<b>Epidemic tinea capitis</b> occurs in children and is extremely contagious.
It is caused by <i>M. audouinii</i>, which fluoresces under a Wood's lamp. 
Microscopically, the fungus demonstrates rare irregular, rough-walled 
macroconidia with two to eight cells and rare club-shaped microconidia.
<p>
<b>Zoophilic tinea capitis</b> occurs primarily in children. Transmission of
infection is through animals. It is most commonly caused by Microsporum canis 
with few microconidia and numerous rough thick-walled, spindle-shaped 
macroconidia with 6 to 15 cells. <i>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</i> is also a 
causative agent of zoophilic tinea capitis. It demonstrates grape-like clusters 
of microconidia and numerous pencil-shaped macroconidia with five to eight 
cells.
<p>

<b>Black-dot tinea capitis</b> is a chronic infection in adults caused by <i>
Trichophyton tonsurans</i>. Rare macroconidia and numerous microconidia are 
observed microscopically.
<p>
<b>Favus (tinea favosa)</b> is a severe tinea capitis caused by <i>Trichophyton
schoenleinii</i>. Macroconidia are only observed if the fungus is grown on
sterile rice grains.
<p>
<i>M. gypseum</i> is transmitted via contact with contaminated soil is a
causative agent of <b>tinea capitis</b>. Numerous rough, thin-walled, 
elliptical macroconidia with four to six cells are produced by the fungus. Few 
microconidia are produced.
<p>
<b>Tinea barbae</b> is an infection of the beard, neck, or face. The causative
agent <i>Trichophyton verrucosum</i> requires thiamine for growth and 
microscopically produces rare three- to five-celled macroconidia with a 
rat-tail end. <i>T. mentagrophytes</i> also causes tinea barbae. <i>
Trichophyton rubrum</i> also causes tinea barbae. It produces numerous 
club-shaped microconidia, which occur singly along the hyphae. Rare to numerous 
smoothwalled, pencil-shaped macroconidia with three to eight cells are also 
produced. This dermatophyte is characterized by a deep red reverse.
<p>
<b>Tinea corporis</b> is a dermatophytosis of the body which usually affects
the inside skin folds. <i>Candida</i> species are often causative agents of 
this infection.  It can be caused by <i>T. rubrum</i>, <i>T. mentagrophytes</i>
<p>
<i>T. violaceum</i> has characteristic violet colonies with a lavender reverse
in 2-3 weeks. Few microconidia are produced on thiamine-enriched media, in
addition to chlamydoconidia in chains. No macroconidia are produced.
<p>
<b>Tinea cruris</b> is a dermatophytosis of the groin caused by the following fungi:
<ul>
<li><i>Epidermophyton floccosum</i> is a dermatophyte that produces two- to
four-celled, smooth, club-shaped macroconidia. These are produced singly or in 
clusters. No microconidia are produced by this fungus.
<li><i>T. rubrum</i>
<li><i>T. mentagrophytes</i>
<li><i>Candida</i> species
</ul>

<p>
<b>Tinea pedis</b> is an infection of the feet, commonly called athlete's foot.
It can be caused by the following fungi:
<ul>
<li><i>T. rubrum</i>
<li><i>T. mentagrophytes</i> is the most common cause of athlete's foot
<li><i>E. floccosum</i> causes epidemic tinea pedis
</ul>
<p>
Subcutaneous mycoses typically result from traumatic implantation (e.g., via
thorn, splinter) of a fungus into the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. 
Subcutaneous fungi invade the tissue and lymph nodes, and chronic, nonhealing, 
hard, lumpy, crusted ulcerations are usually on the extremities. Endemic areas 
are the tropics, but distribution is worldwide. These infections are caused by 
hyaline and dematiaceous, as well as the fungus-like bacteria.
<p>
<b>Sporotrichosis</b>, or <b>Rose Gardener's disease</b>, is caused by the
dimorphic fungus <i>Sporothrix schenckii</i>. Infections can be lymphocutaneous,
 fixed, or pulmonary. At 37&deg;C, microscopic growth is a cigar-shaped budding 
yeast, commonly referred to as cigar bodies. These are observed in tissue. 
Conversion to the yeast form is necessary for identification. At 25-30&deg;C, 
the mycelial form of the fungus is a daisy head or floweret of microconidia, 
which is produced at the end of unbranched conidiophores on delicate hyphae. <i>
S. schenckii</i> is found on plant material, such as rose thorn, sphagnum moss, 
and timbers.
<p>
<b>Eumycotic mycetoma</b>, or <b>madura foot</b>, is a disease characterized by
swelling, sinus tract formation, and the presence of sulfur granules usually in 
the extremities. There is little pain or bone destruction. It typically occurs 
in third world countries. <i>Pseudoallescheria boydii</i>, the teleomorph or 
sexual stage or of <i>Scedosporium apiospermum</i>, is the most common cause of 
mycetoma in the United States. Asexual conidia or single or small, clustered 
annelloconidia produced terminally on long or short annellophores. Sexual 
ascospores are contained asci within a large cleistothecia. <i>Madurella</i> 
species most commonly cause mycetoma in Africa. An initial puncture or abrasion 
with contaminated material, usually on the feet, hands, and buttocks, 
progresses slowly to involve an entire extremity. Infected extremities are 
large and deformed.
<p>
<b>Chromoblastomycoses</b> begin with traumatic implantation of the spore in a
limb. The disease produces hard, dry, cauliflower-like lesions. Lymphatic 
channels are blocked by drainage, causing elephantiasis, deformity and abnormal 
enlargement of the infected limb. Black dots, or sclerotic bodies, are observed 
in deep parts of the lesions. Secondary bacterial infections may be a 
complication of the disease. Infections are caused by the dematiaceous fungi
<i>Phialophora</i>, <i>Fonsecaea</i>, and <i>Cladosporium</i> and typically 
occurs in third world countries. The conidial arrangement of these dematiaceous 
fungi is very similar. Conidiophores support branching chains of blastoconidia, 
multiple arrangements, or loosely organized conidial heads held together by a 
gelatinous matrix.
<p>
<b>Phaeohyphomycosis</b> ranges from a superficial infection to one with
deep-organ involvement. Causative agents include the <i>Phialophora</i>, <i>
Exophiala</i>, and <i>Wangiella</i>, all of which produce slow-growing, black,
yeasty colonies with a short mycelium. The dematiaceous <i>Phialophora</i>
produce terminal balls of phialoconidia supported by phialides. <i>Exophiala</i>
and <i>Wangiella</i> species demonstrate dark annelloconidia in clusters or
terminal balls, respectively.
<p>
<b>Actinomycotic mycetoma</b> is caused by the anaerobic actinomycetes
(fungus-like bacteria). Sulfur granules may be observed in tissues, with 
symptoms including exudates and painful bone involvement. Infections with the 
endogenous anaerobic oral flora results in <q>lumpy jaw</q> or pulmonary and 
thoracic infections due to aspiration into the lungs. The aerobic actinomycetes,
<i>Nocardia</i>, <i> Streptomyces</i>, and <i>Actinomadura</i>, cause 
mycotic-like infections. These organisms are differentiated according to 
biochemical test and growth requirements.
<p>
Diagnostic tests for identification of the systemic fungi include antigenic
skin tests, seromycology, and DNA testing. Several test methods can be used for
serologic detection of fungal antibodies. Empiric therapy is initiated with
fungal infections. Antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B, fluconazole, and
ketoconazole may be used for treatment. Fungal susceptibility testing can be
performed in event of a failed response to empiric therapy. Fungal
susceptibilities are usually preformed in reference laboratories.

<h2>Virology</h2>
<p>
Viruses (virions) are the smallest known form of infectious disease-causing
agents. Viruses are 1/10 the size of bacteria and 1/100 the size of eukaryotic
cells. They cannot be observed with a light microscope. Viruses of humans are
composed of nucleic acid [deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA)].
<p>
The nucleic acid is surrounded by a protein matrix referred to as the
nucleocapsid. The capsid surrounds the nucleocapsid and is composed of 
structural units called capsomers. Virus particles are either <q>naked</q> or 
have a lipoprotein structure, the envelope, which surrounds the capsid. Viral 
symmetry can be helical, icosahedral (20-sided polygon), or complex.
<p>
Viral replication can occur only in living cells and involves any host-cell
enzymes and functions. The steps of replication are as follows.
<ol>
<li>Attachment or adsorption occurs when the virion comes in contact with the host
cell.
<li>Penetration occurs when the virus passes through the plasma membrane.
Enveloped viruses penetrate via fusion. Naked viruses can penetrate 
transversely. Pinocytosis is the process of pinching through the plasma 
membrane, which results in viruses entering within cytoplasmic vacuoles.
<li>Uncoating is typically mediated by cellular proteases and results in the
separation of the capsid from the viral genome.
<li>Synthesis of early proteins. These proteins are involved in genome replication.
<li>Synthesis of late proteins. These proteins are used in the development of
structural components of the virion.
<li>Assembly is the packaging of the new copies of the genome nucleic acid into
the capsid proteins.
<li>Release or egress of the progeny virus is the final step. The lipid envelope
is acquired along with the glycoproteins as the progeny viral nucleocapsid buds
through the membrane.
</ol>

<h3>Specimen collection, transport, and processing</h3>
<p>
Time of collection. Specimens for viral identification are best collected
during the time of first presentation of symptoms. Virus titers (concentration
of virus) are usually highest in the early part of the illness. Serologically,
a 4-fold rise in the antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera has
been used to identify a particular infectious agent as the cause of a recent
disease.
<p>
The type of viral illness and the disease symptoms influence the specimens of
choice for viral culture. Viral specimens are typically divided into nonsterile
sites and sterile sites.
<p>
Nonsterile sites include the following:
<ul>
<li>Conjunctival
<li>Skin (e.g., mouth, lips)
<li>Vesicular
<li>Nasal (aspirates or washes)
<li>Throat/upper respiratory tract
<li>Sputum
<li>Urine
<li>Genital (cervical, penile)
<li>Stool/rectal swab
</ul>
<p>
Sterile sites include the following:
<ul>
<li>Autopsy
<li>Biopsy
<li>CSF
<li>Fine-needle aspirate
<li>Blood
<li>Bronchial alveolar (wash)
<li>Pleural fluid
</ul>
<p>
The procedure for specimen collection is vital for recovery of the infectious
virus.
<p>
Specimens collected with a Dacron or rayon swab (cotton swabs are not
recommended for collection of viral samples because they are toxic to viruses) 
must not dry out during transport. The swab can be placed in a modified Stuart 
transport medium for transport to the laboratory.
<p>
Nonsterile specimens that are not liquid, vesicular fluid, fine needle
aspirates, or tissue biopsy specimens should be collected into viral transport 
media, such as Hanks' balanced salt solution, 0.2&nbsp;M sucrose-phosphate, or 
2%&nbsp;fetal calf serum with Eagle's minimum essential medium. Some transport 
mediums contain antibiotics to inhibit growth of normal bacterial or fungal 
flora and gelatin media to stabilize protein.
<p>
Urine for viral culture should not be collected into containers with
preservatives. Blood for viral culture should be collected into heparin or 
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid tubes. Stool specimens for viral culture 
should be collected into a clean container.
<p>
All specimens submitted for viral recovery regardless of source should be
transported at refrigerated temperatures (0&deg;C-4&deg;C).
<p>
If the inoculation of the specimen into tissue culture media will exceed 5
days, the specimen should be quickly frozen at -70&deg;C.
<p>
Tissue culture is the inoculation of patient specimens into cells to
determine the growth of a viral agent.
<p>
Cells derived directly from the donor (animal or human sources) are known as
primary cultures.
<p>
Primary rabbit kidney is the first choice for herpes simplex viruses types 1
and 2.
<p>
Primary monkey kidney is the first choice for the following viruses:
<ul>
<li>Influenza types A and B
<li>Parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, and 3
<li>Mumps
<li>Measles
<li>Rubella
<li>Enteroviruses
</ul>
<p>
Primary human embryonic kidney is the first choice for the following viruses:
<ul>
<li>Parainfluenza virus
<li>Measles
<li>Rubella
<li>Adenoviruses
<li>Rhinoviruses
<li>Herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2
<li>Varicella zoster
</ul>
<p>
Cell lines are primary cultures that have been subcultured.
<p>
Cell lines that have at least 75% of the cells with a normal chromosome
complement are referred to as diploid (e.g., diploid human fibroblast cell line).
Diploid cell lines usually die after 30 to 50 passages. The choices for
culturing cytomegalovirus (CMV) are WI-38, MRC-5, or IMR-90.
<p>
Cell lines that have a predominance of cells containing an abnormal number
of chromosomes are designated as heteroploid. Typically, these cell lines are
continuous, that is, they have an indefinite number of passages.
<ul>
<li>A549 human lung carcinoma cells are used to culture adenoviruses and
varicella zoster
<li>HEp-2 human laryngeal carcinoma cells are used to culture respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) and adenoviruses
<li>HeLa human cervical adenocarcinoma cells are used to culture RSV,
rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses
</ul>
<p>
The order of inoculation involves diploid cell lines first. The continuous cell
lines are inoculated second. The primary cells are inoculated last.
<p>
Viral adsorption refers to the time point when the virus comes in contact with
the tissue culture cells. <b>Stationary adsorption</b> is the procedure of
simply incubating the cell and virus for 30 to 60 minutes at 35&deg;C. The
<b>roller drum method</b> refers to the gentle rotation of the culture tubes to
enhance adsorption. The <b> low-speed centrifugation method</b> requires that
shell vials be centrifuged at 750 to 1,000 &times; <i>g</i> for 30 to 40
minutes at 25&deg;C.
<p>
Viral detection in the culture cells depends on virus replication in the cells.
Virus may be detected by observing a characteristic <b>cytopathic effect</b>,
such as swelling or inclusions.
<p>
Direct examination of clinical specimens for the presence of viral pathogens
can be done by immunohistochemical staining, nucleic acid hybridization, or 
solid-phase immunoassay. Immunohistochemical staining uses fixed or fresh 
specimens incubated with chemically labeled (fluorescein) or enzymatically 
labeled (peroxidase) antibodies to detect viral antigens. Nucleic acid 
hybridization involves the detection of viral DNA or RNA sequences in nucleic 
acid extracted from specimens. Polymerase chain reaction is a technique that 
allows the viral genes to be amplified to enhance detection. The Western blot 
(dot blot) is a technique that employs single-stranded, complementary nucleic 
acid probes for detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the blood of 
seronegative individuals.
<p>
Solid-phase immunoassays use antibodies and radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect viral antigens.

<h3>DNA viruses</h3>

<h4>Icosahedrally Symmetrical Naked DNA Viruses</h4>
<p>
The naked DNA viruses with an icosahedral symmetry are the <i>Parvoviridae</i>,
<i>Papillomaviridae</i>, <i>Polyomaviridae</i>, <i>Adenoviridae</i>, and <i>
Hepadnaviridae</i>.
<p>
<b><i>Parvoviridae</i></b>. Parvovirus B19 is spread by close physical contact.
It causes erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease.
<p>
<b><i>Papillomaviridae</i></b> have two significant genera,
<b>papillomavirus</b> and <b>papovavirus</b>. <b>Human papillomavirus</b> causes
warts in humans and is associated with some genital cancers.
<p>
<b><i>Polyomaviridae</i></b> produces histologically diverse tumors in various
parts of the body: JCV and BKV.
<p>
<b><i>Adenoviridae</i></b> have more than 47 serotypes of adenovirus. This
virus causes infection of the respiratory tract (nasopharyngitis); the eye 
(keratoconjunctivitis); and the intestines (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting).
<p>
<b><i>Hepadnaviridae</i></b> have a tropism for infection of the liver. <b>
Hepatitis B virus</b> is also known as serum hepatitis and chronic hepatitis.
Transmission of the virus is through the parenteral route (e.g., intravenous
drug abuse and contaminated blood products) and sexual intercourse. Hepatitis
surface antigen (HBsAg) is present in early disease; anti-HBsAg indicates
immunity.

<h4>Icosahedrally Symmetrical Enveloped DNA Viruses</h4>
<p>
The only virus with enveloped DNA virus and icosahedral symmetry is the
Herpesviridae, which has three medically significant subfamilies: <i>
Alphaherpesvirinae</i>, <i>Betaherpesvirinae</i>, and <i>Gammaherpesvirinae</i>.
All have the ability to become latent after the primary infection.
<p>
Within the group of <i><b>Alphaherpesvirinae</b></i> are herpes simplex 1
(HSV-1), herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), and varicella zoster virus. HSV-1 is usually 
seen on the lips or skin or as an eye lesion. It may be diagnosed by the <b>
Tzanck cell test</b>. HSV-2 affects the genital or lips area and is frequently 
transmitted sexually. Neonatal herpes is a severe disease of the newborn caused 
by contact with the virus during passage through an infected birth canal. HSV-2 
disease can be <i><b>primary</b></i> or <i><b>recurrent</b></i>. <b>Varicella 
zoster virus</b> causes a primary disease (chickenpox) and a recurrent disease 
(shingles). <b>Chickenpox</b> is a mild, self-limiting, highly infectious VZV 
disease that occurs mainly in children. <b>Shingles</b> (or zoster) is caused 
by the reactivation of VZV that has been latent in the neurons. Severely 
painful vesicles form on the trunk area.
<p>
The significant viral pathogen in the <i><b>Betaherpesvirinae</b></i> is CMV.
<b>CMV</b> is typically an inapparent disease of childhood. In immunosuppressed 
patients, CMV can cause a generalized disease. If CMV infection occurs in the 
uterus or soon after birth, it may cause fetal or infant death.
<p>
The viral pathogen in the <b><i>Gammaherpesvirinae</i></b> group is the <b>
Epstein-Barr virus</b> (EBV). EBV may cause <b>infectious mononucleosis (IM)</b>
and is associated with <b>Burkitt's lymphoma</b>. IM, or <q>kissing disease,</q>
produces <b>atypical lymphocytes</b> and immunoglobulin (IgM) <b>
heterophile antibodies</b> that are detected by the monospot test. Burkitt's 
lymphoma patients have elevated titers of EBV antibodies.

<p>
The <b>human herpes virus type 6</b> causes a common <b>exanthem disease</b>
(<b>roseola infantum</b>), or sixth disease.

<h4>DNA Viruses with Complex Symmetry</h4>
<p>
The Poxviridae are naked DNA viruses with a complex symmetry. They include the
human viruses vaccinia, variola, and molluscum contagiosum.
<p>
<b>Vaccinia</b> is a variant of the variola virus and produces a mild disease.
Vaccinia is used as the immunogen in the smallpox vaccination.
<p>
The <b>variola</b> virus is the causative agent of smallpox, a disease that
the World Health Organization presumes to be eradicated.
<p>
<b>Molluscum contagiosum</b> causes small wart-like lesions on the face, arms,
buttocks, and genitals. This virus can cause a disease that mimics genital
herpes. M. contagiosum forms eosinophilic inclusion bodies in infected cells.

<h3>RNA Viruses</h3>

<h4>Helicially Symmetrical Enveloped RNA Virus</h4>
<p>
The enveloped RNA viruses with helical symmetry are the Orthomyxoviridae,
Paramyxoviridae, Arenaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Bunyaviridae.

<h5><b>Orthomyxoviruses</b></h5>
<p>
These have a hemagglutinin, a neuraminidase, and a matrix protein associated
with the envelope.
<p>
The influenza viruses are classified as types A, B, and C. Types A and B are
responsible for the epidemics of respiratory tract infections. Reye's syndrome
is associated with influenza type B. Influenza is diagnosed by viral isolation
or the hemagglutination inhibition test.
<p>
Antigenic drift is caused by a minor mutation in the hemagglutinin glycoprotein
that leads to yearly epidemics. Antigenic shift is caused by a major shift in
the hemagglutinin glycoprotein that leads to intermittent pandemics.

<h5><b>Paramyxoviridae</b></h5>
<p>
These are divided into three genera: paramyxoviruses, morbilliviruses, and
pneumoviruses.
<p>
The paramyxoviruses are associated with the parainfluenza and mumps viruses.
<b>Parainfluenza virus</b> causes croup in infants. The <b>mumps virus</b>
results in a generalized disease associated with enlargement of the parotid
glands.
<p>
The <b>morbillivirus</b> is associated with the measles virus and causes a
maculopapular rash, fever, and Koplik's spots on the buccal mucosa.
<p>
The <b>pneumovirus</b> responsible for bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants
is RSV. RSV is rapidly diagnosed by demonstration of viral antigens in nasal
washings with fluorescent antibody or immunohistochemical techniques.

<h5><b>Arenaviridae</b></h5>
<p>
These are not typically encountered in the United States. Included in this
family are the hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., Junin, Machupo, and Lassa viruses) and
the flu-like illness caused by the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.

<p>
<b>Rhabdoviruses</b> are bullet-shaped viruses associated with the human
pathogenic rabies virus and bovine vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).
<p>
The rabies virus produces a fatal disease following inoculation by an animal
bite or, occasionally, by inhalation. The rabies virus produces specific
cytoplasmic inclusion bodies called Negri bodies in infected cells.
Postexposure prophylaxis consists of passive immunization with human rabies
immune globulin. Diagnosis is verified by biopsies from skin, cornea
impressions, or postmortem examination of brain tissue.
<p>
VSV is a mild disease associated with cattle.

<h5><b>Coronaviruses</b></h5>
<p>
These are the second most frequent cause of the common cold and have been
implicated in infant gastroenteritis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome is
associated with SARS-CoV. These viruses are typically difficult to isolate in
the early stages in the laboratory.

<h5>Bunyaviridae</h5>
<p>
The members of the family are Hanta virus, LaCrosse virus, and California virus.
<p>

The <b>Hanta virus</b> has been associated with severe life-threatening
respiratory tract infections in the southwestern United States. Transmission 
has been through exposure to infected deer mice droppings. Symptoms include 
thrombocytopenia, left shift to myelocytes or earlier stages, presence of 
blastic forms among lymphyocytes, and proteinuria.
<p>
The <b>California</b> and <b>LaCrosse viruses</b> produce encephalitis, mainly
in the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. Transmission is via an infected 
mosquito bite.

<h4>Icosahedrally Symmetrical Enveloped RNA Viruses</h4>
<p>
The enveloped RNA viruses with icosahedral symmetry are Togaviridae, Flaviviridae,
and Retroviridae.

<h5>Togaviridae</h5>
<p>
The two medically significant genera in the Togaviridae are the alphavirus and
the rubivirus.
<p>
The alphaviruses are arboviruses with mosquito vectors and animal reservoirs,
such as Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, Venezuelan
equine encephalitis
<p>
The significant rubivirus is the <b>rubella virus</b>, which causes German
measles, a systemic infection characterized by lymphadenopathy and a
morbilliform rash. The rubella virus can produce congenital infections that can
cause severe birth defects. Diagnosis is by a serologic test for IgM antibodies.

<h5>Flaviviridae</h5>
<p>
These include the dengue virus, hepatitis C, St. Louis encephalitis virus,
yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus. <b>Dengue virus</b> is an arbovirus
transmitted by mosquitoes. Hepatitis C virus, also known as non-A, non-B virus,
causes 90% of the hepatitis cases associated with blood transfusion or infected
blood products. <b>St. Louis encephalitis virus</b> is an arbovirus transmitted
by mosquitoes. <b>Yellow fever virus</b> is an arbovirus transmitted by
mosquitoes. <b>West Nile virus</b> is transmitted by mosquitoes and associated
with contaminated blood products, organs, and tissues.

<h5>Retroviridae</h5>
<p>
The Retroviridae contain a reverse transcriptase enzymeRNA-dependent DNA
polymerase. This family is classified into three genera: lentiviruses,
spumaviruses, and oncoviruses.
<p>
The lentivirus genus contains HIV-1 and HIV-2, which are the causative agents
of AIDS. Transmission is through sexual intercourse, intravenous drug use, or
transplacental from mother to child. AIDS is preceded by AIDS-related complex,
which is characterized by anorexia. Full-blown AIDS is characterized by
Kaposi's sarcoma, <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> pneumonia, CMV, and AIDS-related
dementia. Antibodies to HIV are detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and
confirmed by theWestern Blot technique. ELISA: simple screening tool for the
presence of HIV antibody. Western Blot: Patient, who is screen positive, must
also demonstrate the bands of gp41, p24, and/or gp120/gp160. This combination
is regarded as confirmation of the presence of HIV virus. Viral Load: is a more
sensitive test that detects low quantities of HIV-1 RNA. CD4 Lymphocyte Counts:
marker of disease progression.
<p>
Human T-cell leukemia virus I (HTLV-I) is classified within the Type C
oncoviruses. HTLV-I causes a neurologic degenerating disease. Transmission is
the same as for HIV. Long-term effects include debilitation and paralysis.

<h4>Icosahedrally Symmetrical Naked RNA Viruses</h4>
<p>
The naked RNA viruses with icosahedral symmetry are Picornaviridae and
Reoviridae.
<p>
The medically significant picornaviruses are classified as enteroviruses or
rhinoviruses. The enteroviruses include the poliviruses, coxsackievirus types A
and B, echoviruses, enteroviruses, and the hepatitis A virus. The poliovirus
can cause a mild illness, aseptic meningitis, or poliomyelitis (poliovirus
types 1, 2, or 3): spinal cord motor neurons are killed, and flaccid paralysis
results; these are diagnosed through serologic testing or cultivation of the
virus from throat culture or feces.
<p>
Coxsackievirus type A infections are associated with the following diseases:
hand-foot-and-mouth disease, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, 
and colds. Coxsackievirus type B infections are associated with the following 
diseases: herpangina, viral heart disease, and Bornholm disease (pleurodynia). 
Echovirus primarily infects the enteric tract but can cause a range of diseases 
from the common cold to meningitis and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Enterovirus
infections are associated with respiratory tract infections, central nervous
system disease, and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis.
<p>
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is also referred to as infectious hepatitis.
Transmission is via the fecal-oral route. Infections can cause epidemics. HAV
is diagnosed serologically by a rise in IgM as detected by ELISA.
<p>
The rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of the common cold. More than
100 serotypes exist.
<p>
The primary pathogen in the <i>Reovirus</i> group is the rotavirus, which is
the primary cause of <b>acute infantile diarrhea</b>. Diagnosis is by
demonstration of virus in the stool or by serologic testing (e.g., ELISA).
