		<h1>University of California <q>A</q> to <q>G</q> List</h1>
		<p>
			The A-to-G list refer to seven categories made by the University of California
			to classify academic courses at the high school level. The UC system requires
			students to show a balance in order to qualify for matriculation and
			graduation from the UC. This is a guide for other universities. The
			seven categories are given a letter classification: A, B, C, D, E, F and G.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>A: History</b>. Courses in "civics" (the understanding of how the
				U.S. government works); the history or history and geography of the United
				States; the history or history and geography of the world; study of world
				cultures
			</li>
			<li><b>B: English</b>. Courses in English language, composition, and
				literature; in literature, emphasis on British and/or American literature
				is noted. Literature of the world (translated into English) also acceptable;
				expository reading and writing
			</li>
			<li><b>C: Mathematics</b>. Algebra 1 and 2, and Plane Geometry
			</li>
			<li><b>D: Laboratory Science</b>. Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth Science.
			</li>
			<li><b>E: Foreign Language</b>. French, German, Spanish usually, but
				others should be acceptable.
			</li>
			<li><b>F: Visual/Performing Arts</b>: Drama and Dance
			</li>
			<li><b>G: Elective Courses</b>. Includes all courses found in A-F categories
				that are not part of the A-F designated courses. In mathematics, it includes
				calculus; in laboratory science, includes any subject not used to meet the D
				requirement. In foreign language, includes any non-English foreign languages
				not used to meet the E requirement. In Visual and Performing Art, can be
				music courses, studio art, advanced levels of dance or theater.
			</li>
		</ul>


		<h1>Levels of Mathematics</h1>
		<p>
			In applying to universities, many high schools have different standards or
			course-naming practices, or both. In California, students at the late
			elementary (middle school: 7th and 8th grades) and in high school (9th through
			12th grades) take mathematics courses in a proper progression from simple
			arithmetic even to introductory calculus (often a first-year university level
			mathematics).
		</p>
		<p>
			The University of California selects several categories for classifying
			mathematics courses for which they give no particular explanation or meaning,
			and so it is essential to be clear as to what the meaning is. As a student, you
			must examine the concepts you learned in the math class, then decide what
			category they belong to.
		</p>

			<b>IB (International Baccalaureate)</b> mathematics is at the college level.

			highest two are described.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>IB-SL (Standard Level)</b> is a less intense course work requiring the
			application of mathematics without requiring an understanding of the
			theoretical basis. This mathematics is for scholars intending to go into
			fields such as chemistry, psychology, economics and business administration.
			Topics include statistics and probability, circular functions, trigonometry,
			vectors, matrices, and calculus.
