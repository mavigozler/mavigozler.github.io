    <h2>Bioenergetics</h2>
    <h3>Free Energy</h3>
    <p>
      External source of energy comes from sunlight; radiation used to fix CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      into complex carbon compounds.
      <b>Endergonic</b>
      reactions put net energy into molecule building. A net release is
      <b>exergonic</b>
      . Free energy measured as Δ
      <i>G</i>
      . In a reversible reaction, equilibrium constant can be used to express
      the reaction:

      It is important to remember that free energy does not say whether a
      reaction will happen. Activation energy is necessary for that. Glucose

      and H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O (Δ
      <i>G</i>
      &nbsp;=&nbsp;−2870&nbsp;kJ&nbsp;mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      ) does not happen spontaneously, even though much energy is released. Note
      also that while one chemical reaction may have a Δ
      <i>G</i>
      &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, if it is the first of series in which the net Δ
      <i>G</i>
      &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0, it may nonetheless occur with the idea that energy will
      be gained. Indeed the energy may be coupled, since burning glucose by
      itself does not trap the energy to be used in reactions. Free energy
      coupled to synthesis of ATP or to CoA thioesters. These compounds are also
      used to "activate" or provide the activation energy for certain metabolic
      processes, such as formation of acyl CoA prior to β-oxidation of fatty
      acids, a process requiring the coupling of the acyl compound first to ATP
      (form acyl-AMP + PP
      <sub>i</sub>
      , the pyrophosphate later hydrolyzed to drive the reaction further) then
      reaction with CoASH.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that one can proceed by many different routes to the same point, with
      the sum of Δ
      <i>G</i>
      energies always such that the same Δ
      <i>G</i>
      difference is seen from start to end.

      Note that data on the true value of the Δ
      <i>G</i>
      °´ of ATP hydrolysis to ADP (−30.5 kJ mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      ) varies because equilibrium is hard to measure when it is so much out of
      balance (to the right) and analytical methods are limiting. Also
      researchers make measurements under differ

    <h1>Chapter 3 Structure and Function of the Plant Cell</h1>

    <h2>General Morphology of a Typical Plant Cell</h2>
    <p>
      Two broad groups for the plant cells: metabolically active and
      metabolically inactive, the latter being the structural elements of the
      cell. Most of the cells are
      <b><i>parenchymatous</i></b>
      . Parenchymatous cells have two primary components: a cell wall and a
      protoplast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cell wall provides structural support. Composed of an
      <i>outer</i>
      and
      <i>inner</i>
      layer. The outer layer is the
      <i>primary wall</i>
      . The inner layer is composed of several sublayers and called the
      <i>secondary wall</i>
      . Between the primary walls of adjacent cells is an intercellular layer
      called the
      <i>middle lamella</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Protoplast is essentially the animal cell without any cell wall.
      Conspicuous is a peripherally small cytoplasm and a large vacuole.
      Cytoplasm bound by unit membrane (plasma membrane or plasmalemma); of
      varying viscosity. Cytoplasm may stream across vacuole to compartmentalize
      it. Vacuole may be one large or compartmentalized by strands of cytoplasm
      running across it; bound by a unit membrane known as
      <b><i>tonoplast</i></b>
      . Fluid inside vacuole is
      <i>cell sap</i>
      or
      <i>vacuolar sap</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Organelles include a
      <b>nucleus</b>
      between 6-8&nbsp;µm dia.: double membrane defines it; membrane is porous;
      naturally contains chromosomes in a nucleoplasm. Nucleolus is present and
      site of ribosome assembly.
      <b>Chloroplasts</b>
      present as lens-shaped membrane-bound structure up to 10&nbsp;µm in
      diameter; also surrounded by two unit membranes; 200-400 per cell.
      <b>Mitochondria</b>
      somewhat smaller and serve same role in intracellular oxidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Golgi apparatus</b>
      made of a number of dictyosomes; each dictyosome is stack of flattened
      vesicles (cisternae) with 1-2&nbsp;µm dia. Usu. associated with ER or
      nuclear membrane.
      <b>Ribosomes</b>
      occur as free or attached to ER or nuclear membrane; composed of RNA and
      protein and function in protein synthesis.
      <b>Microbodies</b>
      are membrane bound specialized structures and include
      <i>peroxisomes</i>
      , which are found in photosynthetic cells near the mitochondria and
      chloroplasts as they are involved in photorespiration, and
      <i>glyoxysomes</i>
      , present in endosperm or cotyledons of fat-storing seeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Spherosomes</b>
      are particulate inclusions in lipid-storing cells. Surrounded by unit
      membrane (structure is debated), they serve in the synthesis, storage, and
      mobilization of triglyceride.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plasmodesmata</b>
      are intercellular junctions and are certainly present in all higher
      plants, not as well known for mosses, algae. 1-15 per μm
      <sup>2</sup>
      cell surface. Typically a 16-20&nbsp;nm hole in the cell wall; junction
      lined with plasmalemma continous between cells; lumen in 7-10&nbsp;nm dia.
      Lumen may contain a tubule (
      <i>desmotubule</i>
      ) along its axis; this tubule may be a membrane continuation of the ER
      between the two cells. These intercellular cytoplasmic connections make up
      the
      <b><i>symplast</i></b>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Intercellular air spaces quite important; conduct the atmosphere
      throughout the plant tissues once air taken in through stomata. Not as
      well formed in meristem, where it is not necessary. These interconnecting
      air ducts form the
      <b><i>apoplast</i></b>
      .
    </p>
    <h2>Structure and Function of The Cellular Components</h2>

    <h3>The Cell Wall</h3>
    <p>
      Discussed in greater detail in Chap. 4. Very tough structure. Makes plant
      cells difficult to study because of the rough treatment necessary to
      extract cells. Basically accounts for the skeleton of the multicellular
      plants.
    </p>
    <h3>The Membranes</h3>

    <h4>General structure and properties</h4>
    <p>
      Singer/Nicholson fluid mosaic applies here: globular proteins in a
      phospholipid unit membrane. Phospholipids are amphipathic: charged head,
      van der Waal lipid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proteins are peripheral or integral. Peripheral usually removed by high
      ionic strength solutions without affecting function; thought to be bound
      only by the polar head anyway. Integral proteins said to be of 3 classes:
      (i) partially embedded but do not pass through; (ii) transmembrane
      proteins; (iii) those thoroughly embedded and not exposed to a hydrophilic
      surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Membrane is
      <q>fluid</q>
      : lateral diffusion of PL on one face; sometimes a flip-flop (transverse
      diffusion). Flip-flops quite rare (once in several hours) compared to
      lateral diffusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much protein-to-lipid: Schwann cell forming myelin has 4:1 (w/w) lipid
      to protein in its membrane, highest known ratio. Bacteria cell membranes
      show a 1:3 (w/w) lipid to protein. Most membranes 1:1 (w/w)
    </p>
    <p>
      Lipid type effect fluidity of membrane at different temperatures.
      Increased unsaturated fats lower the transition from solid gel to liquid
      crystalline phases. Unlike animals, plants unable to regulate cell
      temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unit membranes asymmetric: outer surface properties not like inner
      surface. Well known as well that unit membranes recognize each other's
      type: mitochondria do not fuse with nuclear or chloroplast membranes but
      will with other mitochondria. Same for other unit membranes. Presumed to
      be directed by membrane protein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Membrane is selective barrier to substances. Facilitated transport and
      active transport done here. Others (lipid, water) pass by simple diffusion
      following a concentration or electrochemical gradient. Plant cells capable
      of endo- and exocytosis of solid (undissolved) materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      EM: freeze-fracture thought to show internal hydrophobic surface since
      this part likely to be very weak and capable of fracturing; the ice
      crystals present on the hydrophilic surface is thought to give greater
      strength against such fracture.
    </p>
    <h4>The plasmalemma</h4>
    <p>
      Outer surface of protoplast. Distinct from ER in that it is slightly
      thicker and is w/o ribosomes. Spherical granules seen on outer surface may
      be enzyme complexes involved in making cellulose microfibrils in the cell
      wall. Vesicles derived from Golgi cisternae thought to contain
      polysaccharides are directed by microtubules to plasmalemma, fuse with it,
      and deposit contents exocytically.
    </p>
    <h4>The endoplasmic reticulum</h4>
    <p>
      Continuous with nuclear membrane (as in animals) but not with plasmalemma
      or tonoplast. May connect intercellularly via the plasmadesmata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Composed of a rough ER (ribosome attached) and smooth ER. ER has close
      relationship with Golgi. Microsomes result of reformation of tiny vesicles
      of plasmalemma and ER.
    </p>
    <h4>The tonoplast and vacuoles</h4>
    <p>
      As much as 90% of the mature parenchymatous cell (protoplast) volume taken
      up by a few, maybe a single vacuole. Meristematic cells have only a few
      vacuoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vacuoles contain water (common to all vacuoles). Solutes dissolved in
      water can be as high as 0.4 to 0.6 M; these solutes include Na

      , K

      , Ca

      , Cl

      , SO
      <sub>4</sub>
      <sup>2−</sup>
      , and PO
      <sub>4</sub>
      <sup>3−</sup>
      , carbohydrates (sucrose), other sugars and mucilages, organic acids (esp.
      in CAM plants) inc. TCA cycle acids, phenolics like flavonoids and
      tannins, amino acids, amides, peptides, proteins (some enzymes), betalains
      and alkaloids. Some undissolved amorphous or crystalline suspensions both
      organic and inorganic in nature also found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tonoplast has an unusual unit membrane. It does not stain with
      phosphotungstic acid as does the plasmalemma. Accumulation of substances
      in the vacuole occurs either by active transport associated with permeases
      in the membrane or by fusion with membranous vesicles usu. generated by
      the Golgi.
    </p>
    <p>The large vacuoles of the plant cell have at least three functions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        they maintain cell turgidity by maintaining high vacuolar osmotic
        pressure to press protoplast against wall
      </li>
      <li>
        they provide a storage site for food reserve (as when seed cells store
        aleurone proteins), for animal attractants (flavinoids in flower petals
        to bring insects for pollination purposes), or for animal repulsion
        (unpalatable/poisonous substances to prevent plant consumption)
      </li>
      <li>
        they serve as the functional equivalent of animal cell lysosomes, since
        these vacuoles contain the same sort of hydrolases for a variety of
        macromolecules, and vesicles containing digestible subtances are brought
        to the vacuole in a fusion process similar to lysosomal fusion.
      </li>

    <h4>The Golgi apparatus</h4>
    <p>
      Golgi apparatus can be several Golgi bodies or dictyosomes; in some cells
      there is only one. Each dictyosome is a set of membrane-bound flattened
      sacs in cross section called
      <i>cisternae</i>
      . Number of cisternae in a dictyosome varies from 4-8. Vesicles are found
      at the dilated periphery of the cisternae, appearing to have formed from
      this end of the cisternae. The cisternae never adhere to each other but
      appear to be separated by an unknown intervening substance (10&nbsp;nm
      thick); the ability to isolate dictyosomes by differential centrifugation
      suggests that this substance also binds the cisternae together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cisternae of dictyosomes is often close to and parallel with the ER.
      The further removed a cisterna is from the ER, the larger it becomes and
      the more numerous the vesicular formation at the periphery.
      <i>Transitional vesicles</i>
      have been found to migrate from the ER to fuse with the proximal cisternal
      membranes or each other to form new cisternae. At the distal end of the
      dictyosome the cisternae break up into smaller vesicles which then move
      through the cytoplasm to fuse with plasmalemma or the tonoplast. The
      cementing material in the dictyosome forms and breaks down in the movement
      of one cisterna from the ER face to the distal face.
    </p>
    <h4>The endomembrane concept</h4>
    <p>
      Attributed to Morre and Mollenhauer, a concept that the membranes of the
      tonoplast, ER, Golgi apparatus and its budding vesicles, nucleus are
      continuous both functionally and structurally. Included are the outer
      membranes of the mitochondria and chloroplast, but not the inner
      membranes. This concept says that all new membrane synthesis (both PL and
      protein) originates in the ER and nuclear membranes. Necessary maturation
      occurs when transitional vesicles bud from the ER to pass through the
      Golgi appartus, and vesicle from these move to the tonoplast or
      plasmalemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidence for this theory is from (i) EM pictures showing continuities in
      all these membranes; (ii) pulse-chase studies of radioisotopically labeled
      precursors showing movement of radioactivity through these membranes.
      Radioactivity first appears in the ER, then in dictyosomes, Golgi vesicles
      close to the dictyosome, then G. vesicles close to the plasmalemma and
      tonoplast, then finally in those membranes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for including the outer membranes of the organelles is the
      theory showing that these double membranes appear not to be continuous
      with each other and that the outer membrane represents a vacuolar membrane
      forming around an endosymbiont.
    </p>
    <h3>Ribosomes</h3>
    <p>
      Three different types: cytosolic and those associated with the
      mitochondria and chloroplast. Mitochondrial and chloroplast have same 70S
      size as prokaryotic. The cytoplasmic Rbs are spheroids (oblate or prolate,
      26 and 19&nbsp;nm in the axes), with 60&nbsp;S and 40&nbsp;S which
      dissociate if Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      is low. The 60&nbsp;S subunit holds three rRNA of 25&nbsp;S (1.3 MDa),
      5&nbsp;S (40 kDa), and 5.8&nbsp;S (50 kDa) and between 45-50 protein
      subunits. The 40&nbsp;S subunit contains one rRNA of 18&nbsp;S (700 kDa)
      and about 30 proteins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nucleolus is the site for rRNA synthesis; its multiprotein complement
      is coded in the nucleus and polypeptide synthesis conducted in the
      cytoplasm. Assembly of the Rb appears to occur in the nucleolus however.
      Some proteins associated with the mitochondrial and chloroplastidic
      ribosomes are nuclear-encoded as well. The fully assembled ribosome may be
      found free or attached to the ER.
    </p>
    <h3>The Nucleus</h3>
    <p>
      Has a dia. of 8&nbsp;µm. Surrounded by double membrane, each 80 A thick,
      and a space 150 A separates them (the perinuclear space). The pores are
      30-100&nbsp;nm dia, octagonal in shape; it is estimated that 8% of the
      surface has these pores (200 pores in a 2&nbsp;µm yeast nucleus, well over
      3000 in a higher plant nucleus). Substances entering in the nucleus would
      be expected to be DNA and RNA precurors, histones, Rb proteins, while
      exports are mRNA, tRNA, fully assembled Rb subunits.
    </p>
    <p>
      During mitosis in fungi and lower plants there is no nuclear envelope
      breakdown as occurs in higher plants and in animal cells. Rather the
      membrane partitions, fragmenting and re-forming around the daughter
      nuclei.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chromosomes are not apparent until mitosis. And in mitosis, the nucleolus
      disappears, reappearing afterward and being the only distinguishing
      nuclear feature in the nondividing cell. Chromosome number is constant in
      each cell. Depending on the species, it ranges from four to several
      hundred. Diploidy is the rule, but polyploidy can occur or be induced (for
      benefit). Germ cells are necessarily haploid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Histones are present as five different proteins. Histone I (Lys &gt;&gt;
      Arg, ~21 kDa) is quite variable in sequence depending on the species. The
      core histones are histone IIb1 (Lys ~ Arg, 15 kDa), histone IIb2 (Lys~Arg,
      14 kDa), histone III (Lys &lt; Arg, 15.5 kDa), and histone IV (Lys &lt;
      Arg, 11 kDa).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cell cycles in meristematic tissue are designated in phases as per animal
      cell: M, G
      <sub>1</sub>
      , S, G
      <sub>2</sub>
      . Cell cycle phase duration depends largely upon the amount of DNA to be
      replicated. The onion (Allium cepa) meristem cells require 17 hour cycle,
      with 2 hr for M phase, 2.4 h for G
      <sub>1</sub>
      , 7.4 h for S, and 5.2 for G
      <sub>2</sub>
      . Chromatid replication has occurred in G
      <sub>2</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Much is known particularly about interphase chromosomes (referred to as
      chromatin). EM pictures show relative uncoiled DNA but sufficiently coiled
      as nucleosomes in which the core histones forming an octamer to coil the
      DNA (1.75 turns of DNA, 145 bp long or 80 bp per turn). Nucleosomes show a
      DNA strand pitch of 3&nbsp;nm built wound around a cylindrical core which
      is 5.5&nbsp;nm long and 11&nbsp;nm dia. (The DNA helix itself has a
      2.5&nbsp;nm diameter.) Since the EM picture shows natural chromatin fibers
      exist in widths 2-3 times the nucleosome diameter, it is believed that
      supercoiling of the nucleosomal assemblies occurs, probably as a
      cylindrical hexagonal array.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chromosomal condensation occurs in prophase of mitosis, accompanied by
      nuclear breakdown. The centromere has the same importance and function as
      in animal cells. In the approach to metaphase, a spindle of microtubules
      develops from pole to pole (continuous fibers) which others extend from
      one pole to the equatorial area of the spindle. Fungi and lower plants,
      not breaking down the nuclear membrane, form spindles in the nuclear
      membrane. Half-centromeres holding their chromatids attach to the
      half-spindle fibers at the equator from opposite poles. Centromere
      division is completed in the beginning of anaphase as the chromosomes move
      to opposite poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telophase onset show nuclear envelope reformation in the daughter nuclei.
      The spindle fibers in the equatorial region now form phragmoplast fibers,
      which form a cell plate. A middle lamella will form as the cell plate
      expands from the spindle to the outer wall, and this will be used in
      synthesis of a primary cell wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Endomitotic cycles occur in plant cells undergoing phases of DNA
      duplication unaccompanied by cell division or mitosis. In some cases,
      chromatid separation occurs, and this leads to sister strand synthesis,
      accompanied by chromatid separation again. This is called
      <b><i>endopolyploidy</i></b>
      , and results in a polyploid nucleus. In another form of endomitosis,
      sister-strand synthesis occurs repeatedly without alternating cycles of
      chromatid separation: this is called
      <b><i>polyteny</i></b>
      , and results in polychromatid chromosomes. Polyteny is less common, being
      seen in some nuclei of developing embryos in angiosperms. The
      physiological role of endomitosis is not clear, but is assumed to be a
      form of gene amplification for the purpose of producing large amounts of
      metabolites in a limited time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polyploidy is restricted to the nongametic cell lines. Polyploidy is quite
      common in plants and does not affect mitotic handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In germ line cells of the plant, meiosis is the preparatory step in all
      organisms involved with sexual reproduction. It is observed in pollen
      mother cells of the anthers and megaspore mother cell in the embryo.
      Meiosis in plants is identical with meiosis in animals. Prophase I of
      meiosis is as elaborate as in animal cells (five substages). The
      interphase is marked by an S phase longer in duration than in mitosis with
      no G
      <sub>2</sub>
      phase. Chromosome condense but the chromatids appear as one (although they
      have certainly doubled) in the leptotene substage of Prophase I. Zygotene
      substage involves arranging the homologous pairs (bivalents) with each
      other, presumably by telomeric associations with the nuclear envelope. In
      the pachytene substage, condensation further reduces the length of
      chromatids, and a
      <i>synaptonemal complex</i>
      (an elaborate array of protein molecules forming a central element and two
      lateral elements) has formed between the bivalents; it may be involved in
      the pairing and crossing-over that occurs between these bivalents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing-over thought to include complex enzyme set which include DNA
      repair enzymes to take care of mismatches. The latter is considered since
      DNA synthesis representing 0.3% of total DNA has occurred. Diakinesis in
      Prophase I is shown when the chromosomes are not bivalent but chromosomes
      are connected at chiasmata and are at right angles to each other. Meiosis
      continues into metaphase I with nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle
      formation; it continues to anaphase I with separation, and then the events
      customary in telophase I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only in some plants does an interphase occur in which chromosomes become
      chromatin, and even form nuclear envelope. In others, an interphase is
      absent an prophase II commences. (In any case, events proceed rapidly to
      the meiosis II.). Crossing-over has likely made the chromatids
      nonidentical even though joined at the centromere. Centromere separation
      to give separate chromatids, followed by contraction, then a nuclear
      envelope reformation all occur as in mitosis. Cell division now begins
      around the four nuclei to produce haploid cells. These form
      <i>microspores</i>
      and
      <i>megaspores</i>
      in the male and female gametophyte stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cases where polyploidy may have resulted from endomitotic processes in
      the germ cell lines, meiotic divisions are clearly not normal. While
      homologous pairs line up as multivalents at the spindle, and crossing-over
      is seen to occur, separation of the multivalents is irregular. Euploid
      plants (organisms with even-number chromosomes) have a better chance than
      aneuploid (organisms with odd-number pairs). In general greater than the
      diploid state results in infertility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allopolyploids are interspecies hybridization and they have
      <i>homeologous</i>
      chromosomes which still form bivalents at meiosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      DNA codes for plant genome. Most genes are single copy. Multicopy genes
      (copy number into thousands) include rRNA and tRNA. mRNA and tRNA pass via
      pores to cytoplasm after processing. Three of the highly repeated rRNA
      genes form the nucleolar organizer and transcribe a 45 S precursor
      processed to make the 18 S, 25 S, and 5.8 S, while the 5&nbsp;S is thought
      to be made on a different chromosome.
    </p>
    <h3>Mitochondria</h3>
    <p>
      They take up stain Janus green B specifically. Shape changes with the
      occurrence of cytoplasmic streaming. Number varies with cell size and
      maturity (200 in maize root cap central cells when young; 2500 at
      maturity), but the number per unit cell volume is constant. Some algae
      have only one large mitochondrion but it is highly lobed and extends
      throughout the cell in a
      <i>mitochondrial reticulum</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      A double membraned organelle. Series of folds or invaginations in inner
      membrane: cristae. The cristae are often tube- instead of plate-like.
      Except at invaginations, the inner membrane follows the contour of the
      outer membrane to give a constant
      <i>intermembrane space</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      The envelope of mitochondria show a granular proteinaceous matrix; the
      electron-dense particles seen are ribosomes and Ca-containing granules, as
      well as fibrillar regions (
      <i>nucleoids</i>
      ). The granules of calcium represent a process wherein Ca is actively
      transported (with phosphate) for storage purposes. The fibrillar material
      is DNA, circular and histone-free (as in prokaryotes); 15-75 kbp in size
      and potentially coding 16-80 proteins with each being 300 residues (40
      kDa). It is known that many mitochondrial proteins are coded for by the
      nucleus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mitochondrial matrix holds all TCA cycle enzymes except for the
      flavoprotein succinate dehydrogenase on the inner surface of inner
      membrane. H
      <sup>+</sup>
      -dependent ATPase is present as an integral membrane protein divided into
      two protein assemblies: F
      <sub>1</sub>
      with total 360&nbsp;kDa in five subunits and is the ATPase, soluble and
      appear as the head on the stalk. The membrane-bound complex is F
      <sub>0</sub>
      with total 77&nbsp;kDa in 4 different subunits, and is the proton channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respiratory chain components make up 10% of inner membrane area. Two NADH
      dehydrogenases are flavoproteins; one is on the inner side and catalyzes
      NADH reoxidation, while the other is on the outer face and reoxidizes
      cytoplasmic NADH. Transport continues as usual. The outer membrane has a
      relatively high lipid content and an protein content and type similar to
      the ER. Outer membrane is freely permeable to low MW and certain proteins;
      t he inner membrane is hardly permeable (esp. to ions) and has very
      specific transport systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitochondria divide (possibly when a critical DNA content is shown) by
      invagination of the inner membrane which does not form a crista but fuses
      with the diametrically opposite membrane.
    </p>
    <h3>Plastids</h3>
    <p>
      Family of organelles unique to plants. Many different types (see headings
      below). Proplastids are precursors, abundant in meristem cells.
    </p>
    <h4>Proplastids</h4>
    <p>
      Small, colorless or pale green; they represent undifferentiated plastids
      in shoot and root meristem. Also with inner and outer membrane. A few
      scattered vesicles are apparent, and maybe thylakoids. Small starch grains
      in root meristem. 7-20 per cell in shoot meristem, and 20-40 per cell in
      root meristem; present as well in multicellular algae.
    </p>
    <h4>Chloroplasts</h4>
    <p>
      Found typically in the palisade and mesophyll cells of the leaf, but also
      in guard cells of leaf epidermis, while other epidermal cells have only a
      small number (shade plants being an exception, packed with large
      organelles). Found in cells of other green tissues, but absent in
      meristem. Number varies from 300-400 and 200-300 in per palisade and
      mesophyll cell of spinach leaf, resp. Found at cell periphery near
      plasmalemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      By definition must contain chlorophyll pigment, but are not always green
      as can be masked by presence of other pigments. Lens-shaped (bi-convex,
      plano-convex, concavo-convex), the major axis being 3-10&nbsp;µm.
      Bryophytes examined show one large chloroplast in mature cells of the
      gametophyte, and internal organellar structure similar to vascular plants.
      Eukaryotic algae show variation in size, shape, and cell number. For
      example, in
      <i>Euglena</i>
      spp., lens shape; in
      <i>Spirogyra</i>
      spp., helical;
      <i>Zygnema</i>
      spp., star shaped. Chloroplasts in a wide variety of algae are enclosed by
      a double membrane sac of ER, known as
      <q>chloroplast ER.</q>
      Thylakoids of the blue-greens are free in the cytoplasm as they have no
      chloroplast.
    </p>
    <p>
      System of membranes present within forming lamellae embedded in an
      internal matrix (
      <i>stroma</i>
      ). A single membrane flattened sac is the unit of these lamellar
      formations (
      <i>thylakoid</i>
      ,
      <q>baggy pants</q>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thylakoids appear different in the various organisms. In Rhodophyta they
      are separated but lie parallel, their outer surface studded with
      phycobilisomes (30-40&nbsp;nm dia.). In Cryptomonad algae thylakoids begin
      to stack by twos. With the exception of Chlorophyta, the remaining algae
      show a stacking of 3 thylakoids, whereas stacking in Chlorophyta is
      similar to higher plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous characterizations of the thylakoid indicated two sizes: a
      <i>stromal thylakoid</i>
      the diameter of the chloroplast and smaller (30-60&nbsp;nm dia.)
      <i>granal thylakoids</i>
      stacking here and there (there might be 40-60 grana per chloroplast with
      5-20 thylakoids per granum). The hypothesis was that the lumen of the
      granal thylakoids was not continuous with the stromal thylakoid, but this
      is not so. The grana have actually been shown to be perforated, yet the
      lumen of the thylakoid is entirely interconnected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chloroplast thylakoid structure depends largely upon whether the
      chloroplast develops from an etioplast or a proplastid. From the
      proplastid, the inner membrane is induced to invaginate into the stroma
      and the membrane fuses to form vesicles which flatten. As the lamella
      spreads, it can overlap the lamella at at different plane, observed as
      stacking under EM. From the etioplast, the membranous tubules of the
      prolamellar body are reorganized into the thylakoid system.
    </p>
    <p>In the chloroplast stroma can be found:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <i>plastoglobulin</i>
        —nonmembrane droplets 50-220&nbsp;nm dia. and rich in lipid, usu.
        plastoquinone; occurring near the thylakoid membrane and numerous in
        senescing chloroplasts when the thylakoid breaks down, less numerous
        when it is forming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>starch grains</i>
        —disappear if plant is kept in dark 12-24 hr, but reappear in a few
        hours if light present; mesophyll cells have 1-5 starch grains
        (1.5&nbsp;µm) per chloroplast, but bundle sheath cells in C
        <sub>4</sub>
        very numerous.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>ribosomes</i>
        —both free in stroma and bound to outer thylakoid surface. 70&nbsp;S
        with 22 and 17&nbsp;nm major and minor axes. Dissociate in low Mg
        <sup>2+</sup>
        (&lt; 10 mM) into 50&nbsp;S and 30 S
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>DNA</i>
        or
        <i>chromosomes</i>
        —located in nucleoids in the stroma, the number and size of which
        depends upon the chloroplast size. DNA is circular, histone-free (MW
        83-95 MDa in higher plants; 75-128 MDa in algae). It could code for 126
        proteins of 40 kDa. The large subunit (LS) of rubisco is coded by
        chloroplast; its small subunit by the nucleus.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Etioplasts</h4>
    <p>
      <q>Etio</q>
      here means the plastid in an
      <q>etiolated leaf,</q>
      or a leaf grown in the dark. Etioplasts are found reasonably in the
      cotyledons and primary leaves prior to emergence of germinating seedlings
      from the soil. Should be considered a stage in chloroplast development
      from a proplastid. Irregularly ellipsoidal (major axis 3 μ). Contain a 1-4
      prolamellar bodies which are large quasi-crystalline structures described
      as interconnecting membranous tubules in a regular array. These tubules
      connect tetrahedrally, that is, one connecting point has four tubules
      extending as if rays to the points of a regular tetrahedron. Light induces
      them to flatten and form thylakoids.
    </p>
    <h4>Chromoplasts</h4>
    <p>
      Plastids containing red-, yellow-, and orange-colored pigments
      (carotenoids typically) which account for color in fruit (tomato), flower
      petals, and some roots (carrot). All structural features identical with
      chloroplast, merely the pigment type has been altered. Function of
      chromoplasts may be to serve as color attractant for animals spreading its
      pollen.
    </p>
    <p>Five types of chromoplasts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        globular—containing only homogenous plastoglobuli; found in flower
        petals; plastoglobuli thought to contain the carotenoids
      </li>
      <li>
        membranous—found in daffodil petals, marked by about 25 sets of
        concentric membranes
      </li>
      <li>
        tubulous—found in certain fruit, composed of fibers believed to be
        carotenoprotein complexes
      </li>
      <li>
        reticulo-tubular—containing a ramifying network of non-parallel tubules
      </li>
      <li>
        crystalline—carotenoids in some cases forming crystals, typical in
        hydrocarbon carotenoids
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Amyloplasts</h4>
    <p>
      Mature plastids filled with starch grains. Found typically in cotyledons,
      or seed or tuber endosperm. Also present in differentiated cells of the
      root, particularly in the root cap where they are responsible for
      gravotropism. Their function is as sites in storage tissues for the
      conversion of imported sucrose into starch.
    </p>
    <h4>Interconversion of plastids</h4>
    <p>
      Chloroplasts, etioplasts, chromoplasts, and amyloplasts can form from
      proplastid. The reverse can happen but depends upon cell division.
      Etioplasts can become chloroplasts with light exposure. Chromoplasts
      develop from chloroplasts.
    </p>
    <h4>Division of plastids</h4>
    <p>
      Divison occurs with cell division in meristem, continuing even after cell
      division has stopped in order to reach a final number of chloroplasts
      typical of the cell. Division of the proplastid and chloroplast is known,
      but is not for other plastids. Mechanism for how daughter DNA is
      partitioned is not known.
    </p>
    <h4>Origin of plastids</h4>
    <p>
      Mereschkowski (1905) first to suggest that a blue-green algae established
      a symbiotic relationship with ancestral eukaryote. The comparison between
      red algal chloroplasts and blue-greens is striking: (a) both have freely
      separated (unstacked) thylakoids; (b) thylakoids from both are covered
      with phycobilisomes; (c) both carry out O
      <sub>2</sub>
      -evolving photosynthesis; (d) both have 70&nbsp;S ribosomes; (e) most
      striking is sequence homology between protein and nucleic acid in the
      genome.
    </p>
    <h3>Microbodies (Peroxisomes and Glyoxysomes)</h3>
    <p>
      Organelles bounded by a single membrane. Matrix has fine granules but
      fibrillar or crystalline inclusions also seen. React positively to
      3,3′-diaminobenzidine, a histochemical test for catalase. Oxidases
      generating H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      are present as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Peroxisomes</i>
      usu. found in photosynthetic cells of higher plant leaves. Isolated first
      in 1968 by Tolbert using a pH 7.5-buffered 0.5 M sucrose as extraction
      buffer. Extract is spun at low speed (250 g for 15 min), then 10,000 g for
      30 min. Sediment has mitochondria, proplastids and microbodies. This can
      then be fractionated using 30-60% sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation to
      separate the less dense mitochondria from the more dense microbodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peroxisomes half as numerous as chloroplasts and mitochondria, typically
      associate with these organelles, reasonable in view of the direct role of
      these organelles in photorespiration. The enzyme complement of peroxisomes
      include: glycolate oxidase, Glu:glycolate aminotransferase, Ser:glyoxylate
      aminotransferase, Glu:OAA aminotransferase, hydroxypyruvate reductase,
      catalase, and urate oxidase (the last enzyme here is not involved in
      photorespiration). Peroxisomes found also in C
      <sub>4</sub>
      photosynthetic cells despite no evidence of photorespiration in them;
      mostly in the bundle sheath cells, consistent with a process involving
      photorespiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyoxysomes are in the cells of endosperm or cotyledons of oil-storing
      seeds, and in fat-rich cells of barley and wheat aleurone and maize
      scutellum. First isolated by Beevers (1967) from castor bean seed
      endosperm. Glyoxysomes are isolated with peroxisomes. They closely
      associate with the fat-storing organelles of the plant, the spherosomes.
      This is logical in view of their role in preventing acetyl -CoA oxidation
      to CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      in the TCA cycle. Glyoxylate cycle enzymes are citrate synthase,
      aconitase, isocitrate lyase, malate synthase, and malate dehydrogenase.
      Glyoxysomes also contain other unrelated enzymes: glycollate oxidase,
      hydroxypyruvate reductase, urate oxidase, allantoinase, Ser:glyoxylate
      aminotransferase, Glu:glyoxylate aminotransferase, Glu:OAA
      aminotransferase, His:ammonia lyase, Phe:ammonia lyase, Tyr:ammonia lyase,
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -amino acid oxidase, and
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span>
      -amino acid oxidase. They have unknown roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microbodies in algae are present but it is not known if algae have
      glycolate pathway although they produce glycolate. Some algae can grow
      strictly on acetate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is believed microbodies form from the ER, which buds off from the blind
      end. Observations have been made that the glyoxysome is transformed into a
      peroxisome once light falls on the plant and once fat is consumed in the
      cotylendons and endosperm; this is consistent the use of the glyoxysome in
      the seed and the peroxisome in the leaf.
    </p>
    <h3>Lipid-rich organelles (Spherosomes)</h3>
    <p>
      The storage of lipid in plants is common: castor bean seed endosperm;
      sunflower, rapen and peanut seed cotyledons; aluerone layer in barley and
      wheat; mesocarp in avocado. Fats are stored in membrane-bound spherosomes.
      Two membrane structures hypothesized: (i) customary single-membrane unit;
      (ii) half-membrane unit. Both theories agree ER is source spherosome, with
      triglyceride-synthesizing enzymes embedded in the membrane. The second
      theory suggests that the spherosome starts out as single membrane unit,
      but with accumulation of fats into spherosome, namely in hydrophobic
      region, the inner half shrinks and is resorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spherosome content is generally 80% triglyceride by weight, the balance
      protein and phospholipid making up the synthetic chain and membrane
      boundary, resp. In some seeds, wax esters and not triglycerides make up
      the fat. Spherosomes largely found in seeds where the large amount of
      stored fats are used to get the germinating seedling to the photosynthetic
      stage. Spherosomes also contain a lipase (with acid pH optimum) active
      during germination stages.
    </p>
    <h3>Microtubules</h3>
    <p>
      First seen in animal and algal cells, later in the early 60s in plants.
      Hollow tubules with 24-25 nm dia. and wall thickness of 5-6 nm. Lumenal
      dia. is 12 nm. Two protein subunits, α and β tubulin, polymerize in a way
      that shows a helical pitch between the same subunits. The helical pitch or
      translation is 8&nbsp;nm from β subunit in one helix to the longitudinally
      aligned β subunit in the next helix. 13 subunits make up one 360° rotation
      of the helix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both α and β tubulin have the about the same globular mass (MW 120,000)
      but are different in structure. Both polymerize on subunit at a time to
      extend the variable length of the tubule. Both bind two GTP molecules, one
      tightly and one loosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microtubules occur in the nuclear spindle during mitosis, in the
      cytoplasm, and as the structural components of flagella and cilia in
      motile cells. MT assembly involves the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule.
      <i>Colchicine</i>
      binds to a free tubulin molecule and displaces its GTP; it thereby
      prevents assembly and disassembly of present tubules is promoted in an
      equilibrium relationship between polymerized and free subunits. Colchicine
      has been used to promote polyploidy in plants. The antineoplastics
      vincristine and vinblastine bind to tubulin at sites different from
      colchicine, and they induce crystallization of the mitotic spindle (rather
      than disassembly, as happens with colchicine).
    </p>
    <p>
      In algal cells that which do not acquire their by virtue of cell wall
      deposition, MTs are thought to act as a cytoskeleton, since colchicine
      treatment causes cell to round up. This treatment leads to abnormal
      formation of the algal cell, suggesting that microtubules are necessary in
      orienting the microfibrils of the wall properly. The hypothesis is that
      the MTs conduct the polysaccharide-containing vesicles from their place in
      the Golgi to the plasmalemma location where the wall is to be built.
    </p>
    <h2>Thylakoid Membrane Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The fluid mosaic model works for the thylakoid as for any membrane, with
      proteins floating in a fluid lipid matrix. Half of the dry weight of the
      membrane is protein, a considerable amount relative to other membrane
      types. 26% of the lipid present are the photosynthetic pigments. The other
      lipids are glycolipids (monogalactosyl- and digalactosyldiglycerides) and
      the plant sulfolipid called sulfoquinovosyl diglyceride (this is a
      sulfated glucose at the 6 position, but a C–S and not a C–O–S bond). These
      form the major part of the bilayer. The fatty acyl portion is generally
      mono- or diunsaturated C
      <sub>18</sub>
      fatty acids. Indeed, in some species α-linolenic acid (Δ
      <sup>9,12,15</sup>
      ) is over 90% of the fatty acid present in chloroplast lipids. The
      intention is to give high membrane fluidity.
      <i>Trans</i>
      -3-hexadecenoic acid is an usual fatty acyl function found in the
      phospholipids present in the membrane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proteins in the thylakoid fall into the extrinsically and intrinsically
      bound proteins. The photophosphorylating coupling factor, CF
      <sub>1</sub>
      , is an extrinsic protein removed with the divalent ion chelator EDTA.
      Chlorophyll-binding proteins require membrane dissolving agents such as
      SDS, and chlorophyll is found to remain associated with three distinct
      proteins in the detergent solution when resolved on polyacrylamide gels.
      One band on the gel (est. 28% of membrane protein) is a P700-Chl
      <i>a</i>
      -protein complex with a high Chl
      <i>a</i>
      :Chl
      <i>b</i>
      ratio and has the P700 reaction center.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second band has a lower ratio of Chl a:Chl b (1:1) and is 50% of the
      membrane protein; it is very hydrophobic like the first protein. This band
      is not found in mutants not having Chl
      <i>b</i>
      . The isolated complex transfers energy efficiently from Chl
      <i>b</i>
      to Chl
      <i>a</i>
      , and it has no reaction center. It is thought to be a light-harvesting
      Chl a/b protein complex. Several proteins within it are phosphorylated (on
      threonine residues) in the light, which occurs when certain protein
      kinases are also light-activated. (A light-independent phosphatase is
      always at work to dephosphorylate the proteins.) This phosphorylation
      increases transfer of light energy to PS I at expense of PS II. Generally
      over-excitation of PS II results in excessive reduction of the PQ
      component of the transport chain, thereby activating the protein kinase.
      The kinase is dependent upon Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      in the mM range and a somewhat high ATP/ADP ratio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third SDS gel band runs with the dye front on the standard gel, the
      amount depending upon the time the thylakoid is detergent-treated. This is
      actually a pigment-lipid-SDS aggregation indicating over-exposure of
      detergent to the proteins if the band is significant.
    </p>
    <h2>Isolation of Cellular Components</h2>

    <h3>Cell-Disruption Techniques</h3>
    <p>
      Virtually all disruption methods involve mechanical force since a cell
      wall makes ultrasonic vibration or freeze-thawing cycles used with animal
      cells unsuitable. Blenders with rotary blades produce sufficient shear.
      Full speed at 30&nbsp;S to 2 min is common (buffer:tissue 1:1, w/w), yet
      there is a problem in that nuclei, microbodies, and chloroplasts are
      fragmented.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with loose-fitting glass pestle rotated
      200-400 rpm is more gentle, with small pieces added (buffer:tissue 1:1,
      v/v). Hand grinding with mortar and pestle of small pieces is even more
      gentle, with clean ignited (silver) sand present as an abrasive.
      Temperature should be low (2-4°) in the event compartmentalized components
      react.
    </p>
    <h3>Homogenization Media</h3>
    <p>
      Medium should maintain organellar integrity (where desired) and of
      preventing reactions brought about by mixing of cellular components not
      normally mixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical buffers contain (i) 0.25 M sucrose (or mannitol) which is isotonic
      with cytosol; (ii) buffer salt to hold pH between 7 and 8 (usu. Tris) and
      at 50 mM which is sufficient to compensate for the acids in vacuoles;
      (iii) a reducing agent (10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol or DTT) to prevent
      inactivation of enzymes having an active site cysteine susceptible to
      oxidation; (iv) 10 mM Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      salts so as to prevent ribosome disassembly of both 80 S and 70&nbsp;S
      ribosomes from organelles; (v) calcium (to 1 mM) to prevent clumping of
      nuclei; (vi) polyvinylpyrrolidine, which binds to tannins which might
      otherwise inactivate enzymes.
    </p>
    <h3>Centrifugation</h3>
    <p>
      Differential centrifugation can separate the various cellular components.
      The following procedure is recommended.

    <p>
      Following this method, further purification might be obtained by
      resuspension of the pellet in buffer and then recentrifuging, but sucrose
      density gradients are better. Resuspended pellet is layered atop a sucrose
      gradient (discrete density layers or continuous). (Allowing freshly
      prepared tubes to sit an hour at 2-4° prior to loading gives smoother
      gradients.) Ultracentrifugation is in a swinging bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple isolation of nuclei in 60% (w/w) sucrose (dens.= 1.296 g ml
      <sup>-1</sup>
      ) removes them from other components (nucleus density avg. = 1.32 g ml
      <sup>-1</sup>
      ; next dense material are chloroplasts at &lt;1.24 g ml
      <sup>-1</sup>
      ). Fig 3.19 shows the density of various cellular components and the
      sucrose solution densities necessary to separate them.
    </p>
    <h3>Checking the Identity of Isolated Cell Components</h3>
    <p>
      Various markers should be checked to ensure presence of components and
      their purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intact nucleus can be checked for DNA, which should not be found if
      the nucleus truly is intact. DNA attaches to the nuclear envelope as well,
      so the presence of attached DNA can be checked in the nuclear envelope.
      RNA polymerase I activity is the marker for knowing that the nucleolus has
      been isolated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intact chloroplasts should find no presence of free chlorophyll, rubisco
      (C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants), pyruvate:phosphate dikinase (C
      <sub>4</sub>
      ), or NADP:triose phosphate dehydrogenase. Presence of thylakoids can be
      followed by chlorophyll presence. Presence of the stroma can be checked by
      the enzymes just listed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intact mitochondria should show little presence of cytochrome oxidase,
      fumarase, succinate dehydrogenase, or succinate:cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      oxidase activity. Isolation of the outer membrane is determined by
      checking for antimycin A-insensitive NADH:cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      reductase. The inner membrane can be checked using the enzymes just
      listed: cytochrome oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, and
      succinate:cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      oxidase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Checking for intact proplastids is done by checking for rubisco, fatty
      acid synthase, or nitrite reductase, which should not be present of course
      unless intentionally disrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intact peroxisomes can be monitored by checking for catalase or
      hydroxypyruvate reductase. Intact glyoxysomes also show catalase presence,
      but also isocitrate lyase and malate synthase.
    </p>
    <h3>Isolation of Particularly Fragile Cell Components</h3>
    <p>
      The Golgi dictyosomes are sensitive to rough handling, but gentle tissue
      disruption followed by adding glutaraldehyde to the homogenate holds the
      protein components of the Golgi together so that centrifugation can
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intact vacuoles might be obtained. In yeast, a snail gut enzyme is used to
      digest the cell wall, with osmotic lysis of the protoplast using 0.7 M
      mannitol, which prevents vacuolar lysis. Density gradient centrifugation
      then follows.
    </p>
    <h3>Isolation of Chloroplasts by A Non-Aqueous Method</h3>
    <p>
      Tissue is lyophilized, then disrupted using a hand-operated glass tissue
      grinder using ice-cold cyclohexane and CCl
      <sub>4</sub>
      to a density of 1.32 g ml
      <sup>-1</sup>
      . Homogenate is filtered through cheese cloth, subjected to density
      gradient centrifugation. The gradient is composed of successive layers of
      cyclohexane:CCl
      <sub>4</sub>
      mixture at the following densities (g/ml): 1.36, 1.32, 1.30, 1.29. The
      filtered homogenate is placed on top. Centrifugation is in a swinging
      bucket for 15 min at 12,000 g. Chloroplasts appear at the surface while
      other things are into the gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
      This procedure is used since stromal enzymes are often lost (by leaching)
      during aqueous isolation procedures.
    </p>
    <h1>Chapter 4 The Plant Cell Wall</h1>

    <h2>General Description</h2>
    <p>
      Cell walls play a role in determing cell function and in regulating cell
      expansion as it forms an immovable envelope. Walls show neither chemical
      or physical homogeneity, being composed of different compounds seen as
      different layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polysaccharides are the most important, and exist in a crystalline form
      and an amorphous form. The crystalline polysaccharides are very long
      unbranched molecules which aggregate into
      <i>microfibrils</i>
      , the long axes of the many molecules parallel to each other. Microfibrils
      are embedded in a loose noncrystalline matrix of generally multiply
      branched polysaccharides, usually copolymers. Reinforced concrete is the
      analogy used to describe this assembly, with matrix polysaccharides the
      concrete, and microfibrils the steel rods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lignin is next most important, and is a complex polymer of phenylpropane.
      It is found in the matrix. It is particularly abundant in xylem wall
      structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other components include the proteins used to build the walls and some
      which may be structural. Water supports the wall by its hydrogen bonding
      to give a gel-like rigidity to the wall in some cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The layered nature of the wall can result from differences in thickness,
      ratios of the microfibrillar component to the matrix, orientation of the
      microfibrils with respect to the long axis of the cell, nature of the
      matrix polysaccharides, water content, and extent of lignification. The
      higher plants show 3 layers. The middle layer is first present after cell
      division and is the initial partition. Primary wall growth occurs in a
      manner which permits the daughter cells to change shape and size; it is
      flexible. Once cellular size and shape are no longer changed, secondary
      wall deposition begins; the thickness of the walls can vary, some times
      becoming so thick it fills the cell lumen and the protoplast dies. The
      latter is typical of phloem formation.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Composition</h2>

    <h3>Polysaccharides</h3>

    <h4>Extraction Procedures</h4>
    <p>
      Standard method has evolved in which the presumptive cell wall material is
      dried in oven at 105° or with acetone. Then boiled in water for 12 h.
      Extract has matrix polysaccharides (pectins) and soluble protein. Residue
      is then subjected to mild chlorination: removes lignin and breaks linkages
      between microfibrillar polysaccharides and the hemicelluloses in the
      matrix. Placed in 4 M KOH at room temp for several hours, with a
      supernatant of alkali-soluble hemicellulose and a pellet of microfibrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternative studies using plant cell suspension cultures yield
      microfibrillar components of the primary wall which can be obtained
      soluble without harsh chemical treatment.
    </p>
    <h4>Microfibrillar Polysaccharides</h4>
    <p>
      Cellulose is the chief component. Other microfibrillar polysaccharides are
      chitin (chiefly fungi), the β-1,4-mannans (in some green algal families),
      and the β-1,3-xylans (in other green algal families).
    </p>
    <h5>Cellulose</h5>
    <p>
      Cellulose is composed of unbranched
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -glucopyranose linked β1→4 at the glycosidic bond. About 8000 monomers per
      molecule. OH groups of C2, C3 and C6 unsubstituted. Repeat unit is
      actually cellobiose disaccharide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arranged in
      <b><i>microfibrils</i></b>
      , which are oval-shaped in cross section (viewed down the long axis of the
      fibril). At the microfibrillar
      <i>core</i>
      are cellulose molecules forming a perfect crystal lattice. Moving from the
      core to the outer
      <i>cortex</i>
      , the molecules are parallel but not perfectly bonded as for crystal
      formation (the paracrystalline phase). Found also in this paracrystalline
      cortex are some matrix polysaccharides (usu. hemicelluloses), becoming a
      higher molecular component as the outer regions of the cortex are reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microfibrils are typically many microns long, and if the average cellulose
      molecule is only 4.12&nbsp;µm (for 8000-unit polymer), this must mean that
      many cellulose molecules run the length of the fibril. The cross-section
      of the microfibril shows ~50 molecules span the crystalline core portion
      of the fibril (~3 nm dia.). Another 100 molecules in radial thickness
      proceed from core boundary into the cortex as a mixture of celluloses and
      hemicelluloses. There are many variations depending upon whether higher
      and lower plants and algae are considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      X-ray diffraction of the crystal lattice shows intracellulosic polymer
      H-bonding as well as the covalent glycosidic bond between the glycoside O
      atom and the H atom of the C3 OH moiety in the next monomer. This requires
      180° rotation of alternating glucopyranose molecules about the glycosidic
      bond as opposed to the way in which the structure is normally presented in
      figures. The unit cell has as its asymmetric group cellobiose from 5
      cellulose molecules (
      <i>a</i>
      =8.35 A,
      <i>b</i>
      =10.3 A,
      <i>c</i>
      =7.9 A, β=84°) The
      <i>b</i>
      axis length is equal to the length of a cellobiose disaccharide. Four of
      the five cellobiose run vertically on the corners of the cell, the fifth
      through the center. In the plane formed by the
      <i>a</i>
      and
      <i>b</i>
      axes (002), the puckered ring faces lie flat. The central cellobiose
      molecule in the unit cell shows some that its monosaccharide appears to be
      arranged so that the polymer proceeds in an antiparallel fashion,
      (nonreducing end of one molecule coming from the other direction relative
      to adjacent molecules); the sugar unit of the molecule is also not aligned
      with other sugars in the unit cell. The difficulty of accepting the
      antiparallel orientation of cellulose molecules arises from what is known
      about the directionality of biosynthesis. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding
      involved in forming the crystalline and paracrystalline microfibril comes
      from H-bonding between the H atom on the C6 hydroxyl of one molecule and
      the glycosidic O atom on another.
    </p>
    <h5>β-1,4-Mannans</h5>
    <p>
      Certain green algae have a large part of their wall composed of
      homomannose polymers (they are called
      <q>mannan weeds</q>
      for this reason). The polysaccharide is actually
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -mannopyranose linked β1→4 which arrange themselves in microfibrils
      similarly to the cellulose microfibrils.
    </p>
    <h5>β-1,3-Xylans</h5>
    <p>
      Generally found in algae (
      <q>xylan weeds</q>
      ). The polymer is xylopyranose (not xylofuranose) linked β1→3 without any
      branching, and it forms the microfibrils embedded in a glucan matrix. The
      glucan is removed by the boiling water treatment of the standard
      procedure. Caution is exercised since xylans are soluble in dilute alkali,
      unlike cellulose or the β1→4 mannans yet typical of hemicelluloses.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the structure is crystalline, the lattice differs as a result of the
      glycosidic linkage forcing the chain to coil in a right-handed helical
      structure. There are six monomers per turn with a helical pitch of 18.4 A.
      These helical molecules are able to intertwine (with two others), each
      held together by hydrogen bonding.
    </p>
    <h5>Chitins</h5>
    <p>
      The microfibrillar component of fungi; and also the component of the
      invertebrate exoskeleton. These are long unbranched
      <i>N</i>
      -acetyl-
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -glucosamine linked β1→4. The repeat unit is chitobiose and forms a
      crystalline microfibril with its intramolecular hydrogen bonding similar
      to cellulose. Molecules are clearly arranged in an antiparallel fashion.
    </p>
    <h4>Matrix Polysaccharides</h4>
    <p>
      Matrix polysaccharides are generally either
      <i>hemicelluloses</i>
      or
      <i>pectins</i>
      , with this division based on solubility. Pectins are extracted after
      prolonged boiling in water, while hemicelluloses are polysaccharides
      extracting with 4 M KOH at room temperature. Both groups usually have two
      or more different monomers, and both are branched. Differences in the kind
      of molecules arise between plant groups and also between cell wall layers.
    </p>
    <h5>Hemicelluloses</h5>
    <p>
      A name given by Schulze (1891) because he believed they were precursors to
      celluloses (half-built cellulose molecules), yet they are far from being
      precursors. Hemicelluloses are further subdivided into 3 groups.
    </p>
    <h6>Xylans</h6>
    <p>
      Generally applies to the polysaccharides rich in
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -xylopyranose, whether in main or branched chain. The xylopyranose
      monomers are linked β1→4. Typically 70% of the monomers are acetylated,
      mostly at C3, occasionally at C2. Some 4-
      <i>O</i>
      -methyl-α-
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -glucuronic acid monomers are linked α1→2. This xylan type occurs
      secondary walls of gymnosperms and dicotyledonous angiosperm trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Study of sycamore suspension cultures indicates that the primary wall of
      all dicots may have cellulose molecules with a branching
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -xylopyranose, single residues attaching α1→6. Others may show a
      trisaccharide composed of α-
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span>
      -fucopyranose, α-
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -galactopyranose, and α-
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -xylopyranose.
    </p>
    <h6>Mannans</h6>
    <p>
      The main hemicellulose of coniferous (soft) woods. Hydrolysis shows a
      monomer ratio of 3:1:1 mannose:glucose:galactose. The main chain is β-
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -mannopyranose and β-
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>
      -glucopyranose linked β1→4 in a 3:1 ratio. Single β-
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -galactopyranose are linked to the mannose in the main chain β1→6.
      Hydroxyls at C2 (usually) and C3 of some mannose residues are acetylated.
    </p>
    <h6>Galactans</h6>
    <p>
      These are arabinogalactans, usually abundant in larches but also in small
      amounts in soft- and hardwoods. The main chain is β-galactopyranose
      monomers linked β1→3. Branching is by disaccharide units of galactose or
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span>
      -arabofuranose.
    </p>
    <h5>Pectins</h5>
    <p>
      Occur not only in wall matrix, but also in fruit juices. The most abundant
      are
      <i>polyuronic acids</i>
      , generally multiple units of galacturonic monomers. Marine brown algae
      show a different sort of polyuronic acid, called
      <i>alginic acid</i>
      .
    </p>
    <h6>Polyuronic acids</h6>
    <p>
      Unbranched chains of
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -galacturonic acid, particularly in primary cell wall, linked β1→4. In the
      case of sycamore suspension cultures, 25 galacturonic acid residues form a
      chain in which high MW rhamnogalacturonan is branching from this main
      chain. The branching polysaccharide is a segment of 8
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -galacturonic units linked α1→4 which are separated by a trisaccharide of
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -rhamnopyranose(1→4)galacturonopyr anose(α1→2)
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -rhamnopyranose(1→4)main chain. This rhamnogalacturan group causes the
      chain to zig-zag
    </p>
    <p>
      The –COOH groups in the galacturonate chain can exist in primary wall as
      (i) esterifed to methanol, forming –COCH
      <sub>3</sub>
      ; (ii) as a salt of metal ions, generally with Ca
      <sup>2+</sup>
      , which may impose a rigidity between molecular chains; (iii) merely as
      the ionzed carboxylate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In brown algae, alginic acid is composed of a mixed polymer of β-
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -mannuronic acids and α-
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -guluronic acids: the polmer will have a stretch of the mannuronic acid
      units at one point, guluronic acid units at another, and some stretches
      where the units alternate. Their COOH groups generally form salts with Na
      <sup>+</sup>
      , Ca
      <sup>2+</sup>
      , and Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the plant pectins are used as
      <q>setting agents,</q>
      the alginic acids are used as emulsifiers. Pectins heated in acidic
      solutions (pH ~3) with sugar present will form a jelly when cooled. Often
      fruit is boiled which releases both its pectin and its naturally occurring
      acids. Pectins in water exist as colloids with a large hydration ratio
      because of their negatively charged groups. If sugar is added, in becoming
      hydrated it takes water molecules from pectin which would be used to
      hydrate it; if acid is added, this reduces the number of negatively
      charged groups. As a consequence, pectin begins to associate in a way
      which forms a hydrated gel (jelly or jam).
    </p>
    <h6>Arabinans and galactans</h6>
    <p>
      Arabinans have a linear chain of α1→5-linked
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -arabinofuranose (note 5-member cyclic ring), in which alternate sugar
      units have a single unit of
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -arabofuranose branching α1→3. The galactans are large chains of
      unbranching β1→4 galactopyranose. It appeared at one time that the
      arabinans and galactans were one molecule (arabinogalactans), and there
      may be a arabino(α1→4)galactan link in some cases, but in general they are
      not covalently linked.
    </p>
    <h3>Lignin</h3>
    <p>
      A major element in the tissues which have a support (skeletal) role or
      role in conduction as vascular elements, e.g., xylem or phloem. Hence
      found in the vascular plants but not the nonvascular (fungi, algae).
      Lignin is also found in pith, root, fruit, bud, bark, and cork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lignification occurs late into maturation, after the polysaccharides of
      the cell wall have been placed. Not all of the wall has an even
      distribution of lignin: layers placed first have a greater lignin content,
      meaning the middle lamella and primary wall have the greatest lignin while
      the secondary wall has less.
    </p>
    <p>
      The functions of lignin: (i) Strengthen the cell wall. It does this by
      forming a ramifying (extensively interconnecting) network among the matrix
      regions of the wall, which holds the cellulose microfibrils more rigidly.
      (ii) Lignin protects the cellulose microfibrils from chemical, physical,
      and biological attacks. Lignin may have been a great evolutionary step in
      allowing vascular plants to grow into large upright structures.
    </p>
    <h4>Extraction Procedures</h4>
    <p>
      Very difficult to extract, with the standard treatments typically
      modifying the lignin in particular ways. Among some of the reagents used
      in extraction were 40% HCl, a mixture of 36% HCl and 80% H
      <sub>3</sub>
      PO
      <sub>4</sub>
      (3:1), and 2% H
      <sub>2</sub>
      SO
      <sub>4</sub>
      prior to ammoniacal CuO, all using elevated temperatures. A more mild
      treatment (Brauns, 1939) could extract 5% of the total lignin using
      sawdust soaked in 95% EtOH at room temperature for several days.
    </p>
    <h4>Structure</h4>
    <p>
      Lignin refers to a group of high MW polymers composed mostly, if not only,
      of phenylpropane. The variety comes in the ways these phenylpropanes (not
      structurally varable in themselves) can be linked in the polymer.
      Polymerization is by formation of free radicals which react in ways that
      cannot be controlled. The general appearance of lignins can be drawn
      however (see figure).
    </p>
    <p>{insert figure of gymnosperm lignin here}</p>
    <p>
      Lignins in the gymnosperm, monocots, and dicots differ from one another.
      The differences become apparent when lignins are mildly oxidized by
      nitrobenzene in alkaline medium. The gymnosperm yield mostly vanillin and
      a little
      <i>p</i>
      -hydroxybenzaldehyde; dicots yield most vanillin and syringaldehyde, and
      monocots produce all three. This is because nitrobenzene oxidation will
      produce an aromatic aldehyde
      <i>para</i>
      to the ring carbon holding the aliphatic side chain, in which the group
      para is -OH if the a-carbon of the aliphatic side chain has an -OH or -SO
      <sub>3</sub>
      H group or is involved in forming a carbonyl (C=O) or double bond. From
      these studies it has been possible to show that gymnosperm use
      p-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic alcohol as their main building unit, with the
      another building unit modified with a methoxy group at the
      <i>meta</i>
      position.
    </p>
    <h3>Proteins</h3>
    <p>
      Proteins first discovered in cell wall in 1924, but it was believed to be
      cytoplasmic contamination. Since confirmed that 5-10% of the cell wall is
      protein. Both enzymes and structural proteins are present.
    </p>
    <h4>Enzymes</h4>
    <p>
      Invertase, various glucanases, pectin methylesterase, ATPase, DNase,
      RNase, and phosphatases among the enzymes found. Several oxidases are
      present, including ascorbic acid oxidase and laccase, involved in lignin
      formation. None involved with cell wall synthesis, although they clearly
      hydrolyze certain bonds to allow reshaping or restructuring of the cell
      wall, perhaps permitting cell size changes. The pectin methylesterase
      hydrolyzes the esters to permit salt formation in the polyuronic acid
      polymers.
    </p>
    <h4>Structural Proteins</h4>
    <p>
      A glycoprotein very rich in 4-
      <i>trans</i>
      -hydroxy-
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -proline and fairly rich in Ser, Thr, Ala, and Asp, and containing a
      polysaccharide of arabinofuranose and galactopyranose has been found in
      the cell wall, mostly the primary cell wall. It is possible but not shown
      that it may be covalently linked to cell wall polysaccharides. The name
      extensin has been given to it since a function in cell wall extension has
      been assumed.
    </p>
    <h3>Water</h3>
    <p>
      With pectins a feature of the cell wall, water is especially important in
      that it imparts a gel structure to the wall. Changes in water content can
      affect hydrogen bonding relationships between matrix and microfibrillar
      polysaccharides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water is also a solvent, and its presence clearly affects permeability of
      the cell wall. It is also a reactant in the hydrolytic events which
      clearly reshape or restructure the wall. Water is thought to be replaced
      by lignin when cell growth stops, making the entire cell wall rigid.
    </p>
    <h3>Incrusting Substances</h3>

    <h4>Cuticular Substances (Cutin and Suberin)</h4>
    <p>
      The outermost surface of cell walls of epidermal cells covered with
      hydrophobic cuticle. Cuticle function is to prevent losses or gains of
      water of leaf tissue, and it also serves a function in protecting leaf
      from physical, chemical and biological attack. Composed of three layers:
      (1) an outermost
      <i>epicuticular wax</i>
      , the ordering of wax molecules appearing crystalline; (2) a layer of
      <i>cutin embedded in wax</i>
      ; (3) an inner layer which is a mixture of cutin, wax, cell wall
      polysaccharides and traces of protein. This innermost layer connects to
      the middle lamella of epidermal cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Cutin</i></b>
      is principle polymer, consisting of hydroxy fatty acids of different kinds
      linked by ester bonds in an extensive interconnecting network. The fatty
      acid portion is generally 16 or 18 carbons which are either (
      <i>a</i>
      ) saturated or monounsaturated, (
      <i>b</i>
      ) ω-hydroxy saturated or monounsaturated, (
      <i>c</i>
      ) di- or trihydroxy saturated units with at least one –OH group on the
      ω-carbon and the others on the carbons 9 and 10. The esters form when the
      –OH group condenses with the acid moiety of fatty acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The epicuticular wax is truly complex in mixture: esters of fatty acids
      and long-chain alcohols; free long-chain fatty acids and hydroxy fatty
      acids; free long-chain alcohols (primary, secondary, and α,ω-diols);
      long-chain alkanes and long-chain ketones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Suberin</i></b>
      is a polymer replacing cutin above the epidermal cell surface for
      epidermal cells in the underground region (i.e., it is found in roots and
      tubers). The building blocks for suberin are (i) α,ω-saturated or
      monounsaturated dicarboxylic acids (carbon length from 16 carbons to 22
      carbons), the predominant molecule being octadec-9-en-1,18-dioic acid,
      HOOC(CH
      <sub>2</sub>
      )
      <sub>7</sub>
      CH=CH(CH
      <sub>2</sub>
      )
      <sub>7</sub>
      COOH [Mitch's note: there is no indication as to whether the double bond
      is
      <i>cis</i>
      or
      <i>trans</i>
      ]; (ii) ω-hydroxy saturated or unsaturated fatty acids; (iii)
      α,ω-long-chain diols.
    </p>
    <h4>Inorganic Compounds</h4>
    <p>
      Mineral inclusions in the cell walls include CaCO
      <sub>3</sub>
      and CaSiO
      <sub>3</sub>
      . The salts are also found as crystalline bodies in the cytoplasm or cell
      vacuole. Other mineral salts are found in the walls of special cells (hair
      cells) in borages, crucifers, and curcurbits and in the walls of silcious
      cells of green algae.

    <h3>Higher Plant Cell Walls</h3>
    <p>
      Middle lamella is the first layer formed, typically when newly divided
      cells are producing the cell plate. The middle lamella is then used as a
      substratum for primary wall synthesis. It is free of cellulose
      microfibrils; believed to be composed of pectins. It is has no lignin in
      the
      <q>soft</q>
      tissues of the plant (e.g., pith, cambium) but is heavily lignified in
      woody tissues.
    </p>
    <h4>Primary wall physical structure in Dicotyledenous Plants</h4>
    <p>
      Primary wall construction involves placement of cellulose microfibrils
      among the matrix sugars. At the end of cell growth change, secondary wall
      formation may begin from the primary wall boundary. If it does, the
      primary wall becomes lignified. Where there is no secondary wall (it
      depends on the particular tissue), the primary wall may or may not become
      lignified. The matrix sugars of the primary wall in dicots are generally
      pectins; limited studies indicate that pectins are only a minor component
      of monocot primary walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      A model of dicot primary wall construction has been put forth by
      Albersheim (1978) to indicate the relationship of the microfibrils and
      various matrix polysaccharides. With the cellulose microfibrils forming
      the girders, the hemicellulosic xyloglucans completely coat the cellulose
      fibers, being held to them by hydrogen bonding. The reducing ends of
      xyloglucans are thought to be covalently linked to reducing ends of
      arabinan-galactan molecules (labeled arabinogalactan in the figure). The
      arabinogalactan molecule, in fact, several of the arabinogalactan
      molecules, then link to a particular rhamnogalacturonan or to another,
      making an extensive network giving stability to the entire primary cell
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model is based on assumptions related to the re-orientation of
      cellulose microfibrils during growth. Note the microfibrils are not
      covalently attached to the matrix sugars, but are fixed by hydrogen
      bonding. As a cell grows the microfibril can re-orient with respect to
      matrix sugars as water is abundant in the cell wall during this period (it
      breaks the hydrogen bonds between the microfibrils and matrix sugars). As
      lignin replaces water and fixes the microfibrils and matrix sugars, the
      cell no longer needs a size or shape change nonetheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      EM work shows microfibrils are randomly oriented in meristem cells,
      becoming oriented in an organized fashion along the long axis of the cell
      during the elongation of the cell. Fibrils at the ends of the cell remain
      randomly oriented. The orientation of microfibrils on the inner surface of
      the primary wall are transversely arranged (i.e., at right angles) to the
      longitudinally-oriented (i.e., along the cell length) microfibrils on the
      outer surface (the surface further from the cell). In between the outer
      and inner surface is a gradient of alternatively-oriented microfibrils.
      This arrangement has been called the
      <i>simple multinet</i>
      structure. In addition to this structure is the observance of
      <i>axial ribs</i>
      of longitudinally oriented microfibrils between the simple multinet. Some
      ribs are oriented through the thickness of the wall (
      <i>integral ribs</i>
      ), and others are superimposed on the outer surface of the wall (
      <i>outer ribs</i>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the various tissues these two microfibril arragements, the simple
      multinet and the longitudinally rib structures, are used to suit the cell.
      Walls of hair cells have only the simple multinet, parenchyma cells use
      both the multinet and longitudinal ribs, and collenchyma primary walls
      used longitudinal ribs as the predominant arrangement. It should be
      recalled that the primary wall is breached in places where plasmadesmata
      pass, and this region of the primary wall shows a reduced deposition of
      cell-wall material, marked as the
      <i>primary pit field</i>
      .
    </p>
    <h4>Secondary wall physical structure in Dicotyledenous Plants</h4>
    <p>
      In cells depositing a secondary wall, cellulose microfibrils embedded in
      matrix sugars are used as in the primary wall. But three differences
      emerge:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Number of lamellae (sublayers) present. As already mentioned, the
        secondary wall shows discrete sublayers in which S
        <sub>1</sub>
        is the outermost, S
        <sub>2</sub>
        is the middle sublayer and the thickest (it is further subdivided into
        sub-sublayers), and S
        <sub>3</sub>
        is the innermost. The differences between the S sublayers is the helical
        angle or pitch of the cellulose microfibrils, described below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Orientation of the microfibrils. Rather than the simple multinet
        arrangement, the microfibrils in the sublayers attain a helical
        arrangement along the length of the cell. In the S
        <sub>1</sub>
        lamella microfibrils arranged into left- and right-handed helices in
        which both make a 50° angle with respect to the long axis of the cell.
        The microfibrils in each of the S
        <sub>2</sub>
        sub-sublayers make only a slight helical twist around the long axis (the
        deviation angle being 10° from the long axis); there is only one
        left-handed helix and not the crossing helices as in S
        <sub>1</sub>
        . In S
        <sub>3</sub>
        lamella, again there is only a single helix which is at a virtual right
        angle to the fibers in S
        <sub>2</sub>
        , i.e., it is a right-handed twist 80° from the cell length axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Matrix composition. The pectins which largely make up the primary wall
        are replaced by hemicelluloses in the secondary wall.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Some exceptions to secondary wall structure are observed. Some cells show
      on an S
      <sub>1</sub>
      -type lamella, others only S
      <sub>1</sub>
      and S
      <sub>2</sub>
      , and other combinations are found. Bamboo plant cells show alternating S
      <sub>1</sub>
      and S
      <sub>2</sub>
      sublayers repeated three or four times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lignification of the secondary wall occurs to a limited extent
      (lignification is a feature of the primary wall and middle lamella
      usually), and often not in S
      <sub>3</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <h3>Algal Cell Walls</h3>
    <p>
      The cell wall structure of microfibril/matrix polysaccharides is the
      similar framework. Differences occur with microfibrils, in which cellulose
      is replaced by the mannans and xylans discussed in previous sections.
      Lignin is not a feature of these cell walls. And while there are many
      layers, there is no primary or secondary wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tropical marine alga
      <i>Valonia</i>
      is the model. The walls of the mature organism are 40&nbsp;µm thick,
      composed of about 1600 lamellae each 20 nm thick. Each lamella is the
      thickness of one or two microfibrils (microfibrils have greater
      cross-sectional area than those of higher plants). The orientation of all
      microfibrils in the lamellae is helical, running from one pole of the cell
      to the other. In one case microfibrils align in an 80° left-handed twist
      with respect to the cell's long axis; in another microfibrils align in a
      10° left-handed twist; a third set forms a right-handed helix bisecting
      the angles of the other two. Lamellae with left-handed helically arranged
      microfibrils are the more numerous (about 1200—or 600 each—of the 1600).
      There is only one of the lamellae (the outermost and the oldest) in which
      the microfibrils are randomly oriented, and this is from the young, naked
      aplanospore of the alga.
    </p>
    <h2>Biosynthesis of Cell Wall Components</h2>

    <h3>Polysaccharides</h3>

    <h4>Microfibrillar Polysaccharides</h4>
    <p>
      The microfibrils must logically be formed at the outer surface of the
      plasmalemma. Evidence comes from EM work showing the presence of partially
      embedded, squarely-packed spherical granules. Fibers with the established
      dimensions of microfibrils emanate from the granules. Granule diameter is
      somwhat larger than the major axis length of the ellipsoidal cross section
      of the microfibril. In green algae producing cellulose microfibrils, the
      granule diameter is 30&nbsp;nm (microfibrillar major axis is 18.5 nm); in
      the higher plants, granules have a 15&nbsp;nm diameter and a cellulose
      microfibril diameter of 8.5 nm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is believed that these granules are protein aggregates of the cellulose
      synthase complex. The primer is the nonreducing end of an existing
      cellulose molecule already a member of a microfibril. The cellulose
      synthase complex is composed of subunits (each with catalytic activity)
      which must align themselves with the crystalline microfibril, presenting a
      number of ordered nonreducing ends, and catalyze the transfer (apparent
      condensation reaction, but actually using GDP-glucose as a reactant) of
      glucose to the nonreducing end. Hence, the entire microfibril is elongated
      at once rather than a separate assembly of cellulose molecules later laid
      down in the microfibril. It appears that the granule, fixed to and moving
      laterally along the membrane, makes random contact with the microfibrillar
      ends, elongates, and then leaves as the microfibril and granule move. The
      granule may meet with and extend another microfibril when it encounters
      it; hence a single microfibril may be produced from several granular
      complexes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The square packing of the granule is believed to impart directionality in
      microfibrillar synthesis. If the orientation of the enzyme complex can be
      controlled by the cell (from within?), then the cell can control the
      ultimate microfibril orientation for its own benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GDP-glucose substrate (see Chap. 7 on the reactions producing it) is
      made within the protoplasm and then exported to the plasmalemma for use by
      the cellulose synthase complex granules at the surface. Whether transport
      is by active transport processes across the membrane or by exocytosis (the
      vesicles from the Golgi?) is not clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      One problem with the model of the cellulose synthase complex extending the
      microfibril is how such a mechanism can occur and the microfibril have an
      anti-parallel arrangement of cellulose molecules. Much remains to be known
      about the synthetic processes involved in making mannan and xylan in algae
      and chitin in fungi which form the microfibrils of the cell walls of those
      groups.
    </p>
    <h4>Matrix Polysaccharides</h4>
    <p>
      The pectins and hemicelluloses used in the matrix are synthesized in the
      Golgi cisternae, since purified Golgi complexes show the presence of the
      synthetic enzymes of these polysaccharides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional work by Northcote shows this as well. Wheat root was treated 5
      min with
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -[U-
      <sup>3</sup>
      H]glucose and the radioactivity found to be located entirely within the
      Golgi bodies. Analysis revealed it had been incorporated into a
      polysaccharide composed of
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -galacturonic acid,
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -galactose, and
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -arabinose, components of pectin. Roots pulsed with labeled glucose for 15
      min then chased for different time periods (10, 20, and 60 min) showed
      movement of the radioactivity from the Golgi cisternae to the Golgi
      vesicles surrounding the cisternae, then to vesicles close to the
      plasmalemma, and then to those fused with the plasmalemma. Eventually the
      label was found in the cell wall. These results show unequivocally that
      the polysaccharide is made in the Golgi, transported without modification
      to the plasmalemma, then incorported into the cell wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is consistent with studies of the cell plate of new divided cells.
      Vesicles from the Golgi (presumably replete with the matrix polysaccharide
      pectin) have been shown to coalesce along the margins of the forming cell
      plate. The cell plate is destined to become the middle lamella, which is
      known to be pectin-rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      With cell maturation, there may be a regulatory mechanism switching Golgi
      function from synthesizing pectins to synthesizing hemicelluloses, since
      the principal matrix polysaccharides of the secondary wall are
      hemicelluloses.
    </p>
    <h3>Lignin</h3>
    <p>
      Evidence of how lignin is made is again from use of radioactively labeled
      precursors during periods in which lignification is occurring. The
      position of the label in the molecules has been both at specific carbon
      atoms and use of uniformally or generally labeled molecules (e.g., [U-
      <sup>14</sup>
      C]glucose or [G-
      <sup>14</sup>
      C]glucose). Analysis of the lignin molecules was usually done
      degradatively to identify which atoms in the lignin had the label,
      determining if there was a regular way in which the label was
      incorporated. If the atom was randomly labeled, it indicated that the
      precursor had been used indirectly. Most of the experimental work has been
      done with grasses since they are easier to manipulate than woody plants
      (which produce most of the lignin of all organisms). Initial studies with
      <sup>14</sup>
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      showed without surprise that lignin becomes labeled, but it also
      demonstrated that the label remains throughout the life of the plant, as
      lignin is a very stable structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also not surprising that labeled glucose ends up in lignin, since
      that is the reduced carbon source produced from CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      which serves as carbon for nearly all other biosynthetic processes. Use of
      [1-
      <sup>14</sup>
      C]glucose and [6-
      <sup>14</sup>
      C]glucose and the analysis of the label position in the vanillin
      (degradation product of lignin) suggested that the aromatic rings of
      lignin derive from shikimic acid. Shikimic acid is present in stems and
      leaves. It is found that [2,6-
      <sup>14</sup>
      C]shikimic acid incorporates unchanged into sugar cane lignin. The
      biosynthesis of shikimic acid from glucose has been worked out for
      bacteria and fungi, and evidence exists that it is the same in plants.

    <p>
      The reaction of PEP condensing with E4P is similar to an aldol
      condensation and the mechanism of action illustrated is based upon the key
      finding from labeling studies that
      <sup>18</sup>
      O atom in the phosphoryl group of PEP is
      <q>lost</q>
      to the P
      <sub>i</sub>
      product in the aldolase reaction. The next enzyme is involved in
      cyclization, again with bond formation being driven by relatively lower
      energy involved in a phosphate leaving group. NAD
      <sup>+</sup>
      is required, believed to oxidize the C5 hydroxyl which facilitates
      elimination of the phosphate and activates the cyclizing carbon as an
      enol.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reaction pathway is known to lead to synthesis of the aromatic amino
      acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, which clearly provide the phenylpropane
      backbone in lignin synthesis. Phe is actually a precursor in all plants,
      while Tyr is effective only in grasses. Synthesis of the amino acids
      continues from the phosphoshikimate to prephenate, which provides both
      amino acids.

    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanism for the 5-enoylpyruvyl shikimic acid 5-phosphate synthase
      enzyme has been determined using
      <sup>3</sup>
      H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O, in which label is incorporated into the methylene group. [Mitch's note:
      the intermediate is apparently stable and isolatable, or the reaction may
      have been monitored using proton NMR in order to make this determination.]
      The sum of the reactions put two double bonds in the ring, making way for
      aromatizing the ring. One reaction not shown in the arogenate pathway in
      blue-green algae, in which prephenate is aromatized to form arogenate, an
      immediate precurosor to tyrosine. The transamination reactions shown
      employ glutamate as the nitrogen donor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional reports suggest a hydroxylation of Phe to form Tyr, but it is
      unlikely that Phe is the substrate. The deamination reactions involving
      the respective ammonia lyases for Phe and Tyr to yield the α,β-unsaturated
      aromatic acids occur by a mechanism involving amine removal, followed by
      loss of a β
      <i>pro</i>
      -S proton to produce the
      <i>trans</i>
      product. The tyrosine deamination occurs only in grasses. Either of the
      products (
      <i>trans</i>
      -cinnamic acid and
      <i>trans</i>
      -
      <i>p</i>
      -coumaric acid) would be suitable precursors to forming the lignin
      building molecules (see below), but
      <i>trans</i>
      -
      <i>p</i>
      -coumaric acid is the immediate precursor. Conversion of
      <i>trans</i>
      -cinnamic acid to the trans-p-coumaric acid is the action of the enzyme
      cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. This enzyme is a cytochrome P450-mixed function
      oxygenase, and it requires NADPH and O
      <sub>2</sub>
      , typical of this enzyme class. This enzyme occurs in the microsome and
      has been studied in young
      <i>Catalapa</i>
      leaf, etiolated pea, and sorghum shoots. The mechanism of mixed function
      oxidases has been studied and involves a complex migration of atoms called
      the
      <q>NIH shift</q>
      (NIH=Natl. Inst. of Health) (see figure).

      From trans-p-coumaric acid is the route to p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl
      alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol, the lignin-building units. The reactions
      involved include hydroxylation of the ring C3 (and also C5 sometimes),
      methylation of these hydroxyl groups but not the one at C4, and reduction
      of the aliphatic COOH to an alcohol (CH
      <sub>2</sub>
      OH), the steps occurring in that order. The methyl donor in the
      methylation reaction is the all-purpose
      <i>S</i>
      -adenosylmethionine found in many methylation reactions. COOH reduction
      first involves formation of the thioester of coenzyme A (to make –COSCoA),
      then reduction to the aldehydes, then reduction of the aldehyde to the
      primary alcohol. It should be noted that both that the thioesterification
      and both reduction steps for all 3 molecules is done by a single enzyme
      with obvious broad substrate specificity. The reactions are shown in the
      figure.

      The lignin precursors are stored in cambial cells as their β-glucosides.
      The reducing end of the sugar forms the β-anomer by condensing with the
      4-hydroxyl group on the ring. When the precursors are needed, a
      β-glucosidase in the cells hydrolyzes them for mobilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was first suggested that compounds like coniferyl alcohol were involved
      in the polymerization reactions producing lignin (Erdman, 1939), and later
      confirmed (by Freudenberg in 1950s) in a reaction in which a lignin-like
      polymer was obtained with coniferyl alcohol placed in a fungal phenol
      oxidase under aerobic conditions. The enzyme was found to be laccase (name
      from the Japanese lac tree), a Cu
      <sup>2+</sup>
      -containing phenol monooxygenase. The copper center reacts with a hydroxy
      phenyl in a one-electron oxidation to produce and oxygen radical. The Cu
      <sup>+</sup>
      prosthetic group is oxidized by molecular oxygen for the next catalytic
      step. The reactions are shown below.

      Various dimeric coniferyl alcohols were isolated from the lignin-producing
      reactions to examine how the radicals form for this molecule. At least
      three types of dimers were found, indicating coniferyl alcohol can link in
      three different ways. One mechanism is given for one of the dimers,
      guaiacyl glycerol-β-coniferyl ether: the 4-oxyradical is formed by
      laccase. The extensive conjugation in the molecule can stabilize the free
      radical at other positions in the ring (ortho and para to the carbon
      holding the oxyradical), and at position in the aliphatic side chain,
      namely the β-carbon to the ring. When the radical is at this carbon in the
      aliphatic chain (the ring is now a quinone), it can react with a nascent
      coniferyl oxyradical to form the ether-linked dimer, quenching the
      radicals present. A spontaneous hydration reaction stabilizes the quinone
      methide into the final product.
    </p>
    <p>
      In lignin formation, the free radical reactions are generally likely to
      result in one monomer free radical reacting to with another monomer, and
      the dimer, still a free radical reacts with the appropriate site in
      another monomer, the process of adding monomers continuing
      <i>ad infinitum</i>
      . Gymnosperm lignin is built primarily from coniferyl alcohol.
      Dicotyledonous lignins are built from coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol free
      radical reactions. And monocot lignins are even more complex, adding
      <i>p</i>
      -coumaryl alcohol to the mix of monomers used in building.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the free radical reactions occur in the cell wall although the
      monomers are synthesized within the cell. Regulation of lignin synthesis
      late into the cell growth stages may be at the point of the
      4-coumarate:CoA ligase, which begins the process of preparing the alcohols
      from the aromatic acids.
    </p>
    <h3>Proteins</h3>
    <p>
      Proteins in animal cells targeted for secretion from the cell are
      synthesized in the rough ER. The synthetic processes involved with signal
      peptides (a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at the N-terminus
      indicating the protein is to be secreted or become a membrane protein) has
      much experimental evidence. The protein synthetic process being completed,
      the protein moves to the lateral bend where vesicles of the ER form and
      give rise to transitional vesicles which fuse and form the Golgi
      cisternae. An enzyme in the Golgi trims the signal peptide from the amino
      terminal. The protein is targeted for secretion, being transported by
      vesicles which fuse with the plasmalemma and which dump the protein
      (enzymes) into the extracellular space. The manner in which proteins are
      placed in the cell wall of the plant is likely to be no different than the
      explanation for plant cells.
    </p>
    <h3>Incrusting Substances</h3>
    <p>
      Studies of the biosynthetic processes for the waxes and monomers of cutin
      used in the epidermal cell wall areas depositing them have been done and
      more is known about these processes than is known as to how the monomers
      are used in forming cutin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mineralization of cell walls is found in only a small number of
      plants, and in those cases, increases in mineral content correlated with
      plant age. Hence, accumulation of minerals may reflect the plant cell's
      attempt to deal with imbalances in cell mineral concentration.
    </p>
    <h2>Formation and Growth of The Cell Wall</h2>
    <p>
      In the pertinent stages of mitosis, formation of a cell plate during
      division marks the first appearance of a primary wall being prepared.
      While chromosomes migrate to the opposite poles, parts of the ER and
      ribosomes accumulate at the equatorial region. Parts of the ER then form
      and interconnecting network with the spindle fibers, the resulting
      structure called the phragmoplast. The phragmoplast begins to extend
      within the limits set by the spindle structure toward the plasmalemma.
      While this process develops, vesicles of about 20-50&nbsp;nm dia. appear
      within the phragmoplast, and these vesicles clearly appear to be the
      pectin-rich Golgi-derived vesicles guided to the cell plate by the spindle
      microtubules. While the first cell wall (middle lamella is formed) some
      connections between the cells will remain as perforations in the cell
      wall, maturing as the plasmodesmata.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growth of primary wall, the deposition of cellulose microfibrils in
      the transverse and longitudinal orientations, their synthesis on the
      outside of the cell, has been mentioned elsewhere. The changes in the
      types of matrix polysaccharides and microfibrillar orientation involved in
      secondary wall formation have been discussed as well. The process and time
      of lignification, and where it occurs most, has also been discussed.

    <h1>Chapter 5: Photosynthesis</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Photosynthesis is the use of light via the agency of chlorophyll to
      convert CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      to carbohydrates. The conversion requires a reduction (protons and
      electrons), since CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is at a higher oxidation state. The CO

      of energy must come from the sun, since water does not normally donate
      electrons to an very strong reducing agent in X/X
      <sup>−</sup>
      .

    <h2>Photosynthetic Organisms</h2>
    <p>
      From algae to the higher plants, all that is green and has chlorophyll is
      photosynthetic. Photosynthetic bacteria also account for a major portion
      of the carbon-fixing biosphere: the order Rhodospirillales is divided into
      the suborders Rhodospirillineae and Chlorobineae. The Rhodospirillineae
      have two families, the Chromatoaceaea or purple sulfur bacteria (formerly
      Thiorhodaceae) and the Rhodospirillaceae or purple nonsulfur bacteria
      (formerly Athiorhodaceae). The Chlorobineae contain one family, the
      Chlorobiaceae or green sulfur bacteria (formerly Chlorobacteriaceae).
    </p>
    <p>
      The bacterial photosynthetic systems differs from plants in that they
      utilize only one photosystem in which the chlorophyll pigments are also
      different. Also the reductant for CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is generated somewhat differently in some bacteria (ATP is used to reverse
      electron flow or alter in the respiratory chain). In other, the electrons
      are taken from molecules other than water. In general, photosynthetic
      bacteria do not generate oxygen as an end product (as they are certainly
      sensitive to it).

    <h2>The Light Phase of Photosynthesis</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>
      Hence for one mole NADPH, 220 kJ light energy is necessary. One mole of
      light of wavelength 700&nbsp;nm produces 171 kJ energy, so two moles of
      photons are necessary at the minimum. Actually four are necessary (see
      below). The flow of electrons from water to NADP
      <sup>+</sup>
      is being defined experimentally, but two photosystems (PS I and II) are
      necessary. They work by gathering the light energy (photons) via antenna
      pigments, which transmit the energy via
      <q>molecular excitons</q>
      to a
      <q>reaction center.</q>
      At the reaction center, chlorophyll (Chl) is raised to an excited state
      (Chl*) and becomes a reducing agent to an acceptor (A), which receives an
      electron from Chl* to become Chl
      <sup>+</sup>
      . The A
      <sup>−</sup>
      which results passes its electrons to NADP
      <sup>+</sup>
      . Chl is regenerated by accepting electrons from a donator (D
      <sup>−</sup>
      ) to reduce Chl
      <sup>+</sup>
      . The D
      <sup>−</sup>
      must have obtained its electrons from H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O ultimately.
    </p>
    <h3>Photosynthetic Pigments</h3>
    <p>
      The plant pigments are the chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phycobilins. All
      pigments interact with proteins in some way, with the chlorophylls and
      carotenoids interacting via noncovalent linkages, but the phycobilins
      being covalent. For these reasons, chlorophylls and cartoneoids are easy
      to extract with alcohol or acetone in macerated tissue. Phycobiliproteins
      are water-soluble and come out of tissue in water or dilute salt
      solutions.
    </p>
    <h4>Chlorophylls</h4>
    <p>
      Four different chlorophylls are found in plants (see table with
      structure). Chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      is found in all members of the plant kingdom (including algae) and is the
      most abundant within each species. Chlorophyll
      <i>b</i>
      is also widespread but is not found in algae except Chlorophyceae and
      Euglenophyceae. Chlorophyll
      <i>c</i>
      exists as two types,
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>1</sub>
      and
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>2</sub>
      ; both are found in Phaeophyceae (brown algae), Chrysophyceae
      (yellow-brown algae), and Bacillariophyceae (diatoms), but only
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>2</sub>
      is found in Cryptophyceae. Chlorophyll
      <i>d</i>
      has been extracted only from Rhodophyceae (red algae), but it may be a
      chemically altered form and may not exist in vivo.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <img
        src="./imagesPlantBiochemistryHTML/AccessoryPigments.gif"
        alt="structures of photosynthetic accessory pigments"
      />
    </p>
    <h4>Carotenoids</h4>
    <p>
      Carotenoids serve other functions as well as photosynthetic pigments, as
      they are found in nonphotosynthetic organisms such as fungi and in
      nonphotosynthetic tissues of photosynthetic plants such the petals,
      anthers, pollens, and in the eyespot of
      <i>Euglena</i>
      spp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher plants make use of the carotenes, α- and β-(VII and VI), and the
      xanthophylls, lutein (IX), violaxanthin (X), and neoxanthin. Pteridophytes
      and bryophytes also show the presence of the pigments. Chlorophyceae has
      the typical higher plant carotenoids, and Chrysophyceae has such a high
      quantity of fucoxanthin (XIII) that its pigment is a result of the
      presence. Carotenoid glycosides are characteristic of blue-green algae:
      myxoxanthophyll (XVII)
    </p>
    <h4>Phycobilins</h4>
    <p>
      Occur in three algal families, namely Rhodophyceae, Cyanophyceae, and
      Cryptophyceae. On the basis of their color, they are divided into red
      phycoerythrins and blue phycocyanins, and both occur in all the families
      listed above. Phycoerythrin is present substantially in Rhodophyceae,
      phycocyanins in Cyanobacteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Structurally they are open tetrapyrroles and can be represented in their
      linear configuration or closed (see structures below). Phycoerythrin and
      -cyanin are composed of two different protein subunits, α (MW~19,000) and
      β (MW ~21,000), which occur 1:1, with ea. subunit carrying covalently
      bound phycobilin, either 1-4 molecules depending upon the source. Some
      subunits predominate with one phycobilin, either phycoerythrobilin or
      phycocyanobilin, but some subunits carry both. The subunits aggregate as
      (α,β)
      <i><sub>n</sub></i>
      in vivo, where
      <i>n</i>
      is 3 or 6 with MW of ~134,000 and ~268,000, resp. In algal cells these
      phycobiliproteins aggregate into granules of regular array at the surface
      of the thylakoid and are called
      <b>phycobilisomes</b>
      .
    </p>
    <h3>Absorption Spectra of The Photosynthetic Pigments</h3>
    <p>
      The three pigment classes absorb light in different parts of the spectrum,
      with chlorophylls absorbing in the blue (~450 nm) and red (650-700 nm),
      carotenoids between 400-500 nm, and phycocyanins between 500-650 nm. One
      must be careful in determining these absorption maxima however, since the
      in vivo maxima are different than when these pigments are in chemical
      solvents. Chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      , for example, has a sharp maximum at 662&nbsp;nm in ethyl ether but this
      red peak has been found to have broader maximum in vivo. The broad maximum
      is actually the result of summed component peaks of at least six different
      species of chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      which have different maxima:
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>700</sub>
      ,
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>692</sub>
      ,
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>684</sub>
      ,
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>677</sub>
      ,
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>670</sub>
      , and
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>662</sub>
      . (see French, Brown, Norris 1972) Similar analysis reveals chlorophyll b
      has two components in vivo:
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>640</sub>
      and
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>650</sub>
      , with
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>650</sub>
      considered to be the more abundant (major) form. Chlorophyll
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>2</sub>
      shows a single red peak at 633 nm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carotenoids demonstrate a similar character in solvents vs. in vivo.
      Fucoxanthin in hexane has three maxima at 427, 450, and 476, but in vivo
      absorbs in a broad range between 500-590 nm.
    </p>
    <h3>Pigment Systems I and II (Photosystems I and II)</h3>
    <p>
      There is now much evidence that the pigments are organized into
      <i>two normal photosystems</i>
      ,
      <b>PS I</b>
      and
      <b>PS II</b>
      , which are functionally and physically distinct. Partial separations can
      be achieved in the laboratory in which isolated chloroplasts are disrupted
      mechanically (forced through needle valves) or chemically (with dilute
      digitonin or TX-100). The homogenate is centrifuged at 3000 g for a clear
      green supernatant, then at 60,000 g on a 10-50% sucrose gradient. The less
      dense fractions are enriched in thylakoid membranes fragments containing a
      high proportion of PS I, while the denser fractions yield granal stack
      membrane fragments containing both PS I and PS II, but enriched in PS II.
    </p>
    <p>
      The less dense fractions of the sucrose gradient (PS I-enriched) have been
      analyzed and are found to contain about 200 antenna chlorophylls, 50
      cartenoids (mostly carotenes), one cytochrome
      <i>f</i>
      , one plastocyanin, two cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>563</sub>
      (cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>6</sub>
      ), and one or two membrane-bound ferredoxin per chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>700</sub>
      (P700). PS I appears to contain one molecule of P700 forming its reaction
      center, with 250 antenna molecules supporting the center. The antenna
      molecules are all forms of chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      but
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>700</sub>
      and both forms of chlorophyll
      <i>b</i>
      ; there is a body of work, however, that chlorophyll b may not be
      necessary since an a SDS-PAGE resolvable chlorophyll-protein complex
      called CPI (MW 110,000 with 14 chlorophyll molecules), has no chlorophyll
      <i>b</i>
      and is essential for the light phase. The nonpigment components in the
      fraction contribute to electron flow in the light phase both on the donor
      and recipient side of PS I. PS I absorbs light maximally in the
      wavelengths longer than 680 nm, and is likely therefore to contains
      chlorophyll a forms and carotenes that absorb at longer than 680 to excite
      P700.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy sucrose fraction (PS II-enriched) shows about 200 antenna
      pigments, 50 carotenoids (mainly xanthophylls), and unidentified electron
      donor (Z), an unidentifed acceptor (Q), ~4 plastoquinones, two cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>559</sub>
      and six Mn
      <sup>2+</sup>
      per molecule of chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>680</sub>
      (P680) which is present (chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>690</sub>
      or P690 in some species). The nonpigment components are involved in
      electron transport. The absence of a 700&nbsp;nm peak (despite the
      presence of PS I) in this fraction generally indicates that P700 is
      associated with PS I and P680 with PS II.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is work that chlorophyll
      <i>b</i>
      and xanthophylls used to collect light in higher plants and green algae is
      not associated with PS II but rather occurs in a separate unit called
      light-harvesting chlorophyll protein (LHCP). It also has some chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      , transfers energy of the light photons to PS I and PS II, and might be
      responsible for the light
      <q>spill over</q>
      phenomenon observed in photosynthesis. PS II should be largely composed of
      chlorophylls
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>662</sub>
      ,
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>670</sub>
      , and
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>677</sub>
      , which should transfer their energies to P680. SDS-PAGE has also resolved
      a chlorophyll-protein complex distinct from CPI and LHCP consistent with
      such a composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chloroplasts isolated from plants grown at low light intensities (&lt;3
      kilolux) are rich in LHCP while plants grown at greater intensities (~20
      klx) have less, suggesting that PS I and PS II are unable to gather enough
      light themselves to drive photosynthesis and require LHCP for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One component of LHCP is a protein encoded in the nuclear genome and
      synthesized in the cytosol, while the CPI protein is encoded by the
      chloroplast genome and synthesized by chloroplatidic ribosomes. It may be
      learned later that the protein-chlorophyll complex making up PS II is
      coded by the chloroplast, and if so, the endosymbiont hypothesis that
      chloroplasts represent an organism related to or once a blue-green algal
      <q>invader</q>
      providing photosynthetic ability while the
      <q>host</q>
      synthesized a protein to assist in light-gathering (coding the LHCP). It
      is known that chlorophyll
      <i>b</i>
      is not in blue-greens or in PS I and PS II, while LHCP contain the
      chlorophyll
      <i>b</i>
      provided by the
      <q>host.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that the lower plants (algae) use chlorophyll
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>1</sub>
      and/or
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>2</sub>
      (brown, gold, diatoms, and Cryptophyceae) and phycobilins (red and
      blue-green algae) in place of chlorophyll
      <i>b</i>
      in supplemented light harvesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the location of PS I and PS II in the chloroplast is not
      clear. Stromal thylakoid membranes are rich in PS I, and the granal stack
      membranes are rich in both PS I and PS II. A combination of results from
      study using freeze-fractures EM, photochemical studies, and
      ultrastructural analyses of particles from mechanically or detergent-lysed
      chloroplasts suggested that PS I is in the outer half of the membrane, PS
      II the inner half. Freeze fracture EM shows 11&nbsp;nm particles which are
      located on the outer halves of the hydrophobic faces of the membranes in
      which the granal surfaces do not stack; these appear to be easily removed
      by washing with EDTA, indicating the 11&nbsp;nm particles are probably the
      CF
      <sub>1</sub>
      photophosphorylating coupling factor. In the membrane regions where grana
      stack, the interior side shows a protein with 13-17&nbsp;nm dia. and 8-9
      nm high (i.e., it may fully span the membrane) and which seems to form a
      crystalline array. Such particles are less numerous and smaller in the
      unstacked thylakoid faces. Thylakoids suspended in low salt solutions show
      and unstacking of the grana (without loss of photochemical activity) which
      is restored in high monovalent cations (50-100 mM) and lower divalent
      concentrations (3-5 mM). This unstacking is correlated to a loss of the
      dense populations of large particles in the membrane as seen under
      freeze-fracture EM. The other studies show PS I is associated with the
      smaller particles and PS II the larger. Other work throws these results
      into doubt, indicating that PS II spans the membrane (although not PS I)
      but in freeze-fracture partitions favorably to one half.

      special chlorophyll a molecules share the charge (unpaired spin) state,
      and that they are linked together in some way. These molecules are called
      the
      <i>special pair</i>
      (Chl
      <sub>sp</sub>
      ). Shipman et al (1976) have put forth the most satisfactory proposed
      structure. In this structure, the Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      metal ion is coordinated at a fifth position in both molecules each by a
      hydroxyl oxygen with is part of a protein: their structure demands
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
      <li>
        that the Mg metal ion be coordinated by an atom containing a lone pair,
        and
      </li>
      <li>the functional group must be able to form hydrogen bonds.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Indeed, besides coordinating with the Mg metal, this functional group
      similarly has hydrogen of this hydroxyl H-bonding with the keto oxygen on
      the E ring of the other chlorophyll molecule (see illustration). This
      H-bonding effectively keeps the proton a greater distance from the oxygen
      interacting with the Mg atom, thus preventing any reduced electrostatic
      interaction between Mg and the hydroxyl oxygen.

    <p>
      It is possible that the ROH, really an R-X-H, could be R=H and X=O
      (meaning water) is linking the two molecules. In the arrangement shown
      above, the planar chlorophyll molecules are such that the plane distance
      is 3.6 Å, and the π MOs of the conjugated ring system in both rings can
      interact optimally and permits unpaired spins to be delocalized over
      <i>two</i>
      rings rather than one.

    <h3>Mechanism of Pigment System Function</h3>
    <p>
      Recall that light has wave and particle attributes with energy expressed
      as
      <i>E</i>
      =
      <i>h</i>
      ν =
      <i>hc</i>
      /λ (
      <i>h</i>
      = 6.6262 × 10
      <sup>−34</sup>
      J s;
      <i>c</i>
      = 2.9979 × 10
      <sup>8</sup>
      m s
      <sup>−1</sup>
      ). Photon energy is generally expressed in eV (1 eV = 1.6022 × 10
      <sup>−19</sup>
      J). One mole of photons is called 1 Einstein photons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pigment molecule is an arrangement of atoms connected by single and
      double bonds. Bonds are essentially the representation of an overlap of
      AOs between atoms to form bonding MOs, in which each bond has a pair of
      electrons with opposite spins. The C-C single bond essentially represents
      the hybridization of the AOs of the carbon atom (a mixture of one
      <i>s</i>
      and three
      <i>p</i>
      orbitals) to form an
      <i>sp</i>
      <sup>3</sup>
      MO for bonding overlap with another carbon atom. The particular bond is a
      σ bond. With double bonds, a single sigma bond of
      <i>sp</i>
      <sup>2</sup>
      hybridization forms while another bond between the unmixed
      <i>p</i>
      orbitals of the bonding carbons forms a smaller (and energetically weaker)
      overlap to form a π bond.
    </p>
    <p>
      MO theory necessitates that the number of AOs two atoms bring together in
      bonding must be conserved in the number of MOs. Hence, the formation of a
      bonding σ MO from two (hybridized) AOs from each carbon necessitates the
      formation of another MO. Two
      <i>sp</i>
      <sup>3</sup>
      or two
      <i>sp</i>
      <sup>2</sup>
      AOs give rise to a bonding σ MO and an antibonding σ* MO. Linear
      combination of two
      <i>p</i>
      AOs also gives rise to a bonding π MO and an antibonding π* MO. Lone pairs
      on oxygens and nitrogens account for another AO in which electron pairs do
      not participate in bonds, with energies between the highest bonding and
      lowest antibonding MOs.
    </p>
    <p class="center">

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      In nearly every stable molecule, electron number is even, and electron
      pairs occupy bonding or nonbonding MOs in the ground state. Photons of the
      right energy can cause electronic transitions to occur between MOs
      however, usually from one of the bonding MOs to the antibonding MO
      (resulting in an
      <i>excited</i>
      state). Four transitions are actually possible: σ→σ*, π→π*,
      <i>n</i>
      →σ*,
      <i>n</i>
      →π*.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general order of energy necessary for the transition is σ→σ* &gt;
      <i>n</i>
      →σ* &gt; π→π* &gt;
      <i>n</i>
      →π* but there can be exceptions. The energies involved in such transitions
      has been experimentally determined for simple organic molecules (see
      table).
    </p>
    <p>
      These energies are much higher (meaning photons with shorter wavelengths)
      than what is characteristic based upon the light absorption spectrum of
      the pigments. However, certain π→π* transitions are possible when the
      molecular structure contains an extensive amount of
      <i>conjugated</i>
      double bonds, since the stabilization of a free radical or ion can be
      delocalized by the extensive charge entropy of such a system, and
      stabilization is translated as lower energy. As the number of π and π* MOs
      increase, the gap between the highest π and lowest π* must decrease,
      enabling transitions at longer wavelengths. From the table below, not that
      a conjugation of seven double bonds puts the energy needed for transition
      in the visible light spectrum. All carotenoids show at least seven double
      bonds and typically more double bonds than that number, clearly accounting
      for their function in photosynthesis.

      In addition, electronic level transitions are complicated by the existence
      of various vibrational modes which actually require less energy relative
      to the electronic level transitions (their energies are in the range
      0.075−0.5 eV or 16,500 to 2500 nm, in the far infrared). Vibrational
      entropy is the vibration occurring between nuclei, with these relative
      nuclear movements influencing changes in electronic transition energies as
      well. An electron which makes a π→π* transition does so in about 10
      <sup>-15</sup>
      seconds, assuming one of the vibrational energy levels within the π* MO
      and without changing its spin direction. The electron will fall from the
      higher vibrational level to the lowest within the π* MO in a series of
      transitions called the
      <i>vibrational cascade</i>
      ; during each transition, a quantum of energy is emitted within the
      spectrum of the transition (the infrared or
      <q>heat</q>
      ). The emission is manifested really as a collision of other molecules
      with the excited molecule, resulting in alteration of the total
      vibrational states of the system. The vibrational cascade is nonradiative,
      meaning the energy changes conferred from one atom to another within the
      molecule or between molecules is not manifested in the form of a photon.
      The vibrational cascade process requires 10

      <sup>-9</sup>
      &nbsp;s to complete.

      The pigment molecule remains in the excited state. The excited electron
      still has a spin opposite to its partner in the other MO. EPR
      determinations would show the existence of an unpaired electron as a
      single signal; hence the reference to a
      <b>singlet state</b>
      in the excited electron and its ground state partner with opposite spin.
      In cases where molecules can absorb at two different wavelengths, e.g.,
      where chlorophyll can absorb in the red and blue regions of the visible
      spectrum, molecules can assume two different excited singlet states with
      (vastly) different energy levels. Excited singlet states have lifetimesof
      10
      <sup>-10</sup>
      to 10
      <sup>-6</sup>
      seconds (the lifetimes are expressed as the time required for excited
      molecules to a fraction which 1/
      <i>e</i>
      of the original number of excited molecules). The energy of the singlet
      excited state is dissipated in several possible ways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Internal conversion</b>
        . If a molecule has two possible excited singlet state with many
        vibrational levels in each state (as does chlorophyll), an electron
        which was excited to the higher electronic level falls down the
        vibrational cascade to the lowest vibrational mode of the MO
        (nonradiative), then crosses to one of the higher vibrational modes of
        the next lower MO (excited singlet state) in a nonradiative process (no
        energy is lost or gained anyway), then falls down that MO's cascade to
        the lowest vibrational state.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fluorescence</b>
        . A drop from the lowest vibrational mode of one excited singlet state
        to the vibrational mode of a lower excited singlet state or ground
        state. The energy transition is less than the energy required to excite
        the electron, and since it is radiative, the emission is of a longer
        wavelength photon. This processes takes 10
        <sup>-9</sup>
        to 10
        <sup>-5</sup>
        s.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Phosphorescence.</b>
        In a rare event probably caused by collision of one excited molecule
        with another, a nonradiative
        <i>intersystem crossing</i>
        occurs in which the excited electron changes its spin, giving the
        molecule a magnetic moment which can be oriented in three different
        ways, distinguishable as three different states in a strong magnetic
        field. This molecule is now in the excited
        <b>triplet state.</b>
        The electron can nonetheless descend the vibrational cascade
        (nonradiative). The electron might change its spin, but the process is
        infrequent and therefore takes longer, usually between 10
        <sup>-5</sup>
        to 10
        <sup>-3</sup>
        s, but can be as long as 10 s. Once reversal does occur, the electron
        moves radiatively to the next lowest electronic level eventually to the
        ground state. The slow emission of these photons is like fluorescence
        but is really phosphorence because of the time difference. The
        wavelengths associated with phosphorescence are longer than for
        fluorescence or other transitions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Energy transfer</b>
        . This is a direct transfer of the energy from one excited molecule to
        the other. The spin angular momentum of the transfer cannot change.
        Three modes of transfer are possible: (a) Molecule #1 is excited but
        with paired spins while molecule #2 is in the ground state: Molecule #1
        merely passes on the energy with no spin changes. (b) Molecule #1 is
        triplet (excited unpaired spins) while molecule #2 has paired spins in
        the ground state: molecule #2 inherits the triplet state, and molecule
        #1 takes the paired ground state electrons. (c) Molecule #1 is in the
        triplet state and molecule #2 is in a triplet less excited state:
        molecule #1 becomes a less excited singlet system, and molecule #2
        becomes a more excited singlet system. In general triplet states are not
        at all involved in photosynthetic pigment system function, so only mode
        (a) is of concern. The energy transfer of (a) might be imagined as a
        direct transition of the excited electron from the donor molecule to the
        electronic level of an acceptor molecule. Simultaneously, the acceptor
        molecule moves one of its ground state electrons into the ground state
        level of the donor molecule.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Photochemistry.</b>
        This mechanism is fairly easy to understand. The excited electron from
        the donor molecule becomes a reducing agent, transferring the electron
        directly to an acceptor which is not necessarily a another pigment
        molecule.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The illustration below attempts to illustrate what is occurring to the
      excited electron in these steps.
    </p>

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual process involved in photosynthesis makes use of the energy
      transfer mechanism. Antenna pigments move the electrons at the high energy
      levels toward the reaction center, which itself makes use of the
      photochemistry transfer process. While internal conversions and
      vibrational cascades are inevitable, the excited-to-ground state
      transition is by direct energy transfer. Fluorescence and phosphorescence
      are wasteful processes and do not constitute the means by which energy is
      transferred from antenna chlorophylls to the reaction center.
    </p>
    <p>
      The energy transfer from antenna pigments to reaction center is nontheless
      <q>downhill,</q>
      that is, the photon progressively (in small quanta) loses its energy in
      going toward P700 and P680. There is no
      <q>back</q>
      energy transfer. The scheme of energy transfer is illustrated below. The
      path taken during energy transfer from molecule to molecule is thought to
      resemble a random walk, a path which eventually meets with a reaction
      center. It is possible that the reaction centers are dispersed randomly
      within the pigment system in which the photon moves via the pigment system
      until by chance it encounters a reaction center; such an energy capture
      pathway would be called the
      <b>lake</b>
      model since the reaction centers float like boats in a huge lake of
      antenna pigments. Another is where the pigment system organizes around a
      single reaction center, such that the antenna pigments conduct that photon
      to a single reaction center; this is the
      <b>isolated puddle</b>
      model of excitation energy flow.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <img
        src="./imagesPlantBiochemistryHTML/ChlorophyllPigmentSystem.gif"
        alt="Chlorophyll pigment system"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the P680 or P700 excited singlet is formed, the photochemical
      reaction must occur quickly else the captured energy is lost by
      fluorscence. The bacterial photochemical reaction has been shown to occur
      in 6 ps (several orders faster than fluorescence). This would indicate
      that the P680 and P700 centers must be located within the redox system of
      the thylakoid membrane. The redox system which reduces P680 and P700 is
      also likely to be physically close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although
      <b>carotenoids</b>
      play a role in the photosynthetic energy transfer process, they also play
      a role in minimizing damage caused by the formation of singlet oxygen. It
      should be noted that organic compounds which favorably would react with
      oxygen (be oxidized) do not do so because reaction is spin-forbidden and
      therefore slow. Singlet oxygen represents an excited state of oxygen. The
      energy is supplied by a photon in the presence of a photosensitizer
      (chlorophyll), in which chlorophyll assumes a singlet excited state, which
      is used in photochemical reactions which
      <i>later</i>
      involve formation of oxygen. However, intersystem crossing to form the
      chlorophyll triplet state (
      <sup>3</sup>
      Chl) can occur, and the reaction with atmospheric
      <sup>3</sup>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is now spin-permitted since both are triplets. The reaction involves
      electron transitions producing singlet Chl and a very reactive singlet O
      <sub>2</sub>
      . Carotenoids can prevent severe photodynamic damage by
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        quenching the triplet chlorophyll by forming ground state singlet Chl
        and excited state triplet carotenoids which eventually lose energy (the
        number of carotenoids competes with the presence of oxygen)
      </li>
      <li>
        quenching singlet oxygen directly, in which ground state singlet
        carotenoids react to form ground state triplet oxygen and excited state
        but less active triplet carotenoids
      </li>
      <li>
        react directly with singlet oxygen to form a hydroperoxide (a mechanism
        of minor importance since only one in 1000 molecules is oxidized)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Mechanism (2) is the most important since 99.9% of singlet oxygen reacts
      in this way. Carotenoids with ≥ 9 double bonds are capable of quenching in
      this way since the singlet to triplet transition energy is comparable to
      the triplet-to-singlet transition in oxygen.

    <h3>Generation of NADPH and ATP by Non-Cyclic Electron Flow</h3>
    <p>
      This process is called
      <b>noncyclic photophosphorylation</b>
      . The path of electrons is
      <i>noncyclic</i>
      since the electron generated in the flow of electrons does not return to
      the molecule from which it was taken. The
      <i>photo</i>
      - indicates the necessity of light to supply the energy which initiates
      the process. And ATP is produced by the
      <i>phosphorylation</i>
      of ADP during the process. Two photosystems and three electron transport
      chains are involved.

      The P700*–NADP

      Electron Transport Chain

    </p>
    <p>
      The term
      <i>X</i>
      is used to denote the first redox component of this chain since it has yet
      to be characterized. ESR signals at low temperatures have identified its
      presence in the photooxidation of P700. The reduction potential of
      <i>X</i>
      is
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = −0.73 V. The
      <i>X</i>
      <sup>−</sup>
      formed then reduces
      <b>ferredoxin</b>
      (
      <b>Fd</b>
      ) (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = −0.54 V). Actually chloroplasts contain three ferredoxins: one is a
      soluble Fd with a 2Fe-2S center (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = −0.43 V), and the other two are membrane-bound called Fd
      <sub>540</sub>
      and Fd
      <sub>590</sub>
      since their
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ are −0.54 V and −0.59 V, resp. Once the membrane Fd is reduced, it then
      reduces the soluble Fd (Fd
      <sub>s</sub>
      ). All redox reaction with Fd are one electron transfers which are not
      accompanied by H
      <sup>+</sup>
      movement. It should be noted that the Fd
      <sub>540</sub>
      is the membrane-bound ferredoxin thought to be reduced in the noncyclic
      pathway, while Fd
      <sub>590</sub>
      is thought to be involved in the cyclic pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soluble ferredoxin then binds 1:1 with a flavoprotein (FAD-containing)
      called ferredoxin:NADP oxidoreductase, an enzyme complex loosely bound to
      the thylakoid membrane. Two molecules of Fd
      <sub>s</sub>
      must bind in one electron transfers, and this requires the movement of two
      H
      <sup>+</sup>
      as well. NADP does not bind to the flavoprotein until it is fully reduced.
    </p>
    <h4>The Intermediate Electron Transport Chain</h4>
    <p>
      This pathway essentially describes the transport from PS II to PS I. In
      some parts electron flow is movement by one-electron redox components, in
      others by two-electron redox components in which H
      <sup>+</sup>
      is necessary and is transported. Once two P700* have given electrons to
      NADP, the P700
      <sup>+</sup>
      cation radicals must be reduced (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = +0.43 V). Plastocyanin (blue-colored in the oxidized form) is a
      one-electron transfer component (MW 21,000) of the intermediate pathway
      containing two Cu
      <sup>2+</sup>
      atoms which reduces P700
      <sup>+</sup>
      (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = +0.37 V). The oxidized PC is then reduced by cytochrome
      <i>f</i>
      (from
      <i>frons</i>
      , leaf) which is a
      <i>c</i>
      -type cytochrome (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = +0.36 V) involved with one-electron transfers. Plastoquinone
      (plastoquinol) is the reducing agent for cytochrome
      <i>f</i>
      , and its redox reactions are all two-electron processes accompanied by
      vectorial H
      <sup>+</sup>
      movement from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen, a process certainly
      involved with coupled ATP synthesis (2 ATP per 2 electrons/2 H
      <sup>+</sup>
      moved is expected, although the actual value is between 1 and 2). PQ is
      greater in quantity than most other components of the transport chain,
      forming a large, apparently translocatable pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      PQ is in turn reduced by two molecules of cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>559</sub>
      (low potential form), which is a
      <i>b</i>
      -type cytochrome. This cytochrome exists in two interconvertible forms
      which appear to have different
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ values. The low potential form (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ ~ +0.06 V) reduces PQ, and the high potential (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = ~ +0.37 V) form reduces P680
      <sup>+</sup>
      under special conditions (cyclic electron flow unaccompanied by
      phosphorylation). Cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>559</sub>
      (LP) is then reduced by an unidentified redox component, Q (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = − 0.04 V) which is the immediate acceptor of electrons from P680*. The
      drop from −0.04 V to +0.37 V is 79 kJ mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      , the energy converted to an H
      <sup>+</sup>
      gradient which then drives formation of 2 ATP (a process requiring 71 kJ
      mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      ).
    </p>
    <h4>The Oxygen-Evolution Chain</h4>
    <p>
      Photons which are conveyed to P680 activate it to P680, with an equivalent
      potential change from +0.9 V to −0.1 V (a 1 V change). With P680
      <sup>+</sup>
      formed from intermediate electron chain transfer accepting the electron,
      the reduction of P680
      <sup>+</sup>
      must come from a reaction of higher potential. This is achieved by
      oxidation of water (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = +0.82 V). It is not as simple as P680
      <sup>+</sup>
      abstracting electrons directly from a physical association with H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O. Several protein components in which Mn
      <sup>2+</sup>
      and Cl
      <sup>−</sup>
      are also involved have been identified in the complex. Thorough
      characterization is hampered in that thylakoid membranes must be intact
      and the system is easily activated by detergent presence. A single redox
      component,
      <i>Z</i>
      , has been said to mediate the transfer of electrons directly from H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O to P680
      <sup>+</sup>
      . Work (by Fowler and Kok, 1974) with spinach chloroplasts which were
      preincubated 40 min in the dark and then subjected to intense light
      flashes (each 10 μs in duration) once every second indicates that
      <i>Z</i>
      actually gives four electrons to four P680
      <sup>+</sup>
      molecules (and accumulates a 4+ charge) before it apparently produces a
      single O
      <sub>2</sub>
      molecule (oxygen evolution being assessed). Flashes 1 and 2 produced very
      low O
      <sub>2</sub>
      yields, flash 3 was very high, and flash 4 of intermediate size. The
      periodicity of four flashes was clear, with the 3rd, 7th, 11th, etc.
      producing the highest O
      <sub>2</sub>
      yields.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite likely that P680 exists in close physical contact with Z and Q
      (a Z:P680:Q complex). Photons cause an excited state (Z:P680*:Q), the a
      charge separation in which Q is the acceptor (Z:P680
      <sup>+</sup>
      :Q
      <sup>−</sup>
      ). In a relatively slower process cytochrome b
      <sub>559</sub>
      then collects the electron from Q before recombination occurs (Z:P680
      <sup>+</sup>
      :Q), and then P680 oxidizes Z (Z
      <sup>+</sup>
      :P680:Q). This cycle continues until Z reaches the Z
      <sup>4+</sup>
      state and is thus capable of oxidizing water.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this noncyclic process, it is clear that eight photons generate two
      NADPH, four ATP, and one oxygen molecule (using two H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O molecules).
    </p>
    <p>
      [The Z redox component of this particular part of the photosynthetic
      electron transport chain has now been identified as tyrosine-161 (Y-161)
      of the polypeptide subunit called D
      <sub>1</sub>
      . The phenol moiety of this amino acid is capable of undergoing
      one-electron redox changes—radical formation in phenols is energetically
      feasible—and it mediates the immediate replacement of a ground state
      electron to P680
      <sup>+</sup>
      . It subsequently obtains an electron from another component perhaps
      directly from a manganese atom. The identification of this tyrosine
      residue as a component of the photosynthetic electron transport chain has
      been supported by physical studies using EPR and fluorescence, analysis
      x-ray diffraction patterns showing proximity of the putative tyrosine to
      the P680 special pair, and mutagenesis studies in which loss of
      photosynthetic ability is associated with the presence of mutant
      polypeptides.]
    </p>
    <h3>Cyclic Electron Flow</h3>
    <p>
      Associated with PS I are other electron transport systems which can
      apparently accept electrons not from PS I directly (P700*), but perhaps
      from X
      <sup>10.0pt'&gt;−</sup>
      . The electron eventually returns to P700
      <sup>+</sup>
      to form the ground state P700, but down a different pathway. Some redox
      components with
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ &lt; 0.0 V reduce PQ in the intermediate pathway, diverting from the
      NADP reduction pathway, and the electrons then proceeds as usual (PQH
      <sub>2</sub>
      ) down the rest of the intermediate pathway to P700
      <sup>+</sup>
      . In other cases with components in which
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ &gt; 0.0 V, PQ is bypassed and either PC or P700
      <sup>+</sup>
      directly is reduced. Arnon (1955) demonstrated the PQ-mediated cyclic
      pathway in which flavin mononucleotide was added (FMN/FMNH
      <sub>2</sub>
      ;
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = −0.22 V) and shown to induce the pathway. The PQ-mediated pathway
      generates ATP since this pathway is associated with vectorial H
      <sup>+</sup>
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The components of the cyclic pathway are not exactly known. It is
      suggested that flow from X
      <sup>−</sup>
      proceeds to Fd
      <sub>590</sub>
      (the other membrane-bound form of Fd) then to cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>6</sub>
      (or cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>563</sub>
      ), with
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = −0.18 V. PQ is reduced by this cytochrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Govindjee (1975) has called this cyclic flow Cyclic I to distinguish it
      from another cyclic electron flow, Cyclic II, in which electrons are
      accepted by Q and proceed to reduce cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>559</sub>
      as in the normal pathway. Cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>559</sub>
      is in equilibrium with both low potential (LP) and high potential (HP)
      forms, as indicated above. The LP form of the cytochrome can reduce PQ in
      the noncyclic pathway, or alter to the HP form, which reduces P680
      <sup>10.0pt'&gt;+</sup>
      . This cyclic flow generates no H
      <sup>+</sup>
      gradient, and therefore forms no ATP. The physiological significance of
      Cyclic II is unclear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Analysis of the ATP requirements for certain biosynthetic processes,
      including starch, lipid, pigment, and nucleic acid syntheses, as well as
      in extrachloroplastidic syntheses (ATP cannot cross the membrane, but its
      energy can via the 3-PGA/DHAP shuttle), indicate a need for cyclic
      phosphorylation since it seems the noncyclic pathways may not generate the
      net ATP necessary for these processes.
    </p>
    <h3>Reagents Which Affect Photosynthetic Electron Flow</h3>
    <p>
      These reagents are divided essentially into three classes, with some of
      them proving as useful herbicides.
    </p>
    <h4>Electron Acceptors</h4>
    <p>
      Methyl viologen, benzyl viologen, anthraquinone-2-sulfonate, and
      diaminodurene interfere with electron flow from PS I some place before Fd
      can receive them, and are probably reduced directly by X
      <sup>−</sup>
      . Ferricyanide and dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) accept electrons in
      the intermediate chain, probably from cytochrome
      <i>f</i>
      or PC.
    </p>
    <h4>Electron Donors</h4>
    <p>
      Hydroquinone, hydroxylamine, phenylenediamine, diphenylcarbazide, and Mn
      ions have been found to supply electrons on the H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O side of the LP form of cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>559</sub>
      . Reduced forms of DCPIP,
      <i>N,N,N′,N′</i>
      -tetramethyl-
      <i>p</i>
      -phenylenediamine (TMPD) and 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-
      <i>p</i>
      -phenylenediamine (or diaminodurene, DAD) donate electrons to some
      components of the intermediate chain, but not necessarily the same
      component.
    </p>
    <h4>Inhibitors of Electron Flow</h4>
    <p>
      Certain inhibitors of electron flow have been identified.
      2′-Phosphoadenosine diphosphate (NADP w/o the nicotinamide) inhibits the
      Fd:NADP oxidoreductase, prevent electron transfer.
      Disalicylidenepropanediamine (DSPD) inhibits flow at Fd.
      2,5-Dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-
      <i>p</i>
      -benzoquinone (DBMID) competes with PQ to stop electron flow between
      cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>559</sub>
      and cytochrome
      <i>f</i>
      . Certain substituted ureas such as 3-(
      <i>p</i>
      -chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (CMU) and
      3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), and certain triazines such
      as 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-
      <i>s</i>
      -triazine (atrazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(chloroethylamino)-
      <i>s</i>
      -triazine (simazine), and 2n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HOQNO)
      block the flow between Q
      <sup>−</sup>
      and cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>559</sub>
      LP.
    </p>
    <h4>Herbicides</h4>
    <p>
      The triazines mentioned above have been used as herbicides since 1952,
      where they are absorbed in leaves and roots. The substituted ureas CMU and
      DCMU have marketed as herbicides under the name Monuron and Diuron, resp.,
      and are applied to the soil, absorbed by the roots and translocated via
      the apoplastic system to the leaves as for the triazines. Some plants are
      susceptible to direct leaf application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bipyridylium herbicides include paraquat (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridylium
      dichloride. Paraquat is methyl viologen which accepts electrons from PS I
      at a point before Fd (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = −0.44 V). It therefore prevents NADPH formation. The phytotoxic effect
      is more rapid than what could occur by reducing NADPH formation: it
      appears to form planar free radical which can reduce oxygen to superoxide
      anion. The superoxide is converted quickly by superoxide dismutase (SOD)
      to H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      and O
      <sub>2</sub>
      present in the chloroplast, with H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      then reacting with unsaturated fatty acyl moieties in the acyl lipids.
      This consequently disrupts the maintenance of chloroplast membranes which
      depend on these lipids. Paraquat is a severe poison in animals, too, with
      severe pulmonary fibrosis and associated kidney and liver damage.
    </p>
    <h2>The Dark Phase of Photosynthesis</h2>

    <h3>Variations in The Mechanism of The Dark Phase of Photosynthesis</h3>
    <p>
      The NADPH and ATP formed from the photosynthetic apparatus is used now
      used in the nonlight-dependent (dark) phase for converting CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      to carbohydrate. The most important pathway is the carbon reduction
      (Calvin) cycle which is now called the C
      <sub>3</sub>
      pathway to distinguish it from plants using the C
      <sub>4</sub>
      or the
      <b>c</b>
      rassulacean
      <b>a</b>
      cid
      <b>m</b>
      etabolism (CAM). C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants are generally tropical plants, while the CAM plants are generally
      growing in arid desert regions. C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants use only the Calvin cycle to reduce CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      to carbohydrate, while C
      <sub>4</sub>
      and CAM plants also use, but have additional enzymatic steps. Differences
      between these plants are based on the time of day when such pathways are
      active and the tissue location of metabolism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plant tissue structure is directly correlated with the metabolic systems
      used by these plants. For example, the density of stomata in the leaves of
      C
      <sub>3</sub>
      and C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants is quite high (5000 to 30,000 per cm
      <sup>2</sup>
      depending upon species), but the stomata of C
      <sub>4</sub>
      show a higher resistance to gaseous diffusion than do C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants. CAM plants show a very low leaf stomatal density (100-800 per cm
      <sup>2</sup>
      ) and also have a high resistance to gaseous diffusion. C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants show an extensive intrafrondal air cavity space to maximize
      atmospheric contact with as many photosynthetic cells as possible, few
      cells being two or three cell layers removed from the gas space. C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants also show concentric layers of
      <b>mesophyll</b>
      and
      <b>bundle sheath cells</b>
      near the vascular bundles. C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants are have a less open structure but parallel to the vascular bundles
      the intercellular spaces are significant. CAM plants expose very few cells
      to open air spaces to minimize water loss at the expense of a
      rate-limiting CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      diffusion.
    </p>
    <h3>The Calvin Cycle</h3>

    <h4>Catalytic Activities in The Calvin Cycle</h4>
    <p>
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is first incorporated into
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to form two molecules of 3-phospho-
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -glyceric acid (3-PGA) by a very important enzyme called
      <b><i>ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase</i></b>
      (Rubisco) (discovered in 1947 by Williams and Bonner). A mechanism for the
      reaction is suggested below which involves tautomeric activation of RuBP
      first to an enediol intermediate to make it nucleophilic, and then
      carboxylation occurs at C2. The nucleophilicity is also enhanced by
      removal of the hydroxyl proton on C3 to produce the enolate anion which
      should easily undergo carboxylation. An unstable intermediate would be
      formed, 2-carboxy-3-keto-
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -arabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate, and the assumption seems correct since (i)
      an analog of the intermediate, 2-carboxy-
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -arabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate irreversibly inhibits the carboxylase and
      oxygenase activities of Rubisco and (ii) two molecules of 3-PGA are formed
      and the chemistry is consistent. [The reaction intermediate proposed by
      Calvin in 1954, later identified in 1982. Inhibitor studies in 1980 and
      1981.]
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      and not HCO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>−</sup>
      is the substrate since studies with HC
      <sup>18</sup>
      O
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>−</sup>
      show that only two oxygens in the products (indicating CO

      use) instead of three, as would be the case if HCO
      <sub>3</sub>

      Rubisco requires Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      during the reaction which is thought to be involved in participating with
      the protein in preparing CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      for the carboxylation step by enhancing its charge polarization. Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      has also been implicated in stabilizing the β-keto acid intermediate until
      C-C bond cleavage can occur (see notes on rubisco below). (A requirement
      for Cu
      <sup>2+</sup>
      was also proposed but has been ruled out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Rubisco has a second function as an
      <i>oxygenase</i>
      (hence its full name), first identified in 1971. In a similarly Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      -dependent step, the five-carbon RuBP is oxygenated at C2 just as it would
      be carboxylated to form a two carbon phosphglycolic acid and a
      three-carbon 3-PGA (water is used in the final step as for carboxylation).
      Again, an enolate anion is generated to produce a nucleophile which
      combines with O
      <sub>2</sub>
      to form a peroxide, which can then be hydrolytically cleaved. (Again,
      although Cu
      <sup>2+</sup>
      is present and has been implicated in the oxygenase activity, studies show
      no requirement for either activity in Rubisco.) The phosphoglycolate is
      metabolized in the photorespiration process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photosynthetic organisms (plants and bacteria) produce what appear to be
      natural inhibitors of Rubisco, and there may be a good reason to inhibit
      activity of this first step of an important metabolic pathway. For
      example,
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -Carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphate is an endogenous substance found in
      chloroplasts and may be used to inhibit photosynthetic activity.
    </p>
    <p class="center">

        alt="molecular structure of Carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphate"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      When would it be prudent to inhibit this activity? Perhaps when
      photosynthetic activity would be nonproductive for the purposes of the
      plant's development stage, e.g., when the leaf is no longer needed and the
      plant is going to seed (setting fruit) and in a senescent process. Or when
      there is a disease process in which the leaf stem is damaged (or some
      critical part affecting product transport in phloem) and photosynthetic
      activity would serve to benefit only the disease-causing agent (bacteria,
      virus, etc.).
    </p>
    <h5>Other notes on Rubisco</h5>
    <p>
      Rubisco makes up 50% of the soluble protein in leaves (by far the most
      abundant and most significant). In early studies it was called Fraction I
      protein as a result of how it separates during analytical
      ultracentrifugation. It is a multisubunit protein of MW 550,000, with
      eight large subunits (LS) of 51-58 kDa and eight small subunits (SS) of
      12-18 kDa. The quaternary structure of Rubisco is shown below.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <img
        src="./imagesPlantBiochemistryHTML/RubiscoQuatStruct.gif"
        alt="subunit or quaternary structure of rubisco"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Both catalytic functions reside in the LS at the same site undoubtedly,
      which is nonetheless active in the absence of the SS. Proof of activity in
      the LS is by immunochemical studies in which anti-LS inhibits activity
      while anti-SS has no effect. The SS may serve a regulatory function. The
      LS is expressed by the chloroplast genome while the SS derives from the
      plant nuclear genome, where it is produced as a large precursor that is
      trimmed within the chloroplast by a stromally located protease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lys and Arg residues have been shown to be involved in RuBP binding,
      suggesting a Schiff base interaction may be involved. But such mechanisms
      are not compatible with C–O bond retention at C2 and C3, shown by another
      study using isotopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      for Rubisco was at first measured to be 0.2-0.5 mM. This is very high
      since the dissolved CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      concentration in chloroplast protoplasm is estimated at 0.01 mM (the same
      as the CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      in water in equilibrium with the atmosphere). Studies now show that
      experimental conditions in the early studies markedly altered the kinetic
      properties of Rubisco after they are released from chloroplasts. If
      Rubisco is assayed within 30-60&nbsp;S after recovery from chloroplasts,
      the K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is only 11-18 μM (about the amount of CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      normally dissolved in water); 3 min later it is ~500 μM. It is likely that
      the K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for substrate is even lower than the initially handled enzyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also shown rubisco has a slow activation phase: addition of CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      and Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      at saturating levels which were previously absent do not produce an
      immediate high velocity state, and there is a lag period to maximal
      activity. Activity assays conducted with CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      - and Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      -preincubated enzyme produces normal assay values. This activation
      requires CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      (not HCO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>−</sup>
      ) initially, in which CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      slowly complexes with enzyme to form an E-CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      , which is inactive. Note that the evidence indicates that the binding of
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is to an amino group (Lys?) on the enzyme to form a
      <b>carbamate</b>
      complex. Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      then binds rapidly to E-CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      to form the active metallated complex E-CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      -Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      . It is not known if binding is to sites away from the active site. The
      activation rate is influenced by pH (increased if pH is raised, although
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      tends to form bicarbonate, which is not a substrate) and by RuBP
      (decreased if RuBP is present). There is debate as to whether Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      is required in the catalytic mechanism or merely for activation.
      Investigators have defined requirements for activating rubisco prior to
      assay which involve preincubation with Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      and CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      (using NaHCO
      <sub>3</sub>
      and carbonic anhydrase) at a particular pH, starting the assay with RuBP
      addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A protein of 40&nbsp;kDa has been reported by one group and called
      <b><i>Rubisco activase.</i></b>
      This protein has been purified and is stable; when re-constituted with
      photosynthetic membranes and using methyl viologen as an electron
      acceptor, Rubisco activity proceeds quickly in the presence of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The details of the activation process are not fully elucidated. In the
      presence of Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      , one Lys residue per LS is modified by the affinity label
      <i>N</i>
      -bromoacetylethanolamine; in the absence of Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      , two different Cys residues are modified, one of them only 3 residues
      from the Lys modified under different conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effects of other metabolites have shown that 6-phosphogluconate enhances
      activation, but inhibits catalysis since it is a competitive inhibitor of
      RuBP. SuBP has been shown in one study to competitively inhibit rubisco. A
      problem with suggesting regulation by metabolites is that the stromal
      concentration of rubisco (est. to be 2 mM) is on a level with the
      concentration of supposedly regulatory metabolites. Independent regulation
      of the carboxylase/oxygenase activities in some mutant enzymes suggest
      that structural changes can alter the ratio of carboxylation/oxygenation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is between 200-400 μM, within physiological for the amount of O
      <sub>2</sub>
      which can dissolve in water (260 μM). It should be noted that the O
      <sub>2</sub>
      competes with the CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      substrate at the same site (K
      <sub>i</sub>
      for O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is same as K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for O
      <sub>2</sub>
      ). And CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      competes with O
      <sub>2</sub>
      during the oxygenase activity (same K
      <sub>i</sub>
      as K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      ). The in vivo rates should therefore depend upon the CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      and O
      <sub>2</sub>
      concentrations. The presence of Cu
      <sup>2+</sup>
      in rubisco has been reported but it may be an artefact binding during the
      isolation procedure. The presence of superoxide dismutase activity in
      rubisco may relate to the fact that superoxide reacts rapidly with Cu
      <sup>2+</sup>
      whether free or bound in a protein complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The role of the small subunit is not worked out, but may affect activation
      of rubisco for its carboxylating activity. The rubisco of
      <i>Rhodospirillium rubrum</i>
      (a photosynthetic bacterium) has no small subunits, just a dimer of large
      subunits. It shows activation kinetics like the plant, but the final K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is higher.
      <i>Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides</i>
      has two forms of rubisco, form I looking like the plant enzyme, form II
      having large subunits only. Form II activation is not inhibited by RuBP
      presence, whereas form I is (as in the plant enzyme).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Calvin cycle proceeds after 3-PGA formation with reactions similar to
      those involved in glycolysis or rather gluconeogenesis. 3-PGA is
      phosphorylated by
      <b><i>phosphoglycerate kinase</i></b>
      to form 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-dPGA), which is reversible unlike many
      reactions involving kinases. As in the reverse of glycolysis, 1,3-dPGA is
      reduced by
      <b><i>glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase</i></b>
      , forming 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (GA3P). This oxidoreductase prefers the
      NADPH coenzyme in the plant rather than NADH as in glycolysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      GA3P can proceed as an entry point into several pathways. It can continue
      along the glucose (C6) biosynthetic pathway, in which
      <b><i>triosephosphate isomerase</i></b>
      (TPI) must isomerize GA3P to form dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The
      GA3P then combines 1:1 with the product DHAP with the catalytic action of
      <b><i>fructose bisphosphate aldolase</i></b>
      to form fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). FBP is dephosphorylated by the Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      -dependent
      <b><i>fructose bisphosphatase</i></b>
      at C1 to produce fructose 6-phosphate (F6P); the enzyme has a high
      apparent K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for FBP, as it is a multisubunit enzyme allosterically activated at high
      concentrations of FBP.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <img
        src="./imagesPlantBiochemistryHTML/CalvinCycle.gif"
        alt="The Carbox Fixation (Calvin) Cycle"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      GA3P then combines 1:1 with F6P to produce one mole of
      xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P) and erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) in a reaction
      catalyzed by
      <b><i>transketolase</i></b>
      . This enzyme makes use of the coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and
      depends on Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      as well. The enzyme transfers the ketol (CH
      <sub>2</sub>
      OH–CO—) moiety from a
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -ketose with a
      <i>threo</i>
      (3S,4R) configuration to the carbon of a aldose sugar. It is TPP which
      attaches to the ketol and transfers it to the aldose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The E4P subsequently formed from the transketolase reaction then combines
      with DHAP in a reaction catalyzed by FBP aldolase in all likelihood. FBP
      aldolase does not appear to have a rigid specificity other than for DHAP
      (in the condensation reaction) or a keto sugar with a 3S,4R configuration
      (in the cleavage reaction). The product of condensation of E4P and DHAP is
      sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (Su-1,7-BP). The Su-1,7-BP is then
      dephosphorylated by a phosphatase that hydrolyzes the removal of phosphate
      from C1. The Su7P thus formed can then donate its ketol group via
      transketolase to a receiving aldosugar, namely GA3P, forming
      ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) from the Su7P skeleton and Xu5P created by ketol
      condensation to GA3P.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five carbon compounds R5P and Xu5P can be converted to
      ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) by an isomerase and a 3-epimerase, resp. The
      Ru5P is then phosphorylated by a kinase to regenerate the RuBP which is
      the substrate for rubisco; ATP generated from the light phase reactions is
      used as it was for the 3-PGA kinase.
    </p>
    <h5>Notes on other Calvin cycle enzymes</h5>
    <p>
      1,3-diphosphoglycerate kinase is freely reversible and sensitive to
      changes in Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      and the ATP/ADP ratio, as expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three different GA3P dehydrogenases can be found in leaf tissue: an
      NAD-specific cytoplasmic enzyme, the NADP-specific chloroplast stromal
      enzyme, and a NADP-linked enzyme irreversibly oxidizing GA3P to 3-PGA
      directly (the purpose to export reducing power from the chloroplast).
      Spinach chloroplast stromal isozyme exists as an oligomeric protein (MW
      600 kDa) and in monomeric form (MW 100-145 kDa). The oligomeric aggregate
      appears to prefer NAD(H) in vitro, while the monomer has a better affinity
      for NADP(H). Dissociation of the oligomer can be promoted by incubation
      with NADP, NADPH, P
      <sub>i</sub>
      , or ATP. DTT also enhances dissociation induced by NADP(H). On the other
      hand NAD or GA3P presence promotes monomeric association.
    </p>
    <h4>Stoichiometry of The Calvin Cycle</h4>
    <p>
      It is not obvious from the cycle where exactly sugar is produced since the
      pathway is a cycle. However, when stoichiometry is considered, a net
      production of molecules becomes obvious. The table below shows how the
      stoichiometry of the input of 6 CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      molecules produces a net molecule 6C sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cycle is setup merely to generate the starting substrate while
      eventually producing a single 6C molecule from the fixed CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      molecules. Note for every CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      molecule fixed, 2 NADPH and 3 ATP are required. This discounts some losses
      which occur to photorespiration, amounting to C-C bond cleavage with loss
      of bond energy. 20-40% is the estimated loss. Hence the ATP and NADPH
      requirement is greater than calculated.
    </p>
    <h4>Evidence for The Calvin Cycle</h4>
    <p>
      The cycle was first elucidated by Calvin (hence the name) who used
      <sup>14</sup>
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      to study green algae,
      <i>Chlorella</i>
      and
      <i>Scenedesmus</i>
      . The algae were grown under light and CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      constantly. The labeled CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      was administered at various times for different durations, then cells
      boiled in alcohol to extract the organic compounds, which could be
      separated on paper chromatograms. Algae exposed to
      <sup>14</sup>
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      for 30&nbsp;S produced an abundant amount of label in 3-PGA, triose
      phosphates, and hexose phosphates. If exposure was limited to 5 s, the
      label was found only in 3-PGA.

      The site of labeling was also analyzed. Analysis of 3-PGA indicated that
      the COOH was labeled. The thought was that a 2C compound was carboxylated,
      but attempts to find it failed. The finding that Su7P, Su-1,7-BP, and
      pentose phosphates were also present later led to speculation that CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      condensed with a pentose phosphate. Another finding was that C3 and C4 of
      F6P were heavily labeled too, which is logical from the operation of the
      pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further evidence of the cycle came from testing features of its
      hypothetical operation. For example, if light is not supplied to the
      plant, NADPH and ATP necessary for the reactions in the cycle should cause
      an accumulation of 3-PGA and a fall in the level of RuBP. When light is
      supplied, the RuBP level should rise and 3-PGA should fall in steady state
      conditions. Such a change in metabolite concentration was shown by Calvin
      in experiments where the light is turned off and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another proof of the cycle is the finding that all of the enzymes
      catalyzing the reactions indicated have been isolated from the
      chloroplasts. While some doubt may arise since the amount of enzyme shown
      is not considered sufficient to account for the level of activity
      necessary, this may be attributable to the difficulty of isolating
      perfectly intact chloroplasts, which generally lose their outer membrane
      during procedures amounting to loss of some stromal enzymes.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Role of Light in The Activation of
      <q>Dark Phase</q>
      Enzymes
    </h4>
    <p>
      Although called the
      <b>dark phase</b>
      suggesting an independence of light, it has been shown that certain (five
      total) enzymes in the carbon fixation cycle are activated by light, namely
      rubisco, GA3P dehydrogenase, FBP and SuBP phosphatases, and Ru5P kinase.
      During the period of light, the pH of the stroma rises from about 7 to 8
      as H
      <sup>+</sup>
      is pumped into the thylakoid lumen, while in the dark, the protons
      eventually leak back into the stroma. Conversely, in the light Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      is pumped from the lumen into the stroma. Four of the five enzymes
      (excepting GA3P dehydrogenase) indicated are all Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      -dependent enzymes which are also pH-sensitive, explaining why their
      activation state changes. Certain metabolites are positive allosteric
      effectors: ATP and NADPH are effectors activating rubisco and GA3P
      dehydrogenase. Other metabolites between FBP and Ru5P also appear to
      increase rubisco activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain compounds which are reduced from the light phase electron
      transport movements are called LEMs, or
      <q>light effect mediators.</q>
      The LEMs appear to activate enzymes in the cycle. These LEMs may in fact
      be proteins which have certain disulfide bonds in their structures
      reduced, and which in turn use these sulfhydryls to reduce the –S–S–
      linkages in the enzyme, altering it from an inactive form to an active
      form. Thioredoxin is a low MW, H-carrying, cysteine-containing protein
      most characterized: it is reduced by soluble Fd via a
      ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, itself an enzyme of MW 38,000 and
      without chromophore. Reduced thioredoxin activates GA3P dehydrogenase,
      both FBP and SuBP phosphatases, and phosphoribulose kinase. The
      chloroplast thioredoxin comes in two forms,
      <i>f</i>
      and
      <i>m</i>
      , and form
      <i>f</i>
      activates the enzymes above, while form
      <i>m</i>
      appears to activate NADP-specific malate dehydrogenase which is involved
      in the C
      <sub>4</sub>
      pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enzyme pyruvate,P
      <sub>i</sub>
      -dikinase is another enzyme unique to the C
      <sub>4</sub>
      and CAM plant CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      fixation pathway which may be activated by LEMs. The enzyme ADP-glucose
      pyrophosphorylase is enzyme involved with starch synthesis, positively
      effected by 3-PGA and inhibited by P
      <sub>i</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <h4>Other Regulation</h4>
    <p>
      Carbon fixation rates in whole leaves, protoplasts, or isolated type A
      chloroplasts depend upon certain experimental conditions. A noticeable lag
      leading to maximal fixation rates can be observed despite the immediate
      start of electron transport and photophosphorylation. Preincubation with
      known Calvin cycle intermediates can ensure a short to unnoticeable lag;
      preincubation with P
      <sub>i</sub>
      (which promotes export of C
      <sub>3</sub>
      acids from the chloroplast) increases the lag. Other effects include
      <q>light priming,</q>
      i.e., chloroplasts or leave illuminated 30 min, then placed in dark, then
      illuminated again reach maximum fixation rates almost at once. This
      indicates that cycle intermediates fall to low concentrations unable to
      sustain high rates of fixation.

      plants also show an unusual leaf structure, with many open air spaces, a
      double spiral of bundle sheath cells packed around vascular bundles, and
      mesophyll cells loosely arranged in spirals around the layer of bundle
      sheath cells. There are also many plasmodesmata between bundle sheath and
      mesophyll cells. Chloroplasts in both cell types have different
      morphologies, with advanced C

      Kortschak and coworkers (1965) were the first to show that sugar cane
      leaves incubated with
      <sup>14</sup>
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      incorporated label first into C
      <sub>4</sub>
      dicarboxylic acids, namely malate and aspartate, and there was a
      noticeable lag before 3-PGA and other Calvin cycle intermediates
      incorporated label. Hatch and Slack extended the work, showing that (i)
      OAA, malate, and aspartate incorporated label entirely into C4 of their
      structures, (ii) only C1 of 3-PGA was labeled, (iii) labeling of the
      hexose phosphates was consistent with having been formed from 3-PGA. The
      mechanism has now been shown to involve the enery-dependent carboxylation
      of C
      <sub>3</sub>
      acids to produce the C
      <sub>4</sub>
      , which is transported from one location (cytoplasm of mesophyll cell) to
      another (either cytoplasm, mitochondria, or chloroplast of bundle sheath
      cell depending upon species) where decarboxylation occurs and CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      can be incorporated to 3-PGA as in the normal cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hatch-Slack cycle does have some common points. Atmospheric CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is dissolved in the mesophyll cytoplasm as HCO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>10.0pt'&gt;−</sup>
      , with carbonic anhydrase accelerating this process presumably. This is
      necessary for the enzyme
      <b><i>PEP carboxylase</i></b>
      or
      <b><i>orthophosphate:oxaloacetate carboxy-lyase (phosphorylating)</i></b>
      (EC 4.1.1.49) to carboxylate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form
      oxaloacetate (OAA). This C
      <sub>4</sub>
      acid is not transported from the cell, but a transamination reaction with
      glutamate by
      <b>
        <span class="smcap">l</span>
        <i>-aspartate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase</i>

      this enzyme is unknown. In the case of plants employing the NADP-malic
      enzyme, OAA is reduced in mesophyll chloroplasts to malate by the
      light-activated

      (EC 1.1.1.82) present in these organelles, the NADPH used coming from the
      light phase reactions. The malate is then moved from the chloroplast and
      from the mesophyll cell to the bundle sheath cell chloroplast, with
      transport probably through plasmodesmata. In the cases of the other C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants, Asp is moved (in a Asp-Ala exchange).

      which first carboxylated PEP. The CO

      the NADP-malic enzyme is utilized in reducing 3-PGA to GA3P, sparing
      bundle sheath chloroplasts from the need to produce at least half of the
      reduced cofactor necessary and putting some of the onus on mesophyll
      chloroplasts to produce these reducing equivalents. The pyruvate generated
      from oxidative decarboxylation of malate is shuttle back to the mesophyll

      Note that the reactions are all shown to be reversible although reactions
      1 and 3 are very much to the right. Reaction 4 is shown to illustrate that
      photophosphorylation reactions will necessarily have to put two phosphate
      bond energies back on to AMP to produce ATP, a reaction actually involving
      phosphorylation by ATP first. Hence, two ATP molecules are used to convert

      cytoplasm where a

        -
        <i>alanine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase</i>
      </b>
      (EC 2.6.1.2) transaminates the pyruvate to form alanine. The αKG cycles
      back and forth with its amino acid analog, glutamate, aminating pyruvate
      and deaminating aspartate to keep the C
      <sub>4</sub>
      cycle balanced. This is assuming that αKG and glutamate can directly pass
      across the mitochondrial membrane (although it is possible another shuttle
      may be at work). Alanine entering the mesophyll cell would be
      transaminated again to produce pyruvate which is changed to PEP using the
      same dikinase above.

      A third group of C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants generates CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      not by a chloroplastic NADP-malic enzyme or by a mitochondrial NAD-malic
      enzyme, but instead by an enzyme called
      <b><i>PEP carboxykinase</i></b>
      or
      <b><i>ATP:oxaloacetate carboxy-lyase (transphosphorylating)</i></b>
      (EC 4.1.1.49). Its subcellular location is not yet known. Decarboxylation
      of OAA is achieved by ATP-dependent phosphorylation of OAA to produce PEP.
      The CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      should diffuse to its location in the chloroplast. It is not known
      although assumed that PEP is converted into pyruvate (probably using a
      cytoplasmic enolase as in the glycolytic pathway), and in effect regaining
      the ATP that was used in the PEP carboxykinase reaction. Pyruvate would be
      converted to alanine for transport back to the mesophyll.

      It should be noted that the mesophyll chloroplasts, while they have
      electron transport chains to produce the necessary NADPH and ATP which
      move CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      to the location where it will be utilized, do not have active carbon
      reduction cycles since the CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is essentially fixed at another location. Rubisco and other enzymes are
      not expressed in the mesophyll chloroplasts. The two enzymes which convert
      3-PGA to GA3P are present however. NADP-specific malate dehydrogenase used
      to produce the malate transported to bundle sheath cells is very low in C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants using the NAD-malic enzyme to recover CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      , or altogether absent is C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants using PEP carboxykinase for this activity. Any NADPH generated by
      mesophyll chloroplasts not using the NADP-malic enzyme is likely involved
      with 3-PGA reduction. Mesophyll cells likely obtain their 3-PGA from the
      bundle sheath cells, and use it in starch biosynthesis or return it to
      bundle sheath cells as triose phosphates.

    <h4>
      Stoichiometry of The C
      <sub>4</sub>
      Mode of Photosynthesis
    </h4>
    <p>
      The only difference between C
      <sub>4</sub>
      and C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants is that C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants have special mechanism to move CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      from one tissue to another. The Calvin cycle is still employed in
      producing hexose phosphates. Three ATP and two NADPH are still employed to
      fix one CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      molecule.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the transport of CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      involved in C
      <sub>4</sub>
      metabolism is energy-dependent. Two molecules ATP are used to activate
      pyruvate to PEP in mesophyll chloroplasts by pyruvate,P
      <sub>i</sub>
      dikinase. Although shown as no net ATP loss, the PEP carboxykinase
      reaction may involve phosphate bond energy. NADPH is used, but there is no
      difference between net use in C
      <sub>3</sub>
      or C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants. Hence C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants use two more ATP than do C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants may in fact use less energy than C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants since there has no accounting given for loss of energy involved
      with photorespiration. The photorespiration rate (see table above) is
      lower in C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants than C
      <sub>3</sub>
      and as a consequence, C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants use less energy to fix one CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      than do C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Purpose of The C
      <sub>4</sub>
      Mode of Photosynthesis
    </h4>
    <p>
      The initial hypothesis for C
      <sub>4</sub>
      metabolism was the belief, since dismissed according to results of studies
      given above, that rubisco needed a high CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      concentration because of its apparent high K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      . This could be forthcoming by a energy-driven process to concentrate CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      The current hypothesis is based upon a finding that C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants show a high stomatal resistance to gaseous diffusion. The CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      in the mesophyll cells of C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants is sufficiently concentrated for rubisco to utilize CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      in the fixation cycle, but in C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants, it is far too low. It is sufficient enough for PEP carboxylase,
      which has a K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for HCO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>−</sup>
      in the physiological range at which HCO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>−</sup>
      is present.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why the higher stomatal resistance to gaseous diffusion? The C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plant structure may impose a barrier to CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      acquisition, but it has the advantage of minimizing water loss through
      transpiration, a problem likely to be significant in very warm climates
      where the water vapor pressure is increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hypothesis to be considered is that C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants also minimize energy losses associated with the photorespiratory
      pathway. O
      <sub>2</sub>
      gas has just as much difficulty as CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      diffusing into the bundle sheath chloroplasts where it would compete with
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      for rubisco, but its product would be wasteful (excepting where heat
      generation is physiologically important). C
      <sub>4</sub>
      metabolism is a process evolved to minimize O
      <sub>2</sub>
      access to rubisco and maximize CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      fixation.
    </p>
    <h3>Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM)</h3>

    <h4>Mechanism of CAM</h4>
    <p>
      Plants employing this special metabolic pathway include many succulents,
      i.e., desert plants. They include the dicotyledonous Crassulaceae in which
      the metabolism was found (e.g., Kalanchoe spp., Sedum spp.), and the
      monocotyledonous Agavaceae, Bromeliaceae, Liliaceae, and Orchidaceae.
      Other dicotyledonous families are Cactaceae, Caryophyllaceaea,
      Chenopodiaceae, Compositae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Plantaginaceae,
      Portulacaceae, and Vitaceae.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not found in the plants considered primitive, suggesting it
      developed late in evolution. Indeed isotope studies of plant fossils show
      the oldest plants use the C
      <sub>3</sub>
      pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAM plants differ from others in that they open their stomata only at
      night (the C
      <sub>3</sub>
      and C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants, on the other hand, open only during the day). Also CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is fixed only during the night, in which massive amounts of malate are
      synthesized during this period in photosynthetic tissues. The malate is
      stored in vacuoles as it accumulates. During the day, the accumulated
      malate is then decarboxylated and the CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      fixed in normal, light-driven sucrose and storage glucan (starch)
      synthesis. Some of the glucan in the cell is saved for the coming night to
      act as an acceptor for CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      in the malate synthesis. The scheme is shown below or on the next page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      enters the stomata at night, PEP carboxylase incorporates HCO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>−</sup>
      (K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is 20 μM; K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for PEP is 190 μM) to produce OAA as in C
      <sub>4</sub>
      metabolism. The subcellular location of PEP carboxylase is not known
      although the illustration indicates a cytoplasmic location; some studies
      indicate it is within the chloroplast. The enzyme is inhibited
      (allosterically) by malate (K
      <sub>i</sub>
      = 1 mM). Malate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial?) then reduces OAA to malate,
      which is actively transported into a vacuole. This single pathway
      continues throughout the night as accumulated PEP is recruited for its
      purpose of collecting CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      . The PEP source is continuously replenished by glycolytic breakdown of
      glucan polymers which proceed down the glycolytic pathway. It should be
      noted that no ATP/ADP or NAD
      <sup>+</sup>
      /NADH accumulates in the process since the night time pathway uses ATP at
      one step and generates it at another, and the same is true for NAD
      <sup>+</sup>
      . The only molecule used in large amounts in P
      <sub>i</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn, the accumulated malic acid passes back into the cytoplasm where
      it is decarboxylated to provide CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      to drive hexose phosphate synthesis. The decarboxylation can occur in two
      different mechanisms depending upon the family of CAM plants. The
      Crassulaceae, Cactaceae, and Agavaceae utilize NADP-malic enzyme, while
      the Liliaceae, Bromeliaceae, and Asclepiadaceae have no NADP-malic enzyme
      but instead a very active PEP carboxykinase. In the case of PEP
      carboxykinase, the malate is oxidized to OAA, although it is not known if
      this is done by cytosolic NAD-malate dehydrogenase or chloroplast
      (light-activated) NADP-malate dehydrogenase. CAM plants using NADP-malic
      enzyme to recover CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      must also convert the pyruvate product to PEP, which they must do using
      pyruvate,P
      <sub>i</sub>
      dikinase. This enzyme is unnecessary in CAM plants using PEP carboxykinase
      since PEP is the direct product.

    <p>
      The rubisco in CAM plants (K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is 18 μM; for O
      <sub>2</sub>
      , 490 μM) is not different than for C
      <sub>3</sub>
      and C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants. F6P is made in the chloroplast and incorporated into organellar
      starch to be used as a source for night time PEP in the carbon fixation
      reactions. Net carbon is also moved from the chloroplast as DHAP, to be
      converted to sucrose in the cytosol. The sucrose is exported to the other
      (nonphotosynthetic) plant tissues to be used by them for nourishment.
    </p>
    <h4>Regulation of CAM</h4>
    <p>
      Two types of regulation have been found, one which is
      <i>short term</i>
      and the other
      <i>long term</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Short term</b>
      regulation was developed from a hypothesis by Kluge (1975) in which malate
      is transported into the vacuole by an active transport mechanism which
      also prevents high concentrations from inhibiting PEP carboxylase. Osmosis
      also demands that water follow the solute into the vacuole as well.
      However, there is a critical turgor pressure point which is eventually
      reached in the tonoplast, at which point, a net efflux of malate moves out
      and inhibits PEP carboxylase. Apparently the tonoplast has properties that
      permit malate to enter until a point is reached when malate is forced out.
      Such a
      <q>switch</q>
      has been shown particularly for K
      <sup>+</sup>
      in
      <i>Valonia</i>
      . If such a hypothesis were true, then diurnal changes in light or
      temperature would not be necessary and CAM would proceed under constant
      light and temperature. This is in fact true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Long term</b>
      regulation is chiefly a factor involving the availability of water.
      Thermo- or photoperiod durations have little effect in water is limited or
      nonexistent. Cacti represent a good example. Having a low surface
      area-to-volume ratio and coated with a waxy cuticle which prevents gas
      exchange (and therefore water loss), these plants may or may not open
      their stomata at night depending upon the availability of water. Where
      rainfall has occurred, the stomata are opened and CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is gathered. But in long periods of drought, the stomata remain tightly
      closed while the cactus does not grow, but prepares to survive, often for
      months. Light energy absorbed during the day is dissipated by
      nonproductive carboxylation and decarboxylation in the CAM pathway, in
      photorespiration, and in the normal dark reactions. CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is cycled back and forth between C
      <sub>3</sub>
      synthesis, starch, to PEP, then to malate, and back to C
      <sub>3</sub>
      synthesis. No net carbon is fixed, which must come from the outside. The
      CAM plant is said to be
      <q>idling.</q>
      On the other hand, when the water is plentiful, the CAM plant appears to
      have a less active CAM mode of CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      fixation and appears to follow C
      <sub>3</sub>
      photosythesis, but it readily switches back to CAM if stressed (besides
      dehydration, such stress includes temperature fluctuation, short
      photoperiods, or salinity changes).

      <sub>2</sub>
      into the plant and that C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants operate typically in warmer climates probably accounts for the

      <sub>3</sub>

      C values are between −14 and −33‰. Since some CAM plants can facultatively

    <h3>Starch and Sucrose Metabolism in Photosynthesis</h3>

    <h4>Starch synthesis</h4>
    <p>
      Starch is a glucose polymer with a linear chain of monomers connected
      α1→4. The first reaction involved in starch synthesis is preparation of
      the glucose monomer in much the same way glucose is prepared in animal
      cells for glycogen synthesis, except the activating trinucleotide is ATP
      instead of UTP. The next step is the synthesis of starch with the
      ADP-glucose product.

    <p>
      The G1P substrate in the pyrophosphorylase reaction is obtained from the
      six-carbon sugar produced by the Calvin cycle, which would be
      fructose-6-phosphate. The chloroplast contains the phosphoglucose
      isomerase and phosphoglucomutase enzymes necessary to convert F6P to G6P
      to G1P in that order. Almost all of the ADPG pyrophosphorylase and starch
      synthetase are found in chloroplasts of leaf tissue. In addition a
      <q>branching enzyme</q>
      catalyzing formation of α1→6 linkages to form the amylopectin component of
      starch is present. A Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      -dependent pyrophosphatase catalyzing PP
      <sub>i</sub>
      + H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O → 2 P
      <sub>i</sub>
      is also present to drive the reaction toward ADPG formation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADPG concentrations in the stroma are very low even when starch synthesis
      conditions prevail. Combine this with the finding that the K
      <sub>m</sub>
      of starch synthetase for ADPG is high, and it seems the case that [ADPG]
      regulates starch synthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inorganic phosphate is a strong inhibitor of ADPG pyrophorylase, with P
      <sub>i</sub>
      concentrations usually high enough to completely inhibit the enzyme.
      However, with accumulations of 3-PGA, the increase in ADPG concentrations
      is sufficient to overcome the inhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pyrosphorylase is inhibited by increasing ADP concentrations (1-2 mM
      producing 50% inhibition).
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary regulatory effect seems to depend on [P
      <sub>i</sub>
      ] generally. With illumination, the phosphate levels fall as
      photophosphorylation consumes what is present, and ADPG pyrophosphorylase
      is not inhibited. Additionally, C3 molecules brought into the chloroplast
      for carbon fixation purposes enter the chloroplast via an C3
      compound/phosphate antiporter or exchanger. Hence phosphate is moved out
      of the chloroplast, providing additional decreases in [P
      <sub>i</sub>
      ]. Couple this with the rise in stromal 3-PGA as the C3 sugars enter, and
      ADPG pyrophosphorylase is very active. This is shown very much with
      phosphate-deficient whole leaves, where abnormal accumulations of starch
      are evident. Also, mannose-fed leaves show the same effect of abnormal
      starch synthesis: mannose is converted to mannose-6-phosphate in the
      cytoplasm, which cannot be metabolized further (and so it acts as a drain
      on phosphate).
    </p>
    <h4>Starch breakdown</h4>
    <p>
      In the light even though the breakdown of starch is possible, there is a
      net accumulation of starch as the synthetic pathway becomes active. In the
      dark, synthesis effectively stops as the high-energy metabolites produced
      by the light reactions are consumed. Starch breakdown is the main activity
      in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starch can be broken down by two pathways classically. In one pathway,
      amylases and maltase work together to produce glucose monomers which would
      have to be phosphorylated to G6P for utilization in the glycolytic
      pathways or in other synthetic reactions involving glucose. In another, a
      phosphorolysis of starch proceeds by the action of a phosphorylase just as
      it occurs in glycogen breakdown in animal cells. A
      <q>debranching enzyme</q>
      hydrolyzing a α1→l6 bonds would have to be used in either breakdown
      pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies in pea chloroplasts show no α- or β-amylase nor maltase
      activities. The presence of phosphate is required, suggesting only a
      phosphorolyzing activity. The K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for P
      <sub>i</sub>
      of the starch phosphorylase is in the millimolar range, indicating that P
      <sub>i</sub>
      should be very high before starch is broken down. The intricate regulation
      of glycogen phosphorylase in animals does not seem to be evident in the
      plant phosphorylases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spinach chloroplasts show some differences with peas. Both amylase and
      phosphorylase activities are apparent, which having the greater
      significance probably depending upon growth conditions. It should be noted
      that breakdown by amylases is not energy-conserving, which is not a
      problem in plants with active photophosphorylation. A de-branching enzyme
      is present in these chloroplasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formation of G6P is seen to develop in an accumulation of 3-PGA. This
      3-PGA formation can result from partial glycolysis or by oxidative pentose
      phosphate pathway (the enzymes for these processes are present in the
      stroma). Use of these pathways would cause a net accumulation of ATP and
      NADPH, perhaps necessary to maintain chloroplast vitality in the dark. The
      lack of enolase, phosphoglyceromutase, and pyruvate kinase do not allow
      further glycolytic activities.

    <h3>
      Transport of Light-Generated ATP into The Cytoplasm–The 3-Phosphoglyceric
      Acid/Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate Shuttle
    </h3>
    <p>
      Increases in the ATP/ADP ratio of the chloroplast in the light are
      mirrored by increases in the ATP/ADP ratio in the cytoplasm, indicating a
      mechanism to move ATP or its equivalent to the cytoplasm. The chloroplast
      envelope shows only selective permeability to metabolites however (see
      table), and ATP is not among those metabolites transported across the
      membrane.
    </p>
    <p>
      In interpreting the table, it should be considered that these are the
      properties of mature chloroplasts, and the permeability properties of
      younger plant chloroplasts may differ. The first experiments to show the
      specificity of the envelope for metabolite translocation began with
      <sup>14</sup>
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      subcellular fractionation at various periods showed that among the first
      cytoplasmic metabolites labeled were sucrose, 3-PGA, F6P, G6P, FBP, and
      UDPG. Labeled RuBP and SuBP remained confined to the chloroplast,
      indicating they do not cross the membrane. The appearance of a compound in
      the cytoplasm does not mean it is capable of crossing the membrane
      however: FBP could have been synthesized from 3-PGA in the cytoplasm using
      all gluconeogenetic catalytic steps rather than crossing the chloroplast
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies with isolated chloroplasts eliminate any conversions outside the
      chloroplast to avoid the above confusion; only metabolites (no enzymes are
      present in the medium). When given labeled CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      , RuBP and SuBP again are not found released into the medium, but among
      the first isolated is 3-PGA.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a substance is truly impermeable to the chloroplast, then adding it to
      isolated intact chloroplasts should not result in its conversion by any
      chloroplast enzyme, nor affect photosynthetic activity of the chloroplast.
      Results show that NADP addition to illuminated chloroplasts does not
      reduce the NADP, and photophosphorylation of added ADP is too slow to be
      physiologically significant. Addition of 3-PGA to the chloroplasts appears
      to decrease the lag period for carbon fixation rates, while SuBP addition
      has no effect. From the above data, it may be concluded that SuBP, NADP(H)
      and NAD(H) are not permeable, ADP is only slightly permeable, and 3-PGA
      has a physiological role in crossing the membrane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interpretation of the results is necessary. Isolated intact chloroplasts
      are not always free of cytoplasmic enzyme contamination, and addition of a
      substance not permeable to the chloroplast membrane may be converted to
      one that is and which affects photosynthesis. A good example is FBP (not
      permeable) being converted by a contaminating aldolase to DHAP and GA3P
      (both permeable). Moreover, stromal enzymes from the Calvin cycle may be
      present in the medium and cause conversions which would otherwise be
      unseen under perfect conditions.

    <p>
      It is usual to measure the rates of uptake of metabolites to assist in the
      interpretation as to whether they cross the envelope. The
      <b>silicone oil method</b>
      is the standard procedure, with perchloric acid solution added first, a
      light silicone oil then layered over it, followed by an overlay of the
      intact chloroplast suspension. The labeled metabolite whose permeability
      is in question added for the necessary incubation time, after which the
      tube is rapidly centrifuged. As the chloroplasts descend through the
      silicone layer, which removes the medium surrounding them preventing
      further action. Once in the acid, immediate denaturation stops any further
      conversion. Radiolabeled products are identified and or presence of
      radioactivity detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Results of these experiments show that part of the chloroplast volume was
      accessible to low MW substances (e.g., sucrose, sugar phosphates) but not
      to proteins or dextran. The size of the
      <q>sucrose permeable</q>
      space was determined to vary with medium osmolarity and correlated with
      the intermembrane space of the chloroplast as calculated from electron
      micrographs. In a hypotonic medium the intermembrane space is small, but
      as tonicity increases, the intermembrane space expands. Therefore the
      sucrose-permeable space is equivalent to the intermembrane space,
      indicating the outer envelope is freely permeable to small molecules while
      the inner membrane is more discriminating (analogous with the plant and
      animal mitochondria).
    </p>
    <p>
      Other studies using resealed chloroplast envelopes show similar results
      insofar as permeability of low MW vs. the high MW.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chloroplast has been shown to be an excellent osmometer, shrinking or
      swelling with the medium tonicity. In part it can be used to determine
      whether a metabolite can penetrate the inner membrane. If a metabolite can
      enter, then the osmotic response would be smaller relative to sucrose,
      which can not penetrate. Such determinations of permeability can not be
      quantitative, however, since the degree of swelling does not vary directly
      with the penetration rate of the metabolites. Solutes which penetrate by
      an exchange system would also produce not net changes in osmotic flux.
    </p>
    <h4>Substances crossing the chloroplast inner envelope</h4>
    <p>
      The chloroplast inner envelope allows certain monocarboxylic acids (acetic
      acid, formic acid, glyceric acid, etc) to cross based on simple diffusion;
      in the protonated form, these un-ionized molecules are sufficiently
      nonpolar not to require specific transporters. The factors affecting
      transport will include chemical potentials of the carboxylic acid and of
      protons (any pH gradient).

      The silicone oil method has also shown that 3-PGA, DHAP, and P

      cross the envelope rapidly, while G6P, F6P, RuBP, SuBP, and FBP are hardly

      of the metabolite). The transporter has been shown to be an exchanger,
      which is logical since P

      would be transported in for photophosphorylation and the sugar phosphates
      will produce sucrose. The transporter contains necessary thiol groups,
      failing to work if thiol-binding compounds alter the protein.

    <h4>Movement of ATP, ADP, AMP</h4>
    <p>
      Although an ATP exchange porter has been found in chloroplast envelope,
      its V
      <sub>max</sub>
      is rather low to be of significance. Indeed, it functions best when ATP
      from the cytoplasm is to enter the chloroplast rather than the reverse.
      Also in the inner envelope are an ATPase and adenylate kinase activities,
      their physiological roles unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a hypothesis that both reducing power and substrate
      phosphorylating energy are transported by the 3-PGA/DHAP shuttle. 3-PGA
      formed in the chloroplast immediately after carbon fixation is
      phosphorylated and reduced, respectively to form GA3P. This isomerizes to
      DHAP. The DHAP then crosses chloroplast envelope in exchange for 3-PGA
      (note charge and mass are balanced). Now in the cytosol DHAP is
      isomerized, oxidized (by NAD-dependent GA3P dehydrogenase), and transfers
      a phosphate to ADP to form 3-PGA. This is exchanged and the cycle
      continues. A net transfer of 2 electrons, 2 protons, and high energy in a
      phosphate bond occurs.

    <h1>Chapter 6 Respiration</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Cellular respiration is defined as the oxidative process in which high
      potential bond energy in certain molecules (carbohydrates, fats) is
      coupled to the formation of bond energy in a molecule the cell relies upon
      for maintaing homeostatic (steady-state) metabolic processes, this
      molecule being ATP.
    </p>
    <p>
      An overview shows that certain metabolic pathways, namely glycolysis, TCA
      cycle, fatty acid β-oxidation, high energy in the form of reducing agents,
      namely NADH and succinate, coupled to the oxidation of these substrates.
      The high energy reducing agents then reduce molecular oxygen in an
      electron transport process which preserves this energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The free energy released from this process is dependent upon the potential
      difference in these electron movements and to the number of electrons
      passing through the chain. Calculations show that the energy from this
      process is preserved 40% (i.e., 40% efficiency) in the energy of forming
      ATP.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATP is formed from many sources: from photosynthesis, driven by light; and
      from respiration, driven by oxidation of reduced organic molecules.
    </p>
    <h2>Oxidative Phosphorylation</h2>

    <h3>
      Isolation of
      <q>Coupled</q>
      Mitochondria
    </h3>
    <p>
      Proof of the inner membrane as the site of oxidative phosphorylation
      required exact processes in which pure inner membrane had to be isolated,
      intact and uncontaminated. Such mitochondria are called
      <q>coupled,</q>
      in which ADP is not phosphorylated unless electron transport is occurring,
      and when electron transport occurs, ADP is being phosphorylated. Poorly
      handled or isolated mitochondria can and do oxidize NADH and succinate
      under aerobic conditions without phosphorylating ADP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Study of mitochondrial function in plants is made difficult by the fact
      that the forces necessary to break cell wall during extraction also
      disrupt mitochondria. Also as vacuoles break and release acidic contents,
      the pH is difficult to control. Polyphenols released during extraction
      also are inhibitory to mitochondrial reactions. Other enzymes, such as
      polyphenol oxidase and the nonspecific acylhydrolase make products that
      are inhibitory in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still picking the right plant tissue and proper extraction buffer, using
      mild cell breaking techniques, then purifying mitochondria using ood
      centrifugation techniques can produce coupled mitochondria. Intact
      mitochondria should show no ability to reduce cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      when added with succinate.
    </p>
    <h3>Nature of the Terminal Electron Transport Chain</h3>

    <h4>General Composition and Operation</h4>
    <p>
      Components of the chain are
      <i>redox</i>
      compounds as they are alternately reduced then oxidized as part of
      transport chain. The flow is from the most negative reduction potential to
      the most positive. All components are proteins with prosthetic groups with
      the single exception of
      <b><i>ubiquinone</i></b>
      (UQ), which is a lipid with a benzoquinonoid nucleus bound to a
      hydrophobic isoprenoid side chain. Three classes of proteins are present:
      flavoproteins, or proteins with either the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or
      flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), the heme-containing cytochromes, and
      the iron-sulfur proteins in which iron is not coordinated by heme but by
      elemental sulfur and the thiols of cysteine residues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Components in the respiratory chain can be classified as
      <q>electron carriers</q>
      or
      <q>proton (hydrogen ion) carriers.</q>
      While all the components
      <q>carry</q>
      electrons in the course of redox reactions, some components only need
      carry electrons. Others, in the course of their reduction, bond to protons
      from the medium as a consequence of forming a stable chemical state,
      making them both electron and proton carriers. Components in the chain
      which are both electron and proton carriers include UQ and the
      flavoproteins; components in the chain which are only electron carriers
      are the cytochromes and Fe-S proteins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another consideration in the redox chain is whether a component is a one-
      or two-electron transfer components. UQ and flavoproteins must acquire two
      electrons to go from a stably oxidized to stably reduced state. The
      cytochromes and, it is believed, Fe-S proteins are stably reduced with
      only one electron (Fe is the important atom here, capable of alternating
      from a Fe
      <sup>3+</sup>
      to Fe
      <sup>2+</sup>
      as part of its chemistry).
    </p>
    <p>
      The molecules
      <q>feeding</q>
      the chain are the reduced compounds, NADH and succinate. Their oxidation
      to their stable oxidized, NAD
      <sup>+</sup>
      and fumarate, necessarily requires removal of two electrons; hence two
      electrons enter the chain. For the two-electron carrying components, only
      one molecule is needed to move the electrons along the chain. For the
      one-electron carriers, however, they must rapidly carry electrons from one
      component to the next, or perhaps operate in pairs.
    </p>

        alt="animal cell respiratory chain in mitochondria"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain components in the chain are integral with the inner membrane,
      i.e., they are fully embedded and may have no parts of them emerging
      beyond the polar heads of the membrane. Others are clearly peripheral
      components, loosely bound and easily removed by salt solutions of high
      concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reactions of the animal and plant mitochondrial respiratory chain are
      compared. More is known about the animal chain. The figures below show
      various FP abbreviations. These are all flavoproteins usually associated
      as prosthetic groups with their specific dehydrogenases.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the animal chain,
      <b><i>NADH dehyrogenase</i></b>
      is an inner membrane complex of a flavoprotein (FP
      <sub>1</sub>
      ) and a cluster of Fe-S protein subunits, which remove a hydride (H
      <sup>−</sup>
      ), i.e. two electrons and a proton from NADH and pass the electrons to UQ.
      The NADH molecule diffuses in from the matrix where it has been produced
      in a number of reactions in the TCA cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase,
      2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and malate
      dehydrogenase). Certain other components of the inner membrane are
      directly involved with oxidation of diffusible organic compounds
      (succinate, glycerol-3-P); while most TCA cycle enzymes are soluble in the
      matrix (or part of a complex), the succinate dehydrogenase is embedded in
      the inner membrane.
    </p>
    <p class="center">

        alt="respiratory chain in plant cells"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The glycerol-3-P (Gol-3P) dehydrogenase is actually an enzyme which is
      part of a shuttle designed to obtain reducing equivalent generated in the
      cytosol. NADH is produced in the cytosol by various processes. Its
      electrons cannot be obtained directly by a mitochondrial NADH
      dehydrogenase on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane since none
      exists. NADH also has no ability to cross the mitochondrial inner membrane
      to get to the matrix, so a more indirect way is employed to obtain this
      energy. A cytosolic NADH-dependent Gol-3P dehydrogenase is used to reduce
      DHAP to Gol-3P. Both DHAP and Gol-3P can cross the mitochondrial outer
      membrane. The NADH reducing equivalents, now in Gol-3P, move into the
      intermembrane space and are met by an inner membrane flavoprotein (FP
      <sub>g</sub>
      ) Gol-3P dehydrogenase on the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane.
      The oxidation produces DHAP, which can return to the cytoplasm to be
      reduced by more NADH. The flavoprotein then reduces UQ. It will be seen
      that plants do not require such a shuttle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another shuttle for NADH which involves a complex movement
      (shuttle) of malate and aspartate, and a-ketoglutarate and glutamate, in a
      balance between reducing equivalents and the transport of nitrogen across
      both mitochondrial membranes into the matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      UQ is then oxidized by a complex of cytochromes (cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      and
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>1</sub>
      )and Fe-S proteins called the
      <b>
        <i>ubiquinol-cytochrome</i>
        c
        <i>reductase</i>
      </b>
      . This moves the two electrons put into UQ at the entry points in the
      chain to two molecules of cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      . The protons released from UQ pass into the cytosolic side of the inner
      membrane. The reduced cytochrome c (ferrocytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      ) is then reoxidized by O
      <sub>2</sub>
      via the cytochrome-containing complex called
      <b><i>cytochrome oxidase</i></b>
      or
      <b>
        <i>cytochrome</i>
        aa
        <i><sub>3</sub></i>
      </b>
      . The reduction of O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is accompanied by proton movements from the matrix. The cytochrome oxidase
      is composed of two cytochromes: cytochrome
      <i>a</i>
      , located on the outer surface of the inner membrane, and cytochrome
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>3</sub>
      , on the inner half of the inner membrane and the site where O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inhibitors of the movement of electrons are known. The NADH dehydrogenase
      is shown to be blocked by the barbituate amytal, which blocks at high
      concentrations. Rotenone also blocks this enzyme, producing 65% inhibition
      of the protein with only 33 nmol/g protein; it is a poison from a tropical
      plant used by South American peoples to catch fish, and is also used as an
      insecticide (it is not very poisonous to mammals since they seem to absorb
      it poorly). Piercidin A is an antibiotic from a
      <i>Streptomyces</i>
      sp. which resembles UQ and therefore competes for reduction with UQ in the
      chain. Antimycin A is also an antibiotic produced by a
      <i>Streptomyces</i>
      sp. which inhibit the ubiquinol-cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      reductase, blocking electron transport from cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      to
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>1</sub>
      . A last set of inhibitors include azide, cyanide and carbon monoxide,
      which react with cytochrome
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>3</sub>
      . 50% inhibition of transport in crude heart mitochondria by CN, azide,
      and CO can be achieved with 5&nbsp;µM, 0.7&nbsp;µM, and 40&nbsp;µM, resp.
    </p>
    <p>
      With plant mitochondria, the NADH dehydrogenase is a flavoprotein as in
      animals, designated FP
      <sub>int</sub>
      instead of FP
      <sub>1</sub>
      , because it this dehydrogenase is
      <q>internal,</q>
      meaning it can oxidize NADH derived from the matrix as the enzyme is on
      the matrix side of the inner membrrane. Other components include the Fe-S
      proteins as in animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second NADH dehydrogenase exists on the outer or cytosolic face of the
      inner membrane as well, and it appears to be only a flavoprotein,
      designated FP
      <sub>ext</sub>
      . The outer membrane of mitochondria are porous to molecules of less than
      10,000 Da, and so NADH generated in the cytosol can cross the membrane and
      approach the external NADH dehydrogenase for oxidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The succinate dehydrogenase of plants is not different than in animals. It
      is built on the matrix side of the membrane, composed of a flavoprotein
      (FP
      <sub>s</sub>
      ) which oxidizes succinate and passes electrons to an Fe-S cluster,
      eventually reducing UQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      UQ is oxidized by a complex equivalent to the animal ubiquinol-cytochrome
      c reductase, except that in animals this enzyme is composed of one
      <i>b</i>
      -type and
      <i>c</i>
      -type set of cytochromes and Fe-S proteins, whereas in plants, a
      flavoprotein (FP
      <i><sub>ha</sub></i>
      ) two
      <i>b</i>
      -type cytochromes (
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>557</sub>
      and
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>560</sub>
      ), Fe-S proteins, and a
      <i>c</i>
      -type cytochrome make up the chain. Proton translocation occurs here when
      the UQ releases its two protons. A
      <i>c</i>
      -type cytochrome in plants is reduced just as it is in animals; it is
      extractable in high ionic strength solutions just as it is in animals as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last oxidative step, plant cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      is oxidized by the cytochrome oxidase which differs from the animal
      complex form only insignificantly. Composition, membrane location,
      function, and sensitivity to inhibitors is all similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for inhibitors, all the animal inhibitors stop electron flow at the
      same equivalent points in the plant chain. One compelling difference is
      the external NADH dehydrogenase, which is not inhibited at all by the
      internal NADH dehydrogenase inhibitors. It is noted that the internal
      enzyme has Fe-S clusters which are the true targets of these inhibitors,
      not the flavoprotein action; the plant enzyme has no Fe-S clusters.
    </p>
    <h4>Components</h4>

    <h5>The Pyridine Nucleotide-Linked Sector</h5>
    <p>
      The pyridine nucleotides are NAD and NADP. In the case of some
      oxidoreductases, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (in
      glycolysis), the NAD coenzyme is tightly bound to the enzyme and is
      essentially not a substrate in the reaction. Most oxidoreductases must
      wait for the diffusible coenzyme to enter their active site, and so it is
      a substrate just as is the compound to be oxidized.
    </p>
    <p>
      NAD/NADP are not permeable to certain membranes, including the
      mitochondrial and chloroplast inner membranes. The outer membranes of
      these organelles are free permeable. As ATP is used by cells to store
      potential energy in many chemical bond breaking processes, NAD/NADP are
      used by the cell to store potential energy in electron transfer processes.
      There is a limited amount of NAD and NADP, so any reduction of these
      compounds must be connected with their rapid re-oxidation to make them
      available for further oxidation-reduction reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      NAD is associated with principally catabolic processes, in which high
      energy compounds are oxidized and NAD transfers this energy to the
      respiratory chain. NADP is associated with anabolic or biosynthetic
      processes, its NADPH form being available to build molecules. A good
      example of using NADPH is where it is generated by the pentose phosphate
      pathway and used to drive conversion of relatively oxidized compounds into
      more complex molecules. This might occur in animals. In plants, NADPH is
      produced in the light reactions to produce the reducing equivalents for
      anabolic processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particular moeities of oxidation-reduction in NAD and NADP involve the
      nicotinamide ring, with the particular C4 carbon brought to a position
      next to the substrate to be oxidized. There is a certain stereospecificity
      in these reactions in which one face of the nicotinamide or the other is
      presented to the substrate; the stereospecificity results from the amide
      group on attached to C3 on the ring. The hydrogen on the A-face is
      projected toward the viewer when the amide group is on the right as the
      ring is viewed; the B-face projects back. The A-type oxidoreductases
      utilize or place to the A-face a hydrogen: these enzymes are malate
      dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, a plant NADH dehydrogenase in the
      outer mitochondrial membrane (not at all involved with the electron
      transport chain), alcohol dehydrogenase, glyoxylate reductase, and an NADP
      <q>photoreductase.</q>
      The B-type enzymes include both the plant internal and external NADH
      dehydrogenases, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
      glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6P dehydrogenase, and glutamate
      dehydrogenase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Free NAD and NADP in both reduced and oxidized forms have characteristic
      UV absorption spectra. The oxidized forms show only one maximum, at
      260&nbsp;nm (no extinction coefficient is given). The reduced forms
      continue show a maximum at 260&nbsp;nm with a slightly reduced extinction
      coefficient, but a new maximum at 340&nbsp;nm is also present. This
      permits spectrophotometric monitoring of the changes in NADH/NADPH
      concentrations. An explanation for the new peak may be attributable to the
      extensive conjugation of pi bonds from the ring to the amide connected to
      the ring, present in the reduced form and not present in the oxidized
      structure.
    </p>
    <h5>Flavoproteins</h5>
    <p>
      The widespread occurrence of flavoproteins throughout the chain indicates
      how important they are. These enzymes are typically associated with Fe-S
      proteins. The coenzyme is either FMN or FAD, either of which are based on
      the riboflavin nucleus which consists of an important
      7,8-dimethylisoalloxazine ring system.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <img
        src="./imagesPlantBiochemistryHTML/FlavinNucleotide.gif"
        alt="Flavin nucleotide structure"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Most flavoproteins utilized FAD. The NADH dehydrogenases in the
      respiratory chain use FMN. In most flavoproteins, the flavin is not
      covalently bound but a diffusible substrate. Succinate dehydrogenase is
      one example where the flavin (FAD) coenzyme is covalently attached to the
      apoenzyme via a histidine residue bonding with the 8-methyl function of
      the flavin nucleus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the reduction of flavin nucleotide, the structure acquires both
      electrons and protons to form the reduced product. Hence the coenzyme is
      both an electron and hydrogen carrier. The mechanism of reduction is not
      yet elucidated It is believed the hydride is accepted by N5, and that
      there is some electron rearrangement requiring N1 to pick up a proton. ESR
      evidence supports another sort of reduction, one in which there is a
      one-electron transfer reaction ot form a free radical on N5, making a
      flavin semiquinone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flavoprotein NADH dehydrogenases remove hydride from the B-side of the
      nicotinamide ring. A flavoprotein NADH dehydrogenase in the outer
      mitochondrial membrane is an A-side enzyme; it normally does not
      participate in the electron transport chain, but can be made to do so if
      the mitochondria are damaged in a controllable way and cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      is added exogenously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard reduction potentials for many flavoproteins vary widely, from
      −490 mV to +190 mV. The oxidized form of FAD or FMN show more extensive
      system of conjugated double bonds, and so the oxidized form should be more
      stable as it has more resonance structures. Anything affecting the
      resonance stabilization will also affect the std. reduction potental. Such
      an effect would be produced by the apoprotein binding to the flavin. If
      the protein binds the reduced form more strongly, the
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ should become more positive relative to unbound flavin. On the other
      hand if the oxidized form is bound more strongly, the reduction potential
      is relatively more negative. It is these differences in the apoprotein
      surrounding the flavin which influences the potential and accounting for
      the wide range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light spectra of FMN and FAD reveal a similarity with NAD and NADP in that
      oxidized and reduced forms show different maxima both in number and
      wavelength. FMN shows three peaks: one in the UV at 265&nbsp;nm with the
      greatest extinction of all maxima, and two on the visible at 375&nbsp;nm
      (about 33% of the extinction of the 265&nbsp;nm peak) and one at
      450&nbsp;nm (with a slightly higher, ~10%, extinction than the 375&nbsp;nm
      peak). These peaks in the visible region will vary as to λ
      <sub>max</sub>
      when they are bound to their specific apoprotein. As for FMNH
      <sub>2</sub>
      , there is only one peak in the UV (at 245&nbsp;nm with extinction about
      20% lower at that max than the 265&nbsp;nm peak of FMN).
      Spectrophotometric monitoring is done for FMN at either of the maxima
      present in the 350-500&nbsp;nm region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flavoproteins show changes in fluorescence and absorption properties when
      undergoing redox changes. Four different flavoproteins have been
      identified in plant mitochondria. These have been designated FP
      <i><sub>lf</sub></i>
      , FP
      <i><sub>la</sub></i>
      , FP
      <i><sub>ma</sub></i>
      , and FP
      <i><sub>ha</sub></i>
      , in which
      <i>f</i>
      and
      <i>a</i>
      mean
      <i>fluorescence</i>
      and
      <i>absorbance</i>
      , resp., and
      <i>l</i>
      ,
      <i>m</i>
      , and
      <i>h</i>
      , refer to
      <i>low</i>
      ,
      <i>mid</i>
      , and
      <i>high</i>
      , resp. At pH 7.2, the
      <i>
        E
        <sub>m</sub>
      </i>
      for these flavoproteins are −155, −70, +20, and +110 mV, resp. Specific
      inhibitors affect these flavoproteins, and studies with these show that FP
      <i><sub>ha</sub></i>
      is a component of the chain between UQ and cyt
      <i>b</i>
      . The FP
      <i><sub>ma</sub></i>
      has been found as a component of the cyanide-resistant chain which
      branches from UQ. No known function has been assigned to the other two
      flavoproteins, although they could be components of the flavin NADH
      dehydrogenases, about which little is known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other flavoproteins include one in an NADH dehydrogenase which re-oxidizes
      NADH produced by the mitochondrial malic enzyme (malate + NAD → pyruvate +
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      + NADH). Another is the NADH:dihydrolipoamide oxidoreductase part of the
      pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, as well as the α-ketoglutarate
      dehydrogenase. Flavoproteins are active in the fatty acid synthase
      complexes in the cytosol as well.
    </p>
    <h5>Iron-Sulfur Proteins</h5>
    <p>
      Biologically useful Fe is mobilized in three ways: it is coordinated to
      <i>heme</i>
      in proteins (includes the cytochromes); it is clustered to sulfur in Fe-S
      proteins; it forms another coordinate center in other kinds of proteins,
      particular (mono)oxygenases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fe-S proteins show iron bonded to either elemental sulfur (inorganic
      sulfur) and to the sulfur in cysteine thiols. The elemental sulfur is
      acid-labile (meaning it is easily extracted). Classification of Fe-S
      proteins is based upon the number of Fe and labile sulfur atoms. In
      plants, two varieties designated [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins are
      found. A single Fe-S cluster only accepts and donates a single electron,
      and the Fe-S proteins are therefore one-electron carriers (they do not
      carry protons).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fe-S proteins show range of MW, from 6000 Da in bacteria to
      12&nbsp;kDa in chloroplasts, and even high for some other complexes. The
      protein moeity is likely to affect redox potential similarly as it
      influences flavins. This range has been measured from −420 mV to +350 mV.
      Fe
      <sup>2+</sup>
      is strongly paramagnetic and shows a high
      <i>g</i>
      value in EPR, characteristic of Fe-S proteins. One particular protein with
      [2Fe-2S] cluster shows a
      <i>g</i>
      value of 1.94. [EPR done in microwave generator set at 9.5 GHz with
      variable magnetic field strength at liquid nitrogen-cooled temperatures.
      The change in absorbed radiofrequency with respect to the change in
      magnetic field strength is plotted against the magnetic field strength (∂
      <i>A</i>
      /∂
      <i>H</i>
      vs.
      <i>H</i>
      ). The
      <i>g</i>
      value expresses the ratio of an electron's magnetic moment to its spin
      angular momentum.] The Fe-S cluster structure is not well understood in
      Fe-S proteins of either plant or animal. The animal NADH dehydrogenase has
      four Fe-S centers (designated N1 through N4 with
      <i>g</i>
      =1.94, 1.92, 1.89, and 1.86, resp.), and they individually have different
      reduction potentials, although N3 and N4 are a complex with a ~250 mV
      potential. An plant NADH dehydrogenase thought to be the internal enzyme
      has at least three Fe-S centers, with its N1 and N2 apparently equivalent
      with N1 and N2 in the animal (the
      <i>g</i>
      values are identical), and the third having a
      <i>g</i>
      value identical with the animal N3/N4 complex.
    </p>
    <h5>Ubiquinone</h5>
    <p>
      Ubiquinone refers to large family of compounds having quinonoid nucleus
      but different only in the length of the isoprenoid tail. The number of
      isoprene units in animal mitochondria is 10, in higher plants 9 or 10, and
      in bacteria 6. It is both an electron and proton carrier since it requires
      both during reduction. UV absorption spectra show differences in oxidized
      and reduced forms: UQ has maximum at 275 nm, while UQH
      <sub>2</sub>
      has 290&nbsp;nm maximum with one-fourth the extinction of the peak of the
      oxidized form. It is not useful to monitor it spectrophotometrically since
      the membrane contains many other UV absorbing materials. It is present in
      greater stoichiometric numbers than any other component of the electron
      chain; UQ outnumbers any of the various cytochromes by 5 to 1. This is
      useful for its function as the receiving point for many electron transport
      processes in the many chains in the membrane; it can serve as a reserve
      for collecting in case one part of the chain is proceeding slowly ahead of
      it.
    </p>
    <h5>Cytochromes</h5>
    <p>
      Cytochromes are hemes: tetrapyrroles coordinating a Fe atom. They move
      only electrons along the chain, and not protons. First found in animal
      cells (MacMunn, 1886) and called histo- or myohaematins, they were
      assigned a respiratory function (based on what was known of hemoglobin).
      Rediscovered in 1925 by Keilin studying insect muscles in respiratory
      activity; he was the first to observe that they function as electron
      carriers from fuel molecules to oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytochromes demonstrate characteristic absorption spectra in the visible
      range between 500 and 650 nm. These absorption maxima depend on whether
      the cytochrome is in the reduced or oxidized form. Cytochromes are classed
      as
      <i>a</i>
      ,
      <i>b</i>
      , and
      <i>c</i>
      , depending upon the position of their absorption bands in the reduced
      state. The reduced cytochromes show three absorption band groups, α, β, γ,
      also called Soret bands. The α group peaks lie mostly in the 545-600 nm
      range, the β and γ group peaks in the 520-535 and 415-445 nm ranges, resp.
      It is the a group peaks which have been used to classify the
      <i>a</i>
      -,
      <i>b</i>
      - and
      <i>c</i>
      -type cytochromes, being peaks appearing in the 590-600, 555-565, and
      545-555 nm, resp. In identifying the particular cytochrome the a peaks are
      found by recording the difference spectrum (the difference in absorption
      between the reduced in the sample and oxidized form in the reference
      cell). For a particular cytochrome type, a unique α peak is present while
      all show indistinguishable β peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The α and β bands disappear in the oxidized cytochrome, the γ band being
      shifted blue 10&nbsp;nm and losing its persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are today
      <i>four</i>
      recognized classes of cytochromes:
      <i>a</i>
      ,
      <i>b</i>
      ,
      <i>c</i>
      and
      <i>d</i>
      . The classification is based on the structure of the heme and whether it
      is covalently bound to the protein. This new classification does not
      change the old cytochromes
      <i>a</i>
      ,
      <i>b</i>
      , and
      <i>c</i>
      classes, which nonetheless fit into the new classes. All hemes in the
      classes have the macrocyclic tetrapyrrole (porphyring ring), with rings A,
      B, C, and D, bridged by a methine (–CH=), the methines designated α, β, γ,
      and δ. The distinction between the different cytochromes are given in the
      table.

    <p>
      When new cytochromes were originally discovered they were given subscripts
      (
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>1</sub>
      ,
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>3</sub>
      ) in order of discovery. It is now the practice to give a name based on
      the wavelength of the α band, e.g., cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>557</sub>
      . The reduction potentials,
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′, for cytochromes vary over a wide range; the
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ is a function of (i) prosthetic group structure, (ii) apoprotein
      structure, and (iii) the nature of binding between prosthetic group and
      apoprotein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of its extractability and the retained activity of solubilized
      protein, the mitochondrial cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      is the most well-characterized cytochrome. The protein portion is 104
      amino acids long (MW ~13,000), and the heme is covalently bound via
      thioether linkages at positions 2 (A-ring) and 4 (B-ring) by cysteines at
      residue 14 and 17, resp. Besides the tetrapyrrole nitrogens, the protein
      coordinates with the Fe atom with the Met-80 sulfur atom and His-18 (the
      side which Met and His are on when the A-D rings are placed to run
      clockwise is not well-indicated in the notes). The protoheme group sits
      deep inside a cleft surrounded fully by the winding polypeptide chain. The
      nature of the redox chemistry is not fully elucidated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plant mitochondria show two
      <i>c</i>
      -type cytochromes,
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>547</sub>
      and
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>549</sub>
      , in which both have about the same
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ (+0.235 V). The association of
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>547</sub>
      with the cytochrome oxidase and its extractability seems to indicate that
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>547</sub>
      is the equivalent of animal mitochondria cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the
      <i>b</i>
      -type cytochromes, three were known in plant mitochondria until the
      mid-70s:
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>557</sub>
      (
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ = +75 mV),
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>560</sub>
      (+45 mV) and
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>566</sub>
      (−70 mV). Two additional with α bands at 558&nbsp;nm have been identified.
      Current evidence places
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>557</sub>
      and
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>560</sub>
      in the chain after FP
      <i><sub>ha</sub></i>
      but before cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>549</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      There appear to be only minor differences between plant and animal
      cytochrome oxidase. Most work on these cytochromes has been done in yeast
      and beef heart. The yeast complex has two
      <i>a</i>
      -type hemes, two Cu
      <sup>2+</sup>
      atoms, and seven different proteins I-VII ranging from MW 4500 to 40,000.
      The three largest (I-III) are hydrophobic and coded by mitochondrial
      genes. The four smallest are hydrophilic and imported from the cytosol
      (nuclear-encoded). The beef heart complex also shows
      <i>a</i>
      -type hemes and copper atoms, but only 6 proteins (MW range: 7300-40,000).
      The complex has a long axis of 83 � perpendicular to the inner membrane
      plane. Site location studies show protein III is in the matrix; II, V, and
      VI are on the cytosolic side, and I and IV are in between with IV closer
      to III. The atoms of Cu are known to undergo redox changes, and must be
      involved in transferring electrons from heme in cytochrome
      <i>a</i>
      (on the cytosolic side) to the heme in cytochrome
      <i>a</i>
      <sub>3</sub>
      (on the matrix side).
    </p>
    <h5>Lipids</h5>
    <p>
      While not necessarily participating in direct electron transfer reactions,
      the membrane phospholipids are clearly necessary to provide the correct
      environment and stabilize structures of the elements responsible.
      Particularly with cytochrome oxidase, PL removal inactivates transfer; it
      is restored when PL is added back. Lipid composition is also a factor.
    </p>
    <h4>Evidence for The Sequence of Components</h4>
    <p>
      Evidence for the current electron transfer sequence given above comes
      from:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        sophisticated spectrophotometric measurements taken during the time of
        transfer (pioneered by B. Chance); this relies on the fact that the
        reduced and oxidized forms have different spectra, that conditions can
        be altered to permit the time to detect and measure, and that each
        carrier is reduced in an unperturbed set of transfers
      </li>
      <li>
        use of compounds which poison the chain at a specific site, causing an
        accumulation of reduced compound at the point of blockage; electrons on
        the other side of the blockage point continue to move down the chain.
        Plots of the concentration of each reduced component in the poisoned
        chain expressed as percentages of the concentrations in the normal chain
        will show the plot
        <q>crossing-over</q>
        the line representing the 100% mark of the control level; the poisoned
        site is the
        <q>cross-over point.</q>
        In determining concentration, a difference spectrum is taken for
        light-absorbing components in the chain
      </li>
      <li>
        under appropriate conditions, the appearance and disappearance of EPR
        signals indicates a change in the redox state of Fe-S proteins in the
        chain
      </li>
      <li>
        assigning the proper sequence of components involved in the chain such
        that the potential energy (expressed as reduction potential,
        <i>E</i>
        <sub>0</sub>
        ′) must go from a more negative to a more positive value. The true
        <i>in vivo</i>
        potential that obtains must account for the steady-state ratio of
        oxidized and reduced forms and the microenvironmental pH
      </li>
      <li>
        disassembly and reconstitution experiments (led by D. E. Green) to show
        which component can reduce the next, if it can. These experiments used
        detergent disruption (Na cholate, digitonin, TX-100) or ultrasonication.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Coupling of Phosphorylation to Electron Transport</h3>

    <h4>Sites of Phosphorylation</h4>
    <p>
      The number of moles of ATP formed when electrons are passed to O
      <sub>2</sub>
      was first determined by Ochoa in 1941. He measured what is called the P/O
      ratio, where P is an orthophosphate and O is a single atom of O, or ½ O
      <sub>2</sub>
      . It takes 4 electrons and 4 H
      <sup>+</sup>
      to reduce one O
      <sub>2</sub>
      molecule to make 2 H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O; hence it takes 2
      <i>e</i>
      <sup>−</sup>
      to reduce one O atom. The P/O ratio can therefore by alternatively
      expressed at the ATP/2
      <i>e</i>
      <sup>−</sup>
      ratio.
    </p>
    <p>
      P/O ratio measurements in animal mitochondria with NADH as the starting
      reductant for the last 50 years have been about 3. If succinate or
      glycerol-3-phosphate is the reductant, the P/O ~ 2 in properly coupled
      mitochondria. Phosphorylation of ATP is thought of as occurring in sites
      in the chain. With a P/O ratio of 2 for succinate, it was inferred that
      one of the sites was between NADH and UQ. Confirmation of this was
      possible in that antimycin A is used to poison the chain downstream of UQ
      and then NADH and ferricyanide were added to show a chain with P/O ~ 1.
      (NADH is the normal contributor of electrons to the chain. Ferricyanide is
      the acceptor of electrons from UQH
      <sub>2</sub>
      , which otherwise accumulates as a result of chain poisoining. The
      ferricyanide/ferrocyanide couple is + 0.36 V.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Site 3 was located between cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      and oxygen in animal organelles. Ferrocytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      is prepared for loading the chain from that point; it is done by adding
      ascorbic acid in the presence of tetramethyl-
      <i>p</i>
      -phenylenediamine (ascorbic acid reduces the phenylenediamine, which in
      turn reduces the membrane-bound cytochrome. Again a P/O ~1. This was also
      true if ferrocytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      was added as a soluble component to the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross-over studies with mung bean mitochondria have shown that site 2 is
      between cytochromes
      <i>b</i>
      and
      <i>c</i>
      . The more precise location within the narrowed range is forthcoming. What
      is shown is that plant and animal mitochondria have analogous
      phosphoryaltion sites. It should be noted that the external NADH
      dehydrogenase in the plant has a P/O ratio of only 2.

      ′, then a potential drop must be &gt; =0.158 V. It can be noted that the
      potential drops from the start to the end of the phosphorylation sites is
      greater than what is needed, and they are the only places where the drop
      is greater than that value.
    </p>
    <h4>Mechanism of Phosphorylation</h4>
    <p>Three mechanisms have been proposed over the years.</p>
    <p>
      The first was the chemical-coupling hypothesis. It proposes that a high
      bond energy is formed in one of the components, which is then used to
      directly mediate the phosphorylation of ADP. It perhaps bonds with free
      phosphate, then ADP takes it via an phosphotransferase. This hypothesis
      was appealing since it resembles what occurs in substrate-level
      phosphorylation and is simple to understand. Unfortunately, this
      hypothesis has been dismissed since no postulated coupling factor has been
      found, and it is difficult to reconcile that the mitochondrial inner
      membrane must be intact and form a closed vesicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conformational-coupling hypothesis is a chemomechanical model. Energy
      from transport is conserved as a change in protein conformation in a
      reduced component. These conformational changes correlated to redox
      changes have been detected in a number of proteins, including cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      . It has been suggested furthermore that the conformational change is
      coupled to/transmitted to the F
      <sub>1</sub>
      component of the ATPase, which itself drives the phosphorylation. The
      concept of a conformational-coupling is essentially the reverse of muscle
      contraction system, wherein ATP hydrolysis induces a conformational change
      in myosin which brings about the contraction. Another reason that has been
      proposed is the change in appearance of active mitochondria (state 3) from
      the resting form (state 4): conformational changes of components of the
      inner membrane manifest themselves as changes in the gross appearance of
      the mitochondria. These explanations are not experimental results however.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third hypothesis is the chemiosmotic model, in which a high-energy
      state, and neither a high energy compound or conformation, is generated as
      an electrochemical gradient of H
      <sup>+</sup>
      across a membrane, namely electron movement is accompanied by vectorial
      translocation of protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. It is
      known that some components must take up protons in the course of
      reduction: they take them from the matrix, and upon oxidation, release
      them to the intermembrane space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculation of the proton motive force (in volts) can be done from the
      following equation:
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      proton motive force = electrical potential + H
      <sup>+</sup>
      chemical potential
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      = ΔΨ + (
      <i>−RT</i>
      ln 10 /
      <i>F</i>
      ) × ΔpH
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that ΔΨ = ~0.15 V as a result of the separation of H
      <sup>+</sup>
      and OH
      <sup>−</sup>
      across the membrane. The pH difference that accumulates across the inner
      membrane ends up being about −1.5 (negative since direction vector for the
      electrical potential and chemical potential must be same).
    </p>
    <p>
      The energy in this proton motive force is coupled to the formation of ATP
      by condensation of ADP and P. This occurs on the matrix side. There is a
      good deal of experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. One is that
      the inner membrane must be intact and form a closed vesicle, and that the
      membrane must be impermeable to H
      <sup>+</sup>
      . This has all been shown. Additionally, H
      <sup>+</sup>
      movement across the membrane has been correlated to electron flow in the
      membrane. More evidence comes from the fact that, absent any electron
      flow, pH changes can be artificially produced across the membrane which
      drive ATP synthesis.
    </p>
    <p>Criticisms of the chemiosmotic synthesis:</p>
    <p>
      (i) the point where protons move across the membrane during electron
      transport does not correlate well with the experimentally determined
      phosphorylation sites in the transport chain. There are three possible
      places where protons can transverse the membrane, each site moving 2 H
      <sup>+</sup>
      (as well as 2
      <i>e</i>
      <sup>−</sup>
      ) for a total of 6 H
      <sup>+</sup>
      moved. Three ATP are known to be synthesized (H
      <sup>+</sup>
      /P = 2): these sites are at the start and end of NADH dehydrogenase (site
      1) in which NADH is oxidized and UQ is reduced. The next possible location
      is at cytochrome oxidase, where O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is reduced (site 3). Yet no translocation is known for site 2, while there
      are two at site 1, which does not agree with the known P/O data. For this
      reason, the hypothesis considers that an unknown proton pumping component
      (maybe UQ) is occurs in the chain perhaps in between the cytochrome
      <i>b</i>
      /Fe-S complex and cytochrome
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>1</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) another criticism is that experimental evidence at this time has not
      conclusively established whether the proton gradient is an effect electron
      transport or an obligatory intermediate in driving ATP synthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite these criticisms, the evidence for the chemiosmotic theory is
      greater than for competing theories. Additional support for the
      chemiosmotic theory is in the next section.
    </p>
    <h4>Uncoupling of Oxidative Phosphorylation</h4>
    <p>
      Certain compounds (poisons) added to coupled mitochondria causes the
      mitochondria to become uncoupled. (Coupling again is describes that
      condition that if one chemical or electrical process occurs, it causes
      another to occur and where the first process does not occur, the other
      must not occur.) 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) was the first described
      (1948).
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncouplers belong to two classes. One class is the
      <i>lipid-soluble</i>
      (they usually have an aromatic ring)
      <i>proton carriers</i>
      which include 2,4-DNP. The other class include the
      <i>ionophores</i>
      , which require specific ions to be present, typically K
      <sup>+</sup>
      and Na
      <sup>+</sup>
      . Uncoupling permits electron transport to continue without connecting it
      to ADP phosphorylation; usually if no ADP is available or some other
      condition related to that, electron flow is stopped despite the high
      amount of reducing compounds (NADH, succinate) which may be present to
      contribute electrons. The manner in which uncouplers work would destroy
      the generated H
      <sup>+</sup>
      electrochemical difference across the membrane, and this absolutely gives
      support to the chemiosmotic model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncouplers like 2,4-DNP can carry a proton—they have an acidic moiety in
      their structure—across the membrane, for in their unionized form (as when
      a proton binds), they easily cross the inner membrane into the matrix
      because of their lipid solubility. Once in the matrix, they can ionize and
      the proton released works against the chemical difference which might
      exist across the membrane. Other uncouplers in this class are shown in the
      figure below.
    </p>
    <p class="center">

        src="./imagesPlantBiochemistryHTML/OxidativeUncouplers.gif"

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The ionophores were first found as antibiotics produced by species of
      <i>Streptomyces</i>
      . They form macrocyclic rings which can embed in the the lipid membrane
      and serve as a conduit for certain cations which bind to them. This flow
      of ions collapses the electrical gradient which is a part of the proton
      motive force driving ATP synthesis. Valinomycin (see figure below for
      structure) and nonactin can bind cations (they prefer K
      <sup>+</sup>
      to Na
      <sup>+</sup>
      ) at their center. With valinomycin the K
      <sup>+</sup>
      ion is coordinated octahedrally by the oxygen atoms in six properly
      positioned carbonyls. With nonactin, coordination of the metal ion is by 8
      oxygen atoms, four from carbonyls and four on heterocyclic rings. The ion,
      normally not able to permeate a lipid membrane, because of the obvious
      electric field effects, is tucked into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the
      ionophore, and moved across.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another ionophore is gramicidin A (a component of gramicidin D from B.
      brevis), and it inserts itself into the membrane to form a permeant ion
      channel in which Na
      <sup>+</sup>
      and K
      <sup>+</sup>
      can pass with equal ease.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h4>Inhibtion of Oxidative Phosphorylation</h4>
    <p>
      Inhibitors poison the chain but are not uncouplers.
      <i>Oligomycins</i>
      are antibiotics produced by certain organisms which inhibit apparently by
      binding to one of the protein components of the F
      <sub>0</sub>
      complex in the H
      <sup>+</sup>
      -ATPase. Atractylic acid comes from the rhizomes of
      <i>Atractylis gummifera</i>
      , and is a poisonous glucoside which blocks the ADP/ATP antiport in the
      membrane, essential for exchange in which ADP enters to the matrix to
      supply the ATPase with more substrate and in which the formed ATP is
      shipped to the cytosol. The oxidative phosphorylation processes stop as no
      more ADP become available for phosphorylation. Another antibiotic with the
      same action in blocking the ADP/ATP antiport is
      <i>bongkrekic acid</i>
      from
      <i>Pseudomonas cocovenenans</i>
      , which is grows on a mold itself grown from defatted coconut.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Other Uses for The High-Energy State Generated by Electron Transport
    </h4>
    <p>
      In addition to using the proton electrochemical difference to produce ATP,
      this high energy state of the mitochondria can be used in the active
      transport of ions or metabolites across their membrane and against
      concentration gradient. Certain transporter proteins, including the
      ATP/ADP antiport exchange system work passively in that movement of these
      substances across the membrane is driven by chemical potential
      differences. The electron transport chain-mediated movement of H
      <sup>+</sup>
      out of the matrix and into the intermembrane space produces both the H
      <sup>+</sup>
      chemical potential and an electrical potential difference which can
      influence the activities of particularly the
      <b>
        H
        <sub>2</sub>
        PO
        <sub>4</sub>
        <sup>−</sup>
        /OH
        <sup>−</sup>
        antiport
      </b>
      and
      <b>
        ADP
        <sup>3−</sup>
        /ATP
        <sup>4−</sup>
        antiport
      </b>
      . The ADP/ATP exchange is influenced by the electrical potential
      difference: as the intermembrane space become relatively more positive in
      charge to the matrix, the relatively more negative ATP (to ADP) is drawn
      out from the matrix where it was synthesized and into the intermembrane
      space. The P
      <sub>i</sub>
      /OH exchange, necessary to supply the matrix with more P
      <sub>i</sub>
      for ADP phosphorylation, is affected more by the H
      <sup>+</sup>
      difference: the OH
      <sup>−</sup>
      formed in the matrix is ready to combine with the H
      <sup>+</sup>
      on the outside, and this is coupled to movement of P
      <sub>i</sub>
      inward. This antiport is inhibited by agents which combine with active
      thiols groups (
      <i>N</i>
      -ethylmaleimide), indicating what is potentially present at the active
      site of the antiport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite these additional uses of H
      <sup>+</sup>
      gradient-driven activities, these compounds have sufficient chemical
      potential alone to move across the inner membrane.
    </p>
    <h2>Oxidation of Exogenous NADH</h2>
    <p>
      Plants have an external NADH dehydrogenase (with the FP
      <sub>ext</sub>
      flavoprotein) in which the transport system produces no phosphate bond
      energy. The apparent function is to permit re-formation of cytosolic NAD
      to permit metabolic processes to continue despite the lost potential
      energy. This potential energy can nonetheless be claimed if the cytosolic
      NADH avails itself one of the shuttles used to ferry reducing equivalents
      to mitochondrial matrix NAD.
    </p>
    <p>
      One such shuttle is the malate-Asp shuttle. Cytosolic and mitochondrial
      matrix
      <b>malate dehydrogenase</b>
      are NAD-dependent oxidoreductases. In the matrix and cytosol are
      <b>aspartate aminotransferases</b>
      . And in the membrane are a
      <b>malate/α-ketoglutarate antiport</b>
      and an
      <b>aspartate/glutamate antiport</b>
      . (1) The NADH in the cytosol to be
      <q>moved</q>
      into the matrix first reduces cytosolic OAA to malate. (2) The malate then
      enters the exchange system in the membrane, with α-ketoglutarate moving
      out. There is a balance of electrical charge in the exchange. (3) Malate
      is oxidized by the matrix dehydrogenase. The NADH is then oxidized by the
      internal NADH dehydrogenase at the start of the transport chain. (4) The
      OAA product of the dehydrogenation is transaminated, receiving an amine
      from glutamate. (5) The aspartate formed from the previous reaction is
      exchanged across the membrane for glutamate at the antiport. The glutamate
      will be used in the previous reaction. (6) The aspartate is subjected to
      the cytosolic transamination to re-form OAA; the substrate is
      α-ketoglutarate in the cytosol after the malate exchange described above.
      The OAA will now be used to obtain more NADH reducing equivalents. The net
      effect is movement of electrons and protons (hydride) from the cytosol
      into the matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another
      <q>shuttle</q>
      is the glycerol dehydrogenase system. An NAD-dependent
      glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is present in the cytosol and as a
      flavoprotein in the mitochondrial inner membrane on its cytosolic face.
      The cytosolic enzyme reduces DHAP using NADH, the glycerol-3P product
      moving freely through the outer membrane and toward the enzyme on the
      inner membrane. The enzyme oxidizes it, and the DHAP product moves back to
      the cytosol for additional cycling. The electrons from the dehydrogenase
      are used to reduce UQ, where the chain continues.
    </p>
    <h2>Cyanide-Resistant Respiration</h2>
    <p>
      Cyanide has already been indicated to block the electron transport chain
      by inhibiting the action of cytochrome oxidase. In animal mitochondria,
      since all electron flow to O
      <sub>2</sub>
      must occur with use of cytochrome oxidase, this means all electron flow is
      stopped. This is not the case with plant mitochondria, as O
      <sub>2</sub>
      appears to accept electrons even when mitochondria are poisoned with
      cyanide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experimental evidence indicates a branching point in the normal chain
      in which oxygen can be reduced at another point (see figure). The only
      common pathway they seem to share is the entry points at both the internal
      and external NADH dehydrogenases and at succinate dehydrogenase to where
      they meet at the UQ redox site. When the chain is inhibited by cyanide, UQ
      passes electrons to flavoprotein FP
      <i><sub>ma</sub></i>
      (Δ
      <i>E</i>
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′=+0.02&nbsp;V) which then passes them to a cyanide-resistant terminal
      oxidase. The oxidase is believed to be a nonheme Fe-containing protein
      which has no Fe-S cluster. It is inhibited by hydroxamates (
      <i>m</i>
      CLAM) which are strong metal chelators, and this inhibition can be
      countered by addition of Fe
      <sup>2+</sup>
      ; it is known that hydroxamates can not chelate iron in Fe-S proteins.
      Other work shows that this oxidase reduces the O
      <sub>2</sub>
      only to H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      rather than H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O. The peroxide product would be quickly converted by catalase.

        alt="Cyanide Resistant Pathway"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      That the branch point is from UQ is based on results showing that
      antimycin A, acting between cytochromes
      <i>b</i>
      <sub>557</sub>
      and
      <i>c</i>
      <sub>549</sub>
      , does not block cyanide-resistant respiration. Amytal, piercidin A, and
      rotenone do block CN-resistant respiration, and this inhibitors act on the
      internal NADH dehydrogenase at the Fe-S cluster. Results also show that
      matrix NADH oxidation in the presence of cyanide or antimycin A produces a
      P/O ~1, showing phosphorylation is coupled to site 1 of this electron
      transport pathway. Moreover, oxidation of succinate and cytosolic NADH
      give a P/O of near zero, indicating that the phosphorylation site is not
      between UQ and the terminal oxidase, and is in site 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      How flow is regulated through the diverse transport chains is not
      absolutely known. Some evidence indicates that it is during intense fluxes
      that the chain is used. The physiological significance of the chain is not
      known. It is unlikely that it evolved to protect plants from their own
      cyanogenic glycosides producing HCN when injured, since plant with the
      most active CN-resistant respiration produce no cyanogenic glycosides.
      There is a theory that ethylene induces active cyanide-resistant pathway
      flow during the climacteric of fruit, which shows a marked increase in
      respiration. Some germinating seeds exhibit use of the pathway during
      water imbibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the best theory is that it generates heat for thermogenic tissues.
      During flowering or inflorescence in some plants (water lily, skunk
      cabbage), the heat produced by the respiratory pathway appears to
      volatilize certain substances (amines, indoles) which produce an odor or
      gaseous material designed most likely to attract pollinating insects.
      Indeed the timing of heat production and the shedding of pollen hours
      later shows that this may be one function of this pathway. The heat is the
      waste of energy involved with the full chemical potential of NADH is not
      coupled to ATP production. The amount of heat produced is incredible, with
      as much as a 25-30° C difference from the air temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      An analogous pathway in the mitochondria of brown adipose tissue, in which
      phosphorylation is uncoupled to produce heat, is present in animals.
    </p>
    <h2>Processes Generating Substrates for Oxidative Phosphorylation</h2>

    <h3>Oxidation of Carbohydrates</h3>

    <h4>Glycolysis</h4>

    <h5>Mechanism</h5>
    <p>
      It is the process of breaking down monosaccharides to pyruvate, in which
      the monosaccharide in the plant is typically glucose (from starch or
      sucrose) or fructose (from sucrose). Glycolysis does not depend nor is
      inhibited by the presence of oxygen. The pathway is essential in
      germinating seeds and nonphotosynthetic tissues of the plant which have no
      other recourse to producing the energy necessary for cellular metabolism
      other than the potential energy stored in glucose.
    </p>
    <p>
      All glycolytic processes are considered to occur in the cytosol, despite
      the finding of phosphofructose kinase (PFK), phosphoglycerate
      phosphomutase (PGPM), enolase, and pyruvate kinase (PK) in the stroma of
      the chloroplast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -glucose and
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -fructose entering the cell are rapidly phosphorylated on the C6 carbon by
      the MgATP-dependent hexokinase. This is usually the case if those
      substances come from a sucrose source, in which an invertase hydrolyzes
      the sucrose. This is not the case if the glucose source comes from
      cellular starch breakdown, in which breakdown is by phosphorylysis to form
      glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) then altered by phosphoglucose mutase (PGM) to
      make G6P, thereby saving phosphate bond energy. From G6P to F6P by
      phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), the F6P is phosphorylated by another
      MgATP-dependent kinase, PFK. The aldolase enzyme then breaks the C-C bond
      to form dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
      (GA3P). The DHAP is converted to GA3P by triose phosphate isomerase (TPI).
    </p>
    <p>
      The two GA3P molecules are oxidized by NAD-dependent
      glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase. The product,
      1-3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-diPGA) is a high energy acyl phosphate ester,
      with bond energy of hydrolysis have Δ
      <i>G</i>
      °′= −49.3 kJ mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      . The dehydrogenase from yeast is homotetramer with subunit MW 35,000 and
      one NAD tightly bound to it. It has been indicated that NADH has very
      little affinity for the enzyme whereas it exchanges with NAD rapidly as
      the latter has an extremely high affinity. The enzyme also has thiol
      groups sensitive to alkylating agents (iodoacetamide). The thiol group is
      thought to be involved in the oxidation as intermediate forming a
      high-energy thioester which is then phosphorlyzed by inorganic phosphate
      to produce the acyl phosphate ester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formation of the acyl phosphate ester is coupled to ADP
      phosphorylation when 1,3-diPGA becomes 3-PGA. The overall Δ
      <i>G</i>
      °′= −49.3 + (+30.5) = −18.8 kJ mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      PGPM is a Mg-dependent enzyme converting 3-PGA to 2-PGA. In the presence
      of phosphate, fluoride ion inhibits the enzyme as it removes the Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      as magnesium fluorophosphate. Dehydration of 2-PGA to form
      phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) produces the highest known phosphate bond energy
      released during hydrolysis (Δ
      <i>G</i>
      °′= −61.9 kJ mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      ). Although the reaction catalyzed by the next enzyme is pyruvate kinase,
      suggesting the PEP to pyruvate formation is reversible, the free energy
      necessary is twice that for ATP hydrolysis and essentially not possible.
      For other reasons, the two ATP-dependent reactions involving HK and PFK
      are irreversible, while all other reactions are truly reversible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under aerobic conditions, glycolysis produce 2 ATP from the
      substrate-level phosphorylation, while the NADH are passed to the
      mitochondrial external NADH dehydrogenase, which produce 2 ATP per NADH.
      The total means 6 ATP per hexose if ATP is also used by HK, 7 if from
      phosphorylysis of starch. In anaerobic conditions, NADH cannot be passed
      to the mitochondria but must be oxidized by reduction of pyruvate to
      lactate. In yeast, regeneration of NAD is by a process involving the
      decarboxylation of pyruvate by the thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent
      pyruvate decarboxylase to acetaldehyde, which is reduced by alcohol
      dehydrogenase.
    </p>
    <h5>Regulation</h5>
    <p>
      The pathway is chiefly controlled by PFK, with PK also contributing. PFK
      is the ideal regulatory point since it describes the first committed step
      and a nonequilibrium reaction. It is allosteric in its control, affected
      by a number of metabolites. Among the metabolites controlling PFK are the
      phosphorylated intermediates (3-PGA, 2-PGA and PEP); adenine nucleotides
      and P
      <sub>i</sub>
      ; the starting metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway
      (6-phosphoglucuronic acid); and the molecule at the beginning of the TCA
      cycle, citric acid. There are some difference between regulation of plant
      and animal PFK—namely the effect of adenine nucleotides—but many things
      are the same. PEP, ATP (a substrate in the reaction), 6-phosphogluconic
      acid, and citric acid inhibit the enzyme; this is obvious since a high
      concentration of these compounds would indicate glycolysis is not
      necessary to produce energy. On the other hand, high P
      <sub>i</sub>
      stimulates the enzyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The allosteric regulation of PK has not been fully elucidated for the
      plant enzyme. It is inhibited by ATP and citrate, and stimulated by its
      substrate, ADP.
    </p>
    <h4>The Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle</h4>

    <h5>Mechanism</h5>
    <p>
      Pyrvate formed in glycolysis enters the mitochondria. Here it is oxidized
      by a huge multienzyme complex known as
      <b><i>pyruvate dehydrogenase</i></b>
      . The dehydrogenase complex has three discrete catalytic activities. The
      first is
      <i>pyruvate lipoamide oxidoreductase</i>
      (EC 1.2.4.1), which has a noncovalently bound
      <i>thiamine pyrophosphate</i>
      (TPP) coenzyme. This catalyzes the decarboxylation and then transfers the
      acetyl group to
      <i>lipoamide</i>
      , the transfer resulting in the reduction of lipoamide. The thiazole ring
      of TPP is temporarily carrying an acetol group during the reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second catalytic function is by
      <i>acetyl-CoA dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase</i>
      (EC 2.3.1.12). The thioester of lipoamide is carry an acetyl group, and
      this is transferred to coenzyme A to preserve the energy of the thioester.
      The products are acetyl-CoA and a dithiolic lipoamide (reduced) lipoamide.
      The lipoamide must be oxidized so that it can return to the first step of
      this multistep process, and so the third and last catalytic step of
      pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is the
      <i>FAD-specific NADH lipoamide oxidoreductase</i>
      (EC 1.6.4.3). The NADH produced from the oxidation is reoxidized by the
      internal NADH dehydrogenase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arsenite (AsO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>−</sup>
      ) is a known inhibitor as it forms an irreversible cyclic complex with the
      reduced lipoamide (see figure).

        alt="arsenite reaction"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Condensation of acetic acid with oxaloacetate is mediated by
      <b><i>citrate synthase</i></b>
      , in which the acetyl carbon attack the
      <i>si</i>
      face of OAA and assumes the 3-pro-
      <i>S</i>
      position in citrate. The citrate is then isomerized into the (2
      <i>S,</i>
      3
      <i>R</i>
      )-isocitrate (
      <i>threo</i>
      -D
      <sub>s</sub>
      -isocitrate) by the enzyme
      <b><i>aconitase</i></b>
      . An intermediate in this reaction is
      <i>cis</i>
      -aconitic acid; although the C3 of citrate is not chiral, the enzyme
      treats it as a chiral molecule. Aconitase is inhibited by fluorocitrate,
      which is interestingly present in several plants in Australia, South
      Africa, and South America and is poisonous to cattle (clearly the plant
      compartmentalizes it or it would be poisonous to the plant as well).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Isocitrate dehydrogenase</i></b>
      then converts the isocitrate to α-ketoglutaric acid in an NAD-dependent
      oxidative decarboxylation step in which oxalosuccinate is thought to be an
      intermediate. (An NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is found in the
      cytosol and mitochondria but is not involved in the TCA cycle. See
      photorespiration.) The formation of the β-keto acid oxalosuccinate can
      result in nonenzymatic decarboxylation as occurs in all β-keto acids, but
      the enzyme may in fact promote decarboxylation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <b>
        α
        <i>-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase</i>
      </b>
      also oxidatively decarboxylates its substrate, but not as a result of
      forming a β-keto acid. Rather the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is a
      complex identical in catalytic action to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex,
      as both are α-keto acids. The only difference is that succinol (not
      acetol) is bound to TPP after decarboxylation by enzyme 1 decarboxylase,
      and a succinyl (not acetyl) moiety is bound to lipoamide in enzyme 2. It
      is noted that the carbon lost is the one in the COOH of OAA prior to the
      condensation reaction. The other product is succinyl-CoA as the potential
      energy of the thioester is trapped. The enzyme is sensitive to AsO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>3−</sup>
      as is PDH complex. This step is, moreover, essentially the only
      irreversible step in the TCA cycle, thereby forcing it in one direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The succinyl-CoA thioester is then phosphorylzed by
      <b><i>succinate thiokinase</i></b>
      . The product of the reaction is succinate and ATP. Note that GTP is the
      product in animal mitochondria. This step is the only substrate-level
      phosphorylation that occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the two of the four carbons in succinate come from the acetyl-CoA
      generated in glycolysis, the distinction becomes lost when succinate is
      converted by
      <b><i>succinate dehydrogenase</i></b>
      to fumaric acid, since the enzyme cannot distinguish between the CH
      <sub>2</sub>
      COOH units. The reaction is a
      <i>trans</i>
      -elimination reaction (illustrated below), the flavoprotein
      (FAD-containing) having Fe-S clusters and couched in the inner
      mitochondrial membrane. The FADH
      <sub>2</sub>
      generated are moved into and through the chain to generate two ATPs
      molecules.
    </p>

        src="./imagesPlantBiochemistryHTML/Succinic2Malate.gif"
        alt="Metabolism from Succinic Acid to Malic Acid"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The fumarate is then hydrated by
      <b><i>fumarate hydratase</i></b>
      (not malate dehydratase) to produce
      <span class="smcap">l-</span>
      malate, not that the H
      <sup>+</sup>
      is added to the
      <i>re</i>
      face and the OH
      <sup>−</sup>
      of water added to the
      <i>si</i>
      face (see illustration below). The malate is converted to OAA by
      NAD-dependent
      <b><i>malate dehydrogenase</i></b>
      , the final enzymatic step. At equilibrium formation of malate is actually
      favored (
      <i>K</i>
      <sub>eq</sub>
      = 1.29 × 10
      <sup>-5</sup>
      ), but is nonetheless driven toward OAA formation with OAA being consumed
      by the citrate synthase reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Totaling the cycle shows a net gain of three NADH, which move through the
      chain to generate 3 ATP molecules for each electron pair, or 9 ATP total.
      Add these to the two ATP from succinate dehydrogenase, one ATP formed at
      the substrate level, with a total 12 ATP per acetyl unit consumed. In
      considering oxidation of one hexose monomer to CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      , a total of 36 ATP are produced assuming phosphorylation of the hexose.
      The efficiency can be calculated in the following manner: [36 mol ATP/mol
      glucose]*[30.5 kJ/mol ATP]*100% � [2870 kJ/mol glucose] = 38.3%
      conversion.
    </p>
    <h5>Regulation</h5>
    <p>
      The logical control point for TCA regulation is at the citrate synthase
      step, since it regulates entry into the cycle. ATP has been shown to
      produce allosteric inhibition of the enzyme. (The citrate synthase in the
      glyxosome is not inhibited by ATP however.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps a better control point is at the PDH complex. It has been
      demonstrated in potato tubers that rising levels of NADH compete with the
      NAD site to slow down formation of acetyl-CoA.
    </p>
    <h3>Oxidation of Fats (Triglycerides)</h3>
    <p>
      A 70-kg man has about 15 kg of adipose tissue in his body, enabling him to
      live on the reserve fat for 40 days of starvation without depleting the
      protein reserve a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plants generally do not use fat as a reserve fuel and do not store it,
      with triglyceride levels minimal in vegetative tissues. Fat is stored in
      the seeds of many species, however, used to support growth until
      photosynthetic processes can be started. The carbon skeleton of fat is
      used to synthesize carbohydrates, proteins, and other lipids. The ATP
      obtained to drive these processes comes from siphoning some of the energy
      in fats to move the TCA cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triglyceride catabolism requires: (a) hydrolysis of the fatty acid esters
      into fatty acids and glycerol, (b) catabolism of glycerol, and (c)
      catabolism of the fatty acids. The lipases used to perform the process in
      (a) are discussed in chap. 8, while the other two are discussed below.
    </p>
    <h4>Oxidation of Glycerol</h4>
    <p>
      The glycerol generated from hydrolysis is phosphorylated by a
      <i>glycerol kinase</i>
      to produce a
      <i>sn</i>
      -glycerol 3-phosphate. This is then oxidized at C2 by NAD-dependent
      glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to form DHAP, which is a recognizable
      metabolite in glycolysis. From that point to complete oxidation, the
      production of 21 ATP molecules is calculated (with a net 20 from the point
      of glycerol, less the one used to phosphorylate it).
    </p>
    <h4>Oxidation of Fatty Acids</h4>
    <p>
      The process involved in breaking down the long-chain hydrocarbon forming
      the fatty acid structure into two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecules is called
      the β-oxidation spiral. Another minor pathway yielding no ATP is the
      α-oxidation pathway.
    </p>
    <h5>β-Oxidation</h5>
    <p>
      All enzymes for this pathway occur in the mitochondria and in glyoxysomes.
      Fatty acids released by the action of lipase on triglycerides are first
      activated by the enzyme
      <b><i>acyl-CoA synthetase</i></b>
      to form fatty acyl-CoA esters. The reaction mechanism and net reaction are
      shown:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 5em">
      (1) R–COOH + ATP ——→ R–CO~AMP + PP
      <sub>i</sub>
      <br />
      (2) R–CO~AMP + CoA–SH ——→ R–CO~S–CoA + AMP
      <br />
      —————————————
      <br />

      R–COOH + CoA–SH + ATP ——→ R–CO~S–CoA + AMP + PP
      <sub>i</sub>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hydrolysis of PP
      <sub>i</sub>
      by pyrophosphorylase is an energy-yielding reaction which further favors
      the formation of the acyl-CoA ester. Since thioesters have greater bond
      energies than phosphoanhydrides, it is not surprising that two
      phosphoanhydride bond energies are required to produce a single thioester.
    </p>
    <p>
      With formation of the fatty acyl-CoA, β-oxidation begins at once with
      oxidation by the flavoprotein
      <b><i>acyl-CoA dehydrogenase</i></b>
      to form the
      <i>trans</i>
      -α,β-dehydrofatty acyl-CoA (
      <i>trans</i>
      -Δ
      <sup>2</sup>
      -dehydrofatty acyl-CoA). The FADH
      <sub>2</sub>
      produced as a result is then re-oxidized with its pair of electrons used
      to generate two ATP before being passed to O
      <sub>2</sub>
      . (In the glyoxysome where this reaction occurs, the electrons and protons
      are passed to O
      <sub>2</sub>
      directly to form H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      .) The second enzyme in β-oxidation,
      <b><i>enoyl-CoA hydratase</i></b>
      , adds water to the α,β-unsaturated acyl-CoA to produce
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -(+)-β-hydroxyfatty acyl-CoA. While the enzyme also hydrates the
      <i>cis</i>
      -α,β-unsaturated acyl-CoA, its product is
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -(–)-β-hydroxyfatty acyl-CoA, which can not be further manipulated because
      of its sterochemistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third step is by the NAD-dependent
      <b>
        β-
        <i>hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase</i>
      </b>
      . The NADH product from this reaction within the mitochondria produces the
      3 ATP from passing through the NADH dehydrogenase. The glyoxysomal
      dehydrogenase may or may not produce 2 or 3 ATP depending upon whether the
      NADH reducing equivalents are passed via a shuttle or use is made of the
      external NADH dehydrogenase.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth and final step of β-oxidation is cleavage by thiolysis with
      CoASH mediated by
      <b><i>acetyl-CoA acyltransferase</i></b>
      . The β-keto carbon is made nucleophilic and undergoes classical acyl
      substitution in which the CoA thiol is the nucleophile. The products are
      acetyl-CoA and a shortened (by two carbons) fatty acyl-CoA that can return
      to and be a substrate for the first enzymatic step in b-oxidation, which
      is why the β-oxidation pathway is cyclic or said to be a
      <q>spiral</q>
      because the cycle breaks down the molecule in steps of two.
    </p>
    <p>
      For fatty acids with an even number of carbons, the β-oxidation cycle will
      yield eventually all acetyl-CoA molecules. If the fatty acid is
      odd-numbered, the final step will be breakdown of a 5-carbon acyl-CoA into
      acetyl-CoA and 3-carbon propionyl-CoA; propionyl-CoA cannot be broken down
      by the enzymes in the pathway further. The 3-carbon molecule is broken
      further by the first two enzymes to form acrylyl-CoA then
      β-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, but then the thioester is hydroylzed (by
      <b>
        β-
        <i>hydroxypropionyl-CoA hydrolase</i>
      </b>
      ) to form β-hydroxypropionate, which is then oxidized by NAD-dependent
      β-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase to form malonate semialdehyde (OHC-CH
      <sub>2</sub>
      -COOH), and this product is further oxidized by the NAD-dependent
      <b><i>malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating)</i></b>
      (EC 1.2.1.18), in which CoASH is used to preserve bond energy, to form CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      and one mol acetyl-CoA. [In animals, propionyl-CoA is handled differently:
      it is first carboxylated to form (
      <i>R</i>
      )-methylmalonyl-CoA which is then converted to (
      <i>S</i>
      )-methylmalonyl-CoA by a racemase. The (
      <i>S</i>
      )-stereoisomer undergoes a rearrangment mediated by cobalamine-containing
      methylmalonyl-CoA mutase which forms succinyl-CoA, a TCA cycle
      intermediate. Plants do not synthesize cobalamine, a/k/a vitamin B
      <sub>12</sub>
      , and so do not use such a pathway.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The fate of the acetyl-CoA generated depends on whether fatty acyl-CoA
      oxidation is occurring in the mitochondria or the glyoxysome. If in the
      glyoxysome, the acetyl-CoA are condensed to form succinate which is then
      moved into the mitochondria, where it can be incorporated into the TCA
      cycle to form OAA. The OAA is then converted to PEP, which then can be
      used in gluconeogenesis (reverse glycolysis). Any NADH generated in the
      steps of the glyoxylate or TCA cycle can be used to make ATP in the
      mitochondria and restore NAD for further cycling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculating the ATP molecules generated by the complete oxidation
      <i>in mitochondria</i>
      of a fatty acid, such as palmitic acid (16 C), can be formidable. It can
      be seen that 7 cycles of β-oxidation will be necessary to break the
      even-numbered fatty acid into 8 acetyl-CoA. Each cycle generates one NADH
      (3 ATP) and one FADH
      <sub>2</sub>
      (2 ATP), giving 5 ATP each turn for a total of 35 ATP. Since each
      acetyl-CoA can be incorporated into the TCA cycle to generate 12 ATP by
      complete oxidation, they generate a total 96 ATP. This subtotals a 131
      ATP, but when two ATP are subtracted for the effective activation of the
      palmitic acid in the first step leading to oxidation, the grand total is
      129 ATP. Using the fact that the following reaction, palmitic acid + 23 O
      <sub>2</sub>
      → 16 CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      + 15 H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O has a Δ
      <i>G</i>
      °′ = −9782 kJ/mol, the efficiency of energy conversion is [129 mol ATP /
      mol palmitic acid]*[30.5 kJ/mol ATP]*100% � [9782 kJ/mol palmitic acid] =
      40.2%. For each of the steps of the β-oxidation, the Δ
      <i>G</i>
      °′ values are −20, −3.1, +15.7, and −27.8 kJ mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      , respective of their sequence, with the net Δ
      <i>G</i>
      °′ = −35.2 kJ/mol showing the overall favorability of the oxidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsaturated FAs typically have a
      <i>cis</i>
      -Δ
      <sup>9</sup>
      double bond or a system of bonds interrupted by methylenes. Two extra
      enzymes are necessary for preparing the acyl-CoA for β-oxidation. Using
      linoleic acid (18:2, Δ
      <sup>9,12</sup>
      ) as an example, there will be three β-oxidation cycles before a unique
      molecule is presented, a β,γ-unsaturated acyl-CoA. An enzyme called a
      <b>
        Δ
        <sup>3-cis</sup>
      </b>
      →
      <b>
        Δ
        <i><sup>2-</sup></i>
        <sup>trans</sup>
        <i>-enoyl-CoA isomerase</i>
      </b>
      will perform two functions: it will move the π bond to form an
      α,β-unsaturated acyl-CoA, and it will put the bond in to a
      <i>trans</i>
      -configuration. This isomerization permits b-oxidation to continue from
      the point where the α,β-unsaturated acyl-CoA would form. An additional
      turn of the b-oxidation cycle produces an α,β-unsaturated acyl-CoA, but
      the bond is
      <i>cis</i>
      instead of
      <i>trans</i>
      . The enoyl-CoA hydratase can still add water, but the result is
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -(–)-β-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which can not be affected by the next
      dehydrogenation step. The presence of
      <b>
        <span class="smcap">d</span>
        -(–)-β-
        <i>hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase</i>
      </b>
      converts it to the
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -(+) isomer, which can be processed. For each double bond in an FA, two
      fewer ATP molecules are produced since there is no need for an
      FAD-dependent dehydrogenation of a saturated group.

    <h5>α-Oxidation</h5>
    <p>
      This type of process has been identified in cotyledons of germinating
      peanuts and in leaves of pea and castor bean plants. In the peanut
      cotyledon system, the α-oxidation occurred by use of a peroxidase in which
      H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is produced, while in the pea and castor bean, an O
      <sub>2</sub>
      requirement was found instead of H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Essentially it involves oxidizing the carbon alpha to the COOH group,
      resulting in decarboxylation and formation of COOH at the α-carbon. The
      mechanism is illustrated below. An FAD-flavoprotein is involved in the
      first reaction, in which the FAD nucleus form a free radical semiquinone
      which stereospecifically removes a H hydride from the α-carbon. The
      reduced flavin then reacts with O
      <sub>2</sub>
      to form a flavinohydroperoxide (FAD-HOOH) adduct, which subsequently
      reacts with the fatty acid free radical to produce a 2-
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -hydroperoxyfatty acid. The hydroperoxy acid can then undergo an
      enzyme-mediated oxidative decarboxylation to form an aldehyde one less
      carbon, and the aldehyde is dehydrogenated to form the acid. An
      alternative to oxidative decarboxylation is reduction of the hydroperoxy
      acid to from a stable α-hydroxy fatty acid.

      The NADH produced in the dehydrogenation of the aldehyde does not appear
      to be used in ATP production, even though it is logical to expect such.
      The physiological significance of α-oxidation is discussed in Chap. 8.

    <h3>Oxidation of Amino Acids</h3>
    <p>
      Little is known about how plants degrade amino acids to use their
      potential energy elsewhere since plants usually use amino acids for growth
      and play a minor role, if any, in energy utilization, quite the opposite
      in animals.

      <q>Respiration-Like</q>
      Processes Not Linked to ATP Generation

    <h3>Photorespiration</h3>
    <p>
      This product occurs only in the light in which O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is consumed and CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      produced (hence the name photo-respiration). The action of rubisco as an
      oxygenase has been covered in chap. 5. Rather than incorporating CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      for productive carbohydrate synthesis, O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is added in which a 3-carbon PGA molecule is formed but so is a 2-carbon
      <i>phosphoglycolate</i>
      . Labeling studies using
      <sup>14</sup>
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      (the carbon is made bold in the figure) and
      <sup>18</sup>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      (the oxygen is made bold) show the following: both carbons of
      phosphoglycolate are labeled, and the labeled oxygen is found in the COOH
      group. The labeling of both carbons is reasonable in view of the rubisco
      mechanism. Once phosphoglycolate is formed in the chloroplast stroma, a
      phosphatase present in the stroma hydrolyzes the phosphate from the
      molecule to form glycolate.
    </p>
    <p class="center">

        alt="Photorespiration"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The glycolate exits the chloroplast to come into a peroxisome, generally
      adjacent to chloroplasts. In the peroxisome, O
      <sub>2</sub>
      -dependent FMN-containing
      <i>glycolate oxidase</i>
      converts glycolate to glyoxylate. Another product is H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      , which is handled quickly by catalase present in the peroxisome. Two
      transaminases present in the peroxisome, one which uses serine and the
      other glutamate in which the amine acceptor is glyoxylate in both cases,
      will convert glyoxylate to glycine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glycine formed in peroxisomes then crosses into mitochondria. Two
      molecules of Gly are consumed as in one reaction, glycine is cleaved by
      <i>glycine synthase</i>
      into NH
      <sub>3</sub>
      , CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      , and its methylene group retained by a tetrahydrofolate cofactor in the
      form
      <i>N</i>
      <sup>5,10</sup>
      -methylene THF. The reaction also requires oxidation by NAD. The other
      molecule of Gly is used to form serine directly in the reaction catalyzed
      by
      <i>serine hydroxymethyltransferase</i>
      . The enzyme requires pyridoxal phosphate, and it uses
      <i>N</i>
      <sup>5,10</sup>
      -methylene THF produced by glycine synthase to provide the extra carbon on
      the serine side chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is observed that NH
      <sub>3</sub>
      is produced in the mitochondria. While mitochondrial glutamate
      dehydrogenase could use the NH
      <sub>3</sub>
      to produce glutamate from a-ketoglutarate, its K
      <sub>m</sub>
      for NH
      <sub>4</sub>
      <sup>+</sup>
      is higher than the amount of NH
      <sub>3</sub>
      to poison mitochondrial metabolic processes. It is likely that NH
      <sub>3</sub>
      is transported to the chloroplast which contains light-activated glutamine
      synthetase and glutamate synthase, both with K
      <sub>m</sub>
      values for NH
      <sub>3</sub>
      sufficiently low enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serine formed in the mitochondria is eventually returned to form ribulose
      1,5-bisphosphate for either another photorespiratory cycle or productive
      carbon fixation. First it passes to the peroxisome, in which a
      transaminase converts it to hydroxypyruvate. The hydroxypyruvate is
      reduced by a NAD-dependent
      <b><i>hydroxypyruvate reductase</i></b>
      to form glycerate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glycerate then passes to the chloroplast. Along the way it may be
      phosphorylated by glycerate kinase (ATP-dependent) in the cytosol (the
      cytosol, in addition to the chloroplast, also has a phosphoglycerate
      phosphatase to hydrolyze the phosphate). Otherwise the chloroplast has a
      glycerate kinase. 3-PGA is the product wherever it is phosphorylated. The
      3-PGA then can move through the Calvin cycle to produce RuBP.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cycle has two parts, the first part being from RuBP to glycine which
      is irreversible physiologically as a result fo the oxidations, and the
      second part being from glycine to 3-PGA, those reactions reversible. The
      net reaction is
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      2 RuBP + 3 O
      <sub>2</sub>
      + 3 H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O — → 3 3-PGA + CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      + P
      <sub>i</sub>
    </p>
    <p>
      The formation of serine and glycine do not depend upon photorespiration
      occurring. If a high CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      ratio obtains to block photorespiratory events, then the accumulation of
      3-PGA can produce Ser and Gly in the back reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Measuring photorespiration is not an accurate process. The CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      compensation point is measured, with a lower value indicating less
      photorespiration. (The CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      compensation point is the point at which a constant CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      concentration reached when a plant is kept in a closed atmosphere under
      constant illumination, meaning CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      uptake by photosynthesis=CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      evolution from photorespiration.) C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants show a value of 40-60 ppm (atmospheric CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      = 0.03% by vol. or 300 ppm) while C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants have values &lt;10 ppm. These values indicate a very active
      photorespiration process in C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants, where C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants lose ~20-40% of fixed carbon and indicating C
      <sub>4</sub>
      plants are more efficient at this process. The major agricultural crops
      (with the exception of maize, millet, sorghum, and sugar cane) are all C
      <sub>3</sub>
      plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physiological role of photorespiration is a mystery, but it appears
      necessary since there are no plants which are free of the pathway.
      Attempts are being made to alter the catalytic properties of rubisco to
      minimize or eliminate the photorespiratory process, and perhaps explain
      why it was necessary to begin with. Use of inhibitors of glycolate oxidase
      (e.g. a-hydroxy-2-pyridinemethanesulfonate, 2-hydroxy-3-butynoic acid) are
      also being considered.
    </p>
    <h3>Microsomal Electron Transport</h3>
    <p>
      Electron transport chains are also found in ER which use O
      <sub>2</sub>
      as the terminal acceptor, but which are not coupled to phosphorylation of
      ADP. An important chain one containing a flavoprotein, cytochrome P450,
      and Fe-S protein (the latter is not certain). The flavoprotein is
      NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, which transfers electrons from NADPH to
      cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450 catalyzes hydroxylation using O
      <sub>2</sub>
      . There is &gt;1 species of cytochrome P450. The all have noncovalently
      bound protoheme Fe which coordinately binds to O
      <sub>2</sub>
      during a redox change, and they are mixed function oxidases utilizing
      protons on a co-substrate:
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      substrate + O
      <sub>2</sub>
      + co-substrate-H
      <sub>2</sub>
      ——→ substrate-OH + H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O + co-substrate (oxidized)
    </p>
    <p>
      The reducing cosubstrate is usually NADPH. The mechanism shown below is
      tentative, with evidence supporting it in parts. The cytochrome P450 is to
      facilitate cleavage of the O–O bond to create a reactive oxene
      intermediate. The bond dissociation energy for O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is quite high (Δ
      <i>H</i>
      = +493.7 kJ mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      ), but O
      <sub>2</sub>
      bound to Fe in heme makes it easy to add electrons (from NADPH) to
      polarize the bond. A proton in the environment is attracted and bond
      dissociation results in bond formation with the proton and H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O is the first product formed. The oxene now remains. Being very
      electrophilic, it reacts with bound substrate, hydroxylating it in effect.
      The hydroxylated substrate leaves behind the original P450-Fe
      <sup>3+</sup>
      before it started.

    <p>
      Among the reactions occurring in plants utilizing this system is the
      sterol demethylation process. Also a monooxygenase is used in the
      desaturation of fatty acids (see chap. 8).
    </p>
    <h3>The Oxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway</h3>
    <p>
      Sugars are broken down to smaller elements using glycolysis although an
      alternative path is found in the
      <i>hexose monophosphate shunt</i>
      of
      <i>oxidative pentose phosphate pathway</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      All enzymes in the path are cytosolic as are those of glycolysis. The
      pathway is thought of as occurring in two stages. Stage 1 is essentially
      irreversible and involves conversion of G6P to Ru5P. Ru5P then returns by
      stage 2 to the glycolytic sequence by production of F6P and GA3P.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase</i></b>
      is the first catalytic step, producing
      <span class="smcap">d-</span>
      glucono-δ-lactone 6-phosphate from glucopyranose-6-phosphate in a
      NADP-dependent dehydrogenation. The lactone is essentially unstable and
      would hydrolyze, but the hydrolytic enzyme
      <b><i>6-phosphogluconolactonase</i></b>
      is present to bring the process along more rapidly. The 6-phosphogluconic
      acid (Glcon6P) product is dehydrogenated at carbon 3 by the NADP-dependent
      <b><i>6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase</i></b>
      . The immediate product is effectively a β-keto acid and spontaneously
      decarboxylates in a fashion typical of β-keto acids; the product is
      therefore Ru5P. Stage 1 is complete with the loss of one carbon and
      production of two moles of NADPH.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stage 2 involves no energy yielding oxidative steps but merely
      isomerization and aldol-type condensations (two- and three-carbon
      transfers). Ru5P can isomerize to form Xu5P (under the aegis of
      <b><i>Ru5P 3-epimerase</i></b>
      ) or R5P (under the aegis of
      <b><i>R5P isomerase</i></b>
      ).
      <b><i>Transketolase</i></b>
      is the TPP-containing enzyme transferring a 2-carbon ketol to an acceptor
      aldehyde: hence, a two-carbon ketol is taken from the keto sugar Xu5P and
      placed on the acceptor aldehyde R5P, the products being GA3P and Su7P.
      Transaldolase abstracts a three carbon dihydroxyacetol from keto sugars
      and delivers them to an aldehyde acceptor: in this case the three carbon
      group around the ketol of Su7P is removed, the product
      erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) being formed, and delivered to GA3P as an
      acceptor, producing the 6-carbon keto sugar F6P. Transketolase can react
      again by moving a two-carbon ketol from Xu5P and adding it to E4P,
      producing GA3P and F6P. All products are either GA3P or F6P, elements of
      the glycolytic path. The reactions are summarized in the figure below.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <img

        alt="Oxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The function of this pathway is to generate NADPH for biosynthetic
      processes in the growing plant, particularly when NADPH is not actively
      produced by photosynthesis. A second purpose is to produce R5P used in
      nucleic acid synthesis. In plants especially, a third purpose is to
      produce E4P for the shikimic acid synthesis, a precursor to producing
      aromatic rings. Note the path to the pentose phosphates can be one in
      which NADPH is generated if it is needed, or one via the reversibility of
      the stage 2 steps. The NADPH produced is generally not employed in
      oxidative phoshphorylation of ADP, but rather directly involved with
      reductive biosynthetic steps.

    <h1>Chapter 7 Carbohydrate Biosynthesis</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Two classes of polysaccharides in plants: storage (e.g., starch,
      fructosans) and structural (e.g., cellulose, pectins). These are made from
      the carbon fixed in Calvin cycle and presented from the cycle in the form
      of F6P. A clear example of the changes in sugar occur in the chloroplast
      during the day when the F6P produced is converted to starch within the
      organelle, then exported later as sucrose during the next dark period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Permanent stores of polysaccharides are found in seeds and vegetative
      propagatory structures (stem tubers, corms, bulbs). These supply the
      immature, growing plant emerging from germination with the fixed carbon
      and energy in its growth and development. Carbohydrate (CHO) synthesis is
      similar in young germinating plants and mature photosynthetically active
      plants. Sucrose is moved to the actively mitotic meristem for both energy
      and cell wall construction. This sucrose is obtained from the
      polysaccharide reserve in the seed stores, which is broken down to produce
      the monomers used to make the transport form of sugar (sucrose). In the
      majority of cases, the polysaccharide is starch, but certain plant
      families (members of Compositae, Campanulaceae, Graminae) store fructosans
      for this purpose. Still other seeds store their energy as fat (lipid),
      utilizing a metabolic pathway permitting conversion to glucose by
      gluconeogenesis and a system which routes acetyl-CoA past the
      decarboxylating steps of Krebs cycle. The glucose is easily converted to
      sucrose as in other plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the experimental work done to reveal what is now known utilized
      <sup>14</sup>
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      in ascertaining how CHO is moved in the plant. From studies of tobacco, it
      was shown that a young leaf keeps nearly all the fixed carbon within the
      leaf itself. When about half grown, it begins to export the fixed carbon
      to other plant structures (as sucrose). When fully expanded, half of the
      fixed carbon is moved to other tissues (largely stems and roots), while
      the other half is kept as reserve in the leaf (as starch and sugar). Less
      than 2% of the carbon is moved to and utilized by other leaves, which are
      above and on the same side of the stem as the treated leaf. Only ~0.1% of
      the carbon reaches the apical meristem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tobacco is dicotyledenous, but similar experiments with monocots (rice,
      rye, barley) show a similar distribution of the labeled carbon. One
      significant difference was that lower leaves stopped supplying the upper
      leaves after emergence of the ears. The large amount of carbon used to
      make the starch in the grains of the ear comes from the ear itself and the
      topmost leaves and sheaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt about the transport form, since the labeled carbon in
      sieve tubes is found primarily to be in sucrose. Indeed, growing plants
      supplemented with sucrose grow faster.
    </p>
    <h2>Biosynthesis of Carbohydrates</h2>

    <h3>Synthesis from Carbon Dioxide</h3>
    <p>
      The incorporation of CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      into all plants via rubisco in the chloroplast stroma as the first step in
      the Calvin cycle is thorough addressed in Chap. 5. All plants use CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      as the molecule in the rubisco reaction. Some plant groups muster their CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      via an intermediate pathway which transports CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      in the form of a C
      <sub>4</sub>
      acid (the C
      <sub>4</sub>
      pathway) across cells to the chloroplast of the cells with active Calvin
      cycles. These utilize the enzyme PEP carboxylase which incorporates HCO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>−</sup>
      rather than CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      directly to form OAA.
    </p>
    <h3>Synthesis by Gluconeogenesis</h3>
    <p>
      The fat stored in the endosperm of some seeds (e.g., castor bean,
      <i>Ricinus communis</i>
      ) is broken down as aleurone cells enveloping the endosperm produce the
      enzymes which are secreted into the fat to mobilize it. Cells of the
      endosperm have a large number of spherosomes (fat storage bodies). The
      single membrane glyoxysomes develop and the enzymes made by them are
      largely the link producing glucose from fat. A lipase with acidic optimum
      is associated on the inner surface of the spherosome membrane, producing
      fatty acids, glycerol, and monoglycerides. These pass to a
      alkaline-optimal lipase in the glyoxysome hydrolyzes the monoglycerides.
      Glycerol is then treated in the cytosol by a
      <i>glycerol kinase</i>
      and
      <i>
        <b>sn</b>
        -glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
      </i>
      in that order to produce DHAP. Its path to glucose is easily traced back
      up the glycolytic pathway. In the glyoxysome, the free fatty acids are
      first activated by acyl-CoA synthetases to produce fatty acyl-CoA, which
      are then degraded by β-oxidation to acetyl-CoA. (It should be noted that
      β-oxidation of fatty acyl CoA in animal cells—which have no glyoxysomes—is
      done in the mitochondria.) The acetyl-CoA is converted to succinate unique
      catalytic activities in the glyoxysome. Succinate then leaves the
      organelle and enters the mitochondrial as the TCA cycle enzymes convert it
      to OAA via fumarate and malate (the glyoxysome has no succinate
      dehydrogenase or malate dehydrogenase). OAA is then converted by
      <i>PEP carboxykinase</i>
      to PEP; its subcellular location is not known. PEP is then converted to
      G1P in a modifed reverse of glycolysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      When ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD ratios are high in the energy-abundant cell,
      nearly all steps but the phosphofructokinase step in glycolysis can be
      freely reversed starting with PEP and proceeding to G1P. This high amount
      of ATP and NADH results from the β-oxidation of endosperm fat, ATP being
      produced by oxidative phosphorylation of some of the NADH and all of the
      FADH
      <sub>2</sub>
      (from fat acyl and succinate dehydrogenation). The total breakdown of fat
      also supplies energy for OAA to sucrose synthesis in endosperm breakdown.
      The PFK step is reversed in glycolysis by a simple hydrolysis of the
      1-phosphate of FBP using FBP phosphatase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since glycolysis and gluconeogenesis appear to be the reverse of one
      another, how does the cell regulate which direction is to be taken? One
      solution is to compartmentalize the metabolic paths, with enzymes
      collected in one area (in one organelle?) committed to glycolysis (PFK,
      but no FBP phosphatase), and enzymes of the opposite direction in another.
      The other way of regulating, and the one utilized in plant and animal
      cells, is to control the key steps of the pathway: PFK, pyruvate kinase,
      and FBP phosphatase. These enzymes are actually multimeric and are
      allosteric in regulation (a typical feature of catalytic control in
      multimeric enzymes). PFK and PK are inhibited by ATP while high ATP levels
      activate FBP phosphatase. Other controls come into play with P
      <sub>i</sub>
      , ADP, and AMP shown to stimulate PFK and PK activities as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      With germinating castor beans, it is not known which of the two possible
      controls are working. It is suggested glycolytic enzymes are in the
      cytosol while gluconeogenetic enzymes are in the plastids. Competing with
      this regulation-by-compartmentation is also evidence of allosteric
      regulation of the key activities. PFK is inhibited by high [ATP], [PEP],
      and [citrate] and activated by high [P
      <sub>i</sub>
      ] and sometimes [F6P] (its substrate). PK is inhibited by high [ATP] and
      [citrate] and activated by [P
      <sub>i</sub>
      ] or [ADP]. FBP phosphatase is inhibited by [AMP]. Energy to the rest of
      the seedling is delivered in the form of sucrose to the tissues requiring,
      synthesis in the endosperm cells from G1P.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amino acids also provide the carbon skeleton for gluconeogenesis. In the
      mitochondria alanine can transaminate to pyruvate, which can be converted
      to malate via the NAD-malic enzyme. (It will be recalled that NAD-malic
      enzyme is used to recover CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      for carbon fixation in plants using the C
      <sub>4</sub>
      pathway; the reaction of the enzyme is reversible though.) From malate the
      path continues to OAA, which is converted to G1P according to the path
      already described. Transamination of Glu can also produce aKG, which via
      TCA cycle steps can produce OAA as well, and then on to G1P. It is not
      believed that gluconeogenesis from amino acids has physiological
      significance for plants.
    </p>
    <h3>Monosaccharide Derivatives and Interconversions</h3>
    <p>
      While glucose is the central sugar around which many metabolic paths
      converge, many other sugars are vital, especially the large array of
      sugars used as structural polysaccharides in the plant.
    </p>
    <h4>Formation of monosaccharide derivatives</h4>

    <h5>Monosaccharide phosphates</h5>
    <p>
      In metabolism characteristic of a plant, the free (unphosphorylated) sugar
      is often produced, such as in starch breakdown or sucrose utilization.
      Typically the monosaccharides produced from simple hydrolysis of complex
      polysaccharides (even intracellular storage sugars) can not be
      metabolically utilized unless
      <q>activated</q>
      by phosphorylation. Kinases of narrow and broad specificity are present to
      transfer phosphate (from ATP) usually to a primary alcohol group on the
      sugar. Some exceptions:
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -arabinose,
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -glucuronic acid (C6 is COOH), and
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -galacturonic acid (C6 is COOH), the cyclic forms being phosphorylated at
      the 1-carbon directly. Ketosugars have two primary alcohol groups, but
      both ketopentofuranoses and ketohexopyranoses (the cyclic forms of
      ketopentoses and ketohexoses, resp.) are only phosphorylated on the
      highest numbered carbon (either C5 or C6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hexokinase is a kinase of very broad specificity, able to phosphorylate
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -glucose,
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -fructose,
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -mannose, and
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -glucosamine. It has an absolute specificity for the donor phosphate
      group, ATP (not GTP or others). Other kinases of single substrate
      specificity are named accordingly:
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -glucuronokinase,
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -galactokinase,
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -galacturonokinase,
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -xylulokinase,
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -arabokinase and
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -fructokinase. Other kinases which phosphorylate already phosphorylated
      substrates include phosphofructokinase and phosphoribulokinase. All
      kinases are activated by Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      .

    <h5>Nucleoside diphosphate monosaccharides</h5>
    <p>
      Very commonly found are the NDP sugars, the NDP moiety being UDP, CDP,
      ADP, or GDP, with the sugar moiety being a monosaccharide or its uronic
      acid form. These intermediates are generally involved in biosynthetic
      processes such as monosaccharide interconversions or oligo- and
      polysaccharide synthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Synthesis of the NDP sugar generally is from the transesterification of
      NTP with the 1-phosphate:
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      glycose-1-P +
      <b>PP</b>
      P-R-N ↔ NDP-sugar +
      <b>PP</b>
      <sub>i</sub>
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that the phosphates in boldface type form the
      pyrophosphate product. The format for naming these enzymes is
      NTP:glycose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase, such as
      UTP:glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. The enzymes are also named in
      accordance with the back reaction: UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. The K
      <sub>eq</sub>
      is about unity, although the reaction favors NDP-sugar formation as the
      hydrolysis of PP
      <sub>i</sub>
      by pyrophosphatase is strongly exergonic. Why NDP-sugars form is largely
      because they are higher energy glycosyl donors than either G1P or G6P and
      are suitable for biosynthetic reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      NDP-sugars can be phosphorolyzed by a number of enzymes found in plant
      tissues. A wheat germ enzyme has been found which phosphorolyzes
      ADP-glucose into ADP and G1P in an irreversible reaction. The phosphate
      incorporates into the nucleotide:
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      A-R-P-P-G + P
      <sub>i</sub>
      * → A-R-P-P* + G1P
    </p>
    <p>
      This enzyme is also active on ADP-mannose and somewhat effective on other
      ADP-sugars. It does not phosphorolyze UDP-glucose or GDP-mannose. (In
      yeast, a phosphorolyzing enzyme has been found for GDP-mannose and
      UDP-glucose.)
    </p>
    <h5>Glycosides</h5>
    <p>
      In addition to forming larger molecules with nucleotides, the anomeric
      carbon of sugars (C1 of aldoses, C2 of ketoses) can bond to molecules
      which are nucleophilic to the C1 carbon. This results in nucleophilic
      substitution of the C1 hydroxyl. The nucleophiles are largely ones bearing
      O atoms, forming
      <i>O</i>
      -glycosides. In some cases, N atoms are good nucleophiles,&nbsp;S atoms
      may be involved, and a carbanion may attack nucleophilically to form
      <i>N</i>
      -,
      <i>S</i>
      -, and
      <i>C</i>
      -glycosides respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glycone portion is usu. glucose in plants, and in other cases is the
      uronic acid of the monosaccharide (glucuronic acid). In some cases, the
      glycone is an oligosaccharide with each sugar having a glycosidic linkage
      with a nonsugar. In other cases, more than one monosaccharide may be
      linked to an aglycone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function of some plant glycosides is not well-known, although they
      certainly have an effect in animals, and are especially used in medicines
      (e.g., digitonin). Two important groups in plants are the cyanogenic
      glycosides and the glucosinolates (mustard oil glucosides). Amygdalin is a
      cyanogenic glycoside with structure of glucose(β1→6)glucose(O-β-CH(CN)-C
      <sub>6</sub>
      H
      <sub>4</sub>
      OH; it is found in seeds of many plants (e.g.,
      <i>Prunus amygdalus</i>
      ). Cyanogenic glycosides have a general structure of:
    </p>
    <p class="center">mono (or oligo-)saccharide–O–CR(CN)–R′</p>
    <p>
      The cyanogenic aglycone is derived from the oxidation of an amino acid.
      The biosynthesis of dhurrin from tyrosine is shown below.
    </p>

        alt="Cyanogenic Glycoside Synthesis by UDPG: Biosynthesis of Dhurrin"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakdown of cyanogenic glycosides is illustrated by the following
      process. First is the hydrolysis of the glycosyl moiety, forming the
      cyanohydrin. An elimination to the carbonyl releases the strong base
      cyanide ion which can combine with a proton to form the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glucosinolates</b>
      are produced by some plant of the Cruciferae, Capparidaceae, Moringaceae,
      Resedaceae, Euphorbaceae, Phytolaccaceae, and Tropaeolaceae. Rubbing
      leaves of the plants induces the smell of mustard oil as enzymes degrade
      the compounds. The general structure is:

    </p>
    <p>
      R usually corresponds to the side chain derived from some amino acid,
      while X
      <sup>+</sup>
      is a typical cation (K
      <sup>+</sup>
      ). Biosynthesis of one mustard oil precursor has been shown but the
      details are sketchy. The conversion into the mustard oil is the work of a
      hydrolase
      <i>thioglucosidase</i>
      . Mustard oils are isothiocyanates. They can also be converted to
      thiocyanates by isomerizing enzymes in some plants.

    </p>
    <h4>Monosaccharide interconversions</h4>
    <p>
      Interconversions of monosaccharides can be described in terms of (i)
      internal rearrangements, (ii) transfers of 2- and 3-carbon units, and
      (iii) oxidation-reduction reactions.
    </p>
    <h5>Internal rearrangements</h5>
    <p>There are generally three kinds of internal rearrangements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Mutation</b>
      . These reactions are completed by the
      <i>mutases</i>
      , enzymes moving a phosphate from one carbon to another, such as
      <i>phosphoglucomutase</i>
      which catalyzes interconversion of G6P to G1P (it is freely reversible.).
      At 30° and at equilibrium, the reaction mixture has 95% G6P. G6P is a
      simple phosphate ester whereas G1P is an acetal of phosphoric acid, and
      this formation would be considered less stable (higher energy). An
      intermediate cofactor of G-1,6-dP has been identified specifically for
      PGM. Moreover, the reaction involves an intermediate phosphorylation state
      of the enzyme: a Ser residue at the active site is phosphorylated and can
      transfer this phosphate to either the C6 or C1 carbons of glucose. The
      enzyme is not stably phosphorylated and requires G-1,6-dP to maintain this
      state. (G-1,6-dP is produced by a
      <i>phosphoglucokinase</i>
      .)
    </p>
    <p>
      Phosphates of the aldosugars ribose, mannose, and galactose also have
      specific mutases, in which the mutases also require catalytic amounts of
      the bisphosphate forms. In each case the terminal phosphate (G6P, M6P,
      R5P) is transferred to the C1 carbon usually of the cyclic form of the
      sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Epimerization</b>
      . These reactions involve inversion of the configurations about the chiral
      centers in the carbon chain of the sugar. The enzymes catalyzing the
      reaction are called epimerases. Some use the monophosphate sugar as a
      substrate, others the UDP-sugar derivatives. Ru5P 3-epimerase is one
      epimerase using the sugar phosphate and is used in the Calvin cycle and
      the pentose phosphate pathway. Among the UDP-sugar epimerases are
      UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, UDP-arabinose 4-epimerase, and UDP-glucuronate
      4-epimerase, which ultimately produce galactose, xylose, and galacturonic
      acid, resp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The catalytic mechanism of epimerization seems to involve reversible
      oxidation-reduction. Tightly bound NAD is found at the active site, and a
      polyhydroxyketone intermediate is present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Isomerization</b>
      (Aldose to ketose conversions). The substrates of the isomerase are
      typically monosaccharides with their primary hydroxyl groups
      phosphorylated. G6P isomerase, R5P isomerase, and triose phosphate
      isomerase are widespread in the tissues of plants. The mechanism involves
      and enediol intermediate. Studies with
      <sup>2</sup>
      H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O show that the label incorporating to the C1 of F6P, clearly supporting
      the use of an enediol mechanism.

      Transfer of C
      <sub>2</sub>
      and C
      <sub>3</sub>
      units
    </h5>
    <p>
      Two enzymes are indispensable in the biochemical pathways of the plant,
      transketolase and transaldolase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Transketolase</b>
      . It catalyzes the transfer of a two carbon
      <i>ketol</i>
      function (CH
      <sub>2</sub>
      OH‑CO‑) from a ketosugar donor to an aldosugar acceptor. The donor
      ketosugar will become an aldosugar two carbons shorter, the acceptor
      aldosugar a keto sugar with two carbons more. The donor ketose must be a
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -sugar with a 3
      <i>S</i>
      ,4
      <i>R</i>
      (
      <i>threo</i>
      ) configuration, and the ketose product will also have the same
      configuration. The enzyme requires thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      , in which the former actually carries the ketol group from sugar to
      sugar. Among the acceptable ketol donors are Xu5P, F6P, and Su7P. Among
      the donors are R5P, GA3P, and E4P.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Transaldolase</b>
      . This enzyme moves a 3-carbon dihydroxyacetone group (CH
      <sub>2</sub>
      OH-CO-CHOH-) from a ketose donor to an aldose acceptor. The products are
      an aldose 3 carbons fewer and a ketose three carbons higher. The donor
      ketose must have a 3
      <i>S</i>
      ,4
      <i>R</i>
      (
      <i>threo</i>
      ) configuration; the product ketose will have the same configuration. The
      catalytic intermediate is believed to involve formation of a Schiff's base
      between a Lys of the enzyme and the C=O group of the ketose. Transaldolase
      is inactive toward dihydroxyacetone or any of its phosphates. Typical
      substrate ketoses are F6P and Su7P, and acceptors include E4P, GA3P, and
      R5P. Aldolase (of the glycolytic cycle) is a special case in which GA3P is
      combined with DHAP to form FBP, or the back reaction applies; the
      mechanism is known to be the same as with transaldolase.
    </p>
    <h5>Oxido-reduction reactions</h5>
    <p>
      <b>Aldonic acids</b>
      are the monosaccharides oxidized at the C1 carbon to the acid, while
      <b>alduronic acids</b>
      are the sugars oxidized at C6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>G6P dehydrogenase</i>
      is the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway, converting G6P to the
      gluconolactone form of the acid. It is a NADP-dependent enzyme which
      removes the hydride from C1, and the incipient carbonium is stabilized by
      loss of the proton off the hydroxyl to form the carbonyl. The product
      hydrolyzes spontaneously but a hydrolase (gluconolactonase) is present to
      speed things along.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>UDP-glucose dehydrogenase</i>
      is a NAD-dependent enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of the primary alcohol
      at the C6 of glucose into the acid. The mechanism proceeds in 4 steps: (i)
      conversion of the C6 -CH
      <sub>2</sub>
      OH to the aldehyde (-CH=O), in which the pro-
      <i>R</i>
      hydride in the group is abstracted by NAD with proton loss from the oxygen
      to stabilize the incipient carbocation; (ii) a reaction of the formed
      aldehyde with a sulfhydryl (-SH) group at the active site to form a
      hemithioacetal; (iii) a second dehydrogenation brought about by NAD again
      leaving a thioacyl product; (iv) hydrolysis of the thioacyl enzyme-product
      to release the UDP-glucuronic acid. It is the fourth step which gives
      irreversibility to the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glucuronic acid can be made by another route in plants as well. The first
      is the conversion of G6P to myo-inositol by the NAD-dependent
      <i>G6P cycloaldolase</i>
      . A suggested mechanism of the action of the enzyme is given below, in
      which a hydride must be removed from C5 of G6P. The NADH produced in this
      enzyme is not freely exchangeable (it is tightly bound). The intermediate
      is 5-ketoglucose 6-phosphate: its formation leads to an internal aldol
      condensation reaction to form
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -
      <i>myo</i>
      -inose-2 1-phosphate, which is then reduced by the enzyme-bound NADH to
      myo-inositol 1-phosphate. Both the intermediate and NAD cofactor never
      leave the enzyme during these multi-step reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      With formation of the product inositol phosphate, the product is
      hydrolyzed by a specific phosphatase to produce myo-inositol. This is then
      converted to glucuronic acid by myo-
      <i>inositol</i>
      <i>oxygenase</i>
      , an enzyme found in higher plants and yeast. The exact mechanism is not
      known: clearly there is a breaking of C–C bonds combined with use of O
      <sub>2</sub>
      and formation of a product H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O, suggesting a mixed-function oxidase at work. The physiological role for
      formation of glucuronic acid by this pathway is not understood. One clear
      difference is that the other pathway (via UDPG) produces a net reduction
      of NAD, and this one does not, which may be the reason for this pathway.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Biosynthesis of
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -ascorbic acid
    </h4>
    <p>
      Plants produce a large number of
      <b>polyhydroxy alcohols</b>
      , or
      <b>polyols</b>
      , from the reduction of the carbonyl of sugars (both ketoses and aldoses)
      essentially to form sugar alcohols. The most common are
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -mannitol and
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -glucitol (called sorbitol, and produced from either fructose or glucose).
      Glucitol is found in a large number of plants from algae to
      spermatophytes. Mannitol is generally found in plant exudates (unlike
      glucitol) and in brown seaweeds. The lichens have those and other
      alcohols, including ribitol, arabitol, and glycerol. These are all likely
      produced by NAD(P)H-specific reductases which reduce the carbonyl group of
      the appropriate sugar monosaccharide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascorbic acid is also produced from the use of these reductases. All
      animals except for man and other primates, the guinea pig, the red vented
      bubul, and the Indian fruit bat can produce
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -ascorbic acid within their bodies. They do it by reducing glucuronic acid
      to gulonic acid via NADH-specific
      <i>glucuronate reductase</i>
      , which reduces the C1 aldehyde to a primary alcohol.. The molecule is now
      cyclized by the dehydrating (condensing) action of
      <i>aldolactonase</i>
      to from
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -gulono-γ-lactone; this esterifies the C4 hydroxy group (of the
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -gulonic acid) to the C1 COOH group. It should be noted that the labeling
      of carbons has become reversed with the indication of the
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -gulonic acid diastereomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lactone is now oxidized by
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -
      <i>gulonolactone oxidase</i>
      , which uses O
      <sub>2</sub>
      in the reaction and is not a simple dehydrogenase in that it produces H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      ; the C3 carbon becomes carbonyl (a keto form). This essentially forms
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -ascorbic acid, since the tautomer of the product is a more stable enediol
      in which the C=C bond is between C2 and C3. It is the gulonolactone
      oxidase that is not present in the nonproducers of ascorbic acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plants have an ability to produce ascorbic acid not only by the route just
      illustrated, but also from
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -galacturonic acid. An NADH-specific reductase can reduce galacturonic
      acid to
      <span class="smcap">l</span>
      -galactonic acid, which can form the γ-lactone by a specific
      aldolactonase. The resulting γ-lactone of galactonic acid is then a much
      better substrate for the oxidase producing ascorbic acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiments in another lab suggest plant ascorbic acid may not be produced
      (principally) by the routes just described. Loewus and coworkers
      admininstering [6-
      <sup>3</sup>
      H]glucose to plants have found a [6-
      <sup>3</sup>
      H]ascorbic acid product. This would indicate that no oxidation of C6 of
      the sugar is seen during biosynthesis, a requirement for either of the
      pathways above. It also indicates no reversal of the carbon skeleton. Any
      ascorbic acid synthesis by the routes above may be incidental.
    </p>
    <h2>Biosynthesis of Oligosaccharides</h2>

    <h3>Disaccharides</h3>

    <h4>Sucrose</h4>
    <p>
      The most widely found disaccharide in nature. The energy and fixed carbon
      is translocated in this form from photosynthetic to nonphotosynthetic
      tissue. The synonym is α-
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -glucopyranosyl-β-fructofuranoside , with linkage α1 β2. Sucrose has no
      free reducing end (so will not react with Benedict's or Fehling's). It is
      essentially a glucoside, with pyranosyl fructose attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Synthesis is by one of two routes.
      <i>Sucrose synthase</i>
      can utilize UDPG, ADPG, or GDPG in producing sucrose, but is not likely
      the main biosynthetic route.
      <i>Sucrose phosphate synthase</i>
      , although it uses only UDPG, is most likely the route since the
      equilibrium favors sucrose formation overall. The reactions of the two

    <h4>The Glyoxylate Cycle</h4>
    <p>
      For those organisms capable of this metabolic pathway, they are able to
      bring about the net conversion of fats into carbohydrates. Animals cannot
      convert the fat which they break down into two carbon acetyl-CoA units
      back into glucose, even though the fat may have been produced from
      glucose. There is no way for the carbons of acetyl-CoA to proceed in a
      manner which brings about the net production of glucose. With the
      glyoxylate cycle it is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glyoxylate cycle occurs in bacteria, algae, and
      <i>certain</i>
      tissues of the seeds of higher plants
      <i>during germination</i>
      . As already stated, it is not present at all in animals, nor is it in the
      vegetative tissues (leaf, stem, root) or the
      <i>developing</i>
      seed of the higher plant. The dependence on this cycle of plants which
      produce fat-storing seeds is especially critical: the glucose produced
      from fat is not intended to be used in production of energy, for it is
      essentially a waste of energy to do so; rather the glucose is instead used
      to build the cell wall structural polysaccharides during germination until
      the young plant can begin producing glucose via photosynthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the fat-storing seeds are dicotyledonous, with the fat stored in
      the cells of the cotyledons. Examples of plants storing fat in the
      cotyledons are sunflower (
      <i>Helianthus annus</i>
      ), rape (
      <i>Brassica napus</i>
      ), abyssinian kale (
      <i>Crambe abysinica</i>
      ), and peanuts (
      <i>Arachis hypogaea</i>
      ). The castor bean (
      <i>Ricinus communis</i>
      ) stores it in its endosperm. Inside the cells, the fat is stored in
      membrane-bound spherosomes distributed throughout the cytoplasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      When germination begins, another organelle, the
      <b>glyoxysome</b>
      , begins to appear in large numbers. It contains all the enzymes of the
      glyxoylate cycle. Glyoxysomes disappear completely when the fat reserve
      has been depleted. Glyoxysomes are also present in plants which do not
      store the typical triglyceride fat for their energy reserve. In the
      cotyledons of the jojoba (
      <i>Simmondsia chinesis</i>
      ) are wax bodies similar to spherosomes, which store wax esters. Wax
      esters are combinations of fatty acids and fatty alcohols, and a lipase
      with alkaline pH optimum attaches to the body membrane, producing the
      components for the glyoxylate cycle. Some cereal seeds (including barley,
      <i>Hordeum distichon</i>
      , and wheat,
      <i>Triticum vulgare</i>
      ) also have glyoxysomes present during germination, although their
      endosperm is largely starch. However, around the aleurone layer in that
      part of the endosperm far from the scutellum is the highest proportion of
      seed lipid. What is interesting is that it has been shown in these plants
      that gibberellin induces the formation of glyoxysomes in these embryos,
      and all the fat appears to be converted to carbohydrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the glyoxylate cycle begins, the fats must be converted either to
      free fatty acids or monoglycerides, the substances which enter the
      glyoxysome. In germinating castor beans, a membrane-bound
      monoglyceride-specific lipase with alkaline pH optimum hydrolyzes the
      monoglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol is not
      handled within the glyoxysome, but is used in the cytosol to produce
      glucose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the glyoxysome, free fatty acids are converted into their CoA
      derivatives by acyl-CoA synthetases. Breakdown into two-carbon acetyl-CoA
      units then proceeds according to the steps of the β-oxidation spiral.
      Certain unsaturated fatty acids require extra enzymes, such as Δ
      <sup>
        3-
        <i>cis</i>
      </sup>
      Δ
      <sup>
        2-
        <i>trans</i>
      </sup>
      -enoyl-CoA isomerase and
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -(–)-3-hydroxylacyl-CoA epimerase to move the double bond and to change
      configuration of a hydroxyl group about a chiral center, resp. Other
      enzymes are unique to certain plants having unusual fatty acids in their
      system: ricinoleic acid (
      <i>cis</i>
      -Δ
      <sup>9</sup>
      -12-
      <span class="smcap">d</span>
      -(–)-hydroxy-18:1) is the most abundant fatty acid in castor bean
      endosperm and cannot be handled by the β-oxidation enzymes alone. The
      acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-CoA hydratase appear to be loosely bound
      to the inner surface of the glyoxysome membrane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acetyl-CoA formed now enters the cycle. The first two reactions are
      identical with the first two steps of the TCA cycle: formation of citrate
      by a condensation of OAA and acetyl-CoA using
      <i>citrate synthase</i>
      , then isomerization to form isocitrate (2S,3R-isocitrate) by the enzyme
      <i>aconitase</i>
      . The next reaction is unique to the glyoxylate cycle. Catalyzed by
      <b><i>isocitrate lyase</i></b>
      , it involves the cleavage of the C2-C3 bond, forming glyoxylate and
      succinate. Glyoxylate then reacts with acetyl-CoA to form malate in a
      reaction catalyzed by
      <b><i>malate synthase</i></b>
      , also unique to the glyoxylate cycle. Malate is then oxidized to produce
      OAA, a reaction also found in the TCA cycle. This OAA is essentially a
      regeneration of the starting material of the cycle. The net product is
      succinate formed from the use of two acetyl-CoA molecules.
    </p>

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Succinate must exit the glyoxysome since the organelle does not have the
      necessary enzymes to continue to process of building glucose from
      succinate. Succinate would necessarily enter the mitochondria to be
      converted by succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase (fumarate hydratase), and
      malate dehydrogenase to OAA. The OAA would then be converted to PEP by PEP
      carboxykinase, and gluconeogenesis continues to glucose from PEP in
      reactions already described (essentially the reverse of glycolysis).

    <p>
      The five enzymatic activities described have Δ
      <i>G</i>
      °' values of given in the table below. The net value is −32.6 kJ mol
      <sup>-1</sup>
      for the entire cycle, the thermodynamic favorability coming from the
      breaking of the high energy thioester CoA derivatives.

    <p>
      In addition to succinate, a net production of NADH and FADH
      <sub>2</sub>
      occurs as a result of the operation of both the β-oxidation and glyoxylate
      cycles. Note particularly the production of NADH from the malate
      dehydrogenase step in the glyoxysome. The glyoxysome has no electron
      transport chain unlike the mitochondria. It is believed that FAD is
      regenerated by the reoxidation of FADH
      <sub>2</sub>
      in which O
      <sub>2</sub>
      is involved. This produces H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>2</sub>
      , which is then converted to O
      <sub>2</sub>
      and H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O by catalase. The NADH appears not to be reoxidized in the glyoxysome,
      but probably reoxidized by the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase. The
      question as to which NADH dehydrogenase is unknown. Some suggest a shuttle
      involving transaminases (serine-glyoxylate transaminase,
      glutamate-glyoxylate transaminase) present in glyoxysomes and mitochondria
      may help move the reducing equivalents into the mitochondria.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be seen why fat can be converted to carbohydrate by this cycle.
      Note that the next three TCA cycle steps after isocitrate formation will
      produce succinate, but two of those involve oxidations which produce two
      CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      . Hence the two carbons put into the cycle when acetyl-CoA enters are
      effectively lost during these oxidations. They cannot be used to achieve
      net synthesis of glucose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In bacteria, the enzymes of the TCA and glyoxylate cycles are not
      compartmentalized as in the eukaryotic plants. This requires allosteric
      regulation of the activities of these enzymes. Bacterial isocitrate lyase
      is strongly inhibited by PEP.

    <h1>Chapter 9 Nitrogen Fixation, Amino Acid Biosynthesis and Proteins</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This concerns the fixation of nitrogen: which is the chemical conversion
      of dinitrogen (N
      <sub>2</sub>
      ) from the atmosphere into a biologically useful form of nitrogen,
      typically reduced nitrogen. The higher plants have no ability themselves,
      meaning they do not code in their genome the enzymes for nitrogen
      fixation. Instead many, but not all, plants form a close collaboration
      with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that can perform this feat. Leguminous
      plants form specialized nodules in their root tissues in order to
      accomodate the growth and proper environment for the nitrogen-fixing
      <i>Rhizobium</i>
      . Some nonleguminous plants (alder, sea buckthorn) also form symbiotic
      relationships with nitrogen fixers. The blue-green algae and bacteria like
      <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>
      are also nitrogen fixers, but free-living. The nitrogen fixed by these
      bacteria is then used by the higher plant for its growth (e.g., amino acid
      biosynthesis leading to protein synthesis); in return, the plant allows
      for the growth of the bacteria as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The genes which control nitrogen fixation (
      <i>nif</i>
      ) have been studied, and the expression of the genes is under careful
      regulation. Plants not having sources of fixed nitrogen typically obtain
      inorganic nitrogen (NO
      <sub>3</sub>
      <sup>-</sup>
      ) from the soil and then use enzymes to reduce this oxidized form of
      nitrogen to NH
      <sub>4</sub>
      <sup>+</sup>
      , the customary biologically useful form.
    </p>
    <h2>Nitrogen Fixation</h2>

    <h3>
      Formation of NH
      <sub>3</sub>
    </h3>
    <p>
      EM pictures of soybean nodules show a system of double membrane
      structures, originating from the host cell wall and enveloping a group of
      <i>bacteroids</i>
      (nodule bacteria). Extraction of these nodules under argon (and
      oxygen-free environment) shows active nitrogen fixation is possible.
      (Polyvinyl pyrrolidine is present to inhibit oxidase producing N
      <sub>2</sub>
      -fixing-inhibitory phenolics.) Also necessary to see the reaction is ATP,
      a divalent metal cation, and reduced ferredoxin. The entire complex is
      known as
      <i>nitrogenase</i>
      , having two components. Protein 1 is a molybdoferredoxin which is a
      heterotetramer of two 51 and two 60&nbsp;kDa subunits; the entire protein
      has two Mo atoms, ~24 Fe and 24&nbsp;S atoms (the&nbsp;S atoms are acid
      labile), and 30 thiol groups. It is believed that three 4Fe-4S clusters
      are present. Protein 2 is a very O
      <sub>2</sub>
      -sensitive FeS protein which is a homodimer with a 30&nbsp;kDa subunit; a
      total of 4 Fe atoms, 4&nbsp;S atoms and 12 thiols is present. The active
      nitrogenase has two Protein 2 dimers and one Protein 1 tetramer. The
      hypothetical structure of the N
      <sub>2</sub>
      -fixing system is shown in the diagram below.

    <p>
      The reduction of N
      <sub>2</sub>
      to two NH
      <sub>3</sub>
      molecules requires three 2-electron transfers for a total of six
      electrons: N
      <sub>2</sub>
      HN=NH H
      <sub>2</sub>
      N-NH
      <sub>2</sub>
      2 NH
      <sub>3</sub>
      . The intermediates diimide and hydrazine have been identified. The point
      at which ATP is required is the reduction of components of Protein 1 by
      Protein 2. This was shown by EPR in which the signal of Protein 2 changed
      with addition of MgATP while the Protein 1 signal was not altered. Protein
      2 also binds tightly to ATP, altering its E
      <sub>0</sub>
      ′ from −0.29 V to −0.40 V, making it a stronger reductant. The need for
      between 2-5 ATP per electron pair is not well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nitrogenase can also reduce protons to form H
      <sub>2</sub>
      , and 4 ATP (for each pair of electrons) has been shown necessary. It is
      not well known how the N
      <sub>2</sub>
      molecule itself binds to the protein. Recent work suggests a ferromolybdo
      complex in which sulfur is also present, the Fe:Mo:S ratio being 8:1:6.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leguminous plants appear to code for an O
      <sub>2</sub>
      -binding protein in their genome which is called
      <i>leghemoglobin</i>
      . It is present among the bacteroids and thought to keep O
      <sub>2</sub>
      tension low around the nitrogenase plant without affecting the respiration
      of the bacteria.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Conversion of Nitrate into NH
      <sub>3</sub>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nitrate is the preferred source of exogenous inorganic nitrogen for most
      plants, present largely because of nitrifying bacteria in the soil using
      NH
      <sub>4</sub>
      <sup>+</sup>
      present in the soil for their metabolic needs. Farmers who may fertilize
      their soils with ammonium compounds may not necessarily be providing their
      crop plants directly the reduced nitrogen required for growth. Rather the
      reduced nitrogen may be obtained indirectly as nitrifying bacteria
      proliferate and provide nitrate to the plant instead. The plant has
      naturally evolved a better system for absorbing nitrate than ammonium
      since in the evolution of plants, it was not anticipated that there would
      be farmers artificially creating ammonium-rich environments.

      The presence of soil nitrate induces genetic expression of a permease
      responsible for nitrate uptake. Nitrate absorbed is divided into a pool
      for storage and one for enzyme induction. Nitrate is reduced in two steps:
      first to nitrite by
      <i>nitrate reductase</i>
      , then nitrite is reduced to ammonia by
      <i>nitrite reductase</i>
      .

      This enzyme has been characterized in both higher plants and bacteria
      where it is present. The plant enzyme is a soluble molybdoflavoprotein

      , part of the nitrate reductase. The actual nitrate reductase is a
      molybdenum-binding protein with a 10-20&nbsp;kDa weight; the molybdenum
      exists as its oxide (MoO
      <sub>4</sub>
      <sup>2−</sup>
      ). The reductase is not constitutively present, but induced with nitrate
      presence. The enzyme is cytosolic and may be bound to the chloroplast
      outer envelope. The protein has a very short lifetime (half-times reported
      to be between 1-24 hr).

      Nitrate reductase in blue-green algae does not accept electrons from

      The spinach enzyme has a MW between 61-70&nbsp;kDa and probably exists as
      two subunits on the exterior surface of the thylakoid membrane in green
      tissues. This is because the immediate source of electrons appears to be
      ferredoxin; it cannot couple with other two-electron carriers.

    <h1>Chapter 11 Terpenes and Terpenoids</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The term
      <i>terpene</i>
      is used to denote compounds containing an integral number of 5 C whether
      they contain oxygen or not.
      <i>Terpenoids</i>
      are compounds in which this integral number varies but the origin is from
      a constructed terpene. These compounds, like alkaloids and phenolics, are
      not just secondary plant products, the result of an unnecessary
      metabolism, as some vital hormones are terpenes.
    </p>
    <h2>Nature and Distribution</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      All terpenes derived from a branched 5C skeleton:
      <b>isoprene</b>
      , or 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene. Some of examples representing their classes
      illustrated below are important biosynthetic intermediates. A shorthand in
      representing these terpenes is the use of the
      <i>ip</i>
      (for isoprenoid) in which
      <i>ip</i>
      or
      <i>pi</i>
      can represent a head-to-tail or tail-to-head construction, resp. Thus
      farnesol is
      <i>ip ip ip</i>
      to indicate is three head-to-tail joinings. Squalene is
      <i>ip ip ip pi pi pi</i>
      which shows that it is essentially compose of two farnesyl groups which
      are joined at one point tail-to-tail.

    <h3>Hemiterpenes</h3>
    <p>
      The only free hemiterpene widespread is isoprene and it generally is found
      in very small amounts (so small that the recent development of highly
      sophisticated mass spectrometry was necessary to detect it). Dimethylallyl
      pyrophosphate (Δ
      <sup>2</sup>
      -isopentenyl pyrophosphate) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (Δ
      <sup>3</sup>
      -isopentenyl pyrophosphate) are the biosynthetic intermediates and exist
      in only trace amounts. Mixed terpenoids are hemiterpenes combined with
      non-terpenoids (purines + hemiterpenes to make cytokinins) and do occur.
    </p>
    <h3>Monoterpenes</h3>
    <p>
      Monoterpenes come in (i) acyclic, (ii) cyclohexanoid which are mono-, bi-,
      and tricyclic, and (iii) cyclopentanoid. Examples are myrcene, limonene,
      and loganin with structures shown in the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monoterpenes are quite widespread and are components of plant secretory
      glands containing the
      <b><i>essential oils</i></b>
      which can be yield by steam distillation of plant material. The families
      Labiatae, Pinacese, and Umbelliferae account for most of the volatile
      monoterpenes. Monoterpene glycosides are nonvolatile and widespread.
    </p>
    <h3>Sesquiterpenes</h3>
    <p>
      The largest group of terpenes in both number (several thousand) and
      variations in carbon skeletal structure and innovation (200 different
      backbones). They coexist with monoterpenes in the essential oils. The
      orders Magnoliales, Rutales, Cornales, and Asterales produce the widest
      number and variations. The Ranunculales produce none, although they must
      produce farnesyl pyrophosphate to make sterols (they apparently have no
      channel to sesquiterpene).
    </p>
    <h3>Diterpenes</h3>
    <p>
      Over 500 known. The kaurane and
      <i>ent</i>
      -kaurane groups are tetracyclic groups with the same basic structure but
      different configurations. The latter group derives into steviol and the
      gibberellins.
    </p>
    <h3>Sesterterpenes</h3>
    <p>
      The best known sesterterpenes are the ophiobolane family produced only by
      fungi, but five other groups are known. It was once thought that terpenes
      greater that diterpenes must form as head to tail dimers such as sterols
      (ip ip ip pi pi pi) and carotenoids (ip ip ip ip pi pi pi pi), with 25C
      sesterterpenes not possible.

    <h2>Biosynthesis</h2>

    <h3>Basic Reactions</h3>
    <p>
      In 1887 Wallach proposed the
      <q>isoprene rule,</q>
      which stated that naturally occurring substances are built of the carbon
      chains of isoprene molecules. Ruzicka showed then proposed that a form of
      isoprene (
      <q>active isoprene</q>
      ) must be formed biologically to construct these larger molecules, and
      Lynen eventually identified this active isoprene as D
      <sup>3</sup>
      -isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). Folkers (1956) later identified the
      precursor of IPP to be the 6-carbon (3
      <i>R</i>
      )-mevalonic acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The synthesis of IPP from acetyl-CoA is shown in the diagram below. Note
      in a separate diagram the structure of mevalonic acid; hydrogen atom
      actually removed from mevalonate to form IPP is the pro-R hydrogen. The
      names of the enzymes thought to catalyze the reactions are also given.

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      IPP is the active isoprene precursor used as the basis of building all
      terpenes. Necessary to preparing for the synthesis of terpenes is the
      conversion of IPP to
      <b>d</b>
      i
      <b>m</b>
      ethyl
      <b>a</b>
      llyl
      <b>p</b>
      yro
      <b>p</b>
      hosphate (DMAPP). (Note DMAPP is also called Δ
      <sup>2</sup>
      -isopentenyl pyrophosphate.) This conversion is enabled by an enzyme,
      <i>IPP isomerase</i>
      , which appears to have a sulfhydryl residue at its active site (i.e., a
      Cys-SH). Either DMAPP or IPP can serve to form the hemiterpenes, but there
      have been really no hemiterpenes found in abundance in nature other than
      IPP (see the section below on hemiterpenes).
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <img
        src="./imagesPlantBiochemistryHTML/IPPElimination.gif"
        alt="DMAPP synthesis"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      DMAPP actually serves as the starting molecule for the synthesis of the
      multiple isoprenoid units forming monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes,
      diterpenes, etc. Under the control of
      <i>isoprenyltransferase</i>
      , DMAPP condenses with IPP to form the C
      <sub>10</sub>
      geranyl pyrophosphate. The proposed mechanism of enzyme action is
      illustrated below.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <img
        src="./imagesPlantBiochemistryHTML/DMAPPCondensation.gif"
        alt="DMAPP condesation and elimination to make IPP"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanism of isoprenyltransferase action shows first a metal-dependent
      (either Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      or Mn
      <sup>2+</sup>
      seems suitable) ionization of the allyl pyrophosphate, which intially
      starts with DMAPP, but can also be any allyl pyrophosphate, such as
      geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) or farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). In the
      ionization step, pyrophosphate is the biological equivalent of a good
      leaving group (a concept in organic chemistry), and so the ionization is
      facilitated. Two metal ions are required for this first step: as the OPP
      <sub>i</sub>
      has considerable negative charge density under physiological conditions,
      the neutralization of that charge density allows the incipient formation
      of a (positively charged) carbonium ion, which might not otherwise form if
      leaving of the pyrophosphate was restrained by electrostatic forces.
      Following formation of the carbonium ion, a condensation step involving a
      waiting IPP should quickly ensue; presumably the IPP is already in place,
      perhaps to facilitate electrophilic attack to encourage the formation of a
      carbonium intermediate during the ionization step. The positive charge
      following condensation has now been transferred to carbon 3 of IPP whereas
      it was delocalized on the DMAPP molecule before. Note at this stage the
      configuration of the carbons which were joined between IPP and DMAPP. The
      final step to complete the formation of the C
      <sub>10</sub>
      GPP must be the elimination of a proton. In this case, labeling studies
      show a stereospecific elimination of the pro-
      <i>R</i>
      hydrogen on C2 of the IPP molecule, resulting in formation of the double
      bond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note the formation of a C2-C3 double bond would be essential to formation
      of an allyl pyrophosphate that could undergo another cycle of isoprenyl
      polymerization by reaction with IPP. This is how the terpene carbon
      skeletons are added by five carbons. Another cycle of IPP addition to GPP
      would form the C
      <sub>15</sub>
      farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is the precursor to sesquiterpenes.
      And addition of IPP to FPP would result in formation of the C
      <sub>20</sub>
      geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Elongation of GGPP with IPP once
      again forms the C
      <sub>25</sub>
      geranylfarnesyl pyrophosphate (GFPP), which will form the sesterterpenes.
      Continued cycles of isoprenylation can form polyterpenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other terpene classes discussed are generally formed by the
      tail-to-tail dimerization of one of the terpenes above. Tail-to-tail
      joining of GPP forms the C
      <sub>20</sub>
      diterpenes, of FPP the C
      <sub>30</sub>
      triterpenes, and of GFPP the C
      <sub>40</sub>
      tetraterpenes. The chemical mechanism is very complex and is illustrated
      below. (The mechanism is not required for examination purposes; see me
      later for an update of this file showing the mechanism.)

    <h1>Chapter 13 The Alkaloids</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Secondary plant products representing an important number of
      pharmacologically active products. Example are cinchona alkaloids found in
      the bark of Cinchona spp. and Remijia spp. indigenous to the high eastern
      Andean slopes; they contain quinine, known to be antimalarial since 1639.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally alkaloids contain nitrogen. The
      <b>true alkaloids</b>
      are said to be those with heterocyclic rings while those without are
      called
      <b>protoalkaloids</b>
      . Their precursors are almost always amino acids, with carbon building
      generally coming from acetate. Alkaloids not derived from amino acids are
      called
      <b>pseudoalkaloids</b>
      , usually being derived from isoprenoid skeletons.
    </p>
    <h2>Distribution and Localization of True and Protoalkaloids</h2>
    <p>Alkaloids are found as follows in the plant kingdom:</p>

      Alkaloids accumulate in four types of tissue: (1) actively growing tissue;
      (2) epidermal and hypodermal cells; (3) vascular sheaths; (4) latex
      vessels. Usually found in vacuoles and are not present in young cells
      until they form vacuoles. Very rarely occur in dead tissue. In Cinchona
      <q>bark</q>
      , they are not present in the cork but rather the parenchymal cells. Site
      of storage often differs from site of synthesis; a good example is
      nicotine, which is made in the roots but stored in the leaves.

    <h2>Biosynthesis of True and Protoalkaloids</h2>

    <h3>General Aspects</h3>
    <p>
      Labeling experiments with radioactive precursors used a great deal in
      verifying hypothetical schemes developed by organic chemists. Although
      enzymes have not fully been purified, the products are there. Labeling of
      tissues is done in several ways: (i) precursor is assimilable and placed
      in the hydroponic support medium; (ii) compound is injected in an aqueous
      milieu into plant cavities; (iii) a drop is placed on a leaf surface which
      is punctured gently several times at the point; (iv) it is
      <q>painted</q>
      on the leaf surface with a suitable solvent, then sometimes covered with
      silicone oil after solvent evaporation; (v) administered by
      <q>wick feeding,</q>
      in which strands of mercerized cotton are threaded through the plant so
      that both ends emerge close together and can be dipped into a small
      solution containing labeled compound; (vi) it is administered by
      <q>vacuum filtration,</q>
      in which the plant is exposed to a vacuum which
      <q>de-gasses</q>
      it, placed in a solution, then the vacuum slowly released such that the
      plant absorbs the solution.

      Three important reactions in alkaloid biosynthesis are detailed below.
    </p>
    <h4>Oxidative Coupling of Phenols</h4>
    <p>
      The figure below shows how iron is used in a one-electron transfer
      oxidation (FeCl
      <sub>3</sub>
      , alkaline K
      <sub>3</sub>
      Fe[CN]
      <sub>6</sub>
      can be used) to initiate formation of a very reactive mesomeric phenolate
      free radical. Polymerization can then occur, with intermolecular coupling
      potentially occurring at
      <i>ortho-ortho</i>
      ,
      <i>ortho-para</i>
      , and
      <i>para-para</i>
      position thanks to resonance.

    <h4>The Mannich Reaction</h4>
    <p>
      In this reaction a carbonyl is joined to an amine and a carbanion. The
      reaction mechanism is illustrated below. Either a 1° or 2° amine reacts in
      a nucleophilic addition with an aldehyde to ultimately form an enamine
      which itself undergoes nucleophilic addition to form a larger amine. The R
      group shown is usually a -SCoA residue

    <p>
      Nearly all derive from a common biosynthetic metabolite, either
      phenylalanine or its precursor shikimic acid
    </p>

    <h2>Phenols</h2>

    <h3>Nature and Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      Simple phenols like catechol not widely distributed. Most common are
      hydroquinone. Urushiol (14.1) is catechol with a C
      <sub>15</sub>
      side chain and is the toxic chemical in poison ivy (
      <i>Toxicodendron radicans</i>
      ). Δ
      <sup>1</sup>
      -tetrahydrocannabinol (14.2) is a resorcinol which is the hallucinogen in
      <i>Cannabis sativa</i>
      .

        alt="structures of phenols"
      />
    </p>
    <h3>Biosynthesis</h3>
    <p>
      Labeling studies show that phenols arise from phenylalanine via p-coumaric
      acid (see earlier chap 4 on synthesis of
      <i>trans-p</i>
      -coumaric acid). These are converted to benzoic acid which is then
      oxidatively decarboxylated to a phenol
    </p>
    <h2>Phenolic Acids</h2>

    <h3>Nature and Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      Found throughout the plant kingdom. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic
      acid (14.3), vanillic acid (14.4), and syringic acid are found in all
      angiosperms examined so far. Gallic acid (14.5) is present in polymerized
      forms as soluble tannins. Also found are corresponding aldehydes and
      alcohols including vanillin (Vanilla pod, 14.6) and salicyl alcohol (in
      willow, 14.7). In addition, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups may be methylated
      as in the acetophenone 3-acetyl-6-methoxybenzaldehyde (in
      <i>Encelia farinosa</i>
      , 14.9).

      The general scheme is harness the light energy from the sun and convert
      its energy into molecular form used by living organisms. The
      photosynthetic organisms use these molecules to drive reactions related to
      their living. Nonphotosynthetic organisms are completely dependent upon
      them for this energy.

            of the alga near its single large chloroplast when the cell is
            illuminated.

    <h2>Biological occurrence of photosynthesis</h2>
    <p>
      Among the eukaryotic organisms carrying out photosythesis are the higher
      green plants and the unicellular or colonial green, brown, and red algae,
      in addition to euglenoids, dinoflagellates, and diatoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the prokaryotic forms are the blue-green algae, the green sulfur
      bacteria, and the purple (both sulfur and nonsulfur) bacteria. The
      blue-greens (Cyanobacter) may be the most closely related to the first
      ancestral photosynthetic form, may in fact not be different from the
      ancestral form. CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is their sole carbon source and they show the ability to fix N
      <sub>2</sub>
      . The green sulfur bacteria are obligate anaerobes living in ponds and
      lakes with rich sulfur-containing organic matter. Indeed the green sulfur
      bacterium
      <i>Chlorobium</i>
      accounts for the green color of some mountain lakes. The purple sulfur
      bacteria (
      <i>Chromatium</i>
      ) are also obligate anaerobes living on H
      <sub>2</sub>
      S, sulfur, or thiosulfate, and are found in ponds or sulfur springs. The
      purple nonsulfur bacteria, which include
      <i>Rhodospirillum rubrum</i>
      can live on a variety of carbon sources such as ethanol, acetate,
      β-hydroxybutyrate, or isopropanol.
    </p>
    <h2>Photosynthetic system organization</h2>
    <p>
      In eukaryotes, a special organelle, the
      <b><i>chloroplast</i></b>
      , is responsible for the photosynthetic activities of these organisms.
      Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have DNA which they are able to transcribe
      (it has its own RNA polymerases) and translate (it has its own ribosomes)
      and the organelle is self-replicating. Chloroplasts are generally larger
      than mitochondria, ranging in size from 1-10&nbsp;µm in diameter. The
      number of chloroplasts varies:in unicellular algae, there is usually only
      one per cell, but in higher plants, there are as many as 40.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spinach leaf chloroplast has been the most studied. It is prepared by
      gentle homogenization of leaves in a blender in an isotonic medium of 0.35
      M NaCl or 0.3 to 0.4 M sucrose at pH 8.0. After filtering the suspension
      through cheesecloth, the organelles are sedimented for a few minutes at
      1000 g. Preparation usually involves repeated washing (resuspension
      followed by centrifugation) to get chloroplasts of suitable quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chloroplasts are surrounded by an outer envelope which is somewhat
      fragile. An inner membrane, continuous but often having paired folds
      arranged as
      <i>lamellae</i>
      encloses the
      <b><i>stroma</i></b>
      , similar to the mitochondrial matrix. The lamellae of the inner membrane
      flatten to form membrane-bounded sacs or vesicles called
      <b><i>thylakoids</i></b>
      (Gr.,
      <q>baggy trousers</q>
      ). These can be arranged in stacks called
      <b><i>grana</i></b>
      . The membranes of the thylakoids and the intergranal lamellae contain the
      photosynthetic pigments and proteins responsible for the transduction of
      light energy into the chemical energy ultimately stored into sugars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photosynthetic bacteria and blue-green algae lack chloroplasts, but their
      photosynthetic systems are embedded into their cell membranes or into
      vesicular structures called
      <i>chromatophores</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      All photosynthetic organisms except bacteria utilize H
      <sub>2</sub>
      O as an electron or hydrogen donor to reduce various acceptors. As a
      result, oxygen (O
      <sub>2</sub>
      ) is evolved from the process:

      Carbohydrate is the product. As for other organisms which do not use water
      as donor because they are strict anaerobes and the production of oxygen
      would kill them, there are alternative donor molecules. The green and
      purple sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide:

      Van Niel, who saw the reaction as:

      From this Van Niel could predict before it was established as true that
      molecular oxygen in plants was derived from water and not CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      . He also showed that electrons actually are taken from two water
      molecules in plants to produce the one unit of carbohydrate product or one
      molecule of O
      <sub>2</sub>
      , which is also true.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is seen that CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      is the acceptor if not the donor here. Actually, it is the
      <i>major</i>
      acceptor, meaning it is not the only acceptor. All photosynthetic
      autotrophs must produce the carbohydrate which they may use for energy and
      in many cases, structural building. There are other acceptors however.
      Reduced nitrogen is necessary for incorporation into forms of reduced
      carbon to produce amino acids, and the form available in the soil
      environment is usually nitrate. The list below shows some of the electron
      donors and acceptors.

      In plants, the final product of the light reactions is actually NADPH and
      ATP, which are used to carry the reducing power and other energy into
      these reactions, so it is not proper to see photosynthesis as strictly a
      production of carbohydrate.
    </p>
    <h2>The Light and Dark Reactions</h2>
    <p>
      A difference between the light and dark reactions was suggested by an
      experimental finding. Photosynthetic organims subjected to intermittment
      flashes of light of millisecond or less duration and followed with
      intervals of varying darkness indicate that maximal O
      <sub>2</sub>
      evolution occurs if a light flash of 10 μs pulse is followed by a longer
      dark period (60 ms or more, or at least 6000 times longer). This varying
      period depends greatly on the temperature, with lower temperatures
      requiring longer periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      D. I. Arnon and coworkers (1958) demonstrated these dark and light
      reactions as separate independent occurrences by flashing chloroplasts in
      the absence of CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      , disrupting the organelles to remove the grana, then added labeled CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      to the stroma. This showed a division within the chloroplast structure,
      the presence of the light and dark reactions, and that the chloroplasts
      were the organelles capable of the entire process of light conversion to
      hexose formation.
    </p>
    <h2>Molecular Excitation by Light</h2>
    <p>
      Light is said to be transmitted in
      <i>photons</i>
      or
      <i>quanta</i>
      . About 12% of the solar energy reaching the earth surface (est. 2 × 10
      <sup>25</sup>
      cal/year) is available to plants, with the balance outside the spectral
      range of plants, absorbed by the atmosphere or by the nonbiosphere.The
      equation of Planck shows the relationship between energy and the
      wavelength of light. One Einstein of photons (1 mol) is the visible light
      spectrum can range between 40 and 72 kcal of energy, with the violet
      wavelengths producing the higher energy. This energy is considerably
      greater than the energy needed to produce a mole of ATP from ADP, which
      require 7.3 kcal under standard conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molecules can absorb photons, and consequently their energy, but molecules
      cannot just absorb any photon that passes by. The arrangement of electrons
      around the atomic nuclei dictates the fundamental radiative frequencies
      which can be absorbed. Hence a molecule is an
      <q>antenna</q>
      for a particular electromagnetic (light) frequency. The concept of
      resonance is appropriately understood here, since the fundamental
      frequency or frequencies absorbed by molecules will be the frequencies at
      which the molecule resonates. Electrons within these molecules absorbing
      the light which is particular to them are boosted to higher energy states
      or
      <i>excited</i>
      <i>states</i>
      . This molecular excitation occurs on the order of less than a femtosecond
      (10
      <sup>−15</sup>
      s). The energy can be dissipated rapidly as a re-emission of light or in
      altering the various vibrational modes of the molecule (vibrational,
      rotational, translational entropy) and the molecule returns to the
      <i>ground state</i>
      . Any light emission is likely to occur at a longer wavelength (lower
      energy photon) since some energy invariably is distributed to other
      changes in molecular entropy; this light emission is observed as
      <i>fluorescence</i>
      which, if it occurs, is complete by 10 ns. Alternatively, the excited
      molecule may react with another, in the process losing the high energy
      electron in what is a photochemical reaction.
    </p>
    <h2>Photosynthetic Pigments</h2>
    <p>
      All cells capable of photosynthesis contain light-absorbing pigment
      molecules called
      <i>chlorophylls</i>
      , of which most are green, imparting the color to the organism. Not all
      pigments are chlorophylls and are green. Algae and bacteria come in a
      variety of colors usually because other
      <i>accessory</i>
      or
      <i>antenna</i>
      <i>pigments</i>
      are present, such as yellow, red, or purple
      <i>carotenoids</i>
      and the blue or red
      <i>phycobilins</i>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      The chlorophylls are extractable from leaves with alcohol or acetone and
      can be resolved chromatographically. The word chromatography itself was
      first used by the Russian botanist Tswett to describe their separation on
      inert adsorbents. The higher plants contain two forms of chlorophyll, a
      and b. The structure of chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      was shown in 1940 by H. Fischer and was proved by its total synthesis in
      1960 by R. B. Woodward. Chlorophyll
      <i>b</i>
      differs from the chl
      <i>a</i>
      form by substitution of the methyl group on the B ring with a formyl (CHO)
      group. The chlorophylls are essentially magnesium-porphyrin complexes but
      the porphyrin differs from protoporphyrin in the nature and position of
      the substituents of the pyrroles and the presence of an E ring of
      cyclopentanone formed on the C ring. Also attached via the propionate
      substituent of the D ring is a phytol side chain (a saturated sesterpenoid
      alcohol). Hydrolysis of the ester by
      <i>chlorophyllase</i>
      produces
      <i>chlorophyllide</i>
      <b>a</b>
      . In acetone, pure chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      has absorption maxima in the red and blue, at 663 and 420 nm. In the cell
      however, the maxima are more abundant, at 660, 670, 678, and 685&nbsp;nm
      in the red. This is because the absorption properties are altered in
      chlorophyll
      <i>a</i>
      by its association with different proteins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other kinds of chlorophyll include the chlorophylls in algae, diatoms, and
      dinoflagellates (chlorophyll
      <i>c</i>
      ) and the chlorophyll in bacteria called
      <i>bacteriochlorophyll</i>
      , which also comes in an
      <i>a</i>
      and
      <i>b</i>
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other pigments are the
      <i>phycobilins</i>
      , pigments found in algae and which resemble chlorophyll molecules in that
      they are tetrapyrroles. But they are different in that they are linearized
      by oxidation and, being open, do not complex with Mg
      <sup>2+</sup>
      . Two phycobilins are
      <i>phycoerythrobilin</i>
      and
      <i>phycocyanobilin</i>
      , which associate with specific proteins and the complex is then called
      <i>phycoeythrin</i>
      and
      <i>phycocyanin</i>
      , resp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plants and other photosynthetic organisms contain a large amount of
      polyisoprenoid pigments called
      <i>carotenoids</i>
      , which include the
      <i>carotenes</i>
      (distinguished being strictly hydrocarbons having a cyclohexene ring on
      both ends of the linear molecule) and the xanthophylls (distinguished by
      the presence of oxygen in the terminal rings).
    </p>
    <p>
      Special pigments in plants are called P700 and P680, discovered by B. Kok
      using special spectroscopic methods. These pigments undergo
      <q>bleaching</q>
      (loss of color absorption) when illuminated with either 700 or 680&nbsp;nm
      light, resp. The bleaching can result when ferricyanide is added as well,
      and hence the bleaching occurs when an electron is lost. It is thought
      that P700 is chlorophyll a associated with a specific protein. P700 is
      only about 0.25% of the total chlorophyll.
    </p>
    <h2>The Hill Reaction</h2>
    <p>
      R. L. Hill first showe that light-induced oxygen evolution could be
      observed in cell-free granular preparations extracted from green leaves.
      He showed as well that photochemical reduction could occur without the
      presence of CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      and that artificial electron acceptors (reducible dyes, ferricyanide)
      could be used to drive the oxidation of water. These acceptors are called
      <i>Hill reagents</i>
      and the reaction the
      <i>Hill reaction</i>
      . It was naturally seen that fixation of carbon involves a flow of high
      energy electrons to CO
      <sub>2</sub>
      and that the path in between could be analyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1951, three different groups reported that the common metabolite NADP
      <sup>+</sup>
      could also replace or be the natural Hill reagent. It becomes reduced
      (accepts electrons) in the same manner as the artificial acceptors. Hence
      NADP
      <sup>+</sup>
      was identified as the common carrier.
    </p>
    <h2>Photophosphorylation</h2>
    <p>
      D. I. Arnon, M. B. Allen, and F. R. Whatley in 1954 showed that isolated
      spinach chloroplasts illuminated in the presence of ADP and P
      <sub>i</sub>
      resulted in the formation of ATP. Hence it was concluded that energy from
      light was conserved in the high energy phosphate bond. A. W. Frenkel
      independently discovered a phosphorylation process in photosynthetic
      bacteria as well. Hence energy coupling in chlorophyll occurs by
      conversion of energy forms to ATP in the same manner as in mitochondria.
    </p>
    <h2>Photobiology and Photosynthesis</h2>
    <p>
      If plants are illuminated with monochromatic light over the range of the
      spectrum, it is observed that O
      <sub>2</sub>
      evolution drops rapidly with light above 680 nm, a phenomenon called the
      <i>red drop</i>
      . R. Emerson demonstrated that light at 710 nm, not effective by itself,
      but supplemented with light 670 nm, greatly enhanced the photosynthetic
      efficiency. Duysens has postulated that the long wavelength system with a
      maximum of 710&nbsp;nm is
      <i>photosystem I</i>
      and is not responsible for oxygen evolution.
      <i>Photosystem II</i>
      is the other photosystem activated by wavelengths at about 670&nbsp;nm and
      below, and is responsible for oxygen evolution. The photosynthetic
      bacteria which do not evolve oxygen contain only one photosystem which
      closely resembles the photosystem I of the oxygen-producing organisms. It
      is for this reason that the bacterial photosystem and plant photosystem I
      arose first and later photosystem II evolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      What about the differences between PS I and PS II? PS I appears to have a
      higher ratio of chl
      <i>a</i>
      to
      <i>b</i>
      than does PS II. In PS I there is a large presence of chl
      <i>a</i>
      -protein complexes absorbing at long-wavelengths absent in PS II. The
      photosystems are physically distinct as well, since detergent-containing
      centrifugal gradients can separate them.
