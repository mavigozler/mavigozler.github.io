# Using Canvas Rubric Feature

Here is a general guideline on how to use the Rubric feature in Canvas based on your provided point values.

## 1. Create a Rubric in Canvas

You can create a rubric directly within an assignment or from the "Rubrics" link in your course navigation.

* **Go to the Assignment:** Navigate to the specific lab report assignment.
* **Add a Rubric:** At the bottom of the assignment page, click the **"+ Add Rubric"** button.
* **Name the Rubric:** Give it a clear, descriptive name like "Lab Report 1: Empirical Formula of Magnesium Oxide." This helps you find it later if you want to use it for other sections or classes.
* **Check "Use this rubric for assignment grading":** This is a critical step. When this box is checked, the point values you assign in the rubric will automatically be calculated and entered into the gradebook for the assignment.

## 2. Define Your Rubric Criteria

Your detailed list of items will become the "Criteria" in the Canvas rubric. Each criterion has a description and a point value. You can add as many criteria as you need.

* **Group Items into Criteria:** Instead of creating a separate criterion for every single point (e.g., "mass of empty crucible: 1 pt"), it's more efficient to group related items into a single criterion. This makes the rubric cleaner and easier for both you and the students to read.
* **Example Criteria Breakdown based on your list:**

* **Criterion 1: Lab Partner Name:** This can be a simple 3-point item.
* **Criterion 2: DATA Section:** This is a perfect candidate for a single criterion with a total of 4 points. The description can list the four items you provided (mass of empty crucible, etc.) and specify that each is worth 1 point for correct recording.
* **Criterion 3: RESULTS Section - Calculated Masses:** You can make this one criterion with a total of 6 points (2 points each for a, b, and c). The description can clearly state the breakdown of points (1 pt for calculation, 1 pt for precision).
* **Criterion 4: RESULTS Section - Empirical Formula:** Another great group for a single criterion. Total points would be 10 (2 points each for d, e, f, and g). The description can list each of these.
* **Criterion 5: RESULTS Section - Percent Composition:** Another group of 4 points.
* **Criterion 6: POST-LAB QUESTIONS:** You can break this into a single criterion for the entire section or multiple smaller criteria. A single criterion might work best for this, with a total of 15 points (3 for "a", 2 for "b", 2 for "c", 2 for "d", 2 for "e", 2 for "f", 2 for "g").

## 3. Set Up Point Values and Ratings

For each criterion you create, you will set a point value.

* **Use the `Points` field:** For each criterion you create, enter the total point value for that criterion. For example, for "Lab Partner Name," you would enter "3" in the points field.
* **Simple Scoring:** For your purpose, a simple "full points" or "zero points" rubric might work best, as you're deducting points for errors. You can do this by setting up just two "ratings" for each criterion: one for the full point value (e.g., "Full Credit") and one for 0 points (e.g., "Incomplete" or "Incorrect"). This gives you a quick "click-to-grade" option.

* Alternatively, you can create a points-based rubric without specific rating labels. When you're in SpeedGrader, you can simply click on the "points" box for each criterion and manually enter the number of points the student earned (e.g., they got 2 out of 3 points for the Lab Partner name because they missed the first initial or something). This is more flexible.

## 4. Important Considerations for Your Point Valuation

You asked for a review of your point valuation. Here are a couple of things to consider:

* **Total Point Count:** Let's tally your points.
* Lab Partner: 3 pts
* DATA: 4 pts (4 items x 1 pt)
* RESULTS - Calculated Masses: 6 pts (3 items x 2 pts)
* RESULTS - Empirical Formula: 10 pts (5 items x 2 pts)
* RESULTS - Percent Composition: 4 pts (2 items x 2 pts)
* POST-LAB QUESTIONS: 15 pts (3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15)
* **Total Points: 3 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 4 + 15 = 42 points.**

Adjusting this to a nice round number divisible by 10 (like 40 or 50) is a good idea. You could either remove a couple of less critical points or add a few more for something like "Overall Clarity/Organization" or "Significant Figures throughout the Report." You could also add 8 points to get to a total of 50.

* **Point Distribution and Importance:** Your current breakdown seems logical, giving more weight to the calculations and analysis (RESULTS and POST-LAB) than to the simple data recording. This is a sound pedagogical approach.

## 5. Using the Rubric to Grade

Once the rubric is attached to the assignment, you will grade the submissions using **SpeedGrader**.

* When you open a student's submission, the rubric will appear on the right side of the screen.
* You simply click on the point value for each criterion, and Canvas will automatically calculate the total score and enter it into the gradebook.
* You can also add comments for each criterion to provide specific feedback.

This method will save you a huge amount of time compared to manually calculating points and typing out feedback for each student. It also ensures consistent grading across all students.
