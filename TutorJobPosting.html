Please email to inquire about your particular subject(s) of study and I will inform you as to whether I
am competent to provide instructional assistance to you or the tutored student.
<p>
The fees depend on the level of the subject.  See the table below for the fees.  This is either at my home
or place of business.  If you require/prefer that I travel to a location, an additional I charge an
additional 36 cents/mile from either my work or home location, whichever is closest to your location.

<caption style="margin:0;color:yellow;background-color:black;">Individual (One-On-One) Tutoring</caption>
<tr><th style="background-color:#fff;text-align:left;">University level subjects
  <td style="background-color:#fff;">$33 per hour
<tr><th style="background-color:#fff;text-align:left;">Primary and Secondary School level subjects
  <td style="background-color:#fff;">$24 per hour
<tr><td colspan="2" style="background-color:#fff;font-size:85%;">Location of tutoring is at either in Davis at my work site or in Woodland at my home:  if student prefers another site, then an additional
one-way 36 cents/mile is applied for each session.
<tr><td colspan="2" style="background-color:#fff;font-size:85%;color:green;">For groups of students:  I apply
	a 25% discount rate to the hourly rate for each additional student rounded down to the nearest dollar down to a minimum
	of $8/hr per student.  Thus, if the individual rate is $24/hr:
  <ul>
<li><b>Two students</b>:  $18/hr per student
<li><b>Three students</b>:  $13/hr per student (from $18 &minus; 25% of $18 = $13.50 rounded down)
<li><b>Four students</b>:  $10/hr per student (from $13.50 &minus; 25% of $13.50 = $10.13 rounded down)
<li><b>Five or more students</b>:  $8/hr
</ul>
To maintain tutoring quality, group sizes shall not be greater than eight (8) students&mdash;I do not want
to open a school

</table>

<p>
In order to keep your costs down, I will ask the student what specific subject he/she is studying in order
to prepare mini-lectures (often as a PowerPoint presentation) should they be necessary, and which can be
given to the student as a study aid.

<p>
<b>Who Am I?</b>  Your tutor has a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology &amp; Biochemistry and works actively in a
laboratory doing proteomics work.  He recently returned to the United States after several years abroad.
I have also actually been paid for my skills and knowledge as a computer programmer,
using C to write code for Unix systems (with limited Windows programming capability).
