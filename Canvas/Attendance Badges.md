# Attendance Badges

That's a great choice. Using a custom badge in combination with the "Unmarked" status is the most effective way to track excused vs. unexcused absences without impacting the student's attendance grade.

Here are the step-by-step instructions for creating a custom badge in the Canvas Roll Call Attendance tool:

## 🌟 How to Create an "Excused Absence" Badge

1. **Open the Attendance Tool:**
    * Navigate to your Canvas course.
    * Click the **Attendance** link in the Course Navigation Menu.

2. **Access Badge Creation:**
    * Ensure you are in the **List View**.
    * Locate the name of **any student** in your roster.
    * Click the **More** link next to their name. A small pop-up window will appear.
    * In the pop-up window, click the **+ Add Badge** button.

3. **Define Your Badge:**
    * A dialog box will appear where you can customize the badge.
    * **Title:** Type a clear title, such as **"Excused Absence"** or **"Communicated Absence"**.
    * **Icon:** Choose an icon that makes sense to you (e.g., a checkmark, a star, or a phone icon to signify communication).
    * **Color:** Select a color to easily distinguish it from the default attendance marks (e.g., a neutral blue or yellow).
    * Click **Save Badge**.

## ✅ How to Use the Badge to Track Excused Absences

Now that the badge is created, here is how you use the two different systems to distinguish between the students:

| Student Status | Roll Call Mark | Badge Applied | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Excused/Communicated** | **Unmarked ($\oslash$)** | **"Excused Absence"** | The **Unmarked** status prevents the absence from counting against their grade, and the **Badge** is your private record of communication. |
| **Unexcused/No Effort** | **Absent (Red X)** | **None** | The **Absent** status correctly deducts points (or 0%) for a missed, uncommunicated day. |

## To Apply the "Excused/Communicated" Status

1. In the Roll Call Attendance tool for the specific date, click on the student's attendance status until the **gray $\oslash$ (Unmarked)** icon appears.
2. Click the **More** link next to their name again.
3. Click on your new **"Excused Absence"** badge to apply it. The badge icon will now appear next to the student's name for that date.

> **Important Note:** Badges are for your **internal record-keeping only**. Students **cannot see the badges**, and they **do not appear on the standard attendance report** that you can export from Canvas. You must view them directly in the attendance tool.

**Next Step for You:** Is there anything else about the attendance tool—like adjusting the default late percentage or running reports—that you would like to clarify?
